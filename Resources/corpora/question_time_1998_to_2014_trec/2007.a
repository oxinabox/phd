 - I do not carry in my head the details of every submission that has gone to cabinet. Let me simply say that our position in relation to an emissions-trading system is that we have, at present, at work a joint task group between the government and the business community. Tomorrow that task group will be releasing a discussion paper which deals with these matters.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Stirling for his question, which goes to the heart of economic achievement and prosperity in this country. There is no better mark of good economic policy than the success that a nation has in providing jobs for those people who want them. According to that measure, this country is doing better than it has done at any time during the last 30 years.I am proud to say that since the end of March last year, when the new Work Choices legislation came into being, 245,000 new jobs have been created. Real wages are now 17.9 per cent higher than they were in 1996 and the latest ABS industrial dispute figures show the lowest figure ever recorded, at 3.2 days lost per thousand employees. It is worth contextualising those three things. We were told when the new legislation came in that it would herald an era of industrial unrest, that it would drive wages down, that there would be mass sackings. None of those things has occurred. The truth is that Work Choices has added to the prosperity and the productivity of the Australian economy.There is an alternative. The member for Stirling, concerned as he is about the interests of the people he represents, wants to know whether there is any threat to these conditions. There is a threat. The threat sits opposite. We saw an example of the Labor Party trying to be all things to all men last week. The Leader of the Opposition was out there saying to the business community, 'I'm really going to be a bit softer on Work Choices. I'm going to make it a bit more business friendly. Kim Beazley may have threatened to rip it up, but I'm sort of going to adjust it at the edges and it's going to be a bit kinder and gentler.' That is what he was saying.That lasted about 18 hours, because the next morning on the Today show the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the member for Lalor, the hard woman of the Labor Party as far as IR is concerned, said, 'No, you're not getting away with that, Mr Leader; I want the world to know that we're going to rip it up.' In that memorable phrase that she will be reminded of for quite a long time she said, 'First of all we'll tear it up and then we'll get rid of it.' In other words, Labor policy is to bring back the nightmare of unfair dismissal laws for small business. Labor policy is to reinstate union control of industrial relations. Labor policy is to put at risk the 30-year low we have in Australia's unemployment rate.Let me say to the member for Stirling: we are very proud of the fact that we have the lowest unemployment in 30 years and we are very proud of the fact that we have presided over the economic management and the policies that have delivered that remarkable outcome for all of the Australian people.</DOC>

 - It is not only remarks made by people in this parliament. There is a farmer I know who is sceptical about that connection as well! But we can debate. Let me say to the Leader of the Opposition that the jury is still out on the degree of connection. What matters is what you do about it. It is not an academic debate; it is what you do about it. This government has done more to tackle both of these problems. The Leader of the Opposition is rejoicing in the fact that he has called a summit on climate change. Can I remind you that the former minister for the environment, Senator Campbell, called about three summits on climate change. The most recent one was held back in 2003 and was attended by representatives of state governments and about 100 representatives of the business community from around Australia. So I would say to the Leader of the Opposition: if he wants to debate the connection between the two, let us by all means do so. There is obviously some connection. The degree of that is a matter of debate. What really matters is what you do about it. And the biggest response to the problem of drought in the Australian community at this time is what this government is proposing to do about the Murray-Darling Basin. - I notice the remarks made by the Premier of New South Wales. I notice the remarks made by the Premier of Victoria. I notice the variable remarks made by the Premier of Queensland - he is gradually becoming more supportive, and I welcome that, because I have always found him a man you can do business with if you get onto the right subject. I look forward to Thursday's meeting in Canberra as being a great day for water security in this country.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for La Trobe for his question. I can inform him that the NAB quarterly business survey, which was released today, shows that business conditions improved solidly in the December quarter and expectations for the March quarter rose. That comes on the back of retail trade figures, released yesterday, showing that retail trade rose 1.3 per cent in the December quarter and was 4.3 per cent higher over the year. But, importantly, the consumer price index remains very restrained. It actually fell in the last quarter by 0.1 per cent. To a degree that was abstracting from things like petrol prices and bananas. When we leave out the volatile items the underlying inflation rate was about 0.5 per cent. But 0.5 per cent is a step down from the 0.8/0.9 we were getting in the last quarter in underlying terms and it shows that inflation is moderate. In addition to that, jobs creation in the Australian economy has been very strong, with jobs being created at the rate of about 20,000 per month in the last half of last year.Notwithstanding all that, there are still challenges for the Australian economy: the challenges of drought; the challenge of adjustment in the property market; the challenge of rising energy prices; the challenge of unfunded liabilities; and, the greatest challenge of all, the ageing of the population. These challenges will require experienced economic management. I see that the opposition also believes that experienced economic management is important. Apparently in a bid to boost their credentials on experienced management, the Labor Party is actively looking at luring John Brumby, the Victorian Treasurer, to Canberra. ALP figures say that Mr Brumby would boost federal Labor's credentials. That is probably right, actually. Mr Brumby was a member of this House between 1983 and 1990. There is the prospect that Mr Brumby would go back into his seat of Bendigo. - When it was put to the member for Bendigo that Mr Brumby would not only boost Labor's economic credentials but also boost the calibre of Labor's candidate in Bendigo, the member for Bendigo said that, if he were to become Treasurer or finance minister in a Rudd government, Mr Brumby 'deserves to be welcomed into a seat where he is not having to constantly worry about constituents' problems'. That is how important Mr Gibbons, the member for Bendigo, thinks constituents' problems are. The member for Bendigo thought that Mr Brumby ought to go into the seat of Scullin and take the place of Harry Jenkins, about which Harry Jenkins had a view that he had not gone through a preselection to pass the seat of Scullin across to Mr Brumby. The one thing that neither the member for Scullin nor the member for Bendigo said was that there was no need to get a new face up here to boost Labor's economic credentials. Nobody would consider it unimportant to have a new spokesman on the economy up here. That is why the member for Lilley should be watching his back very, very carefully.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Cook for his question. I acknowledge the fact that he represents a large number of Qantas employees and has a very great interest in the aviation and the tourism markets. I can inform the House that yesterday Airline Partners Australia lodged a notification under the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act, which will now trigger the provisions of that act and allow a scrutiny of the takeover bid that it has lodged for Qantas Airways Ltd. The act allows the government to scrutinise any bid which would result in an Australian company becoming foreign owned or a foreign owned company changing the identity of the foreign owner. The act prescribes a time limit for such a decision to be made and provides the possibility, if the bid is against the national interest, for it to be disallowed if it fits either of those categories.In addition to the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act, the Qantas Sale Act, which the Labor Party put in place when it privatised Qantas, will also be strictly enforced by this government. That means that foreign ownership of Qantas is restricted to 49 per cent. At the moment, the foreign ownership in Qantas is around 46 per cent. Foreign airline ownership of Qantas cannot go above 35 per cent. Qantas will be required to keep its head office in Australia. Qantas will be required to have its principal operation centre in Australia and Australians will have to make up two-thirds of the directors of Qantas. In addition, the presiding director at Qantas board meetings must be an Australian and the incorporation of Qantas cannot move outside of Australia. I want to make it absolutely clear that all of those conditions will be enforced strictly and in full.The Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act allows screening where a foreign corporation acquires 15 per cent or more or 40 per cent in aggregate of the shares or control of an Australian corporation. I welcome the fact that Airline Partners have notified. It was always the government's view that they were obliged to and should do so. This will allow strict screening. This government will not allow majority foreign ownership of Qantas. We will insist that any bid which is put to the shareholders maintains this company in majority Australian control and majority Australian ownership. The matters will be carefully screened by the Foreign Investment Review Board and a decision will be made in accordance with the act.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Mallee for his question and recognise his great concern and interest in the issue of how we as a government - and therefore the nation - assist the many farming families that are still suffering from arguably the worst drought in Australia's history. Last year, the government made a number of decisions and announcements about drought assistance, following visits that the Prime Minister and I and other ministers made to drought affected parts of Australia and following how those families in those regions were dealing with the severe circumstances of drought. Over the last couple of months we have seen some rain in Australia, mostly in the north. That has been welcome. But we should remember that there are still significant parts of agricultural Australia that are absolutely being devastated by drought.Since last year and the announcements that we made, there is about $2.1 billion worth of support available for Australia's farmers and small business people in drought affected areas, including in the seat of Mallee in Victoria. It is very important to note that the government responded very quickly and provided a great deal of certainty and confidence to the farming community with regard to our support and our assistance. So it came as a surprise to me to read an article in the Weekly Times on 25 January where Labor's agriculture spokesman, Senator O'Brien, was accusing the coalition of failing to help farmers affected by drought. How on earth could he conjure up that notion after the very generous measures that we have taken to assist the farming families across Australia - and more areas have been included in the drought exceptional circumstances areas announced by the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry during January? I just do not know where Senator O'Brien is living. Maybe he should have gone on the trip out to the drought stricken areas near Canberra yesterday with the Leader of the Opposition and spoken to Mr Cameron about drought and other matters.Mr Cameron certainly belled the cat on the issue when he said to the Leader of the Opposition, 'I'm inclined to think certainly natural weather patterns have a lot to do with it' - 'it' being drought. If you have a look at the weather patterns over the decades in Australia, you will see that it is cyclical. It is very important that governments in Australia support their rural communities in times of drought, and we are doing that. According to the latest figures from the drought task force, following the announcements that we made in those support measures last year, the number of farmers accessing EC has jumped by almost 43 per cent. The member for Mallee would appreciate that in Victoria the number of farmers and small business operators accessing EC income support has jumped by 72 per cent. In New South Wales and Western Australia, the number has increased by 37 per cent, and in Queensland it has increased by 15 per cent. That is about the breadth of the support that we are giving and the accessibility of the support we are giving to Australia's farming families. We take the advent of drought very seriously. We recognise the cyclical nature of drought. Can I make a genuine suggestion to the Leader of the Opposition that, next time he goes to talk to drought stricken farmers, he takes his spokesman on agriculture with him.</DOC>

 - Unlike the opposition, which has developed a closed mind on climate change issues, which seems to owe more to -  -  - Very good; thank you. The response to climate change is a complex one. It requires an open mind, and it requires practical measures. What the opposition is giving us now is some kind of cramped political theology. Nobody is allowed to doubt. Sceptics are to be banned. Anybody with an open mind is to be banned. Anybody who considers a solution is to be banned. What do the International Energy Agency say about the responses needed to reduce greenhouse gases? They say that the measures will be energy efficiency, clean coal and nuclear power, in that order. What does the opposition do? It takes the third biggest contributor to reducing greenhouse gas emissions off the agenda totally. The government will consider -  -  - The government approaches the climate change challenge with an open mind, and the mandatory renewable energy target has been particularly successful. We are on track to meet our Kyoto target and are committed to doing so. We are investigating emissions trading, just as we have investigated the options for nuclear power. All measures which are capable of combating climate change and of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and which do so in a manner that protects and preserves our standard of living, will always be under consideration.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Lindsay for her question. I note that the member for Lindsay reminded me before question time that in 1996, when I went doorknocking in the by-election in Emu Plains, the unemployment rate in her electorate was 7.3 per cent under the old Hawke-Keating industrial relations laws. Today, under the Howard government's workplace laws, unemployment is 4.2 per cent. As the Prime Minister said a little bit earlier in question time - there is a compelling table there - since the Work Choices legislation was introduced, 245,000 new jobs were created in the March to December period, which, when we compare it with every other March to December period, is by far the highest level of job creation since 1978. In addition, we now have the lowest level of industrial disputation since 1913, since records were first kept; we have the lowest unemployment rate, at 4.6 per cent, of any March to December period since 1978; and, importantly, we have the highest participation rate, 64.9 per cent, of any March to December period since 1978.The Work Choices laws are part of the equation that has helped to create this record job environment. The Labor Party's agenda is to tear up these laws and replace them with the ACTU's agenda, and - gee! - we heard about that last week, didn't we? We heard it thanks to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, who pulled the retractable cord, and the Leader of the Opposition came back onto the ACTU agenda. There is no doubt that the new laws have had a very positive influence on the creation of jobs in Australia - no doubt about it. The proof of the pudding is in the figures that are delivered, with more than 83 per cent of those 245,000 jobs being full-time jobs, the lowest level of industrial disputation and wages growth, wages going up, and the fact that the employment rate is at its lowest level since the comparable period in 1978.We want to know what the Labor Party is going to tell the Australian workers out there about the ACTU agenda they are going to roll out in a Rudd government, because the 139 paragraphs of the Leader of the Opposition's speech to the Business Council last week did not address the secret agenda - or perhaps non-secret agenda - of the Labor Party on industrial relations. The coalition is about job creation, the coalition is about higher wages, the coalition is about less industrial disputation and the Labor Party is about the agenda of the trade union movement.</DOC>

 - It is true that we have not ratified Kyoto, because to ratify Kyoto would not be in Australia's interests. The truth is that this government is composed of a lot of people who are sceptical about certain things. They are sceptical about knee-jerk environmental solutions that would damage the jobs of coal miners in Australia. They are sceptical about responses to climate change that would put Australia at a competitive disadvantage with the rest of the world. They are also sceptical about ruling out solutions that are clearly in the long-term interests of this country. Let me say to the climate change purists, or the climate change fanatics, on the other side: the cleanest and greenest energy source of all is the one you will not look at, and that is nuclear power. It is the cleanest and the greenest, and those who sit opposite will not look at it. I am a sceptic, yes. I am sceptical about the capacity of the Australian Labor Party to provide an answer to this great challenge that does not damage the long-term interests of the Australian economy.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Gilmore for her question. She has a great passion and, indeed, knowledge about water matters. I have learnt a great deal about water, particularly groundwater, from her. - The Australian government moved quickly and decisively more than a decade ago to address the consequences of climate change. Australia was the first country to set up the Greenhouse Office or any organisation of that kind. We have a comprehensive climate change strategy in which we have invested, over a decade, $2 billion that is building scientific understanding of climate change, helping us meet our Kyoto emissions reduction target and investing in the future technologies that we need, such as renewable energy, clean coal and carbon capture for treating coal-fired power stations. We will need all of those because technology will be the key driver of the ability to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.The opposition, on the other hand, hold up one solitary proposition - sign Kyoto. They are spreading a most pernicious untruth. -  - You know it is untrue. And that untruth is that, if you ratify Kyoto, the drought will break, global warming will stop and everything will be right in the world. The message from the IPCC fourth assessment report, the message from the Stern report and the message from every piece of science we have seen for many years is that there is so much inertia and so much heat in the system that global warming is going to continue for decades - probably until the end of the century. We have to live with the consequences of this phenomenon for many years.The mitigation efforts that we take today will rebound to the benefit of our grandchildren, if not our great-grandchildren. We in the government are committed to long-term planning. We are committed to ensuring that our children and grandchildren will benefit. I would compare that with the extraordinary complacency and neglect by various state governments with respect to their water resources. All around Australia the greatest manifestation of a hotter and drier climate is water scarcity, not just in the bush but also in the cities. Every day when pensioners pull muscles or crack backs lugging heavy buckets to water their gardens in Brisbane and they look at their dry and desiccated lawns and their dead roses, they remember the Leader of the Opposition. It was he and Wayne Goss who, in 1989, chose not to build the Wolffdene Dam. Brisbane is in a drought today. Brisbane is short of water today because of the failure to plan ahead. It suited the Leader of the Opposition politically and electorally not to build a dam. If that dam had been built, Brisbane would have enough water to tide it over this dry time. This is not just the case in Brisbane: Bob Carr did exactly the same thing.We know the Labor Party's record on water resources. We know their form - and their form is just like that of Mr Micawber: 'Something will turn up. Don't worry. Cancel the project. Put it on the backburner. It'll rain next week. Pray for rain.' We are planning ahead. We have the runs on the board. We are looking at every option, including nuclear power. We are looking at an emissions-trading scheme. We have everything on the table. - What does the opposition have to say in response to that? They have defined a new heresy. What is the heresy? It is the heresy of scepticism. A sceptic is a person inclined to question or doubt accepted opinions. Oh no! We cannot have any questioning or doubting - I question myself whether we are moving into some new form of totalitarianism - where the great edicts from the opposition, the gospel according to the Labor Party, cannot be questioned and cannot be queried.The government has moved to deal with climate change. We are mitigating climate change. We are adapting to climate change through the biggest investment in water resources this country has ever seen. We are making up for the failures of Labor governments to invest and we are working internationally through the AP6, through the United Nations, to ensure that we achieve what all of us know is the only answer to reducing emissions in a manner that will abate global warming, and that is a global commitment. Without that global commitment there will be no abatement, and all that we do - and we will do all that we can - on mitigation in Australia will be for naught without a global commitment. That is our policy: mitigation, global commitment and ensuring that Australia is secure and sustainable in the face of a hotter and drier time ahead.</DOC>

 - The Leader of the Opposition takes a debating point, which he is entitled to do, but he knows as well as I do that we have not ratified the Kyoto protocol. We will not ratify it not only because it would be a knee-jerk reaction but because it would actually impose obligations on this country -  - that would be damaging to us because the same obligations would not be imposed on countries with which we are competitors. Our reason for not endorsing Kyoto - ratifying it or whatever description you want to use - is that it would damage this country's interests unless we can have an international arrangement which includes the great emitters of the world - for example, the United States and China. Effectively, about 32 per cent of the world's emissions are covered by those who have ratified Kyoto.This country emits 1.6 per cent of the world's global emissions. It has been said before that, if we closed down everything in this country tomorrow, in nine months the emissions that were saved by the closure in Australia would be equalled by the addition to emissions by China. That is the scale of the international problem. The Leader of the Opposition knows that. He can have his little debating points. He can turn around and look self-satisfied about having scored a debating point, but nothing can absolve him from the fact that he is advocating a policy that would put us at a competitive disadvantage with many of the countries against whom we must compete in a global environment. I want to make it very clear to him and to the rest of the House that, in responding to climate change, this government has no intention of damaging the competitive position of Australian industry.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kingston for my first question. I also acknowledge his very strong interest in the successful establishment of the Adelaide South Technical College. The investment by the Howard government in the 25 technical colleges is an emphatic statement that the days when a trade or vocational qualification was deemed second-class are over. We want a nation where a high-quality technical qualification is as prized as a university degree. Our country made a big mistake 20 and 30 years ago when it turned its back on the old system of developing technical skills within technical colleges.On behalf of the government I am proud to report that, in respect of technical colleges, we have gone from an idea to reality in a very short space of time. It shows that if you get the community and industry behind such an initiative you can move mountains. In that regard, I would like to acknowledge the very significant work of my predecessor, the member for Moreton.I can report that by Monday of next week 20 of the proposed 25 colleges will have commenced, with another technical college opening in the Pilbara midyear and the remaining four on schedule to open in the early part of next year. The program is well ahead of schedule. It means that, in 2007, some 2,000 students across Australia will attend these technical colleges. We are seeing very high calibre students attracted to the colleges.It means we are on track not only for 2,000 students this year but for 7½ thousand students in 2009. Through this initiative, the government is supporting the dreams and aspirations of thousands of young Australians and their parents. We are getting on with doing what needs to be done.Yet what did we hear last weekend from those opposite? The member for Perth announced over the weekend that a Labor government would hand the Australian technical colleges back to the state Labor governments. Handing the colleges back to the states is code for handing them back to the unions. The unions are pulling the strings on this matter.The unions will insist that the employers involved be shown the door. As a consequence, the unique and innovative role of training students with skills that are highly tailored to the needs of local employers will collapse. The colleges will disappear if they are handed back to the states. If Labor were to hand back these colleges to the states, history would repeat itself and the status of technical training would be reduced once again to that of a second-class career.The Australian technical colleges are a major step in elevating the importance of and the interest in technical careers. They are a reality. They have a big role to play, and I urge the Labor Party to show some spine: stand up to the unions and support the dreams and aspirations of thousands of young Australians.</DOC>

 - I deny having ignored their plight and deny having not replied. It so happens that a question that I was asked in the House last November was asked by the opposition in the presence of a large number of the Tristar workers. I am aware that there are some Tristar workers here today. I should also inform the House that, on my behalf, the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations met the people from Tristar.I take this opportunity to tell the House that the dispute at Tristar is not caused by Work Choices. That is a fact that was acknowledged this morning by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition when she said, 'It's true that the immediate Tristar industrial issue is not a product of Work Choices.' I understand that the workers' redundancy entitlement was in an agreement under the pre-Work Choices system. That agreement has been terminated by the AIRC - the umpire under the old system rules. But, due to a change to the Work Choices legislation, the redundancy entitlements remain protected for an additional period of a year. In other words, under the system Labor had wanted us to keep, these redundancy entitlements would have disappeared with the decision of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. So, as a result of an amendment moved by this government, the old redundancy entitlements remain on foot for an additional year. That was not the old law; it is the new law. I think even the member for Batman, as a former President of the ACTU, would understand the significance of that.In relation to the treatment of Mr Bevan, I have previously said that the company, although it may have behaved within a law which has applied to redundancies for decades under both governments, behaved well outside community expectations and decency. That was made very clear by the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, who, on the day he was appointed, was out there talking to the workers. - So don't you come up here with your phoney pro-worker hand-wringing exercise. It was this government that gave the redundancy another year. It was this Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations who, on his first day on the job, went out and talked to the men and women. So don't you come here professing a concern and suggesting that we do not care. I do not believe that companies should treat their workers badly. I think companies should treat their workers in a very respectful and a very precious and proper way. I would remind those opposite and those in the gallery that all the laws in the world will not legislate or dictate -  - Here is another phoney point of order when it is going badly for them. - As I indicated a moment ago, the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations met the Tristar workers - and I acknowledge their presence in the gallery. -  - Mr Speaker, I have been asked a question by the Leader of the Opposition and, because they do not like the answer, there is a constant barrage of interjections from the frontbench. Is that the way this place is going to be -  - The minister met the Tristar workers prior to question time and he did visit the site two weeks ago. He has also been in regular touch with the company management. I understand Tristar claim that there is still work at the factory for the workers - a claim that the Industrial Relations Commission, the independent industrial relations commission which the Labor Party regards as the answer to every problem, upheld four weeks ago. I do not know whether that decision was right or wrong. I am not in a position to make a judgement. But the independent umpire of Labor Party esteem and dreams upheld four weeks ago the claim of the company that there was still work at the factory. The member for Fowler then left the chamber. 
 - I understand that this claim is disputed by the workers, and I can understand that. From what I have seen and been told, it seems to be an understandable view. But I have to point out for the accuracy of the record that the Industrial Relations Commission, which we are always told is the repository of all wisdom in these matters, found in favour of the company. I understand further that, on the basis of the concerns of the workers, the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations has asked the Office of Workplace Services to investigate further, and I am told that that investigation is progressing well.The government is not in the business of shutting down factories. However, if there is no work, the workers should receive their current entitlements - which, by courtesy of the changes that the government introduced, are more generous than they would have been if the old law had obtained. I know that is a rather difficult thing for the opposition to accept, but it happens to be a statement of fact in relation to this issue. I also think it is important to remind the House that one of the reasons the company may have suffered financial adversity is that it lost many contracts with car companies following the 2001 industrial action at the company, which resulted in 12,000 employees in the car industry being stood down, with an estimated loss to the Australian car industry of $230 million.I want the truth of this matter resolved. If these men and women are being kept physically at work in the hope that the company lasts out the 12-month period so that the company does not have to pay the more generous redundancy which is available under a Howard government amendment then I want that truth made known to the public. On the other hand, if that is not the case and there is work available, I want that known, because we are in the business of treating both workers and employers fairly. I simply say to those who sit opposite: you have not tried, at any stage, to really champion the cause of the workers but rather you have tried to score a few cheap political points, and you have been found out in the process.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Boothby for his question and for his interest. I think it is important, in the context of the so-called struggle against terrorism, that the House is familiar with the success in South-East Asia in that struggle against terrorism. The Indonesian government, supported by Australia, the United States and others, has been very effective in its work against terrorism. It is heartening that the Philippines has started to get some real results in the last few months. There have been some significant successes.As a result of sustained military pressure in the Philippines since 1 August, the Philippines military have killed Abu Sayyaf group leaders, one of whom was responsible for the so-called St Valentine's Day bombings in 2005 and another who was responsible for the 2004 superferry attack which killed 120 people. The military have disrupted and closed Jemaah Islamiah terrorist training camps in the Philippines, they have reduced overall terrorist numbers and they have contained key Jemaah Islamiah personalities, such as one of the Bali bombers - a man called Dulmatin - on the island of Jolo.The point I make is that the government of the Philippines is now really starting to get results. They froze significant al-Qaeda linked bank accounts in December of last year, and in October they seized significant quantities of ammonium nitrate which had been smuggled in. Australia is working closely with the Philippines in this respect. We are spending around $10 million on counterterrorism activities in the Philippines which focus very much on training, in particular assisting with police training, and also the provision of appropriate and relevant equipment. Let me add that the United States also plays a crucially important role in assisting the Philippines.We are seeing real results in the struggle against terrorism in South-East Asia, specifically in Indonesia and certainly in Singapore and Malaysia, and now also in the Philippines. It is an illustration not just of the success of the policies and the determination of those governments but also of the role that countries like Australia, the United States and some of the European countries play in assisting that struggle against terrorism.</DOC>

I acknowledge again to this House that I mistook the question asked yesterday by the Leader of the Opposition. I wrongly thought - and I do not mind saying I am wrong when I am wrong, and I have no grounds for complaining about him - he was asking me about the connection between drought and climate change, where I do believe the jury is out. I have to say that I think the evidence of the connection to which he referred is very strong. That is my view, that is what I said yesterday and I repeat it today.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hasluck for his question. Can I say very directly that the purpose of this paper is to promote an intelligent debate on the issues of what form an international emissions trading system might take, how that would impact on Australia, what form a national emissions trading system in this country might take and the circumstances in which it might be introduced. I want to make it clear that the formation of this group, which brings together senior members of the federal bureaucracy as well as senior business figures, is a very intelligent and sensible way of trying to get the right outcome in relation to the environment. In joining the business community and the government, I have very much had in mind the dictum of the member for Batman, whom I find a ceaseless source of encouragement and inspiration on this subject, when he said:It's time to abandon the political correctness espoused by the green movement. Let's be real: without getting business on board we cannot achieve anything.I happen to agree with that. I think the most intelligent way of looking at an emissions trading system either here or internationally is in fact to join the business community to the process, and that is exactly what we have done.I do make it clear again that we have no intention of introducing an emissions trading scheme which damages Australia's international competitiveness. We are not going to sacrifice the jobs of coalminers in pursuit of some kind of knee-jerk reaction. We need a measured, sensible, consistent and intelligent reaction to the problem of climate change. Of course, in determining whether a national system might cause damage to our international competitiveness, we must necessarily pay regard to the responses of other nations to the issue of emissions trading.I think all members of the House would recognise that the people on this group do represent those business interests that would be very directly affected by the introduction of an emissions trading system. I am very grateful to those people for joining it, and I commend the issues paper to all members who are interested in a measured response that protects the jobs of Australians and looks after the interests of the Australian economy.</DOC>

 - The reason why I believe the Australian people will believe me is that I have a track record of putting the jobs of Australians ahead of anything else, and that is what I will continue to do. Quite frankly, I wonder at the view taken by many on the other side - not all; not the member for Batman or the member for Hunter, who also has a very distinguished record in relation to these matters. The member for Hunter has been astute enough to point out that if you introduce a national emissions trading system, you have to abandon the MRETs. I wonder if that is a view shared by the member for Kingsford Smith. I wonder if it is a view shared by the Leader of the Opposition.Back when the energy white paper was introduced, we looked at whether we would increase the MRETs. We decided against that because we thought it was better to invest in low emission technology. The investment in that low emission technology has led not only to an investment in clean coal technology but also to an investment near Mildura, Victoria, which represents the largest investment in solar energy anywhere in the world, and that is a product of the policies of this government. I can say to the Leader of the Opposition that we will put the jobs of Australians ahead of ideology in responding to this issue.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Braddon for his question. The Australian property market, which showed substantial growth in the early part of this decade, has shown considerable moderation in recent years, with the exception of Perth and, to some degree, Darwin. The 12-month change in the Sydney property market, according to Australian Property Monitors, was a 0.5 per cent increase, in Melbourne a 3.1 per cent increase, in Hobart - which I know the member for Braddon would be interested in: southern Tasmania, not northern Tasmania - a 6.6 per cent increase, and overall in Australia quite a considerable slowdown in the growth we saw in the early part of the decade. The exception to that is Perth, which showed a 31 per cent increase in average prices over the 12 months, making Perth the second most expensive city in Australia.In addition to the moderation in the property market we have also seen a moderation in credit markets, with housing credit increasing one per cent in December to be 14½ per cent over the year. Taken together with the adjustments as a result of fruit and petrol prices, we saw a lowering of the consumer price index in the December quarter, with the underlying measures around about 0.5 per cent for the quarter or two per cent for the year.The good news is that the consumer price index seems to have ticked down a bit, and that is good news for stability in interest rates. Interest rates were left unchanged at yesterday's Reserve Bank board meeting in recognition that moderation in the property market, in the credit market and in the consumer price index seems to have moderated to some degree the inflationary build-up that we saw in the latter part of last year.If the Australian economy can continue to grow, with unemployment at a 30-year low of 4.6 per cent and inflation moderate, that will be a very good interest rate outlook for homebuyers and for business. To have a two to three per cent inflation rate in an economy where we have nearly full employment, at 4.6 per cent, is something that we probably would not have dreamed of 10, 20 or 25 years ago. Still, the task is to ensure that economic management is consistent with growing the economy, finding job opportunities for young Australians and keeping inflation low in a stable interest rate climate. That is what this government is committed to doing.</DOC>

 - Perhaps when addressing the Leader of the Opposition I should use different language. Let me simply say again what was the substance of my comments on the Lateline program the other night - that is, this government did recognise that climate change represented a challenge, but I also made it clear that, in responding to it, we did not intend to embrace knee-jerk reactions that are going to damage the Australian economy. At the end of the day, the first responsibility of this government is to secure the welfare of the Australian people in all their various dimensions. One of those dimensions is to make sure that our public policy responses on all sorts of issues do not damage the job security of Australians and do not damage the international competitiveness of this country. In our responses to the challenge of climate change we do not intend to embrace every gloomy prediction about the future of the planet. We intend to respond in a measured way, but we intend to respond in a way that does not damage the Australian economy or destroy the jobs of hardworking people such as Australian coalminers.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Riverina for her question. I recognise her very keen interest in infrastructure investment across regional Australia and particularly in her electorate in the Riverina. I might add that she has been a great supporter of more action in terms of securing Australia's water supplies, particularly for industry and the irrigators in the Riverina. The recently announced government package to deal with the challenges of managing our water better in Australia is due in no small part to a lot of the work that has been done by the member for Riverina. I certainly acknowledge her for that.It goes without saying that water is the lifeblood of regional Australia. Irrigated agricultural production in Australia is a very significant contributor to regional economies and our exports, with $9 billion worth of agricultural produce produced in irrigation areas. That is 25 per cent of agricultural production produced in irrigation areas on one per cent of the agricultural land in Australia. It is very important that we recognise the significance of irrigated agriculture in the overall Australian economy. Most importantly, we need to recognise the critical role it plays in those regional communities in which it exists. For too long we have tended to take too much for granted the management of the water systems and what that delivers in terms of wealth to our regional communities.I know that the member for Riverina recognises the significant nature of the announcement that the government has made - a $10 billion announcement - to invest in the water systems of Australia to secure that sustainability for those communities, some of which the member for Riverina represents. It is a once in a lifetime opportunity to invest in securing those water supplies for those areas. It is not just about the industry in those areas; it is about the communities that survive in those local economies. It is terribly important that we recognise the significance of this.We have seen the debate that has taken place in and the commentary coming back from some of the states - some of it positive; some of it not so positive. But this is an issue that we must look at in the interests of the nation. This proposal - a $10 billion proposal - can save 3,600 gigalitres of water. That is almost six times the volume of Sydney Harbour. That can be saved without one more drop of rain falling. That is the smart aspect of this package that we have put forward. We ask all the stakeholders involved to work with the government to achieve those savings. We have said that 50 per cent of those savings will go back to industry - go back to those regional economies. That is a significant gesture of our faith in the economic worth of those economies to the national economy and to their local communities.It is also important to note that what we are proposing is going to build on a lot of the hard work that has already been done. We recognise the efficiency gains that have already been achieved in our irrigation systems and our irrigation areas across Australia, both on-farm and within the systems. We want to build on those savings. We want to add to them and aggregate greater savings in that area. We are smart enough to fix our river systems. We are smart enough to manage and balance the competing interests of industry and the environment and maintain the sustainability of industry in our regional economies. It is incredibly important. The majority of the feedback that we have received since the Prime Minister announced this policy a couple of weeks ago has generally been, 'Thank goodness someone at last is prepared to do something of a practical nature to address this problem.' We certainly intend to go on and do that.The last point I want to make on this is that this is a $10 billion package and the only way that we can afford to do this is because of the good economic management that has been deployed in Australia over the last 10 years. We do not have any debt. We are running the economy much more efficiently and much more competitively and the nation can afford to do this. If we had had to borrow this money, as previous Labor governments would have had to do, it would have been a much more difficult decision. We should never forget that we can do these things in Australia today because of how well the economy is run and how well the economy is doing.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Blair for his question. On Friday of last week, the Treasury released their annual estimates of net private sector wealth for the year up until 30 June 2006. It showed that the market value of Australia's net private sector wealth grew by 19 per cent over the course of that last full financial year. Although a main influence on wealth is family dwellings, they were not the largest contributor to this rise because of the moderation I talked of earlier to the House. The main influence was the increase in business assets, which has coincided with the Australian Stock Exchange moving to the highest levels ever recorded in its history. Millions of Australians are sharing in that wealth, either directly or through their superannuation funds. Australia's net private sector wealth in nominal terms now stands at around $7.4 trillion dollars, or more than seven times our annual GDP. This is a consequence of the fact that more Australians are in work than ever before, their wages are higher than ever before, their investments in savings - particularly through superannuation - are higher than ever before and Australian business is more profitable than it has ever been.The Leader of the Opposition, who has no experience of economic policy other than as a staffer in a state government, which is his main claim to economic experience, has gone so far as to try and describe the Australian economy as a - and this is a word that I am not familiar with; it sounds like a pharmaceutical of some kind or another - 'brutopia', something that the minister for health could put on the PBS list, I think, and subsidise. He says that brutopia is 'economic neo-liberalism' with 'unrestrained market capitalism' sweeping all before it. Brutopia - also available at health shops near you as an alternative or complementary medicine! - And the member for Melbourne - the Socialist Left - comes in on cue with his complaints about Work Choices. What a shocking piece of legislation that was! - We have only had 245,000 jobs as a consequence, in the aftermath. - We have had the largest accumulation of wealth in Australia's history. We have had more jobs created than we have ever had before in a single year. We had Work Choices legislation - and this genius from the Socialist Left says it is all a failure. We have the other member whose last big day out, on Sunday, was on a joint bill with 'Jihad' Jack Thomas, down in Melbourne - the member for Wills on a joint bill with Jack Thomas. Not quite according to the script, that one. Anyway, let me go back to economic policy. We are now experiencing our ninth -  -  - Well, it is a little less interesting than 'Jihad' Jack Thomas and the member for Wills! We are now experiencing the ninth surplus budget under this government. We have now retired every single dollar of the Labor Party's $96 billion debt. We are now funding unfunded superannuation liabilities, which were never touched by any other government in Australian history. There have been two million jobs created since this government came to power. There is $7.4 trillion of private sector wealth. And the Leader of the Opposition calls that 'brutopia'. One can only wonder what would happen if he were to get his hands on the levers of economic power. But let me tell you -  - it is something that we will protect the Australian people from at all costs.</DOC>

 - I am impressed that the member for Kingsford Smith has so quickly picked up the techniques of the Leader of the Opposition that he too is misrepresenting the remarks that I made on AM, which, for honourable members who are interested in reading them, are set out relevantly, in full, in my speech on the MPI yesterday. What I said was that much of the east coast - not most of it, not all of it; much of it - is adequately elevated. The fact is that I went on to say that the response to rising sea levels -  -  - I went on to say that the response to rising sea levels will require both planning measures and engineering measures. It can be adapted to in some cases. There are a range of measures that will be used to deal with rising sea levels - and, of course, as I mentioned in the AM interview, the consequent storm surges, because it is not simply a question of the sea level rising but of the consequent storm surges.This is the strategy of the opposition: they are seeking to create a massive scare campaign. We are talking about, at the higher limit, a sea-level rise of 58 centimetres over 100 years; at the lower level, 18 centimetres. In the course of the last century, we have had a rise in sea level in Australia of 20 centimetres already, so rising sea levels are not new. We have dealt with them. We have adapted to them.We are working closely with state and local government. Indeed, the National Resource Management Ministerial Council in November 2006 agreed to fund a first-pass national coast vulnerability assessment to be coordinated by the Australian Greenhouse Office. The Australian Greenhouse Office, the Bureau of Meteorology and the CSIRO have published extensively on rising sea level issues. There is an immense amount of literature out there on it. The techniques for dealing with it are very well known. Local councils up and down the coast - on the east coast, the west coast, in South Australia and all around Australia - are aware of this issue and adopting planning measures to handle it. Those measures will no doubt be recalibrated and adjusted as better science becomes available.But it is no answer to the challenge of climate change to be frightening the Australian people - to be out trying to panic the Australian people - with threats of a massive Al Gore style, The Day after Tomorrow style inundation. That is a scare campaign. It is calculated to do enormous damage to public confidence. I would say this to the member for Kingsford Smith: I do not believe that the constituents of the electorate of Griffith, or the constituents of any other electorate on Australia's coast, will thank him for this sort of panicked scare campaign. What the member for Kingsford Smith has left out of his question is: what do you do about it? We are aware of it. We are dealing with it. Labor is full of scare -  - </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Bowman for his question and for his interest in this issue. I think the House is well aware that the Australian government has been amongst those which have strongly condemned the Fijian military's unconstitutional coup d'etat. As time has gone on since the coup, we have become increasingly concerned about the way the Fijian military force is exercising power without any real restraint and without accountability. Honourable members will be aware that there have been reports in recent times of a number of human rights abuses in Fiji by members of the Fijian military force. In the government's view, there have been endeavours by the Fijian military to suppress any form of dissent from or disagreement with the actions that the military have taken. They have done that through extreme intimidation of critics. There have been reports that, in some cases, critics and opponents of what has happened have been taken down to the Queen Elizabeth barracks in Suva and beaten and assaulted. Not surprisingly, many ordinary Fijians are dismayed that the military has not honoured a pledge that it originally made to uphold human rights, the rule of law and, for that matter, freedom of the press. That simply has not happened.The Australian government are disturbed by reports we have heard that the Fijian military is continuing to try to divide the community by encouraging Fijians to spy on each other and report any private criticisms - which must, presumably, be manifold - of the military administration. Furthermore, we are very concerned that the rule of law is being undermined through compromising the independence both of the judiciary and of the police force. On 1 February the Fijian military disbanded the tactical response division of the Fijian police. In December the Chief Justice of Fiji was summarily dismissed by the military. There is no doubt that there is a great deal of opposition in Fiji to what the military have done and to their heavy-handed tactics since the takeover. There is also no doubt that the military commander, Commodore Bainimarama, underestimated the degree of public opposition to his actions and underestimated in particular the degree of opposition that there would be amongst non-government organisations.In conclusion, an eminent persons group - which was established at a Pacific Islands Forum foreign ministers meeting which I attended in Sydney during December - has now visited Fiji. It did so last week. The group contains Peter Cosgrove, a former Chief of the Defence Force in Australia, and a number of other eminent figures from the Pacific region. Its report is in the process of being concluded, and we look forward to seeing that report. I hope that, before too long, a meeting of Pacific Islands Forum foreign ministers will be able to consider that report and hear from the eminent persons group. That will help the region, not just Australia and New Zealand but the region as a whole, chart a way forward in terms of dealing with what has happened in Fiji.I make no apology for raising today the question of human rights abuses in Fiji. It is a serious problem and a serious matter. When the military take over control of a country in this way, which was completely illegal - and of course we in Australia and those in New Zealand, around the Pacific and elsewhere regard it as an unacceptable way to behave - the problem is seriously compounded by the human rights abuses that ensue.</DOC>

 - The rule of thumb with sea level rises, and this is very much a general rule of thumb - it is based on Dutch work; they know quite a bit about sea level rises, as you can imagine, Mr Speaker - is that sandy beaches can retreat 50 or even 100 times as much as the sea level rise due to erosion. So if the sea level rises as estimated in the fourth assessment report, the degree of erosion on sandy beaches in Australia - absent any other engineering action: groynes, artificial reefs or anything like that - could be somewhere between nine and 50 metres. That plainly has consequences for communities that are built on low-lying sandy soil. Obviously, portions of south-east Queensland and Cairns have been identified as being at risk.The measures that will be deployed if or when those sea rises become apparent vary enormously from place to place. As the Leader of the Opposition would know from his very careful study of the fourth assessment report, the sea level rise is not even forecast in the fourth assessment report to be uniform around the world. In fact, there are some parts of the world where the sea level may actually fall. So it is a very variable proposition. And, of course, the land can change too. If you get more precipitation, you get more sediments being washed down, and that can offset or even exceed the rise in sea level.That is the context in terms of Australia. Globally, of course, it is an enormous problem. It is particularly problematic in places like China, Egypt and Bangladesh, where there are large cities and populations that are built in river deltas on sediments which have a tendency to sink anyway. They will be particularly prejudiced, and the dangers are enormous. We are all familiar with New Orleans, which is a city that is largely below sea level. Jakarta, which has recently been flooded, is 40 per cent below sea level.It is plainly a big issue globally but, in Australia, it is something that everybody, every level of government, is well aware of. The Australian government is well aware of this issue. We are working closely with the states and local government through our scientific agencies to make sure that we have the science and that we take the practical measures - not the panic, scare slogans - to deal with the consequences of a further rise in sea level. I repeat: in the last century, we experienced a 20 centimetre rise in sea level. Rises in sea level are not new. We have adapted to them in the past and we will adapt to them in the future.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dobell for his question. China is the world's second largest emitter of greenhouse gases. Only a few years ago it was forecast to overtake the United States by 2020. China's growth has been so rapid that it is expected to overtake the United States by 2010 or even 2009. So it is growing extraordinarily quickly in terms of its greenhouse gas emissions. That is because China is heavily dependent on coal. It consumes more coal than Australia does. In 2005 we consumed about 124 million tonnes of coal; the Chinese consumed over 2,200 million tonnes of coal. So our coal consumption represents a little over five per cent of China's consumption. China is commissioning the equivalent of a 1,000 megawatt coal-fired power station every five days. Its additional growth in emissions equals Australia's annual total every eight months. That gives an idea of the scale of the problem.Only this morning, both in the press and on the radio, Mr Qin Dahe, the Chinese scientist who was co-chair of the United Nations scientific panel that produced the fourth assessment report, stressed China's dependence on coal. He said that it was 69 per cent dependent on coal for its energy needs and that that would continue. He also stressed the need for technology solutions to clean up its coal.Australia is leading the world in clean coal technology - be it through the Low Emissions Technology Development Fund, where over $200 million of projects that are relevant to clean coal technology have been announced; through the AP6; or through the Australia-China Joint Coordination Group on Clean Coal Technology, which the Prime Minister announced in January. Across a wide range of programs, Australia is, and has been for many years, working actively to develop clean coal technology - practical measures, demonstration projects, scientific research.This is often correctly presented as being in our national interest as a great coal-exporting nation - it is a vital part of protecting our coal industry, as the head of the CFMEU said only this morning - but it is also in the world's interest. We recognise that, no matter how much we reduce our greenhouse gas emissions, the critical reductions have to take place in the countries that are the largest emitters. China is saying today - as it has said again and again - that, in order to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions, it needs affordable technologies that enable it to clean up its coal. Australia is working to provide that technology. It may be that, in the years ahead, the greatest contribution we will make to the reduction of greenhouse gases is giving the Chinese, the Indians and the other coal dependent countries of the world the means to clean up their coal-fired power stations and deliver their people the energy they need, but in a manner which does not exacerbate greenhouse gas emissions and climate change.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Canning for his question. I know that he takes a very personal interest in this. It is very important for thousands of people in his electorate, as it is for millions of people - some two million people - around Australia who suffer from osteoporosis. The PBS is one of the three pillars of Medicare. Thanks to the PBS, Australians gain affordable access to life-saving and life-enhancing drugs. Thanks to the Howard government, more Australians have more access to more medicines than ever before.Since August there have been new and expanded PBS listings. Herceptin, for early stage breast cancer; Lantus, for insulin-dependent diabetics; and statins, for people with cardiac risk factors, have added some $1 billion to our PBS investment over the forward estimates period. As well, there is now good news for people over 70 with osteoporosis. From April, up to 73,000 new patients each year will gain access to osteoporosis drugs such as Fosamax under the PBS, before they have fractures - because prevention is better than cure. Along with the associated bone mineral density testing, this latest measure will add some $225 million to our health investment over the forward estimates period.While this government gets on with the job of making a good system even better, members opposite just cannot let go of something called Medicare Gold. The new shadow minister was asked on 3AW, just before Christmas:But Medicare Gold has gone, hasn't it? It's dead, buried, never to be resurrected.Listen to what she said on the record, on 3AW. The member for Gellibrand said:Well, I think that there are some components of it - that is, of Medicare Gold - that are really important for us to consider in any rethink about the health system.We know that Barry Jones called Medicare Gold a turkey. I ask the member for Gellibrand: which bits of that old stuffed bird does she want to serve now? I say to the Leader of the Opposition: inexperience is no excuse. If you do not have a health policy, you have no credibility as a candidate to lead this country.</DOC>

I say that not just because it is a good figure; I say it because it is great that people have jobs. The coalition believe that the best welfare that you can provide to the nation is the opportunity for members of the family to have a job. We believe that is vitally important. When Mr Keating, as Labor Prime Minister, and the then head of the ACTU did a deal in 1993 to introduce the unfair dismissal laws, they had no regard at all -  - Were you involved? He was! - He is going red. I think he was involved. They had no regard at all for the impact on jobs. The coalition warned of the impact that it would have on small business and the creation of jobs - and it was not just the coalition. A 1996 Morgan &amp; Banks survey showed that one-quarter of all small businesses were affected by Labor's laws and 14 per cent of small businesses had hired fewer staff as a result of the unfair dismissal laws. In 1998 the Council of Small Business Organisations of Australia, COSBOA, estimated that 50,000 jobs would be created in Australia if we could abolish the unfair dismissal laws as they applied to small business. In 2002 a Melbourne Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research study estimated that the laws introduced by the Labor Party and the ACTU cost a staggering $1.3 billion. It predicted that if we removed the laws it would create 77,000 jobs. There was an ACCI survey in 2003, and so on.Mr Speaker, you might ask: since we introduced the Work Choices laws in March last year, what has been the impact? In the March to December period of 2005, 90,000 jobs were created. In the same period in 2006, after we removed the unfair dismissal laws in their application to small business, 245,000 jobs were created. So, from having 90,000 jobs before then, when the Labor Party and ACTU unfair dismissal laws were in place, in the same period in 2006 it went up to 245,000 jobs. Certainly, not every one of those jobs can be credited to the abolition of unfair dismissal laws. But, fundamentally, we are about putting in place the infrastructure, putting in place the laws, that create well-paid jobs that give people careers in the modern Australian workplace.Not only do the Labor Party and the ACTU have an agenda to rip up those laws, but current ACTU policy says that the new laws that the Labor Party will have in a Rudd Labor government will go further, to cover casuals at all levels and a whole range of other workers who previously did not have the unfair dismissal laws. We are about job creation. We are about well-paid jobs. The Labor Party, in partnership with the ACTU, is about destroying jobs, particularly in small business.</DOC>

 - Facts are facts. If there has been an increase in the repossession rate then it has occurred. But the Reserve Bank's September 2006 financial stability review noted that the housing loan arrears rate has increased from a low of 0.17 per cent of loans outstanding in June 2004 to 0.3 per cent now. It stands to reason that, if at a time of very low interest rates people borrow a great deal more than they did during high interest rates, some people will borrow more than they can afford. It also stands to reason that if you have a state government that imposes penal rates of exit tax -  -  - Let me say to the member for Lilley - and I know he was rather disappointed that interest rates remained on hold today, so he is dredging up a question about repossession rates - that I can assure him that the homebuyers of Western Sydney regard the circumstances in which they are now living as infinitely superior to the circumstances in which they lived in the early 1990s when interest rates were only just coming off the levels of 17 per cent or 18 per cent that they had got to.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Cook for his question and I particularly thank him for organising a meeting with school principals from schools in his electorate last year so that we could talk about issues of concern to them. Teachers are a precious national resource. After parents, teachers are the single most important determinants in a child's educational outcomes. That is why we must focus on quality teaching.For schools to be able to provide quality education, principals must have greater autonomy. Principals must have greater management control over staffing and over budgets. Principals in our schools must have the power to hire and fire staff according to performance, like any other head of an organisation or enterprise has. How else can a school principal guarantee a quality education, if they have no control over the quality of the staff?What we must do in order to attract and retain the very best, high-quality teachers is to provide more flexible and more attractive workplace conditions, and that includes offering rewards and incentives based on performance. Today I announced that I will be taking to the next state education ministers' meeting a number of proposals relating to greater principal autonomy and ensuring that we have an element of performance based pay for teachers. We must attract, retain and reward the very best teachers. They are professionals. Let us treat them as professionals.I note that the new Labor education spokesman, early on, ventured into this issue of teacher performance. He made a few noises about teacher performance. But, immediately, he was hauled back into line by the Australian Education Union, who even threatened to withhold campaign funding from the Labor Party unless they toed the line. Federally, Labor will never be able to deliver on education reforms because they are captives of the all-powerful teachers' unions. -  - As was stated in a report released this week by the Centre for Independent Studies, public schools in this country will only flourish when we break the nexus between teacher unions and state governments. The Howard government will continue to put the interests of students and parents first in our quest for quality in education in Australia.</DOC>

 - I would first ask whether federal Labor supports the Australian government's proposal to award teachers -  -  - I look forward to bipartisan support from the Federal Labor Party -  - I look forward to the bipartisan support of the federal Labor Party on our proposals to reward teachers on performance - to provide incentives for the performance of our teachers in our schools - because that underpins quality. In answer to the question about funding, I remind members opposite that the Commonwealth provides supplementary funding to state governments that provide the majority of funding for state government schools. - The percentage of funding that the Australian government provides to state governments is based on the investment that state governments make, and that has been the case for decades. So, if the state governments increase their investments in our schools -  - the Australian government's component increases automatically. Over the 2005-08 funding period - that funding arrangement - the Australian government is already providing $33 billion to state governments for our schools. I hope that at the state education ministers' meeting in April I receive bipartisan support to recognise that our teachers are professionals and that they should be respected and rewarded as such.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Bass for his question and acknowledge the wonderful work he has done to help get the Australian Technical College, Northern Tasmania off the ground. This government has been working to a multibillion dollar plan to tackle labour and skills shortages. It is a plan that has already made a major contribution. It is an important part of the continuing success of our economy, and it is a success already. I will give you some examples. In 2006, four times as many young people started a bricklayers apprenticeship than in 1996. In 2006, nearly four times as many young people started a plasterer's apprenticeship than in 1996. The list goes on and on through dozens of trades. In fact, last year, in 2006, 142,000 people completed apprenticeships compared with a paltry 32,000 in 1996.Importantly, the government's plan, which has delivered so much already, is also a plan for the future because demand for skills will continue. It will continue because of the strength of the economy, amongst other issues - the year-on-year uninterrupted growth that we have had. The 30-year low in unemployment will continue to put significant demands on skills. So this plan for the future not only includes a raft of initiatives to give us the capacity to train more people but also, very importantly, is about elevating the status of technical training so that people can be justly proud to pursue a career in a trade. Elevating the status of technical training is necessary because Labor - those opposite - have spent more than 20 years telling parents that unless their children go onto a university education they have failed them. - Young people must be encouraged to follow their strengths. We want a nation where a good technical qualification is as prized as a university degree. The 25 technical colleges are an important initiative in, among other things, restoring the status of technical training in Australia. Not only will 2,000 young people this year directly benefit, and 7,500 by 2009, but these Australian technical colleges will stand as a wonderful symbol in local communities of the importance of a technical career. The government has a plan to address skills shortages and keep the economy strong. Labor's plan is to hand the technical colleges back to the unions.</DOC>

I can also confirm that this premium averages about $3. - Let me tell her that the average is about $3. -  - I point out for the benefit of the rather inexperienced shadow minister for health that under the rules, which she should know, there is always a clinically appropriate drug available at the co-payment price. Finally, I point out to her that, under the PBS reforms that the government announced late last year, pharmacists will receive an additional and higher dispensing fee for dispensing drugs without a premium, and that should substantially address this issue.</DOC>

 - I am aware of this allegation. It was contained in a document prepared by the management team of the Murray-Darling Basin Commission and sent to partner governments in the current commission arrangement. After it appeared in the papers this morning, it was trumpeted by the member for Grayndler, the member for Lilley and the member for Melbourne. If that was the trumpeting, and that is the history, I can inform the House that the allegation is completely incorrect. I can also inform the House that this has been acknowledged by the Murray-Darling Basin Commission, which, shortly before question time, issued a statement saying:This document contains - referring to the document issued last night - a statement that 'the available budget for a new Commission will be decreased by approximately $900 million over 10 years'. I am now aware that this statement is incorrect.That has been issued under the name of Wendy Craik, the chief executive of the Murray-Darling Basin Commission.This little incident illustrates the two faces of the Leader of the Opposition. When I announced my plan, the Leader of the Opposition said, 'I want to take politics out of water.' He said: 'I want to end the blame game. I want to cooperate with the Prime Minister.' - He was saying that, and all the while he has his three amigos endeavouring at every turn to undermine the plan. It would have been quite easy - if the Leader of the Opposition or any of his frontbench had wanted to know whether the claim made in that document was correct, all they needed to do was ring up my office or ring up my department and they could have been told. But no, it is rather like what happened last week with Work Choices. There you had the Leader of the Opposition soft selling it to the business community, but the next morning the Deputy Leader of the Opposition brought him into line.The truth is that the Leader of the Opposition has played a double game on this water issue. He has pretended that he is bipartisan and that he is above politics, but at the first opportune moment he has got his colleagues out there saying there is a funding hole, that there is no bottom line, that the document lacks integrity. This visionary plan - which I believe is the greatest single attempt by any national government to solve the problem of the Murray-Darling Basin - will provide $10 billion of entirely new money over and above -  - the financial provision the Commonwealth now makes. I look forward to my meeting at four o'clock this afternoon with the premiers of the Murray-Darling Basin Commission states and also the premiers of Western Australia and Tasmania, who are likewise attending this meeting. This is an historic opportunity to do something of a lasting and permanent character to solve the problem of the Murray-Darling Basin, and all the opposition has been able to do is engage in cheap opportunism. I table the statement from Wendy Craik of the Murray-Darling Basin Commission.</DOC>

 - The Leader of the Opposition did write to me. I wrote back to him, thanked him for his letter and drew his attention to the fact that we would be having a meeting this afternoon. I said that, following that meeting, I am willing to provide additional briefings on the outcomes of the meeting. I said that the essential information is already on the public record. I attached a copy of my speech, the detailed explanatory material and copies of my letters to the premiers and the chief ministers. Crucially, in the last paragraph I said, 'In the meantime, should you seek additional information, please contact my office.'I would have thought a prudent Leader of the Opposition or a prudent shadow Treasurer or finance spokesman or water spokesman, in picking up that Murray-Darling Basin Commission document this morning and seeing an allegation of a $900 million hole, might have said: 'Hang on, this mightn't be right. Maybe the sensible thing to do is to ring up Howard's office.' But, oh no! They fell over themselves. They raced to the doors and said: 'Aha! We have a black hole.' They know a lot about black holes. The reality is that the opposition has played politics on this issue, despite the fact that the Leader of the Opposition pretended when I first made my announcement.I conclude by making the observation that the reason the Commonwealth is able to offer $10 billion in an historic effort to resolve this issue is that we have run a strong economy. If our budget had been in deficit, if we had not got rid of Labor's debt and if we had not run a strong economy, this nation would not be able to afford to fix the Murray-Darling Basin. So the starting point for all of these things is prudent economic management in the hands of experienced economic managers such as the Treasurer, my colleague and Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party. It is through the quality of his management, above all else, that we have been able to steer this country into a situation where we can afford to fix these issues. All the Leader of the Opposition and his cohorts can do is play politics with the water crisis facing Australia.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Stirling for his question. I think all members of the House will be pleased to know that in January unemployment fell to 4.5 per cent on a national basis. That is the lowest unemployment rate in Australia in 31 years. It contrasts, for example, with the electorate of Stirling, which back in 1996, the member would recall, had an unemployment rate of 9.4 per cent. That is around double the 4.5 per cent we are currently experiencing. Full-time employment went up, part-time employment went down and, overall, unemployment went down.It is important to note that the unemployment rate in Australia has now been below five per cent for nine months, and five per cent was once considered to be full employment in this country. Importantly, 300,000 new jobs were created in Australia in the last year. Of course, the bulk of that period was after the introduction of the government's Work Choices industrial relations changes. We were told that changes to industrial relations would destroy people's jobs and livelihoods. Yet, over the period of the year that the Work Choices legislation was introduced, we have seen 300,000 new jobs created in Australia. Since the government was elected in 1996, two million new jobs have been created in this country. Two million of our fellow Australians have been able to find work during the period of economic management by this government.I want to compare a 4.5 per cent unemployment rate with the unemployment rate in Queensland between 1991 and 1995. I think the House is going to hear a lot about the years between 1991 and 1995 in Queensland, because that is the period when there was a staffer in the Goss government who, we are told, ran everything. During the period 1991 to 1995, unemployment in the state of Queensland averaged 9.5 per cent. Undoubtedly we will hear during the course of debate: 'What could one expect from somebody who was merely a staffer in the state government? We could not expect a staffer in the state government to be responsible for unemployment.' But when it suits the Leader of the Opposition, and when he wants to establish his credentials on experience, he portrays his position as a staffer in the state government as one of enormous power, of significant influence - in fact, enough to qualify him for the prime ministership of the country.When it does not suit him to be held accountable for his record and he does not want to emphasise his experience, the position and its influence are demoted to being merely that of a staffer in a state government. You cannot have it both ways: either he has no experience and no record or he has experience and responsibility. It is up to him to choose which one of those two he is going to emphasise. If he claims to have experience he has a record, and his record is one of high unemployment.</DOC>

 - The Commonwealth's offer of $10 billion is new money - that is, it is additional to all of the money which the Commonwealth had previously committed in relation to the National Water Initiative and in relation to the Murray-Darling Basin Commission, and it is in addition to the top-up which I announced in last year's budget. If the states hand over management of the Murray-Darling Basin Commission - get a load of this - there will be a significant saving, a huge saving. If the Labor states hand over to the Commonwealth, they will save money. They will take money which they otherwise would have been required to put into the Murray-Darling Basin Commission. They will save it because they will not be putting it in. There are the bona fides of the Commonwealth.If you talk about looking a gift-horse in the mouth: is any state premier seriously going to have us believe that you can manage an interstate waterway better by having four separate governments with competing aims and objectives, and would any state premier seriously say that they will reject an offer to get a significant new injection of $10 billion, which does not actually cost them and which will produce savings? If the states want to maintain their expenditures in relation to the Murray-Darling Basin Commission, in addition to the Commonwealth's $10 billion, I am sure that we would accept that as well. From a party that is interested in water and climate change, maybe that offer will be made this afternoon by the state governments concerned. We will be watching very closely in relation to that.I come back to this point, which I made on radio this morning: is this investment something that has just become apparent now? No. This investment has been something that most people who have thought about it would have thought should have been done over the years - maybe even years ago. Why wasn't it done at Federation? Why wasn't it done at the time of the Second World War? Why was it not done in the sixties? - Why wasn't it done in the seventies? I will tell you why. The Commonwealth government never had the wherewithal to put $10 billion into the Murray-Darling Basin Commission. When we were carrying $96 billion of federal debt, we were spending nearly $10 billion a year in interest payments. Now that we have got rid of that, we have the capacity to invest in this infrastructure. This would not have been possible without economic management. Let me say that, whatever your objectives in relation to climate change, in relation to water and in relation to social objectives, you will not have the wherewithal to pay for them without economic management in this country, and that is what this government stands for.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Mallee for his question. Obviously, as has been pointed out this week, the value of irrigated agriculture in Australia is significant - about $9 billion worth of production. That production feeds and clothes some 60 million people both in Australia and in export markets overseas. What has been identified - and the member for Mallee as a practising engineer would understand the technical detail of this - is that up to 30 per cent of the water that is diverted through irrigation out of Australia's river systems is lost due to poor infrastructure, through absorption and through transpiration and the like. What we are proposing to do with the $10 billion package that has been put forward is address that very issue.The notion of being able to create more from the water we already have, without another drop of rain falling, is not necessarily a new or revolutionary idea. It has been around for a while. Some of the comments that have been made following the Prime Minister's announcement of our water plan bear this out. One of those comments was made by Col Thomson from the New South Wales Irrigators Council. He said:This package is bold and breathtaking in its scope and intent. The core issues raised by the Prime Minister are not new to New South Wales Irrigators members, nor are the proposed solutions any different to what has been identified and in many areas already put into practice.The difference between the circumstances now and those in times gone by is exactly what the Treasurer pointed out: the ability of the Commonwealth to pay for what is needed to be done.We, as a government, have a record on this in recent years. In relation to the question asked by the member for Mallee, last year we invested $167 million in the Wimmera-Mallee pipeline to save billions of litres of water in that area. Just for the stock and domestic circumstance, 103 billion litres will be saved in the Wimmera-Mallee pipeline system by removing 85 per cent of the waste from seepage and evaporation.Earlier than that, back in about 1999, along with the South Australian state government and irrigators, we invested about $15 million in the Loxton irrigation system, where we secured that entire irrigation system into pipes. It addressed a drastic circumstance, and we saved almost 4.8 billion litres in that Loxton irrigation system in the member for Barker's electorate. It was in 1999 that we invested that. Last year, we invested in the Wimmera-Mallee pipeline. This year, we have put on the table $10 billion to save 3,600 billion litres of water coming out of the system and to put it back into the system, with 50 per cent of that becoming available for industry, for irrigators.We have consistently identified the ability to save water through investment in infrastructure, and that is exactly what we are doing in this circumstance. The Prime Minister is going to meet with the premiers of the relevant states this afternoon. We urge them to come on board with this plan. This is a bold and breathtaking plan. As Col Thomson said, it is bold and breathtaking in its scope and its intent. Its intent is to fix up a problem that has been identified and that has existed for many, many years. Where we are able to look after the interests of both industry and the broader environment as far as the watering system in those rivers is concerned, it should be done.The last point I want to make and to continue to reinforce is that the reason we can do this is that we can do it without having to borrow any money. We can do it because of the good economic management that has been practised in this country over the last 10 or 11 years. That is why it has never been able to be done before, and that is why it can be done now. That should be clearly recognised.</DOC>

 - Thank you, Mr Speaker; I relish the opportunity to answer this question, and I thank the honourable member. I would suggest that the extract that the honourable member has presented to the House is incomplete or, at worst, inaccurate. The Minister for the Environment and Water Resources made it very clear that overallocation funding is largely and as entirely as possible for structural adjustment. That aspect of the package starts and finishes with assisting irrigators, whether it is with relocation or the like.There is an element, of course, in regard to the purchase of water allocations, but it will be done on the basis of structural adjustment. It allows me to say that it may very well be with regard to the configuration of irrigation systems. You might retire non-viable areas and the like with the support of farmers. And irrigators have welcomed this. The honourable member is trying to make a political point - unsuccessfully - when irrigators themselves have expressed support for the package. After all, the implications for irrigators are overwhelmingly positive, and that is how they have seen it. The cornerstone of the plan is a commitment of $6 billion to modernise irrigation infrastructure off farms, $3 billion on farms -  - The member for Grayndler interrupted me when I was outlining the benefits of the package to irrigators, not political point-scoring. There is $6 billion for off-farm efficiency, $1½ billion for on-farm efficiency and $3 billion to tackle overallocation. And the irrigators deeply appreciate all aspects of the package, especially the fact that 50 per cent of the efficiency savings will be returned to them.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Bonner for his question. I can inform the House that business prospects have picked up. The National Australia Bank's last quarterly business survey for December shows that expectations for the March quarter rose, with the index rising two points to 21 points. Businesses also upgraded expectations for the year ahead, with the index up five points to 32 index points. We are going through a very difficult drought at the moment, and that is depressing some areas of the Australian economy.Notwithstanding that, the Australian economy is on a firm footing. In the year of our ninth surplus budget, we have repaid $96 billion of the Labor debt. We are funding future liabilities which were never funded by the Commonwealth before. We have a monetary policy which is locking in inflation of between two per cent and three per cent. We have unemployment at 4.5 per cent. We have had 300,000 new jobs in the last year and we have had two million new jobs over the last 10 years.The Leader of the Opposition says that all of this represents free market fundamentalism, and he describes this economy as 'Howard's Brutopia'. If he wants to sweep away Howard's Brutopia, he obviously has some kind of different economic policy in mind. There has been some speculation as to what a brutopia is. I can now authoritatively inform the House that Brutopia is a fictional country which appears in several Donald Duck stories:Brutopia is a ... hostile country, aiming for world domination. - This is the analysis that the Leader of the Opposition gives of the Australian economy - that it is a brutopia. Brutopia is a fictional country, in a Donald Duck magazine, aiming for world domination and trying to devastate the American economy. When you ask where he draws his inspiration for his quack economic policy, you find that it comes from a Donald Duck magazine. - Labor is drawing inspiration for its economic analysis from a Donald Duck magazine. This is the evolutionary cycle of the Labor Party. We have moved from Mark Latham's roosters to Kevin Rudd's ducks. -  - Managing the Australian economy, which is a $1 trillion economy, takes experience and commitment - and you do not get your analysis from Donald Duck comics. It is much more serious than that. That is why only a coalition government can manage the Australian economy.</DOC>

The benefits of the water package are well known. Irrigators are supporting it; they know what is in it for them. They know that this is a historic effort by the Commonwealth government to support their industries and to give them a more secure, sustainable future. We will be consulting with the rural industries. Irrigators in rural communities are the starting point of this package, as well as water efficiencies and returning water to the environment.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Grey for that question. I am sure that he, along with many other residents of South Australia, would have been alarmed to read the front page of the Adelaide Advertiser this morning, which was emblazoned with this headline: 'Labor split over mine'. It referred to what has been labelled by the Premier of South Australia as the bedrock of that state's economic future, namely the further development of the Olympic Dam uranium mine. The article in the Advertiser was referring to the comments of the shadow minister for the environment, the member for Kingsford Smith, who expressed his grave concern about the possible expansion of the mine. He went on to say a few other things about the environment policies of the Labor Party that I will come to.This represents the latest example of the great danger in this environment debate, and that is that ideology is going to be put ahead of jobs. In responding to the challenge of climate change, we need a measured, sensible approach. We need an approach that tackles the problem of greenhouse gas emissions, and that is why we need to keep the nuclear option on the table. As the Chief Scientist has said, it is part of the solution to the climate change problem. It is part of the way of tackling greenhouse gas emissions. In the process of dealing with climate change, we have got to do it in a way that does not threaten the job security of Australians. We do not want thousands of coalminers thrown out of work, and we do not want thousands of people denied an opportunity of employment in the development of the uranium mines of South Australia. That is one of the reasons why we have been aghast that it has taken the Labor Party so long to get around to considering a change in relation to the mining of uranium in this country.What we heard from the shadow minister for the environment was a classic example of how many on the front bench of the Labor Party will put ideology in front of jobs. This government will never put ideology in front of jobs. We will embrace all solutions that go to strengthen the capacity of the Australian economy to continue to expand. I say to the people of South Australia: if you want a guaranteed expansion of the Olympic Dam mine and you want to preserve that great industry in your state, for heaven's sake, don't vote Labor, because it would be at real risk.But that was only the half of it. In that same interview with the Adelaide Advertiser, the shadow minister called for a substantial increase in the mandatory renewable energy target. There is nothing new about that. The Labor Party have argued in favour of that for a long time. We do not necessarily share that view, but I acknowledge that it has been their policy for a long time. But it has also been their policy for a long time to have a national emissions trading system. You can argue for that, and many people in the community do argue that, but the shadow minister went out on his own on this occasion and apparently ignored the views of the member for Batman and the member for Hunter, both of whom have said that, if you have a national emissions trading system, you should close down renewable energy target programs. In other words, there is a real conflict.The shadow minister wants to expand MRET - and there will be people who will consider that that is a good idea and many people who will think it puts an unreasonable cost burden on industry - but he also wants to have a national emissions trading system and to move ahead of anything that might be developed internationally. But his two frontbench colleagues, the member for Batman and the member for Hunter, say that, if you have a national emissions trading system, that is incompatible with the maintenance of both state trading systems in emissions and a renewable energy target. All of this is very interesting, and I continue to look forward with great anticipation to further interviews being given by the member for Kingsford Smith.</DOC>

 - I have seen that statement made by Mr Maher, and it has long been my view that leaders do not necessarily speak for workers. I find this fascinating - the automaticity! He was meant to be different. But the Labor Party instinctively thinks: 'Workers equals unions, equals union bosses, and when union bosses speak, they speak for workers.' I have news for the Leader of the Opposition: for the last 10 years a lot of coalminers have voted for us.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kalgoorlie for his question and note that unemployment in his electorate is now 3.4 per cent. In Western Australia today the unemployment rate is three per cent. It can be no accident that there are 54,000 Australian workplace agreements signed under Work Choices in Western Australia. In fact, the take-up in Western Australia of AWAs has been three times the national average.A little earlier, the Prime Minister was saying that union leaders do not necessarily speak for the workers. I will tell you what speaks for the workers: jobs - job creation; meaningful jobs; well-paid jobs. There is no doubt that, since the introduction of Work Choices, we have seen a rapid surge in the creation of jobs in Australia. More than 240,000 new jobs have been created since Work Choices was introduced and over 83 per cent of those jobs are full-time. That makes a lie of the comments by Bill Shorten that Work Choices would be 'a green light for mass sackings'. How wrong he was! In fact, it has been a green light for the creation of new jobs.The member for Brand said that it was going to be easier to sack people - when, in fact, it has actually been easier to employ people. That is because when you remove the unfair dismissal laws - the Labor Party's job-destroying unfair dismissal laws - business creates jobs and small business, in particular, has the courage to go out and take the risk of employing someone and putting them in a meaningful and well-paid job. The Labor Party has continued to claim, even after Work Choices was introduced, that these are not real jobs. In a debate with me only a few months ago at the University of Sydney, Bill Shorten said, 'They're not the sorts of jobs which parents wish for their kids.' That was Bill Shorten. He is coming in next parliament. We look forward to that!The fundamental point is that Work Choices is part of the equation that helps to create jobs that are meaningful and real to Australian workers. It is part of the equation of a strong economy. It is part of the equation of making sure the budget is in surplus. It is about having the courage to make tough decisions that help to make the Australian economy stronger. I know the Leader of the Opposition has his training wheels on, but he has to have the courage to face up to the unions and tell them that they will not dictate workplace relations in a Labor government. The Labor Party has said that it will rip up Work Choices and that the unions are going to be back in town. I say to the Leader of the Opposition and the Labor Party: focus on creating jobs - like the coalition creates jobs; focus on the wages of the workers; and focus not only on the jobs of today but also on the jobs of tomorrow.</DOC>

 - If the member for Gellibrand had a policy, rather than shrieking across the table, she would certainly be doing better about establishing her credibility. - I know how important this is to the member for Macquarie, because 75,000 people in his electorate have private health insurance, and they are relying on the Howard government to keep it affordable for them. Thanks to the policies of the Howard government, some nine million Australians now have the security and choice that come with private health cover. This is nearly three million more than under the Keating government, and it includes one million people earning less than $20,000 a year. All of these people have the potential to avoid state Labor's public hospital waiting list.Yesterday, the member for Gellibrand said that costs might rise under the government's planned changes to health insurance legislation. Let me say that Labor are the past masters of premium increases. In 1987, premiums went up 19 per cent under Labor. In 1992, premiums went up 17 per cent under Labor. On average, under Labor, premiums increased by 11 per cent every year compared with just 5.6 per cent since 1996. Let us make it very clear: the member for Gellibrand is not trying to improve private health insurance; she is trying to sabotage it. She once told this parliament that the government should stop 'pouring enormous amounts of money into private health insurance cover and instead put that money into public facilities'. We are in the mood, it seems, opposite, to repudiate statements, and I ask the member for Gellibrand: will she now repudiate that previous statement of hers? Indeed, I say to the Leader of the Opposition: on the subject of private health insurance, as on so many other topics, will the real Kevin Rudd please stand up? Does he still think, as he once told this parliament, that private health insurance is about the Americanisation of our health system? One day he was a mere staffer; the next day he is the de facto Premier of Queensland. One day he is the philosopher prince of Labor; the next minute, he reads comics for his inspiration. - I am asking the Leader of the Opposition to resolve where he really stands on private health insurance. One day he is not a socialist and he never ever has been and, the next day, he has been a Christian socialist since Keir Hardy's time. When will this enigma -  - One minute he thinks that the coalition has tried to commandeer God; the next minute he thinks that Jesus is standing for a Labor Party seat. When will this enigma finally resolve itself? - I certainly will, Mr Speaker. Let me just say to the Leader of the Opposition: trying to be all things to everyone will not work. On private health insurance, as on so many other topics, he needs to come clean and say what he really believes. If he does not have a clear position on private health insurance, he does not have any credibility in his bid to lead this nation.</DOC>

 - I wish to correct a couple of facts in the member for New England's question: it was indeed on the Saturday of the country music festival - and it was a very good festival - which was after the Prime Minister's speech, which was delivered on the day before Australia Day. I will reflect on the assertions that the member has made. My recollection of my comments is that some proposals had been put forward by a number of local community members - and the issue was raised with me by the Mayor of Tamworth - with regard to concerns about Chaffey Dam and how that could be improved in terms of securing water for not just the city of Tamworth but also downstream irrigators in the Peel River system, and, given that that system flows down into the Murray-Darling Basin, the ongoing effects of the basin. I made the comment that I thought at least local people were starting to exercise a bit of lateral thought about how they could deal with the crisis that is upon them at the moment - as is besetting many irrigators and communities right throughout the Murray-Darling Basin system - as our government would exercise broad lateral thinking in our responses.I indicated that they should put forward these proposals to us so that we can have a look at them - as I am aware that the Premier of New South Wales did at the time that he was there - as we move forward in this process. Again, I remind the member for New England that for the first time in this nation's history we have put down a proposal to do something constructive about a serious problem right throughout the Murray-Darling Basin system.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Bass for his question and for arranging an opportunity to visit his electorate in December, where I met with a number of parents and teachers at schools. These parents reinforced the view that I am hearing across the country - that is, parents are not receiving enough information about what is going on in their schools. They want to know what is happening and how those schools are performing. State governments already collect a wealth of data about individual schools, yet they are keeping it secret not only from parents but from students, teachers and the public. Parents in particular are demanding the right to know how their schools are performing so they can judge whether this is the right school for their child. They want to know.Back in 2005, the Australian government had to force state governments to allow parents access to limited information. This year for the first time the state governments have to allow schools to tell parents this limited detail, this limited information about schools. It is like pulling teeth. The Australian government believes that all schools should have all information available to the public.Parents want to be able to make an informed choice. They want comparative data. They want to know the qualifications of teachers in schools. They want to know the turnover of staff in schools. They want to know the attendance and retention rates in their schools. They want to know the suspension and expulsion rates in schools, and they particularly want to know the academic scores in schools, the test results and how they have improved or not over time. They want the feedback data that is available on parent, student and teacher levels of satisfaction. This is important information.The state governments must also come clean on how each school is being funded. Some government schools are very clearly well resourced and funded, and some government schools in the same area, often right next door, are clearly underfunded and underresourced. The member for Bass and I saw this on our visit to Bass, where schools next door to each other had inexplicably different levels of funding. Parents need to know whether their school is getting a fair share of public funding.Labor are all over the shop on this. They are trying to have it both ways. They talk about reforms and revolutions, but every time they take one step forward they take three steps back, because the unions jump in and pull them into line. - And why are they doing this?The member for Blaxland then left the chamber. - The member for Perth knows that parents deserve this information, and he should join with us in calling on state governments to provide this information. But the unions will resist it every step of the way. Why is that? Because they know that once parents have this information, once the public knows, it will reveal that there are good teachers and good schools, and some teachers and some schools that need to improve. The Australian government is going to ensure that we lift standards in all our schools so all children in Australia have the opportunity to access a quality education.</DOC>

 - I think there is some connection. I think the degree of it is a matter of debate and the jury is out on the degree to which there is that connection. It is fair to say that most Australians believe that we have had drought for a very long time. Common sense tells you that the variability of rainfall across this country has been with us for a long time. Every drought eventually ends.The important thing is to tackle the great challenge this country has. Rather than having a theoretical debate, you actually need to tackle the practical aspects of drought. That is what we are doing. This afternoon is a historic opportunity. It is a moment in the history of this country: the coming together of federal and state governments to do something lasting about water security. The plan I have put forward contains two fundamental propositions. The first proposition is that we should conserve the water that is now lost through seepage and evaporation by lining the channels and piping the irrigation systems of this country. It is estimated that up to 30 per cent - or more in certain areas - is lost through seepage and evaporation. That is the first great element of the plan.The second great element of the plan is to deal with the problem of overallocation. This is not theoretical. This is not, to use a word beloved of the member for Kingsford Smith, 'hypothetical'. When he was asked about the impact of his climate change policy on employment in Australia he said, 'That's hypothetical.' I do not think I would get very far in answering a question like that by saying it was hypothetical. Losing your job is not hypothetical. Fixing the water problems of this country is not hypothetical.This afternoon it lies within the capacity of the Prime Minister of this country and the premiers of the Murray-Darling Basin states to strike a blow for the water security of this nation for generations ahead. This is a great opportunity, because what we have put forward is money made available courtesy of the strength of our national economy. It is over and above what has been offered before. I guarantee all the other programs, and this money is on top of those other programs. All we ask is for a governance arrangement that will end the absurd competition between the states of Australia that has bedevilled the Murray-Darling Basin governance over the last decade. This is an opportunity that must not be passed up. It must not fall victim to any kind of obfuscation and delay. I believe that the people I will talk to this afternoon will come in good faith. I have found on numerous occasions a capacity to deal across the political divide with the premiers, all of whom are Labor. They rise to the occasion. They have risen to the occasion on other issues; the nation wants them to do so on water.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for McMillan for his question and for his strong interest in preserving jobs in the coal and power industry in the regions around him and particularly those of the workers he represents in the seat of McMillan. I stand shoulder to shoulder with you to preserve their jobs. Those on this side of the House have long recognised that there is no one silver bullet solution to lowering greenhouse gas emissions. That is why we are investing in a portfolio of practical measures that respond directly to climate change challenges -  - without sacrificing the competitive advantage on which our economy in Australia is built. These are measures like the $100 million Renewable Energy Development Initiative, known as REDI; our $75 million Solar Cities initiative; and our $500 million Low Emissions Technology Demonstration Fund, which saw $50 million allocated to a power station in the minister for agriculture's electorate, close to the member for McMillan's electorate, to help the power industry in that region lower its emissions and maintain its electricity output. These programs were all defined in this white paper I am holding, which the Prime Minister released in June 2004. The Leader of the Opposition might like to read it.These are practical measures that bring a range of low-emission technologies into our energy mix, whether they be clean coal or renewable. The white paper does mention nuclear power. As we know, since that paper was released we have progressed to a point where we need to consider nuclear power. This is about not putting all our eggs in one technology basket.In response to the recent report of the Energy Supply Association, can I say that they have demonstrated in their report why this is so important. They say in their report that the narrower the range of energy technologies used the greater the cost will be to achieve emissions cuts. The report forecasts a 65 per cent increase in electricity demand by 2030. The report also says that meeting that demand while cutting emissions will cost billions. The report goes on to say that if nuclear energy is excluded from the mix it will cost billions more. It just goes to show how serious and credible climate change responses require all possible options to be considered, including nuclear.We know that the members for Hunter and Batman -  
A government member - And the member for Grayndler - have different views from those of the member for Kingsford Smith - and, yes, so does the member for Grayndler. They even have different views on uranium - and some of them do not mind if that costs jobs, as we heard from the Prime Minister. The Labor Party cannot face -  - the hard political decision because they are split on the issue. The Howard government has a record of making hard decisions -  -  - to ensure the future of Australia's economy and Australia's energy security.</DOC>

 - I would like to thank the member for Hinkler for his question and at the same time warmly congratulate the community and the industry in his part of the world, in Northern Queensland, for the way they have so enthusiastically embraced the technical colleges in Gladstone and Townsville. The people in Northern Queensland have really got behind this initiative, because they understand very clearly the importance of these colleges to maintain the very high growth and the jobs that are so much a part of that region. Already this week we have seen some hundreds of students start at those two colleges, taking up building and construction, electrotechnology, commercial cooking, automotive metals and engineering. The reaction in Northern Queensland is mirrored across Australia. - I would like to give a couple of impressions from students who began this week in colleges in different parts of Australia. Louise Brown, who started this week at the Illawarra technical college, said in the Illawarra Mercury this week: 'I think it's a great opportunity for education and also a trade in electrical. I'll have an advantage with the HSC and a trade. It will be difficult, but I'll really try to do well and strive for high achievements.' Aspiring electrician Nick Habibeh, who is attending the Western Sydney technical college, said this week in the Blacktown City Sun, 'The college will give me more opportunities and will also shorten my apprenticeship.' Cherie Martin, whose son Ryan is attending the northern Adelaide technical college - he hopes to become a sparky like his dad by studying electrotechnology - said this week in the Adelaide Advertiser, 'It's absolutely brilliant because all the subjects are relevant to the workplace.' - These 20 colleges - which have gone from an idea to reality in just under 15 months, a remarkable achievement - have struck a chord across Australia amongst the community, industry and students. - They will deliver many thousands of highly qualified tradesmen and tradeswomen in the years ahead. Just as importantly, they will build on the hopes and self-esteem of many thousands of young Australians.</DOC>

 - I do not retract the statements that I made yesterday, and let me say the reference to the Democrats was in the context of Senator Obama being the candidate. Let me make that very clear. My starting point on this matter is that an American defeat in Iraq would be a catastrophe for the West, and an American withdrawal from Iraq anytime in the next 12 or 18 months, which is effectively what is being advocated by a number of people and effectively, by definition, because he wants to pull our forces out in that time, by the Leader of the Opposition. If you think that the consequence of that withdrawal is a figment of my imagination, can I read to you an extract from the latest national intelligence assessment, which was issued late in January of this year. The coverage of it has largely surrounded its references to whether or not there is a civil war, but what has not been covered is the following:If Coalition forces were withdrawn rapidly during the term of this Estimate - and the term of the estimate, as the Leader of the Opposition knows, is 12 to 18 months from January 2007 - we judge that this almost certainly would lead to a significant increase in the scale and scope of sectarian conflict in Iraq, intensify Sunni resistance to the Iraqi Government, and have adverse consequences for national reconciliation.It then goes on to say:If such a rapid withdrawal were to take place - and that is what is being advocated by many people, not only in the United States but also here in Australia, including by the Leader of the Opposition - we judge that the (Iraqi Security Force) would be unlikely to survive as a non-sectarian national institution; neighboring countries - invited by Iraqi factions or unilaterally - might intervene openly in the conflict; massive civilian casualties and forced population displacement would be probable; (al-Qaeda) would attempt to use parts of the country - particularly al-Anbar province - to plan increased attacks in and outside of Iraq; and spiraling violence and political disarray in Iraq, along with Kurdish moves to control Kirkuk and strengthen autonomy, could prompt Turkey to launch a military incursion.That is the latest American national intelligence assessment. I repeat that if the United States were to withdraw her combat units from Iraq by the early part of next year it could only be represented as a defeat for the United States in Iraq. I hold the strongest possible view that it is contrary to the security interests of this country for America to be defeated in Iraq. I know that the Americans are going through a difficult time in relation to Iraq; that is obvious. That is precisely the time when friends should be available to stick by you, when you are going through a difficult time.I notice that the Leader of the Opposition on 10 January said that, if he were elected, 'We would withdraw the Australian forces within a reasonable time frame so that we would not leave our American ally immediately in the lurch.' Immediately in the lurch, he says - in other words, he would leave them in the lurch but he would fudge it so it did not look as though it were immediate. I am amazed that the Leader of the Opposition and others on his front bench should criticise my criticism of remarks made by a candidate for the Democrat nomination. Apparently it is in order for any number of people in the Labor Party to regularly attack George Bush, to regularly attack the American administration. That is okay, but dare anybody criticise somebody who might agree with them on Iraq and then somehow or other I am interfering in the domestic politics of the United States. Let me make it perfectly clear: if I hear a policy being advocated that is contrary to Australia's security interests I will criticise it.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Cook for his question. Can I say in reply that, as a community, as we debate ways of responding effectively to climate change we must do it in a calm, balanced and practical fashion. We must not be panicked into adopting measures that are going to damage Australia's economy and destroy Australian jobs. Already a number of dangerous proposals have emerged, and the chief amongst those of course is the proposal of the Leader of the Australian Greens, Senator Brown, that we should phase out coal exports from this country.This is a prime example of what happens when you get knee-jerk as opposed to measured, calm, balanced and responsible responses to climate change issues. I might also mention in the context of the future of the coal industry that it is worth reminding the House that the Labor Party's shadow minister in the environment area, the member for Kingsford Smith, has said that an expanding coal industry is a thing of the past. Bob Brown says you ought to phase it out, and the member for Kingsford Smith, the shadow minister for the environment, says that it is a thing of the past. And we all know who is furiously trying to get Greens preferences in the state of Queensland - none other than the Leader of the Opposition.Let me point out to the House that Australia is the largest coal exporter in the world. Those exports are worth $24 billion to the Australian economy every year by way of exports. The coal industry employs thousands of Australians and is pivotal, crucial and central to the livelihood of many communities around Australia. Let me simply say that to close down coal exports would do great injury to Australia, cost thousands of Australians their jobs and visit enormous hardship on many regional communities. I have seen in recent years regional communities threatened through the adoption of misguided policies or understandings of policies urged upon major parties by the Australian Greens. I saw it in Tasmania in 2004. - When it came to the forestry industry this government struck the balance between the environment and job security. Let me promise the coalminers of Australia that we will do the same with climate change. We will strike a balance between the interests of dealing with climate change and the preservation of Australian jobs. We have no intention of sacrificing the livelihoods of coalminers, their families or their communities with unfair, short-sighted, knee-jerk responses to the challenge of climate change.</DOC>

 - I can answer by referring to numerous occasions when the current President of the United States has been attacked personally by members who sit opposite, and then in their next breath they have said that some of their best friends are Republicans. I was not generically attacking the Democrats but, the last time I checked, Senator Obama was a member of the Democratic Party of the United States. I say to those who sit opposite: apparently it is all right for those who sit opposite to attack the Bush administration; apparently it is all right for the Leader of the Opposition to hold out to the Australian public that he would serve as foreign minister under a Labor Prime Minister in Mark Latham, who attacked not only George Bush's policies on Iraq but also his character and his competence. When the Leader of the Opposition was asked in February 2003 whether he agreed with what Mark Latham had to say, he said, 'It was an exercise in free speech.' Yet this morning on national television the Leader of the Opposition said, 'I had a little word to him privately to let him know what I really thought.' That is not good enough - what is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander. The reality is that the Labor Party and the Leader of the Opposition are being two-faced on this issue. It is all right to attack Bush and when it suits you the Republicans, but, if I say anything critical of somebody on the other side of politics, I am interfering in American domestic politics. I am doing nothing of the kind and I do not retract anything I have said.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Braddon for his question. I can inform the House that the Reserve Bank released its latest quarterly statement on the conduct of monetary policy today, noting that inflationary pressures, which may have been picking up in the first half of last year, seem to have been now contained and indicating that it now expects underlying inflation, currently around three per cent, to fall to 2¾ per cent in 2007-08. The Reserve Bank notes that this reflects:... both the evidence that underlying inflationary pressures in the second half of 2006 were somewhat weaker than in the first half, and the likelihood that recent falls in world oil prices will result in some dampening effect on cost pressures and inflation expectations.That is good news because that says - and this is what I said to the House last week - that rather than inflationary pressures picking up it now appears inflationary pressures are coming down. Whereas we had an inflation rate of about 0.8 per cent in some of the quarters in the first half of last year, in quarterly terms the underlying inflation rate is closer to 0.5 per cent. That shows that expectations are well within the target band which the government has set by an agreement with the Reserve Bank of two to three per cent.We are not out of the woods yet, because with an exceptionally cold northern winter it is possible that more pressure will come back on oil prices. This will take quite a lot of managing. In addition to that, because commodity prices are high and because unemployment is low there are risks that you could have unsustainable wage increases. That will also take quite a deal of management.I mention in passing that one of the things that makes it easier to handle high commodity prices this time around than in other periods, such as the mid-seventies, is that we do not have centralised wage fixation. If we had a system of centralised wage fixation, which took wage settlements from profitable areas of the Australian economy and brought them back and spread them uniformly across the whole economy, then we would have the kind of inflationary breakouts that we have seen in previous mining booms.The good thing, of course, is that we have changed the industrial relations system. It would not be possible if we had not done that. Those of us on this side of the House who supported that industrial relations system know just how important that is for Australia's future. Nothing could be more wanton and reckless than a proposal at a time like this to take industrial relations back to where they were when they let Australia down in the seventies and eighties. That is why we need the Work Choices legislation to handle a very difficult economy at a time like this.The Leader of the Opposition would have you believe that his economic policy is our economic policy. It was on the TV on the weekend: everything that we have done he wants to do. I suppose that imitation is the greatest form of flattery and we ought to accept it, but I remind the House that, when all the heavy lifting was being done and all of the policy was being put in place, the Leader of the Opposition was voting against all of those measures. He says that he now supports an independent Reserve Bank with an inflation target. Labor opposed it. Labor said that it was illegal. Labor promised to sue me for putting it in place. They now say that they are in favour of balanced budgets, but they voted against balanced budgets and said it would take the economy into recession. They now say they are in favour of reducing government debt, but they did everything they could to stop us wiping out $96 billion of Commonwealth debt. They will now have you believe they are in favour of the Future Fund, but they did nothing to set it up and they have promised to raid it.They will now have you believe that they are in favour of a more competitive tax system, but they voted against the GST and are in favour, therefore, of keeping FID and BAD tax and stamp duty on shares. They voted against all of those changes which this government put in place, and, of course, many of those tax cuts which the government introduced in 2000, 2003, 2004, 2005 and 2006 they also opposed. Labor opposed all of the hard work to get us to where we now are and they now want to take credit. It is not believable, and the public of Australia should not believe it.</DOC>

 - I think any statement by a leading political figure in Australia that expresses a concern about the consequences of a policy position for the security interests of this country is both legitimate and in the national interest. I remind the Leader of the Opposition that my starting point on this is that an American defeat in Iraq would be a catastrophe for the West. That is what is involved here, not his ego or my ego or the ego of George Bush or Barack Obama. What is involved here are the consequences for the West of an American defeat in Iraq. That is what we have to focus our minds on. -  - I heard somebody saying, 'Already it's happened.' I picked that up. Let me say it again and slowly so the Leader of the Opposition takes it in. It will be a catastrophe for the West if America is defeated in Iraq and, if America pulls out her combat brigades by March 2008, which is the gist of the Obama bill before the congress, that will be seen around the world as a defeat for the United States in Iraq. If you disbelieve me read that national intelligence assessment.Finally, in relation to the Democrats, I remind the Leader of the Opposition that in the years I have been Prime Minister I have worked very closely with both Democrat and Republican presidents. I would also remind the House that the first occasion as Prime Minister that I was responsible for sending Australian forces to the Iraq theatre was in fact in response to a request from the Democrat President Bill Clinton.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Maranoa for his question. He has an obvious interest in this issue, given that his electorate of Maranoa covers most of the Queensland section of the Murray-Darling Basin and Maranoa actually represents about six per cent of basin water use. So it is a critically important issue in south-western Queensland, particularly in the electorate of Maranoa.Last week I indicated that the value of irrigated agriculture to the Australian economy is $9 billion. It is critically important. So $9 billion worth of agricultural product is produced through irrigation - about 25 per cent of all agricultural production. Of course, that equals a lot of jobs. There are about 40,400 farm businesses that rely on irrigation: about one-third of all the farming enterprises or entities that exist in Australia rely on irrigation. Sixteen per cent of people employed in the Murray-Darling Basin are actually engaged in agriculture, compared with 4.6 per cent across the entire nation's workforce. So 16 per cent in the Murray-Darling Basin and 4.6 per cent nationally - that is the percentage of the workforce engaged in agriculture. Those statistics are critically important.The whole objective of our $10 billion water strategy or proposal is water security, and water security in these areas, these communities and these industries equals job security. Remember that, Mr Speaker: water security in the Murray-Darling Basin equals job security.A lot of work has already been done by industry through the initiatives of the former Deputy Prime Minister, John Anderson, and the National Water Initiative. We need to build on that hard work and the commitment that has been made. We recognise that, and it is terribly important in this debate today. We certainly intend to work very closely with industry and with irrigators.To that end, later on this week the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources and I are going to meet with a delegation from the National Farmers Federation and irrigator groups to work through some of the issues and to reconfirm to them that we recognise the hard work that has been done and the contribution they have made and that our objective is to save water and secure water for the future so we can secure jobs in the basin for the future. It is critically important that we recognise that. Our goals are to secure the futures of the farming families throughout that region and throughout regional Australia.The $10 billion plan that we have put forward is a bigger investment than the Snowy Mountains scheme. This is critically important to the nation. The basin runs across state borders; it needs to be seen as a national issue. That is the point the Prime Minister raised with the premiers last week. So we want to engage with industry and we want to engage with the state governments because this is about building a secure future in the Murray-Darling Basin system - because water security equals job security, and there is nothing more important in Australia today than job security.</DOC>

 - I have told the Leader of the Opposition in reply to other questions, and I am very happy to say it again, that the central issue here is the consequences of an American defeat in Iraq. If America is defeated in Iraq, the setback will be for the cause of the West not only in the Middle East but also in our part of the world. I remain critical of any policy espoused by any individual - and I was talking yesterday about an individual -  -  - that is going to encourage the view that the United States will pull out precipitately of Iraq. My criticism of the Leader of the Opposition is that if it is all right for Australia to leave precipitately - although he is now saying he will not leave our ally in the lurch immediately; he will still leave them in the lurch but he will not leave them in the lurch immediately - then why isn't it all right for the Americans, why isn't it all right for the British? That is what is at stake here. If it is all right for us to go, it is all right for them to go, and if we go precipitately then that is an unbelievable setback for the West. It is a setback for the Western cause in the Middle East, and it will give great encouragement and succour to the terrorists not only in that region but also in our part of the world. Now, that goes to our national interest and that is why I will not in any way resile from criticising statements that I believe are contrary to that national interest.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Dobell, who knows full well the importance of the coal industry to Australia. As the Prime Minister mentioned, the coal industry represents $24.3 billion worth of exports this year; one in eight of our export dollars comes from coal. We export to 38 countries and help fuel much of the economic expansion of Britain, Japan, China, India and a host of other countries in and near our region.It is important, in the context of the greenhouse debate, to note that Australia's coal is far cleaner and produces lower greenhouse gas emissions than, say, Chinese coal. The Australian government has been investing significantly, in partnership with the industry itself, in clean coal technologies to further lower emissions. Indeed, we have committed around half a billion dollars to clean coal technologies. In addition, our government has been working constructively with the industry to help upgrade the coal industry's infrastructure, including massive developments to get rid of some of the bottlenecks in the Hunter Valley rail network. The Deputy Prime Minister recently opened the Sandgate rail flyover, which is part of a $380 million investment to lift the capacity of the Hunter Valley rail network to about 115 million tonnes of coal a year.This government is committed to the coal industry. We have demonstrated our willingness to work with the industry to help make its technology cleaner and to help it achieve its maximum potential for our nation. Thirty thousand people work directly in the coal industry and another 130,000 are dependent upon that sector. The honourable member for Dobell asks, 'Are there threats?' Of course there clearly are. The Greens Senator Bob Brown declared over the weekend that he wanted to close down our coal exports and our coal fired power stations in Australia within three years. Within three years, he wants the entire great Australian coal industry to disappear.Many may just dismiss that as the wacky Greens off again with another quite strange policy idea, but the alarming fact is that, at every election, Labor does a preference deal with the Greens. It is always prepared to trade off matters of principle to get Greens preferences. And it is at it again. There are banner headlines 'Rudd woos Queensland Greens vote'. There is one thing the Queensland Greens want: to close down all the Queensland power stations and this great industry, the biggest employer and the biggest export earner in the country.They have a bit of sympathy in the Labor Party from the honourable member for Kingsford Smith, who said that the expansion of the coal industry is a thing of the past and a few days earlier dismissed jobs in the mining industry as being hypothetical. How many hypothetical coal industry jobs are Labor going to trade off this year for their Greens preference deal? How many jobs in the Hunter, how many jobs in the new electorate of Flynn in Queensland, the heart of the coal industry in that state, are going to be traded off for this year's Greens preference deal? Labor cannot get a candidate in Flynn and it is no wonder if they have to try to defend a policy which would close down the most significant employer in that region.So the reality is that Labor is close to the Greens and does deals with the Greens. It identifies with this wacky policy to close down the coal industry. I call on the Leader of the Opposition to stop his negotiations with a party of that nature. Do not try to woo the vote of the Greens in Queensland; be responsible about Australia's coal industry and let them get on with earning the export dollars that are so vital to our nation's industry.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for McMillan and recognise his very keen interest in and commitment to the coal industry and the role of coal in the generation of electricity in his own electorate. World demand for electricity is projected to double by 2030. That growth will be driven in large measure by countries like China and India as they continue their rapid economic growth and as their citizens seek to improve their living standards. China and India are 78 per cent and 69 per cent respectively dependent on coal for electricity generation. Each of them has substantially greater coal reserves than Australia. Neither of them is blessed with significant alternative energy resources and the consequence is that, for economic and energy security reasons, both countries will continue to be heavy users of coal in the years ahead.Australia is a major exporter of coal to the world. In addressing climate change, we must build on our natural advantages and respond in ways that do not threaten the economic prosperity or the job security of Australians. The Labor Party seems to be prepared to ignore these fundamental realities, but we are not. One of the greatest contributions Australia can make to reducing global greenhouse gas emissions is to help develop the technologies the world will need to clean up coal. China and India will continue to use coal for the bulk of their energy needs. It is only by cleaning up that coal fired generation capacity that they will be able to have economic growth, which they are entitled to, and energy growth, which they need, and at the same time reduce the growth in greenhouse gas emissions. China is the fastest-growing coal consumer in the world. It does not use coal as efficiently as it might. Leaving aside near zero emission clean coal technologies like sequestration, China has a long way to go. - The thermal efficiency of a coal fired power station globally is 30 per cent. In the OECD, it is 38 per cent. In China, it is 27 per cent. There is enormous potential for China to improve its energy efficiency and reduce the rapid growth in its greenhouse gas emissions.As part of our $2 billion comprehensive climate change strategy, the government is investing more than $470 million in the effort to promote clean coal and carbon sequestration technologies: $170 million through the low emissions technology demonstration fund, $22 million to support the relevant cooperative research centres, $19 million through projects under the AP6 Partnership on Clean Development and Climate, and, of course, as announced in January by the Prime Minister, the China-Australia clean coal initiative.What is the Labor-Greens alliance threatening to do with coal technology? -  - Well may they laugh. They can laugh away. I hope the constituents of the member for Hunter see him laughing, because the laugh will be on him when the constituents of the member for Hunter realise what the member for Kingsford Smith has in mind for them.The Greens policy is to cease coal exports within three years - effectively shut down the coal mining industry, devastate the economy and sacrifice thousands of miners' jobs, their families and their communities. And for what? For nothing. China would simply buy its coal from somewhere else or use its own coal, of which it has vastly more in reserve than we do - and that coal is more inefficient in terms of carbon emissions than our own. What is Labor's policy? It supports clean coal, it says, but it sets an arbitrary target of 60 per cent reduction in emissions by 2050. It refuses to say what this will cost in dollars or jobs. I would ask Mr Rudd to reveal the analysis underpinning Labor's 60 per cent target. What will the impact be on our economy or on Australian jobs?When the member for Kingsford Smith was asked what Labor's climate change policy would cost, he said, 'We don't know what paying more means.' When asked about the cost of Labor's policy on coal jobs, the member for Kingsford Smith said that it was a hypothetical question. The member for Hunter might tell him that it is not hypothetical for his constituents. Then in the Newcastle Herald he said:The automatic expansion of the coal industry as we have seen in the Hunter region ... over the last decade is a thing of the past.That is not a hypothetical answer, and the workers' jobs it threatens are real. The member for Kingsford Smith's remarks mean one of two things. Either there will be no new coalmines - that has a familiar Labor ring about it - which means that the coal industry is doomed to die because, as every mine is exhausted and closed, no new mine will take its place, or he is simply saying that we should not mine any more coal than we are doing now, that we should put a cap on our coal production and on our exports. To what end? All that will happen is our competitors will rub their hands with glee.The government is committed to meeting the greenhouse challenge, to reducing our greenhouse gas emissions and to helping the world reduce its greenhouse gas emissions, but doing so in a way which preserves the jobs and the economy that the Australian community depends upon. -  - Yes.</DOC>

 - There is a certain touch of irony when the word 'lecture' passes the lips of the Leader of the Opposition, but I will leave that aside. I guess one of the reasons why I am entitled to speak on this subject is that, when we went to the election in 2004, amongst the policies that we espoused then was the commitment we had made to Iraq. It is a matter of regret to me that the military operations and the security situation in Iraq have been as difficult as they have been over the past three years. I do not hide my disappointment about that, but what we must do - what the Leader of the Opposition must do and what I must do - is speak responsibly now about the consequences -  -  - I am very happy to talk also in this answer about what the Leader of the Opposition said at the time of the operation in Iraq. I remind him of his speech to the State Zionist Council of Victoria, when he said that it was a matter of empirical fact that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. - The truth is that both the current Leader of the Opposition and the immediately preceding Leader of the Opposition were both hedging their bets three years ago. If things had gone better, they would have been saying behind their hands that the silly old leader then should not have been so strident in his opposition. What we have to do is to address the consequences of the position we take on the situation today.My charge against the Leader of the Opposition is that his policy would be to let down our greatest ally in her hour of greatest need over Iraq. That is my criticism of the Leader of the Opposition. Self-evidently, if Australia were to withdraw her forces in Iraq - forces that have made an extremely valuable contribution, given the size of this country, to this military operation - that would not only be a material subtraction from the coalition effort in Iraq; it would also, in psychological terms, do enormous damage to the United States position. I am saying to the Leader of the Opposition that I have every right as the Prime Minister of this country to speak to the security interests of Australia. I have every right to condemn policies that would damage the security position of this country. I have every right to warn of the consequences of an American defeat in the Middle East. I have every right to warn of the boost that that would give to terrorism not only in Iraq but also in our part of the world.The truth is that America is going through a difficult time in Iraq and there are many who will condemn the original decision. I accept my responsibility for that original decision but I say to the Leader of the Opposition and to the Australian people that if America is defeated in Iraq the consequences for the West will be catastrophic. Anybody who thinks otherwise has no understanding of international power relations. They are the considerations that give me every right to speak to what I believe to be the national interest of my country.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Solomon for his question. He told me that Sharan Burrow was up in Darwin last Friday. Her timing was impeccable. I would back the member for Solomon in an arm wrestle with Sharan Burrow any day. It would be close, but I would back him any day. The member for Solomon told me that, in the months before the introduction of Work Choices in February 2006, the unemployment rate in the Northern Territory was 6.4 per cent. Last Thursday the unemployment rate fell to two per cent. It fell from 6.4 per cent in February 2006 to two per cent last Thursday. - There is no doubt that small business has embraced the removal of the unfair dismissal laws and seen it as an opportunity to employ more people. I note that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Treasurer have been saying that job creation over the last 12 months has come from the mining industry. I dug into the figures a little bit and found that, of the 240,000 new jobs that have been created since Work Choices was introduced, 46,000 were in wholesale trade, 43,000 in construction, 34,500 in finance and insurance, and only 14,000 in mining. It is hard to believe but I think there might have been a little porky in the opposition line. It is disappointing, because job growth comes about by creating incentives for employers to employ more people. The government is not in the business of creating jobs; only business can create jobs. So removing something like the unfair dismissal laws is going to have a positive impact on job creation.The Deputy Leader of the Opposition said yesterday that she is going to consult small business. She is walking down one side of the street saying, 'We're going to be the friend of small business; we're going to consult with them about the removal of the unfair dismissal laws,' and on the other side of the street the Labor Party and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition have voted 44 times against the removal of the unfair dismissal laws. They are on the road to Damascus. You can see Julia and Kevin holding hands, walking down the road, telling one story to one side of the street and another story to the other side of the street.This has happened not just on unfair dismissal. The new-found Leader of the Opposition said that he is concerned about the interests of independent contractors, yet last year the Labor Party voted in this parliament against protecting the interests of independent contractors. They are walking down one side of the street and speaking to the other side of the street at the same time. The Labor Party even pretended to be the friend of the Tristar workers, yet in this place last year the Labor Party voted against the 12-month redundancy protection for the Tristar workers. They are telling them one thing on one side of the street and voting against the workers on the other side of the street. They are going to try to run this charade of telling people one story but doing the other. We know the Labor Party's agenda; it is the unions' agenda. It is to close down small business, not to create jobs, and it will lead to a deterioration in the employment and workplace relations environment. The Labor Party is about closing down jobs, not creating jobs.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Greenway for her question and I note that in her electorate yesterday the government announced a $1.5 billion boost to aged-care services. Thanks to this latest initiative, government aged-care funding will rise from some $3 billion back in 1995 to almost $10 billion by 2010.There were four key elements in yesterday's announcements. First, pensioners and self-funded retirees in the same financial position will be treated the same in respect of aged-care support; second, the government will increase accommodation charges to meet the Hogan report recommendations on capital funding for high care; third, the government will increase funding for residents with high-care needs such as dementia patients; and, fourth, the government will fund a further 7,200 community aged-care places, taking the total number of aged-care places from under 150,000 in 1995 to almost 250,000 in total by 2010.I would like to thank the Minister for Ageing, Senator Santoro, for putting together this package in consultation with the sector. Let me observe that this government does not just talk about health; we spend the money necessary to make a good system even better. On that point, I should thank the Treasurer, because were it not for the responsible economic management of this government we could never afford to give Australians the aged-care services they need.</DOC>

 - I do remember making that statement and I also remember that the current Leader of the Opposition regarded a statement made by Mr Latham not as something to condemn but rather as something to be supported as a robust exercise in free speech.While I am on my feet, I also remember some things said by the Leader of the Opposition way back in 2002 in the lead-up to the Iraq war. Let me remind you what he said to the State Zionist Council of Victoria:Saddam Hussein possesses weapons of mass destruction. That is a matter of empirical fact.Absolutely. Chemical and biological weapons have always been possessed by him. Also:... we've said from the beginning that Saddam Hussein does possess weapons of mass destruction.I am very happy to go back three years ago to the lead-up to the Iraq war. I am very happy to remind the Leader of the Opposition that he, along with his immediate predecessor, the member for Brand, was very lukewarm in his support of the position taken by the member for Hotham. The member for Hotham at least was forthright about his position. You were in no doubt as to where the member for Hotham stood. But the current and the former leaders of the opposition were both having two bob each way three years ago and, if the outcome over the past three years had been different, they would have been running away from the position that the Labor Party took three years ago as fast as you can imagine it, and the member for Hotham knows that what I am saying is dead right.</DOC>

 - I think all of my colleagues bring common sense into the parliament. That is my view about the member for Moore. This morning I have been caught rather more by some remarks made by somebody else - namely, the Leader of the Opposition. It is very important that everybody listens to this. The Leader of the Opposition was twice asked this morning on News Radio by Marius Benson what he thought would be the consequences of an American withdrawal from Iraq. It was hardly an irrelevant question. The debate of the last 72 hours has been all about the future of Iraq and the consequences of an American withdrawal. He was asked by Marius Benson the very direct question:If the United States did withdraw all its troops from Iraq -  - The question was very direct and very simple:If the United States did withdraw all its troops from Iraq as Barack Obama advocates, what do you think would happen in Iraq?That is a very simple question. It is a very direct question. It goes very directly to what we are debating. What was the reply of the Leader of the Opposition? Typically, he cut and ran. Listen to his answer. He was asked what he thought would happen and this is what he had to say:On the question of the future direction of US military strategy in Iraq, like Mr Downer my role is not to provide a rolling commentary on the merits or otherwise of twists and turns in the US military debate. - The Leader of the Opposition was asked yet again what he advocates in relation to withdrawing troops from Iraq and what he thought the consequences of that would be. The Leader of the Opposition replied:No, what I'm an advocate of is to withdraw the Australian combat component ...We know that. We have known that for several years, but what we do not know is what the Leader of the Opposition believes would be the consequence of a coalition withdrawal by March 2008. Over the last day and a half I have been attacked and lacerated by the opposition for expressing my view, but the Leader of the Opposition does not have the guts to express his. I want to know what the opposition believes. I would like to know -  - The debate here in Australia over the last two days has centrally been about what would happen in Iraq if coalition forces were withdrawn, what would happen to the cause of terrorism in the Middle East and what the security consequences for Australia would be.We have the extraordinary situation where I am attacked because I have had the courage to express my views on the consequences of that. The Leader of the Opposition, in typical fashion, is trying to maintain an attack on us without having the courage to express his views as to what would happen if coalition forces were to withdraw in March next year. That is the central security issue. The reason the Leader of the Opposition is remaining silent is, I suspect, that he knows in his heart that the real answer to that question is the same as the one that I have given, and that is that Iraq would descend into chaos and terrorists around the world would be emboldened. The Leader of the Opposition was twice asked this morning, 'What do you think will happen if coalition forces are withdrawn from Iraq in March 2008?' and on both occasions the Leader of the Opposition did not have the courage to tell the Australian people what I have told the Australian people to be my belief. That is the central issue in this debate. It has got nothing to do with individuals in another election campaign; it has everything to do with the future of Iraq -  - and the central security issue facing this country. I have told the Australian people where I stand. Why won't the Leader of the Opposition do the same?</DOC>

 - Can I say in answer to the member who represents not only the largest electorate in Western Australia and in Australia but also the largest electorate in the world - and it is an electorate that, as we all know, is home to the great resource industries of that state and, according to the people who sit opposite, it is therefore the home to the principal explanation for our economic prosperity - that many things have contributed to our economic prosperity, and part of that contribution has come from the resources boom, which has been underpinned in no small measure by the industrial relations policy pursued in this country over the last 10 years. But, in going directly to his question, the answer is that the government is still opposed to the ratification of the Kyoto protocol because it is not in Australia's interests that we do so. We are going to reach the target or go very close to reaching the target, but we have declined to ratify the protocol for the very good reason that that would do great damage to Australia's industries. I have been saying all along that, because of the way the protocol operates, if we had ratified we would be assuming obligations that our competitors would not be assuming and that would put us at a disadvantage.My colleague the member for Kalgoorlie asks me whether that view has been supported by any expert opinion in recent times. I have to tell the honourable gentleman that it has, in today's West Australian newspaper, by no less an authority and expert in economic matters than Mr Marney, the Western Australian Under Treasurer - that is, the head of the Western Australian Treasury. Mr Marney was appointed by the Western Australian Labor government. He is a career public servant and somebody who, I have no doubt, has given good service to both sides of politics in Western Australia. When he was appointed, the Western Australian Treasurer, Eric Ripper, waxed lyrical about his ability, about his 14 years experience in economics, about how he had worked in the Reserve Bank and about how he had clearly demonstrated that he has the capacity and vision required to hold the position of Under Treasurer - in other words, somebody who would know the real economic interests of the great state of Western Australia and would know what was good for Western Australia and what was bad.What did we find the Under Treasurer saying this morning, apparently quoted at a gathering of CEDA? 'Prime Minister John Howard was right not to ratify the Kyoto protocol on greenhouse gases because it could have a devastating effect on the competitiveness of Australian industry.' This is not a political figure; this is an apolitical Public Service expert who knows something about the Western Australian economy. He goes on to say, 'As long as, for example, the Kyoto protocol has a bunch of our competitors sitting outside of the constraints that come with that protocol then for us to sign up to that would be disastrous.' There was no equivocation, and that is exactly the argument that I have been advancing. It is exactly the argument in support of the position that we have taken.The truth is that, in responding to climate change, no rational government caring for the long-term interests of Australia is going to enter into an arrangement that would reduce the competitiveness of Australian industry. That is precisely why we remain opposed to the ratification of Kyoto. It does not include all of the major polluters. It does not include, for example, China, a country that the Leader of the Opposition on the weekend said was absolutely indispensable to a solution to our environmental problems. I think the words spoken by the Western Australian Under Treasurer, who is in an unqualifiedly advantaged position to know what would happen in his state and therefore to the resource industry of Australia, are right on the money and go directly to the relevance of the government's position.The Kyoto protocol is a landmark agreement in the fight against climate change precisely because it contains targets which, despite being challenging, are also realistic and fair.Leave granted.</DOC>

 - Can I answer that question by saying that I personally have a very warm regard for both of those gentleman. They have on occasions, certainly in the case of General Gration, disagreed with the government stance on foreign policy, but I am sure they have done so out of deep conviction and I in no way impugn their patriotism, their dedication and their commitment to Australia.In relation to the Minister for Defence, the Leader of the Opposition went right over the top this morning when he made the outrageous claim that the defence minister was imputing proterrorist sentiments to anybody who was arguing for a withdrawal of American forces. What the Leader of the Opposition is trying to do is to conflate a description of the consequences of something with an allegation that the person advocating a course of action shares the sentiments of terrorists. The Minister for Defence did nothing of the kind. It is quite outrageous of the Leader of the Opposition to suggest otherwise. My charge is not that the Labor Party is sympathetic to terrorists - I would never allege that for a moment; my charge is that the consequences of the policies you are advocating would be to destabilise Iraq and threaten the security interests of this country through a defeat of the United States in Iraq. That is my charge and you know it. Why won't the Leader of the Opposition state his position?</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Deakin for his question. I can tell him that the Australian Bureau of Statistics has today released lending finance data for December. It shows that housing finance rose 1.1 per cent in December and is up eight per cent through the year; that personal finance fell in December and is up 4.4 per cent through the year; and that commercial finance, which also fell in December, is more or less steady for the course of the year. All of that points to the fact that the growth in credit is slowing. I think that is probably consistent with the fact that inflationary pressures have dropped somewhat.As I said to the House yesterday, in the first half of last year the underlying rate of inflation was about 0.8 per cent for the quarter and it has now gone down a notch to 0.5 per cent. That is good news for stable inflation expectations. That is the kind of outcome which the government has been looking for. Notwithstanding that, all of the business surveys show that business conditions have strengthened in the early part of this year and businesses are looking forward to a stronger year in 2007 than they had in 2006.What picture does this give of the Australian economic situation? It gives this picture: that notwithstanding a very severe drought - a drought which has caused production to fall by about 20 per cent in the rural sector - the Australian economy continues to grow. It continues to grow in a low inflationary environment, and it produces jobs. The unemployment rate is at the lowest level we have seen in 31 years.There have been many challenges to this economy over the last 10 years. We had the Asian financial crisis, a US recession, September 11, war in Iraq and Afghanistan, terrorist attacks in Bali, and we have had a one-in-a-hundred-year drought. But the Australian economy has grown continuously right throughout that period. One of the reasons it has grown continuously throughout that period is that the government attended to the key fundamentals of economic management in this country: balancing our budget; repaying $96 billion of Labor debt; funding our superannuation liabilities; broadening the indirect tax base; cutting the company tax rate; halving the capital gains tax rate; cutting income taxes in 2000, 2003, 2004, 2005 and 2006; and making sure that we had an independent central bank with an inflation target. All of that work is producing these results.The Labor Party would have you believe that it is in favour of the results; it just opposed all the work that was required to get there. Australians know this: you do not get the results without putting in the effort. The Australian Labor Party cannot come along after 10 years of opposing the effort and try to claim ownership of the results.On the weekend the Leader of the Opposition made out that he supports all of the economic policy of this government. We take that as a compliment. But I say to the people of Australia: come to the originators, not the imitators. Come to the originators who actually had the foresight to put all of these policies in place. It was the foresight and the work that got us to where we are and it is the work of today which will get us to where we want to be tomorrow.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hinkler for his question. Obviously the member for Hinkler is taking a very keen interest in this debate as it is focused around the coal industry, given that he represents the port city of Gladstone, arguably one of the most efficient coal-exporting ports on the eastern seaboard, and other areas that have coalmines within them, and many of his constituents are employed in that industry.It has been clearly established - and the figures were used yesterday - how important coalmining exports are to the Australian economy. Can I also point out how important, particularly in an industrial city like Gladstone, the competitive advantage that Australia has in this cheap energy source is. Coal provides 85 per cent of the nation's electricity needs - cheap, efficient power supplies, not just for private consumers in their homes but also for businesses and for industry. And there is some very important industry in Gladstone, which employs a lot of the constituents of the member for Hinkler and relies on that internationally competitive energy source that comes from our coal supplies.Many other nations across the world have a competitive advantage in other areas - for example, China and the cheaper cost of labour. - Our competitive advantage is the cheaper cost of energy. - The cheaper cost of energy in Australia is threatened by reckless environmental policies in this current debate. You may want to see what happens when you factor into the equation some of the costs that are being proposed. We read in today's paper about the proposed coalmine in New South Wales. The New South Wales state government has indicated that that mine should factor in a cost of $109 for each tonne of carbon dioxide created when its coal is burnt. That cost is going to go somewhere. That cost is going to go to consumers.I think that organisations like the New South Wales government proposing this should be honest with consumers and tell them what their electricity charges are going to go up by. If it happened in Queensland, the industry in the city of Gladstone would be paying more for its electricity. If you want to see an example of that, just have a look at what has happened overseas. Have a look at what has happened in Europe. The NUS Consulting Group has done an analysis of the cost per kilowatt hour across a number of different economies. In Australia in 2006 the cost in US cents per kilowatt hour was US5.29c per kilowatt hour. In Germany it was US10.33c per kilowatt hour. In France it was US10.53c. In the United Kingdom it was US11.03c. That is what the cost of environmental taxes does to the competitiveness of the cost of energy, which we rely so heavily on in Australia.We know that members of the Labor Party do not pay much attention to this issue. When the member for Kingsford Smith was asked, 'Will consumers have to pay more?' his reply was, 'I don't know what 'pay more' means.' The consumers in Europe and other countries across the world that are bearing this cost know what 'pay more' means. It means paying more than US5c a kilowatt hour.That report on European costs said that this cost increase was due partly to rising oil prices. It also said that it was due to the application of new environmental or green taxes on electricity purchases. That is what happens. These costs are passed on to consumers. We know that will happen. We know that the member for Kingsford Smith has already got that in his mind. In a former life he told Lateline, on 6 May 1999, when he was the President of the Australian Conservation Foundation:I mean, most countries when they come to a GST and tax reform - and certainly the OECD experience is that - they use that opportunity to get into some environmental taxes.We know that is what the Labor Party is about. We know that is what the green movement is about. The people of Australia need to understand that what the government is about is making these industries cleaner and investing in clean coal technology so that we can continue to take advantage of our most important competitive advantage, and that is clean and cheap energy in Australia.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Tangney for his question. The expectations in relation to inflation here in Australia are that inflation has moderated somewhat and should be within our band of two to three per cent over the course of the forthcoming year. In most of the developed economies of the world, inflation expectations are low. For example, in the United States the latest CPI is 2½ per cent, in Britain it is three per cent and so on. There are some countries around the world that have very high inflation rates. The Economist's table of inflation has one country in particular that stands out as a very high inflationary society, and that is Venezuela, where inflation is currently running at 18.4 per cent.Members will know that the President of Venezuela, Hugo Chavez, has threatened to nationalise the oil industry and the phone industry. President Hugo Chavez has described the President of the United States as a killer, a genocidal murderer and a madman. So it may come as a surprise to the House that President Hugo Chavez has his admirers in Australia, and these admirers have invited him to come to Australia. They have written an open letter to him which says:We have watched developments in Venezuela with great interest. We have been impressed by the great effort that your government has taken to improve the living standards of the majority of Venezuelans ...Although we are on the opposite side of the globe we feel that our shared ideals of social justice and democracy bring us close together.Aside from half of the trade union movement of Western Australia which has signed this open letter to President Hugo Chavez to come from Venezuela over here to 'Brutopia' to tell us how to run an economy, signatories to this invitation include Warren Mundine, National President of the ALP, and Senator Gavin Marshall, ALP senator for Victoria.I would have thought that the Leader of the Opposition, who is so concerned about the US alliance, would not have his own senators inviting to this country a man who calls the US President a genocidal killer and who went to the UN General Assembly and, from the podium at the General Assembly, called the President of the United States the devil. So now that we are all into the business of protecting the alliance and making sure that nobody says anything that could possibly prejudice the alliance, we will be looking forward to the Leader of the Opposition disciplining Warren Mundine, disciplining his own Senator Gavin Marshall and explaining to us just what the President of Venezuela could advise us on how to improve 'Brutopia' here in Australia.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for McMillan for the question. He represents one of the major coal-producing areas of Australia and he, like many others, must be concerned about the threats to the coal industry that we have seen coming from the opposite side over recent days. The Australian government stands firmly behind the Australian coal industry and the 130,000 Australian families that are dependent upon that industry for their incomes. The $24 billion worth of export income is also absolutely critical to Australia's growth and prosperity, so we have been supporting practical measures to help the Australian coal industry to achieve its potential and, in particular, to meet the challenges of climate change.The $500 million Low Emission Technology Demonstration Fund last year provided $100 million to projects in Victoria and Queensland to develop clean coal technology. The industry's own Coal 21 initiative has committed $300 million to support low-emission technology projects. We are working with the Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate to help ensure that there are real environmental outcomes to help improve the environmental performance of this industry. And with China we are working on a joint coordination group for clean coal technology, which was recently announced by our Prime Minister and the Premier of China.So Australia has been very active in seeking to expand the opportunities of our world-leading coal industry. Of course, not all people are so enthusiastic about the Australian coal industry. Yesterday we learnt that Senator Bob Brown wants to end all coalmining in Australia and close down all coal-fired power stations within three years. We also learnt that Labor is wooing a Greens preference deal. We know from past experience that Labor has been prepared to trade off any policy and any number of jobs in its determination to get green preferences. We learnt that the member for Kingsford Smith has already written off the coal industry and its jobs as just hypothetical and made it clear that any expansion of the coal industry was a thing of the past. This anti coal industry talk is not just talk; there has also been a fair degree of action. We have noticed, for instance, that Labor and Green councillors in Newcastle combined recently to force a cap on coal exports and a moratorium on new coalmine approvals. So Labor is already acting against the coal industry.Western Australia has proposed a $25 a tonne carbon tax and now we know that the New South Wales Labor government is proposing a $109 tax on a proposed new coalmine at Anvil Hill in the Hunter Valley. These are the kinds of actions that you would expect from a party that wants to close down this industry and that has no sympathy whatever for the importance of coalmining in Australia - no respect for and no interest in the thousands of jobs created in the electorate of the honourable member for McMillan, in the Hunter and in Central Queensland by this great Australian industry. The reality is that Labor is anti the coal industry. The coalminers of Australia and all those people who are dependent on the industry have grave reason to be concerned about Labor's lack of commitment to the coalmining industry and their determination to wind it down. The best solution for Australia is to make sure that Labor never sees government nationally so there will be somebody left to stand up for this great Australian industry and its wonderful contribution to our economy.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kennedy. I will answer his five questions in order. In answer to the first question, two-thirds of Australia's agriculture is somewhat more than most people regard the Murray-Darling Basin as producing. The figure is generally stated as being between 40 and 50 per cent. Nonetheless, it is true that our largest and most productive agricultural area does its work for Australia with only six per cent of our run-off, emphasising yet again the importance of the Prime Minister's $10 billion plan for reviving and making efficient Australia's irrigated agriculture, 80-odd per cent of which is in the Murray-Darling Basin. But, as the Leader of the Opposition would know if he had bothered to read the Prime Minister's speech, which he plainly has not, the $10 billion plan, as the Prime Minister emphasised repeatedly, is available across Australia. Not only did he say that but he cited a number of irrigation areas in Queensland and in Western Australia that could be eligible.The second question was about the superabundance of water in northern Australia. We understand that about two-thirds of our run-off is in the tropical north. Regarding the third question, meeting with North Queensland shires, I can assure the member for Kennedy that I meet with parties seeking grants under the Australian government water fund all the time. The management of that program is done by the Water Commission, but I am very happy to meet with his constituents.As to his fourth and final questions about the irrigation potential of the north and the ethanol production potential from sugarcane in the north, these are the sorts of issues that the government is addressing through the task force being set up under the chairmanship of Senator Bill Heffernan. Australia's north is where the bulk of our water is. It is something that we have to manage sustainably. We have invested tens of millions of dollars in science into northern water so that we do not make the same mistakes in the north as we have in the south. It is a region of great opportunity and we are focused on that opportunity and will continue to be, in the national interest. - Finally, the Australian government water fund has already invested substantial amounts in Northern Queensland, in the electorates of Herbert, Dawson and Capricornia - a fact the honourable member opposite is probably not prepared to concede to the government.</DOC>

 - The Labor Party's key climate change policy is a 60 per cent cut in greenhouse gas emissions from 2000 levels by 2050. The Labor Party will not say, does not know or does not care to know what the economic and social impact of that cut will be. The member for Kingsford Smith becomes irritated when he is asked about what the cost will be and says that he does not know what 'paying more' means. - The Leader of the Opposition, when asked whether jobs would be lost as a result of his climate change policy, said, 'Not necessarily.' That is hardly a ringing reassurance for Australian workers. In 2006 the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics modelled a 50 per cent cut in 1990 level emissions by 2050, which is a much less drastic reduction than that proposed by the Australian Labor Party. ABARE forecast that this cut would result in a 10.7 per cent fall in GDP, a 20.8 per cent fall in real wages, a 75 per cent fall in aluminium production and - this will be of particular concern to the member for Cowper - a 44 per cent reduction in agricultural production. ABARE concluded that the key elements in greenhouse response are global -  -  - ABARE concluded that the key elements in greenhouse response are global action and having available the full range of technologies, including clean coal, renewables and nuclear power. ABARE said that unilateral action offered no perceptible benefits for the rest of the world either economically or environmentally because it would make no difference, as we all know, to the overall level of global greenhouse gas emissions. - Labor's unilateral climate change policy is bad for jobs. It is bad for business. It is bad for the economy -  - and it will not even help the environment. The government's climate change policy is committed and is delivering real reductions in the growth of greenhouse gas emissions -  - investing in the technologies that will make it possible for the world, particularly developing countries, to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions while maintaining economic growth, and above all having an open mind with every technology and every practical measure on the table as we manage Australia's climate change response in the national interest.</DOC>

 - There are a number of reasons why productivity will vary from time to time. One of those reasons is that you can have - and it is happening in the case of the resource industry - an extraordinary increase in employment in advance of an increase in the product brought forth by the investment, which accounts ultimately for both the product and also for the gains in employment. It is true that changes to the Australian economy over the last 20 years have produced increases in productivity and it is also true that changes recently made are going to lead in time to further increases in productivity, and I refer in particular to the workplace relations changes. If they flow through, Mr Speaker, I believe -  - They will make a contribution to productivity growth. There is one obstacle of course and that is the election of a Labor government, which will stop that happening because Labor has pledged to tear up Work Choices.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Ryan, whose electorate in the heart of Brisbane in that great state of Queensland now has an unemployment rate of 1.9 per cent. Overwhelmingly, that has to be linked to the small businesses that are in the electorate of Ryan. It is undoubtedly part of the equation about doing the hard yards and making the tough decisions that help to build a strong economy. The Australian, in their editorial today, pointed to the benefits of workplace change. They said:The benefits of labour market reform are plain to see in the snapshot of the Australian economy provided yesterday by the Reserve Bank ...At the heart of those workplace reforms is the abolition of the Labor Party's job-destroying unfair dismissal laws. Small business today have confirmed that they now have an incentive to create jobs. The New South Wales Business Council said:We always said that the removal of unfair dismissal would free up small businesses to employ more people.The President of the Real Estate Institute said:I think with the previous legislation that was thrust upon us it made it very, very difficult for small businesses to survive under that regime.The Chief Executive of Family Business Australia said:The old legislation - the Labor Party's legislation - was onerous. Family businesses were inclined to have to pay what they called 'go away money' to get rid of the disruptive or inappropriate employees.The Labor Party voted against the interests of small business on 44 occasions. They voted against the removal of the Labor Party job-destroying unfair dismissal laws. - At that time the Deputy Leader of the Opposition stood on principle opposing those laws. She said our removal of the unfair dismissal laws was:_ a further assault on the working conditions of the industrially weak.She went on to say:It is fundamentally bad public policy, short-sighted and ridiculous _There she was, taking a principled stand opposing the laws, and so it was a bit surprising for all of us on Sunday when she said that she was going to speak to small business about possible exceptions. The trade union movement, as they do, came out today pointing out that it is a matter of principle for them. The ACTU's Greg Combet - always good for a quote - declared that the issue remained 'a statement of principle and belief'. He said, 'We believe there shouldn't be any exceptions.' The AWU's Bill Ludwig - not a bad guy sometimes and a good judge of character at times - said that you either have those unfair dismissal laws or you do not. And we cannot forget Unions New South Wales's John Robertson who said that there should not be exceptions.The Labor Party is trying to walk on both sides of the street. On the one hand the trade union movement is saying that there are no exceptions, that it is a matter of principle and that unfair dismissal laws should apply to every businessman no matter what. That is the policy of the Labor Party, because that is how they have voted on 44 occasions in this place. On the other side of the road we have the Deputy Leader of the Opposition trying to whisper sweet nothings into the ears of small business. Small business is onto you. Small business is smarter than that. Small business knows that getting rid of the unfair dismissal laws has helped to create jobs. The coalition believes in creating jobs and the Labor Party believes in destroying jobs.</DOC>

 - I think there are clearly linkages between investment in education and productivity and growth in the economy. I think there are also linkages between the quality of the outputs of education and the economy. I think the Australian economy will benefit enormously from our re-embracing of technical and further education. I think the Australian economy will benefit enormously if we can have relatively uniform and much higher standards of English, arithmetic and literacy. - I think the Australian economy will benefit enormously if the 80,000 school students who travel from one part of the nation to another are not disadvantaged by a lack of synchronisation between the curricula of the various states. That is why my colleague the Minister for Education, Science and Training has been arguing so strenuously with her state colleagues to bring about a greater uniformity of curricula. Investment in education is important, but standards in education are even more important. And the real barrier to standards lies in the hands of those people who have sought over the years to impose their own ideology on education in this country. This country's economy will be massively boosted if, in the years ahead, we can produce a larger number of young men and women out of the school system whose basic proficiency in English and in numeracy, and their literature understanding, is much higher than it is at the present time. That remains a major objective of this government.</DOC>

 - I do thank the member for Braddon for his question, and I note that on the most recent figures the bulk-billing rate in his electorate has increased by 25.2 percentage points since December 2003. Now, let me be clear: bulk-billing -  -  - is not the be-all and end-all of Medicare, but it is important. It should be widely available, particularly to children and pensioners, and that is just what has happened thanks to the policies of the Howard government. The latest Medicare statistics came out last Friday and they show that in the December quarter the national bulk-billing rate had gone up to 77.1 per cent. That is 10.6 percentage points more than in December 2003. It is the 12th consecutive quarterly increase in the GP bulk-billing rates. - At 84.3 per cent, the bulk-billing rate for children is at an all-time high. - At 71.9 per cent, the bulk-billing rate in country areas is at an all-time high. I am pleased to say to the interjecting member for Brisbane that the bulk-billing rate has increased in every state and territory over the last two years but most of all in Tasmania, where the bulk-billing rate is up 22.6 percentage points since December 2003. Results like these mean that Medicare is safe with the Howard government. They mean that the Howard government is the best friend that Medicare has ever had.I was asked about alternative policies. On the weekend, we had the Leader of the Opposition boasting about the big job he once had as director-general of the cabinet office in Queensland. He said:At that level, you provide a lot of advice on key questions which go to the very core of what governments do - with schools policy, with hospitals policy and the rest.I was very interested in that, because in 1995 - after the Leader of the Opposition had been running Queensland for six years, he thinks - a survey showed that 61 per cent of Queenslanders said their hospital system was in crisis. Six years of Kevin Rudd and 61 per cent of Queenslanders think their public hospital system is in crisis. Well, there is a clear message in all of this: don't let Kevin Rudd do to Medicare what he did to Queensland's public hospitals.</DOC>

 - We could do much better for our kids' future if we had a restoration of standards of literacy and numeracy, and in the teaching of English. - We could do a lot better for our children's future -  - if we had some state governments in this country that did not allow the education curriculum to be dictated by the teachers unions. -  - We could do a lot better for our children if we did not equate analysing an SMS text message with Shakespeare. We could do a lot better for our children if we restored -  - The member for Melbourne then left the chamber. - Mr Speaker, we would do a lot better for our kids, to adopt the phraseology -  - of the Leader of the Opposition, if we had, as I said, a proper narrative teaching of Australian history instead of it occasionally being slipped in under some amorphous title such as 'Time, experience and mood' or something like that. Having set the framework, let me just remind the House of a couple of facts and a couple of statistics about my government's investment in education. I do so against the background, when it comes to university education, of a statement made in the education supplement of the Australian in January by Professor Gerard Sutton, who is the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Wollongong and the President of the Vice-Chancellors Committee. He said, in substance, that the number of HECS places now available in Australia was adequate to the demand. That is not me and it is not the Minister for Education, Science and Training. It happens to be the President of the Vice-Chancellors Committee who is saying that.Let me remind those who sit opposite that, under our Backing Australia's Future policy, we will create an additional 50,000 places in universities by 2011. In 2006, 90 per cent of year 12 applicants who applied for a university place in their own state received an offer. That happens to be the best result for 20 years - 90 per cent who applied received an offer and that is the best for the last 20 years.Between 1996 and 2006, the period of office of the Howard government, funding for both government and non-government schools has increased by 158 per cent to $9.3 billion in the current school year. It includes - listen to this, Mr Speaker, and I hope the teacher unions of Australia will listen to this - a funding increase for government schools, public schools as we call them in New South Wales, of 118 per cent while enrolments in government schools over the same period have gone up by only 1.1 per cent. Yet people like Pat Byrne of the Education Union still write articles dishonestly asserting that this government has cut funding to government schools. It is a slur on the commitment that my government has made to the future of young men and women who go to government schools in this country. We are proudly supportive of both the government and the private sectors in education. We are the true believers in choice in education. We are the true believers in excellence and we are the true supporters of returning to a period in Australia when a high-grade technical qualification is as prized an asset as a university degree.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Gilmore for her question and her very strong determination to represent the very best interests of the defence community in Nowra in particular.The member for Hunter then left the chamber - The first priority and responsibility of any government is the defence and protection of the country, its people, its interests and values. In order to do that it requires two things. Firstly, it requires political will, a government that believes in defence and is prepared to invest in defence and believe in its people; and, secondly, it requires strong economic management - a government that can create an environment in which wealth is created and strong surpluses are gathered so that money can be invested in the defence of Australia.This government has announced that over the next 10 years an additional $50 billion will be spent on acquiring equipment and maintaining that equipment. But the most important asset that we have in Australia in defence is our people. The men and women who wear and who have worn the uniform of the Australian Navy, Army and Air Force, more than any other group of Australians, have defined and shaped our values, our beliefs and our national identity. - I think the behaviour of the opposition is reinforcing the point that I have just made, Mr Speaker. Just before Christmas, the Prime Minister announced a $1 billion initiative, which is the first phase in a 10-year program to invest further in Australia's Defence Force people. That includes a major reform to the way in which we recruit people. We will reduce over the next year, from an average of 31 weeks to six weeks, the time it takes to recruit people into the Australian Defence Force. We will also be providing bonuses and allowances of up to $40,000, particularly for our lower ranks, other ranks and lower officer ranks.There will be further investment and reforms to Australian Defence Force cadets and there will also be changes to the way in which defence careers are managed throughout our Army, Navy and Air Force. Next year for the first time 1,000 young Australians, when they leave school, will have the choice of spending a gap year in one of our three services and wearing the uniform of the Australian Army, Air Force or Navy. The government is quite confident that not only will young Australians find increased resilience in themselves from that experience but many will subsequently go on to spend their careers and their lives serving Australia wearing the uniform. This government has committed itself to the task of building the Australian Defence Force by 6,000, from 51,000 to 57,000, over the next 10 years.In contrast, the Australian Labor Party in government set itself the task in 1989 of stripping 6,000 men and women out of the Australian Defence Force and the hardest task it had in doing so was that, because more than a million Australians were unemployed, no-one wanted to leave the Australian Defence Force. In terms of actions, as distinct from empty rhetoric from the opposition frontbench, it ought to be remembered that, when the Australian National University published its survey of candidates standing for election in the federal parliament in 2004, more people sitting behind the Leader of the Opposition wanted to cut defence expenditure than increase it. This government believes in defence, in security, in standing up for Australia, in a strong economy and in investing in our people and our equipment.</DOC>

 - If the Leader of the Opposition wants to go and address a meeting, he can do so. -  - If the Leader of the Opposition wants to address anybody anywhere in Australia, he is free to do so. He can ask me any question he likes any time this parliament sits. But I think he would bring a little more credit to this debate -  - and a little more credit to his own position if he would have the courage to answer the question that was put to him by Marius Benson on Radio National this morning. - All of this debate about the respective positions of the government and the opposition on Iraq arises from the fact that I made some very critical comments of a position taken. - It all started when the Leader of the Opposition took exception to the answer to a question that I gave on the Sunday program. Ever since then, I have been attacked by the Leader of the Opposition for the views I expressed on the consequences of a coalition withdrawal from Iraq by March 2008. -  - That is meant to be -  - the central issue of this debate. That is meant to be what this difference is all about. The Australian public knows my position; the Australian public does not know the position of the Leader of the Opposition.The member for Lingiari then left the chamber. - Let me tell the House again:BENSON: If the United States did withdraw all its troops from Iraq - The member forAdelaide then left the chamber. - Marius Benson asked:If the United States did withdraw all its troops from Iraq as Barack Obama advocates, what do you think would happen in Iraq?I have told the Australian people what I think would happen. The Leader of the Opposition does not have the courage to do the same thing. The Leader of the Opposition attacked me for the position that I have taken -  - on US troop withdrawal, yet he does not have the courage to tell the Australian people -  - what he believes would be the consequence of an American withdrawal. I speculate that the reason that he does not have the courage to answer that question is that he knows in his heart that the answer I have given is correct. He knows in his heart that I am right on the consequences of a coalition troop withdrawal. He knows that the national intelligence assessment is correct. He knows that Iraq would descend into full-scale civil war. - He knows in his heart that all of the consequences that I have spelt out would be fulfilled. That is why he does not have the courage to answer that simple question. He was asked twice by Marius Benson, and he completely ducked the question on both occasions. We have had an extraordinary spectacle for the last two days. The main subject of -  - political debate in this country has been the criticism of my assessment of what would happen if American troops were withdrawn. I have to cop that criticism because I have had the courage to state my view.The member for Cunningham then left the chamber. - For the last two days the major topic of political debate in this country has been the stance that I have taken on the consequences of an American withdrawal from Iraq. I have been prepared to answer that question, I have been willing to cop the criticism of the position that I have taken, but my opposite number in this place does not have the courage to answer that simple question. The reason that he does not have the courage -  - On two occasions this morning on national radio the Leader of the Opposition was asked to state his assessment of what would happen if US troops were withdrawn from Iraq in March next year, and on both occasions he ducked the question. I do not know the inner man but I speculate -  - On two occasions the Leader of the Opposition was asked a simple question. He was asked a question on the subject matter which has been central to all the criticism that he and others have made of me over the last two days. I have endured that criticism. I have been attacked in this country in the media and by the opposition. Why? Because I have stated an honest position and a strongly held belief about the consequences of what would happen. - Yet my opposite number, who has orchestrated and led that criticism, when asked the same question does not have the guts to give an answer.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Macquarie for his question. The funding of schools in this country is a shared responsibility. In the case of state government schools, state governments own, operate and manage those schools and have primary responsibility for the majority of the funding of those schools, and the federal government supplements that funding. In fact, we on this side of the House are proud of the fact - as the Prime Minister has just answered - that, since 1996, funding from the federal government for state government schools has increased by 118 per cent. Each and every year that we have been in government, funding for state government schools from the federal government has increased by 118 per cent. That funding comes in the form of capital and operating costs and special programs as needed.In fact, members of this House will be well aware of the Investing in Our Schools program whereby additional Commonwealth funding of $700 million will be invested in state government schools for educational items and infrastructure such as computers, libraries, playground equipment and maintenance and repairs. Members will also be pleased to know that, to date, there have been three rounds in the Investing in Our Schools program and 6,200 state government schools have been assisted with Commonwealth funds from the Investing in Our Schools program. That is almost 90 per cent of state government schools in this country.The member for Macquarie asked about New South Wales. In the three rounds, almost 2,000 state government schools in New South Wales have benefited from the Australian government's Investing in Our Schools program, including some 46 schools in his electorate - and I know they would be grateful for the member's support of this program.The program did, however, highlight the chronic need in many state government schools for basic educational items. The federal government has been pleased to step in and assist with our $700 million program. But, despite that commitment, the Australian Education Union, in an attack on funding for state government schools, has once more directed its entire attack at the federal government. In an article published today in the Daily Telegraph, Pat Byrne, the federal president of the Australian Education Union, penned some 65 lines on the state of funding for state government schools - and not once did she mention the state governments' primary responsibility for funding state government schools. Perhaps they were embarrassed to mention state government funding - and that may well be understandable. Let us take a look at what happened in the 2006 budgets.In its 2006 budget the New South Wales government increased its funding to its schools by 3.9 per cent. In its 2006 budget the Australian government increased its funding to New South Wales government schools by 10.7 per cent. If the New South Wales government had increased its funding at the same rate as the Australian government increased its funding for New South Wales government schools, there would be an extra $492 million in the New South Wales government school sector.This is the picture across the country. State governments across the country in their 2006 budgets increased funding for their schools by 4.9 per cent. The Australian government increased our funding for state government schools by over 11 per cent. If the state governments had matched the federal government rate of increase, there would be an extra $1.4 billion in state government schools across Australia.It is not as if they do not have the money. The GST is providing them some $40 billion this year, and yet there is $1.4 billion that should be in state government schools if they matched the rate of increase of the Australian government. The priorities of state governments therefore do not include state government schools, and the Australian Education Union and federal Labor have no credibility in the education debate until they call upon state Labor governments to match the federal funding for state government schools.</DOC>

 - As usual the Leader of the Opposition is misrepresenting not only what I say but also what the Minister for Foreign Affairs says. Let me go to the Baker-Hamilton report. Let me read to the House an excerpt from the Baker-Hamilton report. On page 37 it states:A premature American departure from Iraq would almost certainly produce greater sectarian violence and further deterioration of conditions, leading to a number of the adverse consequences outlined above. The near-term results would be a significant power vacuum, greater human suffering, regional destabilization, and a threat to the global economy. Al Qaeda would depict our withdrawal as a historic victory.Let me repeat that:Al Qaeda would depict our withdrawal as a historic victory. If we leave and Iraq descends into chaos, the long-range consequences could eventually require the United States to return.Those words are very close to the words of the national security estimate, which no doubt the Leader of the Opposition has read, in which it said amongst other things:If Coalition forces were withdrawn rapidly during the term of this Estimate, we judge that this almost certainly would lead to a significant increase in the scale and scope of sectarian conflict in Iraq, intensify Sunni resistance to the Iraqi Government, and have adverse consequences for national reconciliation.It went on to say:If such a rapid withdrawal were to take place, we judge that the ISF - Iraqi Security Forces - would be unlikely to survive as a non-sectarian national institution; neighboring countries - invited by Iraqi factions or unilaterally - might intervene openly in the conflict ...and it goes on in similar vein. When challenged to state his own view as to the consequences of an American withdrawal by March 2008, the Leader of the Opposition has sought refuge in cherry picking Baker-Hamilton. That is what he has sought to do. The Leader of the Opposition has sought refuge in cherry picking Baker-Hamilton and he has ignored the conditionality of the proposition put in Baker-Hamilton. He has completely ignored the assessment that if there were a premature withdrawal in Iraq by the American forces there would be the consequences that have been outlined.The most that the Leader of the Opposition would say this morning on AM when he was asked about the consequences of an American defeat or withdrawal in circumstances of defeat was: it would be bad. The sum total of the Leader of the Opposition's assessment of the consequences of an American withdrawal in circumstances depicted as defeat is that it would be bad. That is the one word: it would be 'bad'. I think it would be worse than that. It would represent a catastrophe for the West. It would have serious security implications for this country. A humiliated, weakened America after a withdrawal from Iraq depicted as a defeat would be bad news for the world and it would be bad news for the security of Australia.</DOC>

 - First, I thank the honourable member for Boothby for his question and for his interest. I have been in Munich at the security conference there and I had the opportunity to talk with US Defense Secretary Gates, several United States Republican and Democrat members of the Senate and the House of Representatives, the German foreign minister and the defence minister, the Pakistani foreign minister, the NATO Secretary General and the Swedish foreign minister. I also went to Ankara and met with the president, the foreign minister and the speaker of their parliament, who, Mr Speaker, sent his best wishes to you - I believe you are acquainted.The point is, in relation to the honourable member for Boothby's question, that of course this list of people - and there were others - have a variety of different views over whether it was right or wrong to throw Saddam Hussein out of office. But they are all united on one point - that is, a precipitate withdrawal from Iraq would be disastrous. It would be a victory for terrorists. It could draw neighbouring countries, such as Iran, Saudi Arabia and possibly even Turkey, into the conflict. It would destabilise the Middle East as a whole. It would have disastrous consequences in the war against terrorism. It would embolden terrorists around the world and bring terrorism closer to Western countries. But, ultimately, it would also be a human disaster for the people of Iraq. They are suffering enough. -  - Labor members interject, 'What about now?' They are suffering enough already. Why is it that the Leader of the Opposition would wish them to suffer more by the precipitate withdrawal of American troops? As the Prime Minister has pointed out, when the Leader of the Opposition - and before he was Leader of the Opposition, by the way, when he was the spokesman on foreign affairs - is asked, 'What would be the consequences of an American withdrawal?' he always ducks the question. On 17 October he was asked that question eight times and he decided it was not convenient to answer that question. Of course I know while I have been away he has been asked that question and has continued to duck it. He came up with this thought bubble that he might quote the Iraq Study Group, and so he ran that line. He would not answer the question -  - except for some blather on the Iraq Study Group, which is, to say the least, cherry picking, selective quoting and deeply misleading. The Iraq Study Group has been quoted by the Prime Minister, but it also said:The point is not for the United States to set timetables or deadlines for withdrawal, an approach ... we oppose.That is what the Iraq Study Group said. Labor members obviously have not read the report of the Iraq Study Group. There is no doubt about it: the international community believes it would be a mistake for America to withdraw precipitously and the Leader of the Opposition happens to think the reverse. The opposition spokesman on foreign affairs, the member for Barton, said, when President Bush announced the surge, that Labor was opposed to the surge. - Yes, he says. But the Iraq Study Group said that it could support a surge. So the Labor Party says it supports the Iraq Study Group; the Iraq Study Group said 'we could ... support a short-term redeployment or surge of American combat forces to stabilise Baghdad'. So when the Labor Party, in particular the Leader of the Opposition, desperately trying to find populist positions, starts flailing around on a national security issue, he is exposed, as he has always been exposed on national security issues, for being an opportunist and not a deep policy thinker.</DOC>

 - Just as I am happy to tell the Australian people what I believe would be the consequences of a precipitate American withdrawal, I am very happy -  - The member for Maribyrnong then left the chamber. - I will start my answer again. Just as I am happy to tell the Australian people what I believe would be the consequences of a premature withdrawal by America, I am happy to tell the Australian people again -  - I will start again. Just as I am happy to tell the Australian people what I believe the consequences of a premature withdrawal would be by the United States and by the coalition, I am more than happy to repeat to the Australian people what the goals and the strategy of the Australian government are in relation to Iraq. These have been goals and strategies that have been outlined by me, the foreign minister and the defence minister over a lengthy period of time, and they are that by our continued presence, by the contribution we make to the training of the Iraqi security forces, by the confidence we give to the people of the Iraq by our continued support, we are creating the circumstances where the people of Iraq -  - I repeat that our strategy is through what I have said, most particularly through the training that we are providing in cooperation with our allies, the contribution we are making by our presence to the general security situation, the backup role that we have in the southern part of Iraq, we are creating -  - the circumstances where it will be possible for the Iraqi security forces to provide in time the protection that is needed so that we can be reasonably confident that the people of Iraq can embrace the democracy they so clearly have voted for.That has always been our goal: to give the people of Iraq a bit of hope. You want to deny them a future. You want to deny them any hope. You want to condemn them to the violence and chaos which everybody from Baker through to General Pace through to the Prime Minister of Iraq through to the head of the CNN bureau in Baghdad, reported this morning on Radio National -  -  - Our strategy, in cooperation with our coalition partners, is to build the circumstances where the Iraqi security forces are able to provide a reasonable level of security in that country on their own so that the people of Iraq may be able to enjoy the democracy that they have on three occasions, in the face of the most fearful intimidation, voted to embrace. Those of us in this nation who have only ever enjoyed peaceful democracy should be in awe of the courage of 10 million Iraqis who, in the face of the most terrible intimidation, have voted to embrace a democratic future. That is our goal. Another goal that we have is to avoid the consequences of a premature withdrawal. The consequences of a premature withdrawal have been pointed out by Baker-Hamilton -  - Part of our goal is to avoid the disastrous consequences of a premature withdrawal from Iraq - as described by Baker-Hamilton, as described by the national intelligence assessment and as described by General Peter Pace, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who was here in Canberra only two days ago. This is what he had to say:I think that if coalition troops pull out prematurely then we will then have a humanitarian disaster - A humanitarian disaster! That is what the opposition want to happen in Iraq - a humanitarian disaster - because you will have sectarian violence that will get out of hand. You will have then many more Iraqis who are killed and you will have then, I believe, a spillover effect into Afghanistan.So our strategy is to create the circumstances of stability by staying until the job is done so that the Iraqi security forces can look after the security of that country without foreign assistance. And our strategy is also to avoid a precipitous withdrawal and a withdrawal of American forces in circumstances depicted as defeat.I say again - and I say it very deliberately to the Leader of the Opposition - that if out of Iraq America retreats in circumstances of defeat and humiliation, the consequences will be enormous not only in the Middle East and for Iraq but around the world, including for the long-term security interests of our nation.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Barker for this question. To specifically answer the question, the member for Barker need look no further than the fact that, until Melbourne Cup day last year, the states had not done any contingency planning at all for supplying water to the communities across the lower Murray-Darling Basin, particularly in the electorate of Barker, given the extreme circumstances as far as those water supplies were concerned. It took a meeting convened by the Prime Minister to address the issue and put in place those contingency plans. It took the federal government's announcement of a $10 billion investment to secure those water supplies into the future and take a national approach to what is a significant issue.The member for Barker knows only too well the track record of our government in securing water supplies in his electorate. We have made significant contributions to piping the Loxton irrigation system which have addressed a couple of issues: water security and salinity. It is very important to recognise our government's commitment. We have continually tried to improve the circumstances of industry and communities alike throughout the Murray-Darling Basin system.We have heard comments today from the National Farmers Federation supporting our National Plan for Water Security. We welcome that support. The farming community have been calling for this sort of investment for quite some time. They have been calling for a recognition of what needs to be done to improve the circumstances of the system. To them, this $10 billion investment represents an acceleration of the National Water Initiative, something they have been consistently calling for.This morning, along with the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources and the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, I met with representatives of the National Farmers Federation and also with an expert based group of representatives from the irrigation industry to discuss the implementation and the way forward with this plan. They are all committed to seeing the investment taken across a number of states in this system to generate more water - to save that water that we have indicated can be saved with the $10 billion investment. They want the federal government to get on with it. They want to be involved in this process and in the technical development of the scheme, and we welcome that commitment from the industry.It is important to note that we need to implement this plan and we need the states to agree that this plan needs to be implemented. The Prime Minister has made abundantly clear to the states our view of how this structure should work, and this decision should be taken in the national interest. That is the attitude of the National Farmers Federation. That is the attitude of the irrigators in industry that operate right throughout the basin towards this plan. It is time that the state governments also took that approach and started thinking about the communities, thinking about the industry and thinking about the jobs that rely on water security throughout the basin and beyond that can benefit from the implementation of this plan. They should understand that water security equals job security, and just at the moment in regional Australia there is no greater imperative to dealing with some of these issues than securing job security into the future.</DOC>

 - I have already indicated in answer to the last question what, to use the Leader of the Opposition's expression, mission statement. In an earlier question it was 'exit strategy'. I think, 'mission statement', is a better term to use. It is a rather more hopeful expression, and I am into hope; I am not into surrenders - so I think it is a rather more hopeful expression. I noticed this morning on radio that the Leader of the Opposition was sort of saying, 'Oh, well, we only have this number of people.' Yes, we only have just under 1,500. They are making a wonderful contribution in a very difficult situation, and it ill behoves the Leader of the Opposition to give any credence to the proposition that our contribution is inadequate.But what we want is a situation where the Iraqis can reasonably provide for their own security. They plainly cannot do that at the present time, and all the intelligence assessments suggest that. It stands to reason that if participants in the coalition from the very beginning - and that includes Australia - start nominating so-called exit dates, it will only encourage those who want to prevent the Iraqis being in a position to look after themselves to continue the mayhem and maintain the chaos, maintain the sectarian strife and the sectarian violence in the full knowledge that, eventually, nations having nominated an exit date will give fulfilment to that prediction.It seems to me to be an elementary exercise in common sense that when a nation that was in the coalition from the beginning stands up and says, 'We want to be out by X month in X year,' those who are opposed to our interests are going to say, 'All we've got to do is keep the mayhem going until that particular date and then we know we've got them.' That was really, in a sense, the starting point of some observations that I made at the weekend. I think it is very unwise in the extreme, if you are interested in a strategy that produces a positive result for the people of Iraq, to be nominating the benchmarks that the Leader of the Opposition is calling for. And he knows that. Part of the Leader of the Opposition's dilemma in this matter is that in his heart he knows what I say is right about the consequences of a precipitate coalition withdrawal. He must understand that if the coalition leaves before the Iraqis are able to look after themselves, the place will descend into greater conflict and into total civil war, and the consequences of that will be enormous.I say again to the Leader of the Opposition: our position has been clear. Our position has been forthright. We know it is not popular with a lot of Australians. We know it is not popular with the opposition - but at least we have the courage to state our position. At least we have the courage to state it and argue it. But all the Leader of the Opposition can do in response to my challenge is to go on radio this morning and try and cherry pick the Baker-Hamilton report and, when he is finally confronted on the third or fourth occasion with a question about the consequences of an American defeat in Iraq, he says, 'Oh, it would be bad.' It would be more than bad, let me say to the Leader of the Opposition. It would be, to use one of his expressions, a 'rolled gold' catastrophe for the security interests of our own nation.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Corangamite for his question. Overnight, the OECD released Economic policy reforms: going for growth 2007, which made recommendations for all of its members, including Australia. The OECD recommended five reforms that it believed would enhance growth and productivity in the Australian economy. The first was to 'reform disability benefit schemes'. Mr Speaker, you would know that the government has been attending to this, against the opposition of the Labor Party - alas! - over the last couple of years.The second thing the OECD recommended was to 'improve upper-secondary education attainments'. You would know, Mr Speaker, that it is a focus on this that has led the government to introduce the Australian technical colleges and, indeed, to push standards under a national curriculum, because the secondary education system is mostly run by the states.The third recommendation was to 'strengthen competition in network industries', such as electricity and telecommunications. Again, the government is focusing on this with the Australian energy market, which the Commonwealth has been leading at the national level.The OECD recommended that withdrawal rates for means-tested benefits be lessened, and of course the government has been putting this in place over successive budgets, reducing withdrawal rates on pensions, on family payments, on Newstart allowance and on other payments.The fifth thing which the OECD recommended was a phase-out or rationalisation of the award system, and members of the House will know that the Work Choices legislation is designed to make the Australian economy much more flexible.May I stop there and say that most of these reforms were opposed by the Labor Party. The Labor Party opposed reforming the DSP system when we introduced it, and cried foul about it. The Labor Party has been attacking the government over technical colleges. The Labor Party, through its state branches, has not been cooperating to the degree it should have in relation to competition and national energy markets. The Labor Party never had the wit to reduce withdrawal rates, which this government has attended to in recent budgets. And, of course, the Labor Party defends the award system.The Labor Party has been opposing all of these things which the government has been working on, just as it opposed balancing the budget, repaying debt, introducing the new tax system, reforming industrial relations and establishing the Future Fund. Then of course the Leader of the Opposition goes on television on the weekend and says: 'Coalition policy is my policy on the economy. Don't worry about my policy; it's all the coalition's policy.' The people of Australia are not fooled by that. They are not fooled by the bloke who turns up after the house has been constructed and says: 'It's all my handiwork. I might have opposed you when you were laying the foundations, tried to stop you putting up the frame, delayed the delivery of the tiles and kept the plumber away, but it's all my work.' That is the way the Leader of the Opposition approaches economic debate, and he is probably one of the best of them.I am asked what other models there are. One of the models that seem to have a lot of appeal to the Labor Party is the Venezuelan model - Hugo Chavez. Let me remind the House that Labor has signatories to an invitation to President Chavez to come to Australia so that he can talk to us here in Brutopia about how to improve things. It says:... what Venezuela has been able to achieve in so little time will be a source of inspiration and ideas for many in Australia. - This is the model which a former ALP president and current senators actually endorsed that we should learn from, and they are not the only ones. As you go around the ALP websites, there are a lot of people who are enamoured with President Hugo Chavez. For example, Duncan Kerr, member for Denison, is advertising a speech on Venezuela 'challenging US domination in the 21st century'. - It is the part of the question that asks about different models -  - The OECD has a recommendation in relation to the Australian economy and how economic policy should be adopted. The model which the government will not be following is the Venezuelan model of Hugo Chavez, as recommended by the member for Denison. He tells you how you can get down to the University of Tasmania and discuss:... the challenges and goals for the Bolivarian Revolution that is improving the quality of life of millions of poor, and empowering them to take control of their society and build an alternative system to the US Empire ...That is just one of the Labor Party members, but let me assure the member for Gellibrand that this will go on day after day because there are so many of the ALP who admire Hugo. They admire all of the shortages in the Venezuelan economy. They regard themselves as supporters of the Bolivarian Revolution - Bolivarian socialism.The Leader of the Opposition may be a Christian socialist by his own admission, but many of his backbench are Bolivarian socialists - and we are entitled to know how much influence they will have over economic policy in relation to a future Labor government. We are entitled to know where this motley, ragtag left-wing crew would take this country if they ever got their hands on the levers of power and brought the Bolivarian dictator's ideas for inspiration to Australia.</DOC>

 - In a situation that is so difficult and fraught in Iraq, it is difficult, as he knows, for anybody to responsibly give 'guarantees', as he calls them. But I can, using that term in a very broad sense, guarantee that, if the approach that he is adopting were to be adopted by coalition governments, you could guarantee total chaos in Iraq; you could be certain of that. The point I was making, as he knows, in answer to the earlier question is very simply that, if participant governments in the coalition start nominating dates by which forces are going to be withdrawn, what they are doing is inviting our enemies, inviting the terrorists in Iraq, to persist with the destabilisation and the mayhem and the bloodshed in the certain knowledge that ultimately the nerve will be lost and ultimately a withdrawal will take place. The Leader of the Opposition knows that. - If the Leader of the Opposition is wanting to make a constructive contribution to the debate, he should address his central responsibility, and that is to tell the Australian people what he honestly believes will be the consequences of a precipitate coalition withdrawal by 2008, next year. That is really what this all revolves around. This latest rekindling of the debate in the parliament on Iraq started because I was criticised for responding to a view about withdrawal by 2008. I have said what I think; I have told the Australian people. I have been criticised - an attempt was made to censure me by the Leader of the Opposition; I have been criticised in sections of the Australian media, not by all of it but most of it - but that is the consequence of taking a stand. - The problem is that those who sit opposite will not take a stand. -  - Well, they laugh! I notice the shadow Treasurer, the member for Lilley, was interjecting a moment ago. He was on Brisbane radio this morning - with my friend and distinguished colleague the Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs - and the question was asked by Madonna King:The situation is dire there right now, Wayne Swan. What do you think would happen if the troops did pull out?Answer:I don't know what would happen when the Americans pull out.That is what Wayne Swan had to say. Then he was asked, a bit later on, a very similar question, and he said, 'Oh, look, don't ask me. Go and talk to Kevin about it.' That is the measure of responsibility from this great contributor! - Can I just say to those who sit on the opposition front bench that this is a serious public policy issue. If you want to make a serious contribution to the debate, the first thing that you have got to do is to have the courage to say what you really believe. Don't hide behind cherry-picking the Baker-Hamilton report, don't hide behind misrepresenting what the Minister for Foreign Affairs said, don't hide behind slogans; actually front up to the Australian people and say, 'I believe that if the Americans were to pull out by March of 2008 then the following would be the consequence.' I have had the courage to do it; it is about time the Leader of the Opposition did likewise.</DOC>

 - First of all, I thank the honourable member, and I can tell her that the Australian government welcomes the agreement that has been reached at the most recent session of the six-party talks in Beijing. This is a good start. But, having said that, obviously it will require monitoring and follow-up.Clearly, we very much hope that, having reached this agreement, the North Korean government will fulfil their obligations to move quickly to disable permanently its nuclear programs. Under this agreement, within 60 days North Korea is to shut down and seal its nuclear reactor at Yongbyon and allow the entry of International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors. Also, working groups will meet within 30 days to discuss economic and energy cooperation with North Korea and the whole issue of the normalisation of political relations. The next phase of activity will see North Korea provide a complete declaration of all of its nuclear programs and the disablement of all of its existing facilities, and North Korea would then receive emergency energy assistance followed by a package of economic, energy and humanitarian assistance.I want to take the opportunity in particular to pay tribute to the American negotiator, Assistant Secretary Christopher Hill, whom many members of the government know, and to the Chinese government for the very good work that they have done also to help make this early step forward possible. This is of course the beginning of a process for North Korea to rejoin the international community. It does need to abandon all of its nuclear weapons and programs and return to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and subject itself fully to International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards.I am glad to say that Australia worked closely with our regional partners - Japan and China. I visited North Korea on a couple of occasions myself. We clearly worked closely with the United States in order to do what we could in support of an agreement. In continuing support of an agreement, we will consider what assistance in certain circumstances we might directly provide to North Korea. We have in the past provided food assistance through the World Food Program, and it is possible that we could provide some additional assistance, including energy assistance and safeguard expertise.I am glad to observe that the opposition's spokesman for foreign affairs, the member for Barton, has welcomed this agreement. That is good to see. I note, though, that he said in the same context that, whilst he welcomed this agreement, Iraq had been a 'distraction'. I thought that was a curious thing to say. It is pretty obvious that it has not been. It is pretty obvious that the Americans and the international community have been able to work on this issue. It has been laborious and difficult, but it is a process that has so far gone pretty well. Iraq or no Iraq, it has certainly been possible to do a good job on this. If American prestige is damaged by defeat in Iraq, it will make it much more difficult for the Americans to negotiate these sorts of agreements with other countries in the future. There is no doubt about that. If America is humiliated in Iraq, it will diminish American power and influence around the world and that will be at a price that all of us, including Australia, will pay.</DOC>

 - Let me start at the beginning. I believe that the participation of Australia in the coalition back in 2003 was correct. I remind the Leader of the Opposition that he was even more strident than I was in his assertion that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. He was not relying on intelligence when he gave that now famous address - and it is going to become even more famous as time goes by - to the State Zionist Council of Victoria. This is what he had to say:Saddam Hussein possesses weapons of mass destruction.It got even better - That is a matter of empirical fact. If you don't believe the intelligence assessments, you simply read the most recent bulletin from the Federation of American Scientists, which lists Iraq among a number of States in possession of chemical, biological weapons and with a capacity to develop a nuclear program. - He actually went further in what he said on weapons of mass destruction than anything I said in the addresses I gave to this parliament or to the National Press Club. Let us understand that, in terms of a motive for opposing Saddam Hussein back in March 2003, the Leader of the Opposition and I were actually in lockstep - he on the basis of scientific evidence and I on the basis of intelligence assessments. - That is why -  - as I indicated at the time -  - The Leader of the Opposition asked me whether the original decision was wrong. My answer is: no, it was not wrong. I stand by that decision. I will continue to be accountable for that decision in the bar of public opinion in Australia. I have never hidden from the responsibility for the decision that I took back in 2003 and, unlike the Leader of the Opposition, I have always been prepared to tell the Australian people what I believe will be the consequences of certain actions. The Leader of the Opposition is once again avoiding that responsibility. He asked me about guarantees. Nobody can give ironclad guarantees. Of course they cannot, and he knows that. If you want me to venture a view, I do not believe that, under the current administration or, I would hope, under any other administration, whether it be Republican or Democrat, the Americans will embrace a strategy that leads to defeat. That is the basis for my criticism of what the Leader of the Opposition is saying. He is, in effect, advocating a precipitate coalition withdrawal. It is my belief that sensible counsel will prevail in the United States, because a defeat in Iraq for the United States would be more than bad for the war against terrorism; it would be catastrophic. It would lead to not only a bloodbath in Iraq but the destabilisation of Saudi Arabia and Jordan and the end of any real hope of getting a Palestinian peace settlement. It would also embolden the terrorist cause in our part of the world. I say again to the Leader of the Opposition: why doesn't he have the courage to tell the Australian people what he genuinely believes will be the consequence of a precipitate coalition withdrawal by March 2008?</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hughes for her question and note that the unemployment rate in the great electorate of Hughes is now down to 3.1 per cent. Once upon a time they said five per cent was full employment, but in the electorate of Hughes it is 3.1 per cent. It would not have happened under David Hill. - That is right - a few of them. One of the reasons for that is that this government believe in helping families and we want to encourage women in particular to enter the workplace and to give them the choice of either staying at home with their families or, on occasions, going into the workplace. Since we were elected to government in 1996, one million more women have entered the workplace in Australia. There has been a 35 per cent increase in part-time work, participation rates are at all-time highs and the pay gap between men and women has narrowed. So we are getting to a better position in relation to the pay gap. In fact, the World Economic Forum's Global gender gap report 2006 described Australia as a leader in closing the gender gap.This is all in addition to our other initiatives in which we have doubled the number of childcare places, introduced and extended the family tax benefit, introduced the baby bonus, introduced the childcare benefit and provided up to $4,000 in tax deductibility for child care, helping to provide choice for Australian families.The interesting thing is that under the Labor Party between 1993 and 1996 - and note that their workplace changes were made in 1993 by Laurie Brereton and Paul Keating - the last three years of Labor, the wages gap between men and women grew; and it has narrowed under the coalition. That is what happens when you have a centralised system. That is what happens when you have an inflexible workplace system that does not take into account the aspirations of women. The Labor Party now want to return to that system. I note that Greg Combet yesterday sank to a new low when he wheeled out research -  - I noted the research yesterday from Professor David Peetz. He is cited by the trade union movement as an independent authority on our workplace laws. Aside from the fact that Professor Peetz's analysis was fundamentally flawed, and aside from the fact that he used outdated information and his report lacked academic integrity -  - I question why someone who claims to be independent would put their name to this report. I looked into Professor Peetz's history and found that he has -  - a rich level of experience. He worked for Gough Whitlam when Gough was Prime Minister - not that there is anything wrong with that; I think there is a presenter of The 7.30 Report who worked for Gough Whitlam -  -  - In 2001 he undertook an economic study, sponsored by the ACTU, on the work of union officials. His curriculum vitae lists his research interests as 'union membership' and he has been reported as being a singer in the trade union choir. This is the 'independent analyst'. But, wait, there is more. Professor Peetz, the independent expert, writes poetry for the Workers Online website, the official organ of Unions NSW, where they describe him as the 'resident bard'.On a more serious note, on 17 September 2001, six days after the terrible terrorist attack in New York, he wrote a poem which included a verse about a terrorist telling the President:Yes, evil will be overcome by good, but Sir, you seeI know you are the evil one, and good is on my side!This is a terrorist telling the President of the United States that he is evil and that good is on the side of the terrorist. This is the independent expert. He goes on to say:You are the force of Satan. - It comes back to the point that you have to judge people not by what they say but by what they do. The coalition has been about helping Australian families in the workplace, through the tax system and with family benefits. The Labor Party is about getting these concocted reports put together by flawed academics and parading them as a new paradigm for women in the workplace. The coalition is about getting more women into work if they choose to do so, providing them with better pay and better opportunities and helping Australian families. - </DOC>

 - I will come to the question of the alleged misrepresentation in the latter part of this answer, but let me for the information of the House and those who are very interested in this issue just remind them that I initiated discussion between the Australian Taxation Office and the New South Wales government following representation from the member for Gwydir, amongst others, and some irrigators in New South Wales about the treatment of these payments. I am told that those discussions are now concluded and that the Taxation Office will shortly be providing advice to the New South Wales Department of Natural Resources on their request for a class tax ruling. The details of this advice are a matter between the applicant for the ruling - in this case, the New South Wales Department of Natural Resources - and the Australian Taxation Office. The ATO's practice is not to provide a copy of their advice or a draft class ruling to anyone other than the applicant. The government is awaiting advice from the New South Wales government on their most recent discussions with the tax office relating to the class ruling. If irrigators have any remaining concerns with the tax treatment of water licences, the government is always willing to listen to their concerns, as it has done to date.The representations arose out of the fact that the payments had been structured and made in an environment where they were not intended to provide compensation for any perceived loss to farmers. In those circumstances they fell to be taxed as income. I am happy to provide to the member a letter that was written by Mr Ian McDonald on 28 August last year in relation to taxation arrangements for payments to landholders under the New South Wales government's Native Vegetation Assistance Package. It reflected the approach and the philosophy of the New South Wales government in relation to these matters. It says, inter alia:This package does not intend to provide compensation for any perceived loss for farmers.It also goes on to say, crucially, on page 2 of the letter:I am advised that it is likely that the Australian government - and they really meant there the tax office - will treat such payments as income.And, of course, they would, because they have not been designed to look as though there is compensation, despite the fact that the payments are clearly being made as a result of the loss in the value of their capital assets. It is quite clear from this that the approach of the New South Wales government was to have these things not treated as compensation, because their argument at the time was that they did not want to open up the possibility of compensation for the withdrawal of water rights.I think the member for New England will understand that this is very pertinent to the government's water package for national water security. This is really where the $3 billion component comes in. You have a situation where, if we are ever going to settle this water thing, we will have to take back entitlements, and people will be entitled to some compensation. Whatever may be the strict legality of every situation, they will be entitled to compensation. I think this is pretty good evidence that the New South Wales government did not want to be liable for compensation. That is one of the reasons why we have put $3 billion on the table.So let me say to the member for New England - and I also might say it to the member for Gwydir, who of course has been very active on this issue for a couple of years - that we have initiated discussions. I do not know what was in the tax office ruling, but I do live in hope that common sense will obtain and that what were clearly intended to be payments for capital losses will not be treated as income but will in fact be treated as what they were - payments for capital losses - and therefore the capital gains provisions of the taxation act ought to apply. I think, when he reads this letter and when other matters are discussed, he will see that, so far from us pushing back the pleas from Mr McDonald, we are in fact the people who have initiated a sensible discussion of this issue and we are the people who have provided, through our $3 billion component of the water package, a lasting solution to the overallocation problem, which is fundamental to fixing the future water security of the Murray-Darling Basin.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Forde for her question. I think it is important that this parliament notes that at least 90 per cent of all dental services in this country take place in the private sector, and that has always been the case. The former Labor government provided no support whatsoever to 90 per cent of the dental services of this country but, thanks to the private health insurance rebate, the Howard government provides no less than $440 million a year to support dentistry in this country.This government also supports dental services by massively increasing dental training places. There were just 221 dental training commencements in 1995; there were 312 in 2005; and, thanks to the policies of this government, there will be 560 dental training commencements in 2010. As well, this government provides for the first time some limited Medicare support for dentistry through the allied health professional initiative started in 2004. By contrast it is true that state-run public dental services are failing. Unfortunately, there are now some 650,000 people on state public dental waiting lists right around Australia. This is fairly and squarely the fault of the state Labor governments. I say to members opposite: why is it the Howard government's fault when the state governments do not do their job properly? How can the Leader of the Opposition say he is ending the blame game when he blames every single problem in this country on the Howard government? Let us be clear about this: between 2000 and 2004, the most recent period for which the figures are available, state dental funding fell from $374 million to $327 million a year. That is according to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare. -  - Oh, yes, the Howard government made the states cut their dental funding. Members opposite like to regale this parliament with horror stories about people pulling out teeth with pliers. I came across a story the other day - a very sad story. It was a pensioner who waited three years -  - to have six teeth extracted and then eight months to have dentures supplied. - This pensioner waited three years to have six teeth extracted and eight months to have dentures supplied. This poor pensioner was eight months without teeth. You would think that this happened under Howard's Brutopia but no, this was in 1994 on the Gold Coast when the Leader of the Opposition had been the de facto Premier of Queensland for five years. In 1995, when we had had six years of Christian socialist government in Queensland -  - In 1995, when the Christian socialist sitting opposite had been the de facto Premier of Queensland for some six years, his own health minister went into the parliament and said, 'Dental waiting lists of up to three years are unacceptable.' - I am always being asked what I am doing about dental services, and I am explaining, Mr Speaker, about what the Christian socialist sitting opposite did about dental services -  - when he was the de facto Premier of Queensland. His own health minister - The member for Hindmarsh then left the chamber. - His own health minister admitted that dental waiting lists were up to three years and he said that it was completely unacceptable. And this was in the period of the Keating government's dental scheme. They were taking the Keating government's money and at the same time the public dental waiting lists were three years. What sort of Christian, I say to the Leader of the Opposition, allowed a three-year dental waiting list? I tell you what: he is not very Christian but he is - The member for Richmond then left the chamber. - He calls himself a Christian socialist and I simply ask: what is so Christian about a three-year public dental waiting list? I say: do not let this guy wreck Australia's dental services like he did those of Queensland. -  - Yes.</DOC>

 - We do not apologise for introducing laws that have helped to create an environment where jobs can be created. I say this to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition: governments do not create jobs; business creates jobs. -  - I say to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition: a strong economy is the best basis upon which you can create a job. All the regulation in the world under the Labor Party in the 1990s -  - could not prevent nearly one million Australians losing their jobs. All the laws that the Labor Party had in the 1990s could not protect one million workers who were left on the scrapheap. The only way you can create jobs is if you have got a customer coming in the door -  - and under the coalition business is having strong growth and low inflation and we are helping to create an environment that creates jobs.</DOC>

 - I note that the unemployment rate in the member for Blair's electorate is now 5.2 per cent. In the last year of Labor it was 9.4 per cent. As I just said, sound economic management gives business the platform to be able to create jobs. That was confirmed by an overnight OECD report, and I urge the deputy leader to listen to this carefully. The OECD report backed our Work Choices legislation by saying that -  - the unfair dismissal law was an impediment to job creation. The OECD said:Strict employment protection legislation - such as unfair dismissal laws - is likely to increase the length of unemployment spells and thereby long-term unemployment. Likewise, the job prospects for those groups with relatively weak attachment to the labour market such as young workers and women can be compromised.Basically, they are saying that the Labor Party's job-destroying, unfair dismissal laws actually hurt those most vulnerable - </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for O'Connor for his question. As a Western Australian member, I know he will be particularly interested that the government has agreed to host at Geraldton a ground station for a United States military communication system, which is known as a Mobile User Objective System. It will be hosted on the same basis as all other Australia-US joint facilities and operate on the basis of our full knowledge and our full concurrence. These arrangements apply at Pine Gap and the joint geological and geophysical research stations, which are both near Alice Springs, as well as at the naval communications station, the Harold E Holt communication station at Exmouth, where the US also has access.These facilities in the new Mobile User Objective System are fundamental in underpinning and giving practical effect to the United States alliance. The government is strongly committed to the alliance as the key guarantee to our nation's security.I would have assumed that the Labor Party would welcome this initiative, but this morning, when Labor spokesmen were asked about it, their response was silence. Labor spokesmen did not come out and embrace this initiative as we would have expected. The Labor environment spokesman, the member for Kingsford Smith, was asked on five occasions at a press conference this morning whether he supported this facility. On five occasions the member for Kingsford Smith refused to answer. Indeed, it is interesting that the member for Perth, the member for Lilley, the member for Lalor - who, after all, is the deputy leader of the Labor Party - and the member for Grayndler all refused to answer a question and give endorsement to this proposal.Labor members are always happy to give their views on anything and they have been urged by the Leader of the Opposition to do what he used to do - that is, just talk endlessly in the media. One journalist said to the member for Kingsford Smith: 'But you've sung songs before about your opposition to US bases on Australian soil. Have your views changed since then?' He said:My views are clear and they've been clear since I have come to the parliament. I am here as a member of the Labor party to talk Labor policy.But never an endorsement of this joint facility, never an endorsement of these bases.Let us be absolutely frank about this: the member for Kingsford Smith was always a supporter of the closure of American bases in Australia - always. There he was at Alice Springs in the 1980s with fellow travellers demanding that Pine Gap be closed, close all the joint facilities. A great man of principle - 'US forces give the nod, it's a setback for your country' -  - The simple fact is that the Labor Party thinks that the United States should be defeated in Iraq, it thinks that these joint facilities are really not acceptable in Australia, and yet the Leader of the Opposition tries to pretend that he is a supporter of the US alliance. It is typical of Labor under the Leader of the Opposition: it plays all ends against the middle.</DOC>

 - They are lodged to ensure that they comply with the law. The protections we have put in place in the legislation are there to protect employees. I make this point: the Deputy Leader of the Opposition wants to see every AWA. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition and her union mates want to have a look at every employment agreement between the employer and the employee. That is exactly the way they do it. Greg Combet belled the cat this week when he said that the agreements they were opposed to are not only AWAs but also non-union agreements. The trade union movement wants to be there for every negotiation between an employer and an employee.We believe in freedom of choice. We believe in the opportunity for the individual to control their own destiny. We believe that individuals have the capacity to negotiate on their own behalf in a whole range of areas: buying a house, buying a car, entering into an employment contract and even raising children. We believe that individuals have the capacity to undertake those sorts of responsibilities, and we do not believe the union movement should have a role in every workplace agreement.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kalgoorlie for his question and for his very strong support for Defence facilities in Western Australia. I can confirm that for some two years now the Australian government has been negotiating with the United States an agreement that will see a number of ground based satellite communications systems placed in appropriate locations in Australia.The first one, which has not yet been finally agreed but which we expect to conclude in the next few months, is for an unmanned ground based facility at Geraldton, which will be a satellite communications system for the United States military and its allies. For reasons I would expect the House to appreciate, I will not go into the specific details, but the facility will support not only the operation of the United States military and its allies but also Australian troops.As the Minister for Foreign Affairs said, it will be conducted with the full knowledge and concurrence of the Australian government - in other words, we will be fully aware of the information that goes through that ground based system. We are also negotiating for a number of other ground based facilities which will have a non-military use. The United States-Australia alliance is extremely important. It is not just about friendship; it is also about our capability: military capability, intelligence sharing, the interoperability between our two militaries and, of course, the security of Australia's people, interests and values.I was asked about alternative views. The Australian National University conducts a survey every federal election and it asks the candidates seeking to be elected to the federal parliament their views on a number of issues. It is interesting that amongst its questions in 2004 the Australian National University asked: 'Is the United States a threat to Australia's security?' It is rather extraordinary that anyone would think of the need to ask such a question; nonetheless, the ANU asked people standing for election to the federal parliament whether they thought that the United States, Australia's key ally, is a threat to Australia's security. I was staggered to read that 22 per cent of candidates, or one in four, standing for election for the Australian Labor Party believed that the United States is a threat to Australia's security. - That means that, as we on this side look to that side, we know that every fourth person on average believes the United States is a threat to the security of Australia. The foreign minister reminded us that this morning the member for Kingsford Smith was one of five Labor Party frontbenchers asked whether they support the unmanned ground based military facility for Geraldton. I noticed that the member for Kingsford Smith was asked not once or twice but five times whether he supported it. He was asked whether he had sung about it. Well he has sung about it, but he has also written about it. I went to the library and obtained a book entitled Peter Garrett: Political Blues. When choosing books I -  - Having examined the front of the book, I then went to the back -  - because I thought it important to have a precis of the book. It said:In Political Blues he - that is, Peter Garrett - confronts us with the issues on which it is time for us to make a stand. - So the member for Kingsford Smith felt so strongly about these issues that he did not write a letter, he did not produce a pamphlet, he wrote a book -  - He wrote a book called Peter Garrett - quite an imaginative title - about the things upon which it is now time to take a stand. - I turn to page 95 in the book where, in relation to US facilities in Australia, the member for Kingsford Smith says:I look forward to the day when the eviction notices are formally presented to the American Secretary of State by the elected leader of the Australian people.In fact, he also criticised the US Secretary of the Navy because he 'believes in winning wars'. So the alternative government of Australia has one in four people in its ranks who believe the United States is a threat to the security of Australia, it has five frontbenchers who will not support a US base facility - to support our troops as much as its own - and it also has a frontbencher who is looking forward to the day when the leader of Australia 'evicts the United States and its facilities from this country'. It is time that the Labor Party stood up for Australia, the Australia-US alliance and Australia's best interest.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Greenway for her question. I think all members of the House would welcome the fact that the James Hardie company has now recognised its liability to those suffering from asbestos related diseases and that shareholders have now approved financial arrangements which should enable the company to meet its just liabilities - which it should never have sought to avoid when it entered into a very complicated arrangement to remove itself to the Netherlands. I can inform the House that the Australian Securities and Investments Commission has now commenced civil action against the company and a number of former and current directors and executives.These proceedings should not affect the compensation arrangements in any respect whatsoever, but the proceedings which have been taken by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission seek pecuniary penalties of up to a maximum of $200,000 per breach and the regulator is asking the court to consider banning individuals from acting as company directors in the future. Of course, these are just proceedings at this point - and, under our legal system, anybody is entitled to the presumption of innocence - but I want to remind the House that the government has been very clear about the necessity to bring to justice anybody who may have been in breach of the Corporations Act. Indeed, that is the reason why the government gave $7.5 million to fund this investigation and it is why the government passed the James Hardie (Investigations and Proceedings) Act 2004 so that evidence could go to ASIC from the Jackson inquiry. It is as a consequence of those measures that these proceedings have now been taken.Members will recall that it was proposed by the New South Wales government that it would give a release to the directors of James Hardie so that they would not be required to face proceedings of this kind. Members of the House will recall me raising that matter in this House and the Commonwealth opposing it. Fortunately, we were successful in preventing the New South Wales government from doing any such thing. If it had done any such thing, these proceedings could not have been brought. In fact, I got a letter from the CFMEU state secretary for New South Wales, Mr Andrew Ferguson - who is well known to people in this House - as recently as yesterday, asking me what the Commonwealth government was doing about this investigation. It is clear what the Commonwealth was doing about it. I should mention in passing that, if the Commonwealth had not been on the job, the New South Wales government would have given releases to prevent these actions from being taken. I think Mr Andrew Ferguson would be very pleased that the Commonwealth government was on the job, preventing the New South Wales Labor government from doing what it then proposed.I also mention in passing that federal Labor was proposing as recently as a few months ago a new tax break for James Hardie - a company-specific tax break for James Hardie - to give it an improved financial position to meet its just liabilities. That was being proposed by the member for Hunter with amendments in this House. This company never deserved a company-specific tax break. This company should have been, and now has been, brought to its just liabilities - without any tax privileges as were proposed by the federal Labor Party. These proceedings have now been brought - without any releases as were proposed by the New South Wales Labor government. That was an ask from James Hardie, a piece of brinkmanship which it tried to pull on, just as it tried to pull on the removal of the liability by a complicated relocation to the Netherlands. As this government has made clear all along, we believe those that may have breached their corporate law obligations should be brought to court, and these proceedings will do that.</DOC>

 - Because numerous reports have been done on it by the Department of the Environment and Heritage, the Australian Greenhouse Office, the CSIRO, the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and the Bureau of Meteorology. The Treasury, of course, has not constructed a model in relation to climate change, but as part of its role in advising the government it has undertaken extensive qualitative analysis of all the global literature in relation to this matter, including the UK government's Stern review and the IPCC assessments. The Stern review uses an integrated assessment model to make projections of the global impact of climate change. As far as the Treasury is aware, no country has developed a model of national consequences. All of the models that have been developed are in relation to global consequences. The Stern review itself says:Making such estimates is a formidable task _ It is also a computationally demanding exercise, with the result that such models must make drastic, often heroic, simplifications along all stages of the climate-change chain. What is more, large uncertainties are associated with each element in the cycle.That does not mean that it is not worth doing, and I think the Stern report was worth doing, although, as I have previously informed the House -  - The member for Grayndler has had one of those enlightened moments. As I have previously informed the House, it was well worth doing, although the Treasury, as it has given evidence in relation to the matter, had serious disagreements with the way in which it was done. I think I would be correct in saying the UK treasury itself had some serious disagreements with the Stern inquiry. But that does not mean it was not worth doing; it most definitely was worth doing. The assessments that the Treasury have done in relation to that in fact profited from that. If somebody were to go on from that and say that the government has not done any work, they would be seriously wrong.I cannot leave this question without observing that the member for Kingsford Smith called a press conference on this very issue today. After making a rather long introductory statement, he was asked this question:Peter, you're well known for your views on the US alliance. How do you feel about a new base in Western Australia near Geraldton? - You may well say, 'What's this got to do with the question?' because here was the answer:I'm astonished the Treasurer hasn't had his eye on the ball for climate change.That was very relevant! The next question was:Putting climate change aside, do you have concerns about a new US communications base at Geraldton?Answer: I am here to remind Australians the Howard government has taken its hands off the wheel in relation to climate change.Question: Mr Garrett, have you shed your previous views on US bases on Australian soil?Answer: Appropriate shadows will respond to that question.Question: Why don't you tell us what you think about this US base?Answer: I want to tell you what I think about climate change today. - I am nearly to the end. I have gone through the four denials and I am up to the fifth. Let me give you the last one:Question: But you sang songs before about your opposition to US bases on Australian soil. Have your views changed?Answer: My views are clear and have been clear since I came into the parliament. I am here as a member of the Labor Party to talk about Labor policy.Let me make this observation: whereas the Labor Party cannot bring itself to have a position on this base at Geraldton, they do not have much trouble in getting a position on Hugo Chavez and Venezuela. They are much more interested in the latter than the former.</DOC>

 - First let me tell the honourable member - and I am sure he does not need any reassurance of this - that the Australian government stands by the brave people of Iraq. - Between 10 million and 12 million Iraqis defied terrorists on three occasions to go and vote to reclaim their own future -  - We are certainly committed to those people; not to the terrorists and the insurgents and the militias, but to the vast majority of the Iraqi people who obviously want a more peaceful life and certainly have voted for a more democratic life than they had under Saddam Hussein. We are making a good contribution in a number of different ways in Iraq.The honourable member asked whether there are any other positions. My observation of the Leader of the Opposition over the years when he was the spokesman on foreign affairs is that the Leader of the Opposition has never held a strong position for more than a few days at a time. He will only hold a position for as long as it is popular, and when that ceases to be popular he will move to another position. He is all things to all people. That is my observation. He is getting a good run of course from the media at the moment, but once he comes under scrutiny I think that that will be exposed.Let us just take the whole issue that this question is about: the troops in Iraq. In November 2003 the Leader of the Opposition wrote to the Prime Minister and said:Now that regime change has occurred in Baghdad - which privately I think he may have been pleased about, but Labor was opposed to - it is the Opposition's view that it is now the responsibility of all people of goodwill, both in this country - Australia - and beyond, to put their shoulder to the wheel in an effort to build a new Iraq.So the Leader of the Opposition thought we should get in there, we had a responsibility and we should help secure Iraq and a future for the people of Iraq. Good; I agreed with that. In 2004, only a few months later, when the opposition starts running some campaign about 'troops out by Christmas', he said, 'Our objective is to have troops out by Christmas.' So a few months earlier he was in favour of getting in there and helping; it gets to, I think it was, May 2004 and it is 'troops out'.What is the position today of the Leader of the Opposition on this issue? He was asked on Meet the Press on Channel 10 on Sunday: would troops be out by Christmas? Having been in favour of that position in 2004, we have got to 2007 and his answer is:Of course not ... if I become PM I'd establish early contact ... with the Administration - that is the US administration - and talk about how that was best done. I don't intend to leave our ally immediately in the lurch ...What is all this about? When you forensically dig into the position of the Leader of the Opposition, this is Labor's position: Labor believes we should pull out the 500 troops in the Overwatch Battle Group in Dhi Qar Province, but only if there is somebody else who can be found to fill the gap. So that is 'troops out', and the Leader of the Opposition can tell all the people in Australia who are in favour of 'troops out' that he is in favour of 'troops out'. What doesn't he tell those people? He doesn't tell those people that not only does he believe the security detachment should remain in Baghdad - which is reasonable; I am not making an argument about that - but he also believes that the 200 or so sailors on HMAS Toowoomba should remain in Iraqi waters protecting oil platforms. He believes that the 140 Australians who support the C130s in and around Iraq should remain. He believes that the P3C aircraft and the 170 who go with them should all remain.The Leader of the Opposition's position - far from being clear, as some people are trying to claim - is that, of the 1,400 people we have in Iraq, Labor might take out 500 of them if somebody can be found to fill the gap and the other 900 would all remain in Iraq. And Labor's position - repeated yesterday by the Leader of the Opposition - is also, very interestingly, that the Americans should get out of Iraq - in defeat, in ignominy.So what is the position of the Leader of the Opposition? The answer is: his position, as usual, is every position. If you are in favour of sticking up for the Iraqis, the Leader of the Opposition has a policy for you. If you are opposed to it, the Leader of the Opposition has a policy for you. If you want troops in Iraq, yes, he can deliver that; if you don't, yes, he can deliver that. If you support the Americans, yes, he can do that. If you support the insurgents and the terrorists and so on, yes, he can deliver that as well. This country deserves a Leader of the Opposition with a bit of strength, a bit of commitment. Here we have a Leader of the Opposition who vacillates and, in a populist crusade, tries to find a position that will suit absolutely everybody.</DOC>

 - Well, Mr Speaker, I suppose that is the best he can do! - Not bad, he says! Here we are, in the second week of this sitting, he bowls up, he hasn't asked us a question about jobs or interest rates or infrastructure or tax -  - and that's the best he can bowl up. Well, of him, I can only think of one description: some mothers do have 'em! And we are very glad your mother did, if I may say so -  - and we would like you to stay precisely where you are. In relation to the economy, this is not an economy which runs itself. This is a $1 trillion economy, and during the period in which I have been the Treasurer of this country -  - During the period I have been Treasurer there has been a great deal of risk in the Australian economy. We had to take the Australian economy through the Asian financial crisis, the US recession, September 11, war, SARS and the worst drought in 100 years. And all of the way as we took it through all of those risks - and one of those risks is very much on the board at the moment: the drought which Australia is suffering from - this government had to do the heavy lifting. - I am asked about risk in the Australian economy and the point I am making is that there is a lot of risk in the Australian economy. There is so much risk in the Australian economy -  - that the Australian economy has to be managed. Let me let the House into another secret: there is so much risk in the Australian economy that Australia cannot afford the member for Lilley as the Treasurer. There is so much risk in the Australian economy that we cannot have a nouveau for Prime Minister.The member for Melbourne then left the chamber. - There is a lot of risk in the Australian economy. It is true that the Australian economy has weathered that risk a lot better under coalition management than it did 10 years ago. But if anybody in Australia thinks that you can walk people in to manage the Australian economy on the basis that they once ran a cabinet office in Queensland or on the basis that they were once an ALP state secretary in Queensland, they are wrong. Economic management is much too important to be left to the Labor Party. - Yes.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Bonner for his question. I can inform him that over the life of the current health care agreements the Commonwealth will provide $42 billion to the states for public hospital services, which is a 17 per cent real increase over the previous agreements. That $42 billion includes $8 billion for public hospitals in Queensland, which is a 21 per cent real increase. The Commonwealth has increased its funding. Let us give credit where it is due: the states have also increased their funding. In fact, the states have increased their funding more. The Leader of the Opposition likes to attack the blame game but one thing the blame game has done is that it has shamed the states into finally spending what they need to spend on their public hospitals. Thanks to this increased spending there are now 54,000 public hospital beds in this country. There are now 2,400 more public hospital beds than in 2004.The Leader of the Opposition might think we are living under the jackboot heel of Howard's 'Brutopia' but at least we have got more hospital beds, thanks to the policies of the Howard government. The Leader of the Opposition said the other day:Remember I worked in Queensland from '88 really until '96 ... purely on schools, hospitals, water, environment, land rights, law and order - that was the bread and butter of my daily life ...He is turning his back now because he does not like to be reminded of the silly things he has said. He said:The thing about state governments is that ... people legitimately demand performance ...I thought: how was this golden age of Christian socialism in Queensland? I discover that when the Leader of the Opposition was the de facto Premier of Queensland, three operating theatres at the Princess Alexandra Hospital were closed in August 1994 and three operating theatres at Royal Brisbane Hospital were closed in November 1994. Between 1989 and 1995 'Premier Rudd', as he thinks of himself, closed 2,200 hospital beds in Queensland. - These days the Leader of the Opposition says that his greatest hero is Dietrich Bonhoeffer, or it might have been Keir Hardy, depending upon which journalist he is talking to. In those days the Leader of the Opposition was known as 'Dr Death' because he closed 2,200 hospital beds in Queensland. - I am a little confused. I simply referred to the Queensland public's terminology. They called the Leader of the Opposition 'Dr Death' because of his record in Queensland public hospitals. If the Leader of the Opposition has an objection, he should raise it and he should let the flunkies sit down and stop fighting this fight for him. -  -  The member for Lingiari then left the chamber -   - Mr Speaker, on the point of order, if the Leader of the Opposition asks me to withdraw because he finds it offensive, I will withdraw, but I am not going to withdraw for this one.A Member must not use offensive words against:(a) either House of the Parliament or a Member of the Parliament;Standing order 90 - I am getting straight to the point of order - says:All imputations of improper motives to a Member and all personal reflections on other Members shall be considered highly disorderly.Standing order 91 goes to what action you should -  
An opposition member - Point of order, Mr Speaker. - I simply make the point that after the Leader of the Opposition's record in Queensland, there is a clear message to the Australian people: do not let this man wreck Medicare like he wrecked the Queensland public hospital system.</DOC>

 - I comprehensively answered this question before, and I will do it again. If the question is, 'Do I think there is risk in the Australian economy?' then the answer is yes. I will say that to the House and I will say that to the people of Australia, as I just have. There is risk in the Australian economy, and let me repeat: there is so much risk in the Australian economy that you cannot trust the Labor Party to run it. You are going to hear me say that hundreds if not thousands of times between now and the next election. - We are stronger now that we do not carry $96 billion worth of debt. We are stronger now that we have had nine surplus budgets. We are stronger now that we have established the Future Fund. We are stronger now that we have reformed the tax system. We are stronger now that we have Work Choices. Are we strong enough to withstand a Labor government? No way!The member for Cowan then left the chamber.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Hinkler, who has a deep and abiding interest in the jobs of coal workers. The coal industry is particularly important to his electorate, as it is to many other electorates around Australia. Queensland alone exported $14 billion worth of coal last year. That is a very significant contribution to the Queensland economy. I mentioned a couple of days ago that one in eight of Australia's export dollars comes from coal - and in Queensland that figure is very much higher; perhaps as much as one in four - and so we rely very much as a nation on the coal industry for our wealth and for our growth and for the progress and development, particularly of much of regional Australia. Our clean coal is making a significant contribution also into reducing greenhouse emissions and, if it were to be replaced by coal from China or other parts of the world, the problems that the world would face in relation to greenhouse issues would be much greater.In this context it is almost unthinkable that there could be threats to the future of this industry. It is almost unthinkable that there would be people who would want to close that industry down, and yet Senator Bob Brown has made it absolutely clear that in his view the coalmining industry should be phased out in three years and all the coal fired power stations also closed down in that time. But today he has gone even further to compare Australia's coalmining industry with heroin dealers. Senator Brown said that Australia is like a heroin dealer feeding the habit of the world's dependence on coal. For Senator Brown to compare Australia's 30,000 workers in the coal industry with heroin dealers I think reaches an absolutely new low. That is a disgrace. Let him go to the people of Gladstone and tell them that he is likening them to heroin dealers.As I said before, we could just dismiss that as being the whacky comments of the Greens, but of course we know that Labor is vigorously pursuing a preference deal with the Greens. They badly want to be on the same truck and on the same platform with the Greens when it comes to the next election. The honourable member for Kingsford Smith well and truly let the cat out of the bag when he said that the expansion of the coal industry, as we have seen in the Hunter Valley over the past decade, is a thing of the past and dismissed coal jobs as merely 'hypothetical'.That is even causing some alarm, we read, in the Labor Party. Senator Evans, the opposition resources and energy spokesman, apparently told the shadow ministry earlier this week that they should be aware of repeating the Latham blunder on the forestry industry, and another Labor member is bemoaning how badly the member for Kingsford Smith's comments have gone down in the Hunter Valley. I do not know who the unnamed member was, but I am sure the member for Hunter would be very concerned about the comments of the member for Kingsford Smith in relation to the coal industry. The reality is we have got the Greens demanding an end to this industry, calling coalminers the equivalent of heroin traffickers, and we have got the Labor Party actively pursuing their preference deal at the next election. This kind of behaviour is a serious threat to the coal industry, an industry which has served this country very substantially. It is high time Labor disassociated itself from these bids to win over the Greens to endeavour to establish a preference deal with a party with this kind of attitude to one of Australia's great industries.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hunter for his question and welcome him to the Defence portfolio. - I have not ever suggested or even implied that the member for Hunter would be in the 25 per cent of Labor MPs who think the US is a threat to Australia's security. The member for Banks, to his credit, whilst not being involved in the Defence portfolio particularly but having a keen interest in the Australia-US alliance, took the initiative to ask me a question about this. Had the member for Hunter been carefully listening to the answer, he would know that I had said that the final negotiations are not yet concluded. - When the memorandum of understanding is finally signed and agreed by the United States of America, of course he will be welcome to complete disclosure. But, if in the meantime he would like even more information than I have made available to the member for Banks, we would be most pleased for him to receive it. I must say I do welcome - although it appears to have taken in the vicinity of some six or seven hours - the Labor Party's support for a US facility based in Australia.Leave granted.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for McMillan for the question. His commitment to the coal industry and to clean coal is well known, and the benefits of our investment in clean coal technology will be felt particularly in his electorate.The Australian government have committed $2 billion to climate change mitigation, and we are getting results. We are going to meet our Kyoto target. By 2010 there will be 87 million fewer tonnes of carbon in our atmosphere. That is equivalent to the total emissions of the entire transport sector. This is being achieved by investment in a range of projects, in renewables, but above all we are focused on clean coal. Why is that? Because coal is the world's most abundant energy source. It dominates the energy sources of the world's most active and growing economies - China and India. They are 70 per cent dependent on coal; they need coal, they have coal and we have to help them clean it up. We are helping them do that. We have invested more than $410 million in projects and technologies to clean up coal, including the world's single largest carbon capture and storage project. We are working with China through the AP6 and through the bilateral relationship, because, unless China can get the energy it needs and have the technology to enable it to reduce its emissions, all of us know that, no matter what we do here, no matter what hardships we endure, they will have no effect on global warming. Cooperation on clean coal technology is vital to our future.But what are the alternative views? We have the Greens policy. Senator Bob Brown proposes that we shut down the Australian coal industry. The member for Kingsford Smith has said that the expansion of the coal industry in the Hunter Valley is a thing of the past. When he is asked, 'What is the impact of your climate change policies on jobs going to be?' he says, 'That's a hypothetical question.' When he's asked by a reporter who, out of sheer frustration while trying to get a response, says, 'Does this mean we'll have to pay more for our energy?' the member for Kingsford Smith says, 'I don't know what 'pay more' means.' It is not just on US bases that he is coy: he will not answer a question on anything.I have looked carefully to see where the precedents are for the policies of the opposition for this big 60 per cent unilateral cut in emissions. What are they looking at? What are the examples? What is the history? There have been two groups of countries which have had enormous reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. Take Russia. Russia's emissions dropped 25 per cent between 1990 and 2004. Why was that? Total economic collapse, inflation of more than 11,700 per cent, a halving of GDP, and by 2004 they were still 15 per cent below 1990 GDP in real terms. So that is one example. If you want to cut greenhouse gases dramatically, slam your economy into the ground, impoverish your country, shut down your industry.That may be the example that the member for Kingsford Smith is looking at. But there could be another, because Labor looks not just to Hugo Chavez for political inspiration but also to Margaret Thatcher. In 2004 Britain's emissions were down by 15 per cent. How did Britain achieve this? I will tell you. They shut down the coal industry. The member for Hunter should listen to this because his constituents include many descendants and relatives of British coalminers. In 1990 Britain produced 100 million tonnes of coal. This year it will produce 20 million tonnes of coal. There were 280,000 workers in the British coal industry in 1990; today there are 10,000. Now Britain is importing coal itself. Which of the two choices does the member for Kingsford Smith favour? Does he want to be Bob Brown in government or play Margaret Thatcher to the coal workers of Australia? Either way, it is a grim prospect for our greatest export industry.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Mackellar for her question. I certainly accept that regular rest and recreation is very important for health, particularly for the health of workers. For more than 50 years, thousands of workers had healthy holidays at Unions NSW's holiday retreat of Currawong in Pittwater, in the electorate of Mackellar. Not any more. Unions NSW have just sold Currawong - to a developer, no less. But they did not sell it for $30 million as one bidder offered. They did not sell it for $25 million as the Macquarie Bank offered. They ended up selling it for $15 million in one of the most mysterious deals of recent times.This is certainly going to damage the health of workers because the courses on occupational health and safety previously run at Currawong cannot continue. I looked at the ACTU website today and it says the sale of Currawong means that they are 'therefore unable to guarantee at this stage that residential courses will go ahead'. I discovered from Piers Akerman's article in the Daily Telegraph today that the entity advising Unions NSW, through a complicated corporate structure, was also the entity that was purchasing the site. There is a clear conflict of interest in this sale that is going to damage the health of workers in New South Wales.The same person who co-controls the entity advising Unions NSW also co-owns the purchaser of the site. This gentleman, Mr Alan Linz, had been a fellow director of Unions NSW boss John Robertson of a company called Getonboard, whose directors also included New South Wales Treasurer Michael Costa and New South Wales Labor secretary Mark Arbib. There is a clear case of insider dealing here.I ask this House, I ask the people of New South Wales and I ask the honest unionists of New South Wales: where are the missing millions? Why did Unions NSW sell this property for $15 million less than they could have had? This deal has 'scam' written all over it. I call on the New South Wales Police Fraud Squad to investigate the links between Mr Linz and senior Unions NSW figures and I particularly call on the New South Wales Fraud Squad to investigate why one of the companies controlling the advising company was registered in the British Virgin Islands -  - You can be quite confident that I will be doing just that, Mr Speaker, because I am concerned about scams which damage the health of the workers of New South Wales, and the Leader of the Opposition, who likes to give unctuous lectures to people about standards, needs to explain why Unions NSW entered into an arrangement that involves a company registered in the British Virgin Islands, no less - one of the world's most notorious tax havens - involving people whose ownership of it is a deep, dark secret because of that registration. Who are the shareholders here? Who are the beneficiaries here? What is the relationship between senior Labor Party officials in New South Wales in this deal? And where did that $15 million go? We deserve some answers.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. Twenty million Australians expect their national government to govern this nation in the national interest, and if there are circumstances not in the national interest in this country which need to be identified then they expect us to identify them. - Just as this government has shouldered the responsibility for the last 11 years of fixing up the mess that the Labor Party left us after being in office for 13 years - and while we have a bunch of state Labor governments dragging the nation down - we will continue to identify their fallacies and what they are doing in their policies. The Labor Party, led by the new Leader of the Opposition, can squark all they like about the 'blame game'. The reality is that Australians want this country run properly, whether it is at a federal level or at a state level or at a local government level. They expect the dollars that we are deploying on their behalf to be spent wisely -  - and they expect the country to be run properly. We have continued, over the last 11 years -  - in the face of opposition at every turn from the Australian Labor Party, to fix up the mess that they left us. If the state Labor governments continue to leave a mess behind them, we will continue to talk about it because, at the end of the day, we are expected to run this country in the national interest.So, if the member for Fraser wants to ask questions about why ministers continue to blame state governments when they are wrong and it is their area of responsibility, we are going to continue to do that. We will hold the Labor Party to account for the mess that they left this country in 11 years ago and the hard work that we have had to do to fix it up. We will hold to account the state Labor governments in Australia, who continue to drag this country down when the rest of the country is trying to move forward. So, in answer to the member's question, we will continue to identify bad policy and bad decisions whenever they stick their heads up.Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Barker. Last Friday was a great day for the Murray-Darling Basin. I am glad to report to the House that New South Wales, South Australia, Queensland and the Australian Capital Territory have agreed to the Commonwealth's plan. Victoria indicated on Friday through its Premier that it was unable to do so, although discussions between Victoria and the Commonwealth go on. It is my hope and, I believe, reasonable expectation that Victoria will see the wisdom of joining the other states in a clear referral of power to the Commonwealth so that the plan can go ahead as originally announced.This is a historic investment in the irrigation infrastructure of our nation. It involves $10 billion of new Commonwealth money. It involves about $6 billion of that being spent on irrigation infrastructure and about $3 billion being spent on buying back water entitlements, excess water entitlements and overallocations, all of which have occurred on the watch of the states. This is a case of the Commonwealth not only accepting responsibility for something that occurred under the eye of the states but also paying the cost of fixing the problem.I say to the people of Victoria: it is in your interests that your state government join the rest of the states because Victorian irrigators stand to benefit to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars at the very least from this plan. Victoria has a lot riding on this plan and, if Victoria stays outside the arrangement, Victoria will suffer. I hope that all members of this parliament, on both sides, who represent Victorian electorates will go back to those electorates and encourage their constituents to encourage the Victorian government to join the other states. This is not a time for Victoria to inflict itself with pain and punishment. Let's not have a self-inflicted wound from Victoria. Let Victoria join the other states and let us go forward with a plan that will rescue the great River Murray, the great River Darling and the whole basin, which is so important to the future of this nation. The plan will deliver long sought after national water security.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question, and I acknowledge the interest that he takes in economic policy. I can tell him that managing expenditures is vitally important for the Australian economy. If we had not been careful about managing expenditures in this country, the budget would still be in deficit and we would be carrying $96 billion of Labor Party debt. A big part of the economic success of the last 10 years has been balancing the budget and repaying Labor debt. That requires careful management of expenditure.I have watched in amazement over the last week as the Leader of the Opposition has run around Australia promising state premiers every pet project that he can imagine. He began in Queensland, on 18 February, promising the Queensland government $408 million for a recycled water pipeline. He moved on to Western Australia, where he promised money for Gnangara Mound, Canning Dam and the Harvey irrigation project. He moved on to divesting Commonwealth royalties back to the state of Western Australia -  - The member for Swan interjects - one of the voices of Brian Burke in this parliament. One wonders whether he has had a phone call telling him when to interject and when not to.The Leader of the Opposition then moved on to South Australia, where he promised money for a desalination plant for BHP in the Spencer Gulf, and he is moving back to Queensland at the end of this week to promise the Queensland government money for sequestration in relation to the Stanwell power project. All of this would be serious, and if he had actually done some work on any of these projects he could tell you how much water they use, he could tell you how much these projects would save and he could give you some estimate, dollar per litre, of why this may actually be in the national interest. But when he was asked in South Australia how the project for desalination was going to work, he had no idea of the water BHP was using and no idea of how much it would save. He said: 'It's 160 from us and 160 from the state.' Matt Abraham asked him:How much from BHP?Mr Rudd answered:BHP's investment is already substantial.Matt Abraham asked:In the desalination project, how much are they putting in?Mr Rudd answered:In terms of the precise investments, in terms of their individual use, those figures I don't have to hand.He did not have to hand how much water they were using, how much he was going to save or how much they were going to invest. The only thing he had to hand was that he had 160 - as he calls it; this Leader of the Opposition is used to big sums - for the state of South Australia.Let me remind the House of one of the cardinal, iron laws of Australian politics: never stand between a pot of money and a state Premier. You will be run down on every occasion. And if you open up the federal Treasury to the state premiers, you will be killed in a stampede. State premiers would make the running of the bulls look like a cat race. They would run right over you. The state premiers see this bloke coming. What they want is somebody who could open the federal Treasury, lie down and make himself a doormat. What better person to do that than an ex state public servant - somebody who is used to taking his orders from a state Premier? You can see why the state premiers of Australia, gearing up like the bulls for their run in Pamplona, are licking their lips. This will be no bullfighter; this will be a doormat opening the federal Treasury to a rapacious group of people against Australia's national interest. - I have, absolutely.</DOC>

 - Very easily. I will quote something else that I said to the Financial Review interviewer. I said:If the government sought to reflect too much populism on this issue, there would be an understandable backlash in the business community against it.I understand the view that [Qantas] is an icon, but the personal views of the prime minister or the treasurer or senior ministers shouldn't be allowed in a free enterprise economy to influence who owns companies _I regard that as an absolutely unexceptionable statement of an operating principle in the sort of economy that we have, and I am fascinated that the Leader of the Opposition apparently has a different view. I go on to say:... shouldn't be allowed in a free enterprise economy to influence who owns companies, provided the law is observed and the rules are obeyed.I am absolutely certain that the Treasurer will ensure that the rules are observed and the law will be obeyed; he will exercise his prerogatives, he will see that the Qantas Sale Act and the foreign takeovers legislation are observed and, as always, he will place the national interest ahead of anything else.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Fadden for his question. Obviously, he is very interested in the issues surrounding climate change and emissions of greenhouse gases. Of course, all transport industries are, at some stage, going to be asked to make a contribution through changes to the structure of their fuel. We are seeing, for example, in road transport, the roll out of biofuels like ethanol and biodiesel which are helping to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the overall economy. Obviously, when you think about the growth of aviation travel both here and globally, the aviation industry is going to have a contribution to make.Along with the technologies that we are investing in, like those in the Low Emissions Technology Demonstration Fund, the $400 million we are investing in solar energy in Australia, and the investment in clean coal technology, we can do practical things with the aviation sector as far as reducing the level of their emissions. It is interesting to note that there is already a process in train as far as international aviation is concerned, called flexi-tracks, where international carriers can identify different routes to travel to take advantage of weather conditions and wind velocity, which can actually save time and save emissions. In a recent example, a flight from Melbourne to Dubai saved 10 minutes travel time and burned 2.7 tonnes less fuel because they identified a better path to travel given the weather conditions. That actually saved 8.2 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions.One need only think about circumstances in Australia. How often when you have travelled have you arrived at the port of destination and your plane has had to be put into a holding pattern? Planes that are put in a holding pattern burn four to five times as much fuel whilst waiting to land than a plane en route or, obviously, a plane sitting on the ground. We need to better manage the aviation sector so that, if there are going to be delays at the destination end, the plane should be delayed at the port of departure.There are some very practical real-life solutions that we can implement through processes of management in different industries that will assist our nation meet its greenhouse gas emissions targets. Just as there is no need to close down the coal industry to save the emissions that we need to save in that sector - by introducing and investing in clean coal technology - there is no need to close down the aviation sector or the road transport sector. We just need to deploy better management practices that are focused on limiting and restricting those emissions, which will help make a contribution towards the overall national target.</DOC>

 - Without having the Reserve Bank figures with me, I do not intend to say yes or no to that, but I can say that interest rates were much higher under Prime Minister Keating. I can also say that the value of homes is much higher now than it was under Prime Minister Keating. I can also confirm for the gentleman who sits opposite that, under this government, as a result of the very low interest rates that we have enjoyed over recent times, people have borrowed and invested in more expensive homes and more expensive assets. As I say, without having the figures with me, I am neither going to confirm nor deny it but rather state those facts.Leave granted.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Grey for his question. I can inform him that the government is very concerned about international boycotts that are being used against Australian wool growers to try to get international buyers to ban the purchase of Australian wool. Australia's farmers do it tough enough already. They do it tough enough when they are fighting against drought and all of the vicissitudes of the Australian climate. They know that their wool product is the best in the world, and they deserve every help that they can possibly get from government to get their wool to market and their wool purchased by international buyers.Unfortunately, Australian wool growers are now suffering from secondary boycotts. Secondary boycotts are where somebody tries to get a customer not to deal with a target or a supplier not to deal with the target. Quite often we have seen secondary boycotts in relation to industrial action. The current boycott - which is being organised by a group called PETA, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals - is to get the customers of Australian wool growers not to buy Australian wool. One of the spokeswomen for PETA is the pop star Pink. She is protesting about the mulesing of sheep. Whatever Pink's singer-songwriter credentials are, it is highly unlikely that Pink is an expert on the mulesing of Australian sheep. Anybody who knows the risk of flystrike in Australia knows that the practice of mulesing, far from being exploitative or cruel treatment of sheep, is actually one that is preventative of a far worse fate that could befall Australian sheep.As a consequence of this, the government will be amending the Trade Practices Act to allow the ACCC to take representative action for secondary boycotts. What that means is that, rather than an individual farmer having to fund the action for their individual damages - which would be a big cost for a small sum - the ACCC can take a representative action on behalf of all Australian farmers to recover damages, which collectively would be a much larger sum. The ACCC can take representative actions for other offences against the Trade Practices Act - why not a representative action for a secondary boycott in contravention of the Trade Practices Act?The government has previously sought to give the ACCC the power to bring representative actions for secondary boycotts; unfortunately the opposition has voted this down in the Senate, and as a consequence denied this remedy to Australian farmers. The government will be re-presenting these amendments and now that the Labor Party wants to re-establish credentials with the Australian business community, we ask the Australian Labor Party to reconsider, to do something which is obviously pro-business, and to do something to help Australian farmers in this difficult situation.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hinkler for his question and for his strong support of the coal industry in Central Queensland - and his support of the electricity industry, the alumina industry, the aluminium industry and all those other industries that he looks after in his electorate so well. Since the Prime Minister's announcement in June 2004, the Low Emissions Technology Demonstration Fund has been a cornerstone of the Howard government's climate change strategy. The Low Emissions Technology Demonstration Fund has delivered to date some $310 million to five cutting-edge low-emission projects, including of course some $175 million already put on the table for low-emission coal technologies. -  - I have only just started; I have plenty more to come. For example, $50 million has been made available to International Power's clean coal project at the Hazelwood power station in Victoria. That project is worth some $360 million. Some $50 million has been made available for CS Energy up in Central Queensland, a project worth some $188 million. Also, $75 million has been made available to Fairview's coal seam methane project, which is worth some $445 million in western Queensland -  - I can hear the member for Maranoa saying, 'Hear, hear!' Of course, he looks after his resource and coal industries very well. Taken together, these three coal projects are worth about $1 billion. They are working to develop low-emission coal technologies. There are more announcements to come from the LETDF. I know that the other side do not understand how you do business and how business principles apply, but you have to work through business cases to ensure that taxpayers' money is going to be well spent in developing these technologies. -  - I am trying to get through the answer, but I can take as long as they would like me to. - This government is always open to supporting viable low-emission projects that advance clean coal technology. For example, we have been in close contact with my home state and its government about ZeroGen, which is a low-emission coal-fired electricity generating project. After a couple of meetings in particular - although I have been talking to them for about two years now and so has my department -  - I cannot hear myself think. -  - I think all the time, unlike those people, who think that you have to make business decisions quickly. I like to think them through. I will keep going and hope that they hear me. After requesting the detailed submission from the Queensland government owned corporations, the submission has been made by ZeroGen. It is three inches thick. The department received it about a week ago and is currently going through it. On the basis of that, the department will prepare a detailed analysis of that proposal.I know that those who sit opposite like to make quick decisions and that they do not understand how business works, but without discipline - which you need for effective policy development - Labor use a short cut: they just copy this government's policies and put them out as their own. Yesterday they announced a carbon copy of our Low Emissions Technology Demonstration Fund. - The Leader of the Opposition may think that reannouncing Howard government policy will score him points with the voters, but his environment spokesman has already let the cat out of the bag on coalmining. He has already said that automatic expansion of the coal industry is a thing of the past. The Leader of the Opposition's sudden support for the coal industry will not fool the coalminers and it will not stop them worrying about their jobs under a future Labor government.</DOC>

 - It is true that our interest rates are higher than those in some other developed countries. The reason for that is that our economy has been a lot stronger. The very low interest rates that obtained in the United States for a period of time were a direct reflection of the fact that the economy of the United States went virtually into a recession. If you want to chase that kind of situation, you have a very odd idea of good economic management for this country.I remind the Leader of the Opposition that while he is pursuing issues relating to household debt he ought to read some comments made by the recently appointed Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, Mr Ric Battellino, who, on 22 August 2006, had this to say - and this is very relevant to the issue that the Leader of the Opposition is pursuing:... in judging the health of household finances, we should not look at trends in debt in isolation; we need to look at the overall financial position of households. If we do this, we see that households' financial assets have increased by substantially more than their debt ... As a result, even though household debt has increased, the net financial position of households has improved noticeably.Very simply, what has happened over the last few years is that because interest rates have been so low - relatively speaking in the Australian experience, and much lower than the crippling levels of 17 per cent for housing interest rates and 21 per cent for small business interest rates that obtained under the former Labor government - people have become emboldened and have gone out and borrowed to the hilt.The value of housing has rapidly increased and as a result the amount of disposable income consumed by mortgage payments - albeit at lower interest rates to pay for more expensive houses - has risen. That is simply what has happened: people have put more into housing because they can afford - because of lower interest rates - to borrow more to buy more expensive houses. It stands to reason that the ratio would have gone up. What you have to do, as Mr Battellino pointed out, is have a look at that against the value of your assets. Your liabilities in relation to that asset may be higher, but because your asset value has gone up, your net financial position has improved. That is fundamentally what has happened. Any simple examination of the facts would reveal that to the Leader of the Opposition.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Gilmore for her question and for her very strong support for the Nowra defence community, and the Navy in particular. Shortly after its arrival in Iraq in 2003 and the demise of Saddam Hussein, the Australian Army was involved in providing security along with coalition forces to the Iraqis themselves and has been heavily involved in the training of the Iraqi security forces. Almost four years later, some 136,000 Iraqis have been trained for their own army and about 12,500 of those have been trained by Australian soldiers. For that, amongst many other things, we should be very proud of what our Australian diggers are doing in Iraq.When I was in Baghdad in August last year, the democratically elected Iraqi Prime Minister spent a considerable amount of time thanking me on behalf of Australia for all that our military has done for the Iraqi people. I asked him if there was anything more that we could possibly do. He said, 'Of all the things that we admire about you, it is the training that your soldiers provide to ours, and any further assistance in training will be greatly supported.'Australia's Defence Force has been training in a variety of things. Training an individual soldier is relatively easy, but training an army and building it up is a much more difficult and complex task. We have been involved in training and logistics, the nuts and bolts of actually building and running an army; in ethics and detainee management; in robust battle tactics; in medical skills; and in the acquisition and management of equipment.We have also had Australian soldiers north of Baghdad at a place called Taji training the Iraqis in counterinsurgency. In fact, I noticed in the Army News edition last week, which goes to all our soldiers, a report under the heading 'Iraqi skills cultivated'. As an example of this, our battle group, which is in Tallil, in southern central Iraq in the Dhi Qar province, sent 100 of its soldiers up to train 750 Iraqi soldiers in an intensive week-long training program. Those 750 Iraqi soldiers have since been deployed to Baghdad to support the Baghdad security plan. They were training them in the conduct of contact drills, vehicle patrols, vehicle checkpoints, house-clearing tactics and first aid.I am asked about alternative policies. The training that our soldiers provide is about three things. It is about partnership, it is about the building of trust and it is also about practical training in the field. The Leader of the Opposition has said, consistent with wanting to be all things to all people, that he opposes sending any more soldiers to Iraq. The Prime Minister and I announced last week that the Australian government will send another 70 Australian Army trainers to Iraq. Fifty of them will train in logistics and 20 will train Iraqi soldiers and Iraqi officers. Consistent with the way the Leader of the Opposition operates, he then said something for others who might support more training for Iraqis. He said that he would support them being sent to another country, namely Jordan, which is obviously another country that is not Iraq.I point out the logistics, for example, of taking 750 Iraqi soldiers and training them about clearing checkpoints and a whole variety of on-the-ground military tactics: taking them all to Jordan, booking them into hotels, running them into a lecture theatre and giving them a lecture for a week about how to run security in Iraq. Whilst training some people in countries other than Iraq may be appropriate, training soldiers needs to be conducted in Iraq. The mission in Iraq is essentially to ensure that we train the Iraqi security forces up to the point where they are able to provide essentially for the security of their own people. Our mission and the mission undertaken by the battle group in Iraq, which the Leader of the Opposition thinks he might take out sometime next year, is as much about training as it is about providing support to the Iraqi people to avoid a humanitarian crisis and stopping Iraq from becoming a haven for terrorism which would be driven through the region and, indeed, throughout the world.</DOC>

 - In answer to the Leader of the Opposition, you cannot do a valid comparison in relation to that unless you also look at the length of economic growth and the length of the expansion. If you do that, you will find that Australia, of course, is in a much stronger position because we have had something like 15 years of uninterrupted economic growth. Can I just go back to what I said earlier, and that is that Australians are rather interested in relative performance in Australia because most Australians do not experience living conditions in other countries. The truth is that interest rates in this country are demonstrably lower now than they have been for a very long period. Under this government, the average level of interest is demonstrably lower than it was under the former government. No matter what statistics the Leader of the Opposition quotes, he cannot escape the fact that, when his party was last in government, not only the peaks in interest rates but also the average levels during the 13 years of the Hawke and Keating governments were much higher than they have been under this government. Nothing can alter that fact. He can hurl all the worldwide comparisons he likes.We are very happy to have a debate about the relative standard of living in Australia compared with the relative standard of living in other countries. If the Leader of the Opposition wants to have a debate about relative per capita wealth, if he wants to have a debate about the provisions made for the less well-off in this country, if he wants to have a debate about the tax and payment support for people on average wages, we are very happy to do so. On all of those comparisons, this country is outperforming other nations around the world. I simply say to the Leader of the Opposition that nothing he can say by way of a question to me can alter the fact that interest rates today are demonstrably lower than they were when Labor was last in office. As a result, people have felt able to borrow a lot more and buy more expensive houses. As a result, they pay a higher percentage of their disposable income by way of mortgage repayments, but that higher debt burden is offset by the much more valuable assets they have, so their net financial position is a lot better than it was under the former government.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Canning for his question. I note that the unemployment rate in 1996 was 9.1 per cent in Canning; today it is 4.8 per cent. I am pleased to report that the latest disputes data confirms that just 0.3 working days per 1,000 employees were lost in Western Australia in the final quarter of 2006. Now, that is a massive 430 times lower than the peak under Labor in 1991. That rate is the lowest rate ever recorded by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. It is also the case, of course, that Australia has the lowest level of industrial disputation since 1913 - since records were first kept.That is good for the economy of Western Australia and it is good for the Australian economy. Under Work Choices, the Howard government has said that it is unlawful to take industrial action in support of pattern bargaining. Work Choices is about genuine bargaining, not copycat bargaining. Yet the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, on two occasions now, has refused to rule out, under the Labor Party, the return of pattern bargaining. On Meet the Press on the weekend, and on The 7.30 Report, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition went out of her way not to indicate that the Labor Party would continue with our policy in relation to pattern bargaining.So the Labor Party believes in the one-size-fits-all approach to industrial relations. Before the Baird committee in Western Australia last week, the Reserve Bank Governor, Glenn Stevens, had pattern bargaining in mind when he said:I do not think it is any secret that if, for some reason, labour markets became much more rigid, much more prone to very large wage increases, which were not related to productivity and which flowed across industries the way they did many years ago, that that probably would constitute something of a problem for managing resource booms like we presently have. - So the Reserve Bank Governor is saying that pattern bargaining - one-size-fits-all bargaining - can have a negative impact on the economy. It can push up inflation and it can push up interest rates. - So what is the Labor Party's position? Go straight to the paymaster of the Labor Party, Greg Combet. He said, in November last year, that the ACTU has developed a comprehensive policy which naturally supports the rights of workers, delegates and the union to pattern bargain across an industry. If you are looking for potential economic vandalism look no further than the Labor Party and its current policy to reintroduce pattern bargaining, because pattern bargaining can have a negative impact on inflation by pushing it up and it can have a negative impact on interest rates by pushing them up. We are about a strong economy; the Labor Party is about protecting its union mates.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Cowan for his question and I also thank him for his service to our country, as a former serviceman. In fact, I draw the member for Cowan's attention to what I actually said, which is on my website. I will repeat some of that for you now.In 1942 this country was clearly at grave and immediate threat, and a magnificent group of men from a magnificent generation saved this country. And every Australian, whether by birth or by migration, should thank every day those men who fought at Kokoda, as we should also thank the Americans who fought in the Coral Sea, and others amongst our allies who protected and defended our country.There was not, nor is or should ever be, any comparison in a military sense between our operations in Iraq and what happened in Kokoda. To do so would offend not only the veterans of Kokoda and those who lost their lives but also the men and women who are fighting on Australia's behalf in Iraq. But in this century, 65 years on, it is much harder to see that our generation and our country as a liberal democracy face threats to our values, freedoms and culture from a global insurgency which is driven by Islamic extremists throughout the world who are doing everything they can to drive a resurgent totalitarianism which is a real threat to our way of life.There is no comparison, nor should there be, between the battles in Kokoda and Iraq. Iraq and Afghanistan are but two of the theatres in which this struggle is being fought - as it is with counterterrorism through South-East Asia. And as we heard at the weekend, these people are determined to build a caliphate that will extend from Spain through North Africa, through much of the Middle East and into South Asia. So whilst it is understandably very difficult for us, and many Australians, to see that our generation faces very real threats to our way of life - in particular in relation to the Kokoda veterans and those magnificent men who kept our country free - every single Australian, me included, pays nothing but tribute to them and their sacrifices.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dobell for his question. I regret to inform him and the House that at a conference last week the member for Gellibrand accused the government of ignoring what she called a veritable 'tsunami' of chronic disease, which she said was threatening to overwhelm our system. In making this over-the-top claim, the member for Gellibrand showed her inexperience and her ignorance of how our health system is actually improving. - If she just listened, she might learn something. For the benefit of the member for Gellibrand, I inform the House that last year nearly -  - For the benefit of the member for Gellibrand, let me remind her and the House that last year nearly 650,000 people -  - Last year nearly 650,000 people with chronic illness benefited from GP care plans. More than 250,000 people benefited from team care plans coordinated by their GPs, and these team care plans involved more than half a million allied health consultations. Also last year nearly 250,000 senior Australians benefited from comprehensive health checks under Medicare. This means that the government directed nearly $200 million in Medicare funding towards preventative health and chronic disease. That is nearly $200 million directly targeting preventative health and chronic disease under the policies of the Howard government.I want to make very clear that the Howard government are spending this money through private doctors and through private health professionals. We are not and we will not spend this money building giant socialist bureaucracies or even Christian socialist bureaucracies - that is not our style. Last week I noticed the Leader of the Opposition, who says he is not a socialist and never has been, and who in the past has repeatedly called -  - for the ALP to drop the socialisation objective, rolled over in the face of party pressure. The Sunday Telegraph says:KEVIN Rudd has rejected a move to drop Labor's socialist platform at the party's national conference in April.I say again: will the real Kevin Rudd please stand up? - His Queensland Labor colleagues once said that the only socialist thing about him was his haircut - his Depression era haircut. -  - I ask for the real Leader of the Opposition to stand up and all we get is the member for Grayndler. His Queensland Labor colleagues said that the only socialist thing about him was his haircut. Why doesn't he have the guts to actually repeal the socialisation objective of his party, which he said he would?Last week the member for Gellibrand said that the threat of chronic illness was as great as the threat of climate change. I say to her: you cannot make apocalyptic claims like that without some serious policies to deal with them. I say to the Leader of the Opposition: if you do not have -  - a health policy you are not a serious politician. But what more could we expect from someone whose only practical experience of health was to close 2,200 public hospital beds in Queensland and earn the well-earned nickname of Dr Death, which certainly is not objectionable as far as he is concerned?</DOC>

 - I thank the member for La Trobe for his question and acknowledge his support for schools in his electorate. The Investing in Our Schools Program is providing $1 billion in extra funding for schools across our nation for much needed infrastructure and educational tools. This $1 billion, $700 million of it for state government schools, is in addition to the record levels of funding that this government has provided for schools across the nation. In fact, in the case of state government schools, the federal government have increased funding by 118 per cent since we came to office, even though enrolments have only increased by just over one per cent. But members will recall that, when we came to office in 1996, we inherited a $96 billion debt from Labor. I understand from the Treasurer that we used to have to find $9 billion each year just to pay the interest on Labor's debt. Now that that debt has been paid off - we have paid off Labor's debt - we are in a position to invest more money in our schools.There has been huge demand for this program across Australia. Fifteen thousand projects have now been funded, and that means that over 6,000 government schools have received funding under the program. About $650 million has been provided to date to government schools, and that represents 90 per cent of government schools - so almost 90 per cent of all government schools in Australia have benefited under the Investing in Our Schools Program.The member for La Trobe asked about his electorate. I know he will be delighted to learn that over 100 projects have been funded in his electorate - that is 40 government schools - and we have invested some $4.6 million in his electorate. I know members on both sides have similar stories, because this program has assisted almost 90 per cent of government schools.Last week, the Prime Minister announced an extension to this program. On top of the $1 billion, we have announced a further $181 million in funding for the Investing in Our Schools Program - $127 million will be allocated to government schools. -  - Thank you, Mr Speaker. This means that schools that have not yet been successful or have only received a small amount of funding can now apply for the opportunity to receive up to $100,000 in funding.I do acknowledge the support of the Leader of the Opposition for this program. He said it was a very practical and useful program. But this does beg the question: why is it that the state governments are not investing in their schools? This program has highlighted the chronic neglect of state government schools, and the funding has gone to fix some very basic items in government schools. When the Leader of the Opposition has his meetings with state premiers, perhaps he could ask them to match the federal government's rate of increase in government schools. In the 2006 budget, while the Australian government increased funding for government schools by 11 per cent, the state governments only increased it by four per cent. Had the states matched the federal rate of funding, there would have been an extra $1.4 billion in 2006 for government schools. I call on the Leader of the Opposition to join the government in asking state governments to properly invest in their schools, as we are doing.</DOC>

 - In reply to the member for Calare: there is no misuse of entitlements, none whatsoever. In 2006 the Australian Electoral Commission did redistribute the boundaries of federal seats in New South Wales, and the use of MPs' entitlements in the new portions of electorates is covered by the Remuneration Tribunal determinations and accepted conventions. The Remuneration Tribunal has since 2001 explicitly allowed for the use of the postage entitlement to communicate with residents of an adjoining or nearby area following a redistribution. This is the advice I have received. Similarly, the printing allowance may by convention be used in the new areas. Furthermore, I am advised that MPs are permitted to travel on scheduled services to the new areas and may use their privately plated vehicle to travel to and within the new areas.I am advised that the member referred to - and that is obviously the outstanding, wonderful and redoubtable Chief Government Whip, the member for Macquarie - is within the guidelines and conventions surrounding the use of the entitlements. All I can say, in the spirit of fair electoral contest, is that I think the people of Lithgow will warm to the member for Macquarie.Leave granted.</DOC>

 - I would like to thank the member for Bowman and acknowledge a longstanding interest in education and training. In today's world, people need access to training and education throughout their life - training, retraining and reskilling. In this respect, it is anticipated that in the future the demand for university qualifications will be roughly in balance with the current supply of university education - that is, around 20 per cent of the workforce. By contrast, in the future, it is anticipated that over 60 per cent of jobs will require vocational and technical education, vocational and technical qualifications, yet only 30 per cent of the working population have those qualifications.This is why as a government we have increased real spending in vocation and technical education by over 88 per cent since we took office. It is not the virtually flat funding so disingenuously claimed by the Leader of the Opposition in this place two weeks ago. There has been a more than 88 per cent real increase in spending in the last 11 years. That is why we also announced, late last year, a package of measures worth over $840 million to train people in mid-career. Among the measures are 30,000 training vouchers a year with a value of up to $3,000. So far, since this program started on 1 January this year, with some 530 registered training authorities contracted to provide over 4,400 different courses, we have had over 3,000 vouchers issued in the last six weeks. That is a very high demand and a very important initiative. It is also why in this package we have decided to provide up to $13,000 in wage subsidies for those taking mid-career apprenticeships. We are also providing incentives for higher technical skills and much more.But why are we in this position, where we are now providing billions of dollars to train people in mid-career? Why are we providing support and encouragement to people who are in their late 20s, throughout their 30s and in their early 40s - people who should be at the peak of their productive capacity? Why are we training people in this age group? It is because these people are the people who finished their early education throughout the eighties and much of the nineties. If each year through the eighties and early nineties the number of people who finished an apprenticeship was equal to the number who finished apprenticeships last year - 142,000 young Australians - we would have in Australia now over one million more trained people in technical and vocational education. We would have over one million more people able to deal with the skills challenge that this country faces. This is Labor's lost generation of tradesmen and tradeswomen - people in their late 20s, their 30s and their early 40s, who never got the opportunity to get a technical and trade education. This is Labor's legacy of 13 years of neglect and denigration of the trades. These are the people - a whole generation of parents and their children - who were made to feel that a trade qualification is somehow second-class, because of Labor's rhetoric through all those years.Labor are still in denial. In the education revolution document put out by the Leader of the Opposition - it is 27 pages - how much do you think there is on technical education? There are four paragraphs out of 27 pages. They are still in denial. Just last month the member for Rankin, the shadow minister - listen to it - for service economy, small business and independent contractors said, of all things, 'I think we can very easily overstate the importance of trades.' Labor are still in denial. This government and the country must place a priority on training Labor's lost generation of tradesmen and tradeswomen.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker -  - You can read it from there, except it has 'confidential' written on it. I have not seen the proposal, but I would certainly welcome a debate on nuclear energy as part of our future energy mix from those who sit opposite. It should also include a debate on how that all fits together in terms of the extra money that we are already putting into low-emission coal, low-emission gas -  - I would welcome a debate. In fact, I would also welcome the Leader of the Opposition and the premiers of each state copying the Howard government's uranium policy because, until we can actually mine the uranium in each state, we cannot export it. I have here a media statement from Australian Nuclear Energy Pty Ltd, which was just passed to me. The statement says:The Australian community will ultimately decide the best way to provide sustainable energy for our country.I would hope that that would be through a debate. I know the Leader of the Opposition likes debates. The media statement goes on:Australian Nuclear Energy Pty Ltd is a private company established to examine potential commercial responses to future energy needs.ANE company secretary Mr Bruce Fitzgerald says that contrary to today's media reports, the company has not put forward a proposal to build nuclear power plants in Australia.The company will make no further comment.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Blair and, in answering that question, can I say that the federal government is assisting the parents of Australia to educate their children in a number of ways based on a number of principles. The first and most important principle is freedom of parental choice. I make it plain that the cornerstone of our education policy is that parents have an unfettered right to choose the type of education they regard as suitable for their children. I make that observation in the wake of the release of some ABS school statistics, which show a continued drift of children from government schools to non-government schools. We now have 1.1 million, or one-third, of all students attending non-government schools in Australia. That is not something that I necessarily welcome, because I believe very strongly not only in freedom of choice but that the basis of a good education system in this country is a vibrant, strong, well-based, well-resourced public education system. If parents are to have genuine freedom of choice, then the offerings of a strong public system have to constitute a very important part of that choice.But I have to say that, in the wake of the release of these statistics, we have had, regrettably, the usual responses from state education ministers and leaders of the teacher unions. The Victorian education minister, John Lenders, said that the figures reflected the Howard government's funding priorities - implying that in some way our funding had short-changed parents who send their kids to government schools and favoured those who send their children to non-government schools. He neglects to acknowledge that, in the almost 11 years that we have been in power, direct federal government funding for government schools has risen by 118 per cent while the enrolments in government schools over that same period have increased by only 1.2 per cent.If you make allowance for that share of general revenue payments by the Commonwealth to the states that is used by the states to fund public education - which you must do if there is to be any fair statistical comparison - you find that government schools, which now enrol 67 per cent of students, receive 75 per cent of all government funding while non-government schools, which enrol 33 per cent of students, receive 25 per cent of funding. They are unarguable statistics. They are contributed to by the Commonwealth's direct payments, which have gone up 118 per cent, and also by payments through the GST. Figures today reveal that, in the current financial year, the states are $2 billion better off than they would have been under the old financial sharing arrangements. This is echoed again by Mary Bluett, of the Australian Education Union's Victorian branch, who goes on to attack the federal government for allegedly - and it is a false accusation - short-changing government schools. The reality is that, under the Schools Assistance Act, the more the states increase their payments to schools, the more the Commonwealth payments go up, because the two are linked to a formula written into the act.There are those who are concerned that too many parents are taking their children out of government schools - and I understand those concerns because I do not want to see, and the government does not want to see, the government system weakened. Can I say to state education ministers and to the leaders of the teacher unions: instead of falsely blaming the federal government, why don't you ask the parents why they have made a different choice? If you ask parents, they do not say that it is because the federal government does not give enough money. Parents talk about standards. They talk about discipline. They talk about values. They talk about a whole range of things. I think the parents are the people who should be listened to because, in the end, we exist as governments to serve the choices of parents. We do not exist as governments to serve particular ideologies and we do not exist to serve a preference for the private over the state or the state over the private.One of the great pieces of genius of the Australian achievement is that we have always achieved a sense of balance between public and private provision. What I want in education is an Australia where parents have that unfettered choice. I think people who worry about the drift between government and private schools should talk to the parents, instead of falsely blaming the federal government, to find out why they have exercised their choice in a particular direction.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Stirling for his question, and I can inform the House that the Sensis business index for small and medium enterprises was released today. This is the most comprehensive survey of small- and medium-sized business in Australia. There are 1.96 million trading businesses in Australia and 95 per cent of them are small businesses. The survey today showed that confidence has risen in the small and medium enterprise sector by six percentage points to a net balance of 56 per cent and that expectations about the economy rose strongly with a net 13 per cent of SMEs believing the economy would be better in a year's time. This is the first positive result since May 2006 and the highest result in two years.The report also asks whether the small and medium enterprise sector has a net favourability for particular levels of government. I can inform the House that the government in Australia which is the most supported government by small and medium enterprises is the federal government and that the assessment of federal government policies rose to a net balance of positive 11 per cent. Lest someone think that is not much, the least supported government in Australia by small and medium enterprises was the New South Wales government, which had a net favourability of minus 34 per cent. This is the 12th successive quarter in which the New Wales government has recorded the lowest result of any state or territory. The key reason why small and medium enterprises do not support the New South Wales government is, as they say, 'having too much bureaucracy and too high taxes'.I noticed in the paper this morning that the Treasurer of New South Wales, Mr Costa, said he is being persecuted because of his ethnic background. I suggest to Mr Costa that it is not his parents but his policies that are the problem in New South Wales. Where you have a state that has trailed the rest of Australia and has high bureaucracy and high taxes, it is no excuse to say that there is some kind of ethnic component in the favourability rating of the New South Wales government. The New South Wales government stands at minus 34 per cent. If it wants to win back the confidence of small and medium enterprises, it ought to do something about its bureaucracy, do something about its taxes, support improved industrial relations and take a leaf out of coalition policies.</DOC>

We are always happy to see a proposal of any type in my office, and I have not seen the proposal from this company put before me in my office. As I said, we need to have the debate and there needs to be a bipartisan position. One thing I do not understand is why the Labor Party or some parts of the Labor Party - it is a shame that the member for Batman is not here - say that we can export uranium to our friends so that they can lower greenhouse gas emissions by using it in base-load nuclear power stations, but they do not want to have a debate here in Australia about nuclear energy.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Riverina for her question and her great interest in the issues surrounding water security and the sustainability of regional economies in those areas that rely on water security. We certainly understand that water security, particularly throughout the Murray-Darling Basin, underpins regional development prospects in all regional communities.The member for Riverina asked about our $10 billion national water plan. It needs to be said at the outset that it would not be possible for our government to be putting this proposal forward and to be encouraging the states to commit with the Commonwealth to this investment and this nation-building scheme if it had not been for the good economic management of the economy over the last 11 years that has put us in a position where we can afford to invest this money. Eleven years ago the nation would never have been able to afford to invest this amount of money in what is a critical national issue. Now we have the Labor Party wanting to put their hand up and say, 'Me, too' after opposing every inch of the way the hard work that the nation has put in to achieve this economic outcome so that we can afford these investments in much needed infrastructure.We have the Labor spokesmen going out and saying, 'We'll do this and we'll do that.' We had the member for Grayndler promising to free up money for state projects. We know that that is what this Labor Party is all about: being beholden to state governments. We also know that they want to punish farmers in regional communities for the mistakes of state governments in the overallocation of water rights. We will not punish farmers or regional communities for the mistakes that state governments have made, and we make no apology for that. That is why we put this package together: so that we can sensibly approach an issue that we need to address.Where it exists, overallocation will be addressed firstly through efficiency savings in the system. That is why we have indicated that we are prepared to invest $6 billion into efficiency savings to address that overallocation. Secondly, as a last resort we are prepared to purchase water rights in the marketplace from willing sellers. But we want to generate the efficiency savings first because we believe that there is a significant amount of water that can be saved. We will engage all stakeholders so that they can provide us with advice and guidance from top to bottom on this issue at every step of the way. We want to engage in a genuine partnership with those regional communities to enhance and ensure the prosperity of those regional communities, particularly those in the Murray-Darling Basin area.Labor's alternative, and the member for Grayndler outlined this in a speech yesterday, is to blame the farmers for overallocation and not to put the finger on the state governments that made the overallocation. He is out there saying that he is going to free up money and give it to the state governments. Where is he going to get the money from? He is going to get the money from the good management of this government that he opposed every inch of the way. He did not want us to make the savings - he did not want us to improve the economic circumstances in Australia - but now that it has been done he wants to grab the money and go and spend it. The member for Grayndler should get out into the countryside and talk to a few of the producers around the place. The member for Grayndler says that the price of water should be higher - but he will not say how high - and he wants to tell farmers what crops they should be growing. - I say to the member for Grayndler -  - that the market should set the price of water. The market should determine which crops farmers grow, not some central committee of the ALP politburo. The member for Grayndler says that the Murray needs a drink but he does not acknowledge that there is a drought on. In one of the comments he made in this speech he said: 'Labor firmly believes the overallocation of water licences is a primary source of the water crisis.' The primary source of the water crisis is that there is a drought on! I do not know whether you had noticed, but there is a drought on! We want to responsibly address better managing water resources for a sustainable future. It is quite clear, as we travel around regional Australia, that working families in regional Australia know the Labor Party's form on forestry, the decisions they took at the last election at the last moment; they know their form on coalmining - their attitude towards coalmining versus climate change. We know their form on uranium mining and the deployment of uranium. The regional communities do not trust Labor on the management of water in the future. Labor try to be all things to all people. They have spent 11 years opposing the government's measures to improve the economy, and now they want to get their hands on the loot and spend the benefits of that hard work. No amount of gloss on top of this new team in the Labor Party is going to hide the rust that we know exists underneath. They are anti jobs, anti development and anti regional Australia.</DOC>

 - I appreciate the honourable member's question. This government has determined that Australia should play its part in the war against terrorism. I think all of us felt very deeply about the Australians who were killed in Bali and in other incidents. That just reinforced our determination to strike back at terrorists and to defeat terrorists. One of the areas where we make a contribution is in Afghanistan. It is still a very dangerous environment, particularly in southern Afghanistan. We expect there to be, to use a phrase, a spring offensive from the Taliban in the first few months of this year.I welcome the decision by the British government that they will deploy 1,400 more troops to Afghanistan, bringing their total in Afghanistan to 7,700. And I am proud of the contribution the 550 Australians are making in Afghanistan. Can I just say - we have said this before - that the government has sent a scoping team to Afghanistan to inform our Defence planning on possible changes and possible increases to our force structure in Afghanistan. We are committed to helping the Afghan people, as we are the Iraqi people, to free themselves of the scourge of terrorism. I noticed on 22 February that the Leader of the Opposition supported an increase in Australian troops to Afghanistan. This is what he said:We've always taken a constructive, bipartisan approach to the war against Osama bin Laden and the Taliban ...Apparently not al-Qaeda in Iraq - but, in any case, if they are in Afghanistan, he is against them. This was an interesting statement by the Leader of the Opposition. He supports more troops being sent to Afghanistan but, six days earlier, in an interview on Channel 7, he said that we should be withdrawing our troops from Iraq because they are needed back here in our region. This is what he said:We have other alliance responsibilities in our region. You've got the Solomons ... you've got problems in Tonga, you've got problems in Fiji, who knows what's going to happen in parts of New Guinea - we have limited military resources ...The Leader of the Opposition, yet again, is trying to have it both ways. How can a member of the House of Representatives argue on the one hand that we should bring troops back because we need them in our own region but support sending more troops to Afghanistan? You do not have to be a Philadelphia lawyer to work out that there is a stark and embarrassing contradiction. - But this of course is what we have been treated to for the last two months -  - from the Leader of the Opposition and what we who have followed the foreign affairs debate through the last five years were treated to. He supports every imaginable position: troops out of Iraq because we need more troops in South-East Asia and the Pacific, but more troops can go to Afghanistan. Even the Labor Party can work out that there is a contradiction there. There is one final contradiction, which is a pretty fundamental one: why is it that it is so important to fight terrorism in Afghanistan but it does not matter what happens in Iraq? It does not matter that the terrorists have a great victory in Iraq but it does in Afghanistan? If you ask me, that is a pretty silly sort of position and it is a position not driven by strength of policy or conviction, not driven by belief and not driven by a desire to do the right thing by our country, our allies and our friends around the world; it is driven by grubby politics.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Dobell for his question. Today the Australian Bureau of Statistics released data on managed funds which showed that in the December quarter of 2006 total consolidated assets of managed funds increased 4.6 per cent and grew to nearly $1.1 trillion. Let me say that again: the amount of managed funds in Australia as at the end of December 2006 is now about $1.1 trillion. - That is managed funds. That does not include self-managed superannuation, which is about 23 per cent of superannuation. Managed funds not only include superannuation but include other funds that are under management. If you were to bring in self-managed funds for superannuation, of course, the savings would be greater than $1.1 trillion.The measure of savings in Australia's national accounts has been negative for several quarters, but that measure does not capture the accumulation of assets. This is a point that has been made by Ric Battellino, the Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, who said in a speech in August of 2006:... conventional measures of saving do not take into account capital gains. This has a particular bearing on Australian households because, as noted, they now hold a high proportion of their financial assets in investments such as shares and superannuation on which a significant part of the return is in the form of capital gains. ... we showed that once allowance is made for capital gains, the saving rate of Australian households ... is neither low nor falling.In fact, it is estimated by the Reserve Bank of Australia that, looking at household net financial wealth, savings are around 24 per cent of disposable income. This measure suggests that Australia's savings, by global standards, are actually quite high. This is an important point which has perhaps been overlooked in a lot of the economic commentary to date. When you do a household savings ratio and you are looking just at income, you are not allowing for the fact that many Australian households are actually making quite a rational decision to put their savings into better yielding returns, either in the stock market or in superannuation. In many European countries, you might put your money into a bank which then invests. That is counted in the conventional measure of saving because it is held at a bank. But many Australians have taken quite a rational decision to invest either directly into the share market or to invest through self-managed funds.I have no doubt that the volume of money that Australians now have in managed funds and directly in the stock market has contributed greatly to the increase in stock market values. It was estimated at the beginning of this year that the complete market capitalisation of the Australian Stock Exchange was around $1.4 trillion. When you think that managed funds have $1.1 trillion and there is, in addition to that, considerable self-managed superannuation, you can see that there is an enormous stock of savings in the Australian economy which is now looking for a home to invest and no doubt -  - On cue comes one of the genii of the Labor backbench who, if he listened as much as he talked, would have heard me say that managed funds do not include just superannuation. Managed funds include listed property trusts. They include cash management trusts. - And I suppose Paul Keating invented the cash management trust, did he? Did he invent the listed property trust? - I suppose he invented the self-managed superannuation funds! Let me guess - Paul Keating invented the internet! 
A government member - No, that was Al Gore! - Sorry; that was Al Gore! Paul Keating got an Oscar yesterday, did he? - Some of these people are so out of touch they have not seen a good economic policy in so long they would not know how to recognise one when it came to you. That is why you cannot trust the Labor Party - caught fossilised in a period of time of ignorance until the light of the coalition came and shone on them, and it is going to stay there for a long period of time.</DOC>

 - First, can I thank the honourable member for Boothby for his question and of course for the great interest he has in these issues. I have said before that we in the Australian government welcome the 13 February agreement, which gives a timetable for the dismantling of North Korea's nuclear program. I also would like to take the opportunity of welcoming the announcement that the Director-General of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed ElBaradei, intends to visit Pyongyang in the next week or so - the week commencing 12 March, I think it is - and this visit is at the invitation of the North Korean government. So this is a good sign that the North Korean government is moving towards the implementation of the agreement that was announced on 13 February.As the House knows, we have worked very closely with the American administration but also with the Chinese, the South Koreans and the Japanese in relation to the whole issue of North Korea's nuclear tests and its nuclear program. The agreement that has been reached provides for international assistance to North Korea in return for specific progress towards abandoning its nuclear weapons.With that all in mind, I have decided to send an Australian delegation to Pyongyang, almost certainly in the week beginning 5 March. This will be led by a very senior official in my department and will include a number of officials. They will urge North Korea, first of all, to fulfil its obligations under the agreement that has been reached and, in particular, to dismantle permanently its nuclear programs. The delegation will indicate that such actions will allow Australia and many other countries in the broader international community to provide the assistance to North Korea that the people, the ordinary people, of North Korea so desperately need. It will also be an opportunity to lay down some markers for the strengthening of a bilateral relationship between Australia and North Korea. The delegation will be able also to check the progress of multilateral aid projects to which we currently contribute. They are basically projects that are associated with food.I think the delegation should make a useful contribution, particularly bearing in mind the close alliance relationship between Australia and the United States. The delegation will be able to make a useful contribution to sending some messages to the North Korean regime about their obligations; what the broader international community expect of them, not just the other five parties in the six-party talks, and what benefits North Korea can get out of fulfilling their obligations under the agreement that was announced on 13 February.</DOC>

 - I have not seen the statement attributed to my colleagues but I am sure that, as is their custom, they made very sensible statements. My position on nuclear power is that I think this country should examine the nuclear option. It is too early to be talking about individual locations because -  -  - I know the game that the opposition are playing. They may think it is clever short-term politics but it is doing a great deal of long-term damage to a sensible debate this country. I welcome the fact that three prominent Australian businessmen have formed a company to look at the issue of nuclear power generation. I would think it completely unexceptionable that they might have had some contact with the government. I listened with fascination to all of the questions asked by the Leader of the Opposition.What on earth turns on somebody who, according to the Premier of South Australia, is a good enough adviser on the business affairs of South Australia to sit at the cabinet table with the Labor Premier? There is Mr Walker, who was, I am very happy to say, Honorary Federal Treasurer of the Liberal Party, and a very good one - and he is now the Chairman of John Fairfax Ltd. And there is Robert Champion de Crespigny, who, amongst other things, as well as being a very successful businessman, was a member some years ago of the Council for Reconciliation and devoted a great deal of time to improving relations between the Indigenous population and the rest of the Australian population.But I would just say to the member for Parramatta: I think this nation, if it is serious about climate change, has to look at the nuclear option. I am not frightened of that. I am not ruling out power stations anywhere in this country. That is a juvenile, idiotic game to play. To those who sit opposite, if you are interested in a serious debate -  - you will embrace it. I do not intend to be diverted from a rational discussion of the nuclear option by this kind of childish scare tactic.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for La Trobe for his question. He is a great member for La Trobe. In 1996 the unemployment rate in his electorate was 6.2 per cent. Today it is 3.5 per cent. And I can update the House on the impact of the government's changes to the Labor Party's job-destroying unfair dismissal laws. I look at the Sensis report which the Treasurer referred to a little bit earlier, which came out today. It is a good report. The report notes that already some 10 per cent of small and medium enterprises reported that they have made changes, with putting new workplace agreements into place being the most common action to date. SMEs in the Northern Territory are the most likely to have made changes so far. In the Northern Territory - Snowy, pay attention, and the member for Solomon over there - in February of last year, in the month before the introduction of Work Choices, the unemployment rate in the Northern Territory was 6.4 per cent; today it is two per cent. So there is no doubt that if you add together the Sensis survey and the outcomes as measured in the unemployment rate there is a positive impact associated with the removal of the unfair dismissal laws on small business. So it begs the question: why does the Labor Party want to reintroduce the job-destroying unfair dismissal laws? Why? 
Government members - Why? - It could only be that the Rudd-Gillard-Combet combo is going to deliver a platform for the trade union movement to re-enter every workplace. - The net impact of the Labor Party's job-destroying unfair dismissal laws is that they do cost jobs. Various surveys previously talked about in this place have said they could have an impact on up to 77,000 jobs out there in the community. The evidence now clearly illustrates that small business has embraced our Work Choices changes. Small business has said, 'Yes, we will take the risk in employing people.' And the OECD came out and said only a couple of weeks ago that the unfair dismissal laws disadvantaged those who are most vulnerable, particularly women and young people. They were the most disadvantaged by prescriptive labour laws because it made the risk of employing those people far greater for small business. So why do the Labor Party want to reintroduce these laws? It is only because of the pact they have with the trade union movement to let the trade unions back into every workplace and every small business. The trade unions will run the Labor Party if, on a dark day, they get into government. That is not just bad for jobs; that is bad for the Australian economy.</DOC>

But let me make it very clear that, speaking for myself, the only contact I have had with these three very reputable Australian businessmen was in about the middle of last year, when Mr Walker, in a telephone conversation I had with him -  -  - Oh, yes, it was very conspiratorial! I have only known Mr Walker for about 20 years and he has been a good fundraiser and a great contributor to our side of politics. This is the new politics. This is the above-the-ruck, new standard politics - there is something conspiratorial in John Howard talking to Ron Walker. You have got to be kidding. Heavens above, I saw the Leader of the Opposition with Ron Walker at the soccer! I will tell you what: that is only the half of it; Steve Bracks was there too.I had a discussion with Ron Walker. I am very happy to tell the world. One Saturday morning, Ron rang me. It was not about racing tips - neither of us is very interested in racing - but it was about something else. It was about the middle of last year. He said that he, Hugh Morgan and Robert Champion de Crespigny had decided to register a company that could be interested in nuclear power. I said, 'That's a great idea, Ron, because you know my view on it.' I do not know what this is all about. My view and the view of the government about nuclear power being an option is well known. Whether it ever goes any further will be a matter for commercial decision. I remind the Leader of the Opposition that the laws of the Commonwealth and the states as they now stand prohibit any nuclear power generation in Australia. We will address that issue in relation to the Commonwealth when we give our detailed response to the Switkowski report.But let me say again to the Leader of the Opposition: if you are serious about climate change and if you want to lead the intellectual debate on this issue, you have to look at every option. You should not bring to the climate change future of Australia or the world a closed mind. You should not bring your ideological prejudices and you should not be overborne by the member for Kingsford Smith on this issue. My challenge to the Leader of the Opposition is to get out in front of the Australian Labor Party, show a bit of policy courage and show a bit of intellectual depth and acknowledge that if we are serious we will look at cleaning up coal and we will look at wind and solar power at the margin, because you cannot run power stations on wind and solar. We will examine nuclear power and we will recognise that the mandatory imposition of a high MRET will do great damage to Australian industry. That was why we were not prepared to go further when we brought out the energy white paper. It is not right for the Leader of the Opposition to say that I reject MRETs. I do not; I think they should be measured and not place an unreasonable burden on Australian industry. Let me return to the central point. If this nation is to have a sensible debate about climate change, we have to look at the cleanest and greenest power generation source of all, and that is nuclear power.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Bonner for his question. I can assure him and the House that the Howard government strongly supports Australia's great Medicare system. It is not perfect but it is at least as good as any health system anywhere in the world. The principal reason that the Howard government is undeniably the best friend Medicare has ever had is that many members opposite now want to reform Medicare out of existence. Those who want to reform Medicare out of existence start with none other than the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the former shadow minister for health, the member for Lalor, who has been a consistent supporter of a single funder in place of Australia's existing health programs. In May 2004, she said to the Tasmanian AMA:The principal characteristic of a unified national health system is that existing Commonwealth health monies - that is, Medicare, the PBS, aged care funding and healthcare agreement money - are combined with -  -  - She had a bit of intellectual credibility and honesty, which the current shadow minister lacks. She said:... are combined with existing State and Territory health monies ... and the combined pool of money is then applied to the population's health needs.Let us be quite clear. As far as the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is concerned, this is the death of Medicare and its replacement by something resembling the UK National Health Service. But she did not leave that back in 2004. As recently as her Earl Page lecture last year, she said:A Labor government would be prepared to examine the need for big changes. That includes a single funder for health care.She even managed to con her then leader, the member for Brand, who said in his address to the Economic and Social Outlook Conference in Melbourne last November:But shifting to a single public funder for health care is on my reform agenda.So she supports it and the former leader supports it. But wait. Recently the Age reported the shadow minister for federal-state relations, the member for Fraser, as saying:Mr McMullen said the single funding model, where the Commonwealth and states would contribute to a common pool of money, had substantial problems.Well, good on the shadow minister for federal-state relations. 'That would be a bad idea,' he said. Who is right? Is it the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, who supports a single funder, or the shadow minister for federal-state relations, who opposes it? I say to the Leader of the Opposition: you cannot wimp out of taking sides on this one; you have got to take sides on this one. You cannot be all things to everyone on this one. But he is a strange piece of work, this bloke. He supports the US alliance but he does not support helping America in Iraq. He says he is against greenhouse gas emissions but he will not support nuclear -  - I was making the point that the Leader of the Opposition should resolve this contradiction, like he should resolve so many contradictions. He says that he is not a socialist, but he is a Christian socialist. He says that he is an Anglican, but he has never quite resigned from the Catholic Church. Will the real Kevin Rudd please stand up - not the flunkey! -  - Mr Speaker, I am happy to come to a conclusion. The Leader of the Opposition should come to a conclusion. Does he support his own deputy leader on this point or does he support his recently appointed shadow minister for federal-state relations? He cannot keep sitting on the fence on this. He cannot keep trying to be all things to everyone. I say that he should put his Dr Death skills into practice and kill off, finally and for all time, this very silly idea of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition.</DOC>

 - I cannot confirm, without doing a company search, that the company was incorporated and formed on 1 June. It could have been and, for the purposes of discussion, I am prepared to accept the word of the Leader of the Opposition that it was. But what on earth turns on that? My views in relation to nuclear power were well known before 1 June. They have been well known for some time. The Leader of the Opposition is going down a very silly track on this. I know what he is about. Walker, Morgan and de Crespigny are three very reputable businessmen. One of them had a conversation with me - I have many conversations - and he said that he was going to form a company and I said, 'That is good, Ron.' I do not apologise for that, because I actually believe in companies being formed. I believe in them making profits and I believe in them paying large taxes if they make a profit. I also believe that if we are honest about tackling climate change - and this is the big piece de resistance of the Australian Labor Party; they are going to lead the way forward in relation to climate change - here you have one of the solutions to climate change.Let me remind you again, Mr Speaker, what the Chief Scientist, Dr Jim Peacock - he is the principal adviser to the government of Australia about science matters - had to say to me on 21 December 2006:At present there are only two modes of power generation capable of base-load power production - that means running the power stations that keep our cities going, that keep the lights on, that keep us in jobs and that keep the wealth being generated; they are indispensable to the economic capacity of this nation - which can be operated without serious consequences for climate change emission.And this is what this debate is meant to be meant all about. Surely, those who sit opposite are interested in something that can be run without a serious consequence for climate change emission. Mr Peacock said:Fossil fuels will be used in Australia now and in the next several decades in power plants.We all know that. He continued:These power plants should be operated with minimum emissions and we have technologies to retrofit most existing power stations ...And so he went on. He then said:Nuclear power stations are the other clean and mature mode of electricity generation.This is not John Howard; it is not some ideologue in the debate. It is the dispassionate, rational, impartial Chief Scientist of Australia. - Those who sit opposite have spent the entirety of question time trying to establish something sinister in the fact that there may have been a conversation between me and Ron Walker. That is a measure of the trivia that this opposition goes on with at question time. This is meant to be the new Labor politics. This is meant to be the high standard. Let me say that I am not the least bit embarrassed about the fact that I have revealed to the world that Ron Walker had a conversation with me about this. Any suggestion of impropriety in that is ludicrous. The people who are doing themselves a disservice are the alternative government of this country. They are flouncing around Australia saying that they care about climate change. They have spent an hour trying to allege some conspiracy in relation to what the Chief Scientist says is one of the two modes of running power stations in this country which will not have harmful effects on our environment and will not be damaging in the climate change scenario. I would have thought that, instead of alleging in a childish, juvenile fashion that there was something sinister in my having had a discussion -  - they would have had a serious debate. The last hour has revealed the Labor Party who sit opposite as inadequate and intellectually deprived participants in the climate change debate in Australia.Leave granted.</DOC>

 - In reply to the member for Braddon, I remind the House that this government remains the best friend that small business has ever had. Not only is this government the best friend that Medicare has ever had, we are also the best friend that small business has ever had. We have done many things, and the most meritorious of all is the way in which we have provided a sound economic climate. The figures quoted yesterday by the Treasurer, in relation to the attitudes of small business to governments around Australia, illustrate that.In recent times the removal of the unfair dismissal nightmare was a great boon to small business. I noticed in the past week that there have been a number of gyrations and permutations from the Labor Party in trying, once again, to walk both sides of the street in relation to small business. We know what Labor's record was. Over the years before the current law came into operation, on 44 occasions the Labor Party voted against an exemption for small business that would have only extended to firms having 15 to 20 employees. The current law, of course, provides an exemption for firms with up to 100 employees.Over the past couple of days the shadow minister responsible, the member for Rankin, has tried to walk both sides of the street. He briefed the Sydney Morning Herald to the effect that he was going to make a big speech last night in which he was going to announce a significant change in relation to Labor's position on unfair dismissal laws. He said he was going to get rid of the Beazley reinstatement option. The whole impression was given that change was in the air, as far as the member for Rankin was concerned. But when the speech came out last night there was not a lot of change in the air. And that was picked up in an absolutely hilarious interview on Brisbane radio this morning between Madonna King and Craig Emerson in which, amongst other things, Madonna King said:You're being a little tricky here, with respect, Dr Emerson, because I read you those parts of that report and at no point ...And so the exchange goes on. Basically, what happened is that he briefed Phillip Coorey from the Sydney Morning Herald. He said: 'Look, we've got a big speech tonight. We're going to put our arm around small business. We're going to look after them.' Along comes the speech and nothing happens. Along comes his interview this morning and, quite understandably, the journalist was rather cynical about the way in which the member was behaving. But let me come to the nub of the policy issue and let me quote from the shadow minister. He said:I am saying to you right now, in answering your question, that I have not said, either in the speech or on your program, that we are exempting small business.Not in the speech or in the program!What I am saying is that we will take into account the special circumstances of small business in developing our policies.Let me say in very plain language to the member for Rankin, and to those who sit opposite, that the only way that you can take properly into account the special concerns of small business is to leave the law exactly as it is.I can tell you what small business wants. Small business wants the present law. Small business does not want any tinkering with the present law. Small business does not want union officials back interfering in their business. Small business likes the present exemption. Small business knows that the present exemption has led to more jobs. Small business should be listened to, and the law should be left exactly as it is.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, can I correct the Leader of the Opposition? I thought it was Julie Bishop's plan, actually. One of the reasons that we have not made what I think is a very elegantly presented plan by the -  -  - I think one of the reasons why more progress has not been made on this is a thing called the education unions, who have been busily instructing state ministers. Let met say that I welcome the fact that the Leader of the Opposition has now come on board. One of the things that I will find interesting, and I am sure the minister will find interesting, is analysing the remarks of the former Deputy Leader of the Opposition the member for Jagajaga on this matter. If my memory serves me correctly - and I have not checked the record; I may be wrong - I have a faint suspicion that when the idea of a national curriculum was raised by the minister it was lambasted by the member for Jagajaga as a terrible attempt by the Howard government to impose ideological uniformity on the skills of Australia. - I could be wrong, but let us check the record.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Hasluck for his question. In last year's budget I announced the biggest reform of taxation arrangements for superannuation in Australia's history. Those reforms dramatically simplify the taxation of superannuation and they make superannuation the preferred investment for every Australian. Every Australian who has money in a taxed superannuation fund, once they reach the age of 60, will be able to withdraw that sum entirely tax-free. It will be tax-free if it is taken out as a pension; it will be tax-free if it is taken out as a lump sum. In addition to that, the government announced its proposal to change the assets test taper rate on pensions so that 321,000 Australians will be eligible to benefit from improved arrangements from 20 September 2007.What this will do is give many Australians an incentive to remain in the workforce after the age of 60, drawing down on their superannuation tax-free and having a part-time job at a lower marginal tax rate. It will also mean that Australians no longer have to pay for complicated advice when they are heading towards retirement. It will abolish reasonable benefits limits and it will encourage young people to get into superannuation through the course of their working lives. After 40 years of employer contributions, an average worker earning $1,000 a week is projected to increase their retirement income by 17 per cent as a result of these tax changes. A self-employed 25-year-old earning $28,000 and contributing two and a half thousand dollars a year would be expected to increase their pension benefit at retirement by over $88,000. These are reforms which will boost incentives for saving. These are reforms which will boost retirement incomes.Susan Ryan, the former Labor minister, said after these reforms were announced, 'Maybe faced with the Treasurer's bold gazumping of Labor's cherished but slightly shabby property the opposition will find the resolve to get another big picture worked out and the wherewithal to let voters know about it.' Unfortunately the opposition has not managed to do that. I want to quote Garry Weaven, the ACTU adviser and superannuation fund advocate. He said, 'The government's budget initiatives have proved the Liberal Party is now the official party for superannuation.' Garry Weaven is an ACTU adviser and lifetime ALP supporter. The good news is that the legislation for these reforms went through the parliament yesterday. This is now law. The biggest superannuation change in Australia's history has now been enacted. It is going to give benefits to all Australians who save through superannuation, and it will take effect from 1 July this year.</DOC>

 - I am quite aware that the former minister for education the very distinguished former member for Goldstein in this parliament did raise that proposal. I am also aware, as no doubt the Leader of the Opposition is aware, that in order to bring about something of this nature you do need the cooperation of state governments. -  - I would have thought that it was self-evident that you do need the involvement and cooperation of state governments. My experience is that sometimes state governments cooperate with you and sometimes they do not. Sometimes some state governments cooperate with you and one does not - although hopefully later on that state government will cooperate with you. I have to say that, over the past few weeks, every time the issue of a national curriculum has been raised the reaction of state education ministers -  - No, I was just observing it. It is not their fault actually. Every time the issue has come up, in the case of New South Wales the state education minister has said, 'Well, we're not going to alter our curriculum because we think all the others are lousy.' In the case of the other state education ministers, they have said, 'We're not going to have the federal government imposing their views on us.' So it will be very interesting to see whether there are good national curricula and bad national curricula and whether the reaction of state education ministers will be the same to the proposal put forward by the Leader of the Opposition, which is essentially the same as that which has been advocated by the Commonwealth for a number of years. If in fact the state education ministers change their tune because the federal Labor Party have put up the proposal, it will demonstrate what we have believed for a long time: that they have been playing politics for a number of years.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Corangamite for his question and recognise his interest in making sure that the federal government invests appropriately in the critical infrastructure in his part of Australia, in Victoria, and in particular the work he has done in getting investment in the Geelong ring road. I know that he has been a long and passionate advocate of that investment. Interestingly, out of $1.3 billion going into Victoria out of AusLink, $186 million is going into the Geelong ring road. The member for Corangamite is also a great advocate of ensuring that state governments shoulder their responsibilities for their roads. This is after the negotiated outcome of the AusLink corridors between the Commonwealth and the states, where we have agreed as a Commonwealth government to invest in specific roads. The states have said, 'Well, you do that and we'll shoulder our responsibilities over here.' That is all very well until after the signing, and then they head off and start blaming the federal government for not putting money into their roads. A classic example in Victoria is the Princes Highway, and I know that the member for Corangamite actively holds the Victorian government to account to ensure that they step up to the plate and shoulder their responsibilities as far as the Princes Highway is concerned.We are investing unparalleled amounts of money in Australia's infrastructure through AusLink. Over the next 20 years the freight task in Australia is going to double. We are going to need this investment. In the current round of AusLink we are investing $15 billion in the AusLink corridors which we have agreed with states. That should allow the states to invest more money in their responsibilities. We continue to seek that process and ask them to do that, as was agreed through the AusLink negotiation ultimately endorsed by COAG. If the states could make some more progress in terms of their planning and in terms of their investment in their roads, we would see much better progress as far as the overall infrastructure in the nation's roads is concerned. So, instead of the states blaming the Commonwealth for not fixing their roads, they should get on and do it themselves. We will continue to invest in the AusLink corridors, but we will also hold them to account.We have an ally in this; it is the member for Batman. We appreciate his comments. I heard somewhere in a media interview today the Leader of the Opposition talking about a bipartisan approach to fiscal responsibility in this country. We have not seen it for the last 11 years; maybe we are about to see it. But he did make that point. However, the member for Batman is echoing my sentiment. I read with interest in the Surf Coast Echo a comment he was reported to have made about the Princes Highway. The member for Batman is reported to have said:'I understand the local community's and council's frustration but the buck stops with the state government. I know my responsibility and that is not one of them,' Mr Ferguson said. 'The duckshoving needs to stop. We can also play the blame game.'I thank the member for Batman, because that is the truth. We negotiated the responsibilities for the different infrastructure corridors across Australia with the states under AusLink. We will continue to invest in AusLink, but we expect the states to continue to invest in their responsibilities, and this is one of them.Mr Speaker, you will recall that last week the member for Fraser asked me a question about the blame game: are we going to continue to blame the states? Yes, we are - where they are not shouldering their responsibilities. That is the answer I gave last week. We look forward to more bipartisan support on fiscal responsibility, and this is one of them.</DOC>

 - I certainly do remember the policy debate inside the government in 2003. Amongst other things, it has led to policies which have contributed to a turnaround in Australia's fertility rate. I would have thought that, if we are concerned about the long-term future of this country, turning around our fertility rate is fairly important. That policy debate led, amongst other things, to the introduction of the baby bonus. It also led to the introduction - and the member for Lilley will remember this - of the $600 a year supplement, the supplement that was not real. I can tell the member for Lilley - through you, Mr Speaker, as always - that it was very real indeed. This government's policies in relation to the balance of work and family have been remarkably successful. The member for Jagajaga talks about the respective sectors dealing with children. I do remind her, not in an exercise in the blame game but rather -  -  - Well, I am very interested in this expression 'blame game'. They love it opposite. When the Labor Party talk about the blame game ending, what they mean is that you have to stop blaming the states, all of which happen to be Labor, and continue to blame the Commonwealth, which happens to be a coalition government. I do not want to play the blame game.What I do want to do in this country is to play the responsibility game. The responsibility game is that we have certain responsibilities and the states have certain responsibilities. We do not expect the states to shoulder our responsibilities, and, in the 10 or 11 years I have been Prime Minister of this country, at no stage have we asked the states: 'Will you do this instead of us doing it?' It has always been one-way traffic, normally on the basis that the states want us to pay some money to them to do what they are already paid to do.Let me say that there are responsibilities, and early childhood services, particularly in relation to preschool, have been one of the fundamentals of that policy arrangement between the Commonwealth and the states. So, in the name of the responsibility game, I invite the former Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the member for Jagajaga, to have a talk to some of her state colleagues.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Grey, whose electorate contains Roxby Downs, the second largest uranium mine in the world. It is soon to be the largest. In 2005-06 Australia exported 10,000 tonnes of uranium ore concentrates. That was valued at $545 million. The expectation is that this year our uranium exports will be worth some $700 million. That is enough uranium to power almost 50 nuclear reactors, producing, interestingly enough, 40 per cent more than Australia's total electricity production, or two per cent of global electricity.So our uranium exports make a very strong contribution to the global energy scene. Last year our uranium was used in the United States, Japan, France, Korea, the United Kingdom and a number of other European countries. It is worth reminding the House that on 3 February the nuclear safeguards agreement that we negotiated with China entered into force. I acknowledge that the Leader of the Opposition supported this agreement, saying that he approved of the proposal of the Australian government to negotiate and then conclude an agreement with China to export uranium to China.The honourable member asked whether there are alternative policies. Let me make this point: the Labor Party does have an alternative policy. The Leader of the Opposition is going to go to the national conference of the Labor Party, and the Labor Party will be briefing the media that this is going to be a big challenge to get through a change to the three mines policy. Any journalist who writes that that is going to be a big challenge and a difficult task is a sucker, because that deal is already done. The Leader of the Opposition is not a brave man, and he would not take such a proposal to the Labor Party national conference if he thought there were any chance on earth of it being defeated. So do not write that story.The second thing is that the Leader of the Opposition and the majority of the Labor Party are saying, 'We think Australia should export more uranium.' That is what the Labor Party's position is, and that is good. I agree with that. The Leader of the Opposition, though, also says that nuclear power stations are a bad idea, that we should not have nuclear power stations in Australia, that we should not have nuclear power and that nuclear power is dangerous. He asks, 'What is going to happen to all the waste?' and all those sorts of questions. Hang on. I believe that the Leader of the Opposition goes around telling people that he is the cleverest person in politics. Bearing that in mind, if he is so clever, how come he has not worked out the rather obvious proposition, if I may say so - the obvious conundrum - for him to say that it is a good idea to export uranium but it is a bad idea to have nuclear power stations?What does the Leader of the Opposition think that this uranium is going to be used for? Fluorescent-faced watches or something like that? Lava lamps? To pave the streets of Paris - or Beijing, dare I say it? The contradiction and the hypocrisy in the Leader of the Opposition's position are obvious for all to see. But it makes the point, does it not, that this Leader of the Opposition always has contradictory positions. He is in favour of more uranium mining and more uranium exports, but he is totally opposed to nuclear power stations. He says that he is the most brilliant person in politics, so he has worked out that that is a contradiction. Why does he do it? He does it because the Leader of the Opposition is not only the most brilliant person in politics but also the greatest political opportunist ever seen.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Perth for his question. The Australian government believes that we should focus on where the problem lies in this area. Labor came up with a very hastily put together plan that entirely misses the point in relation to the teaching of maths and science in this country. We must engage young people at a primary or secondary school level. If they are not engaged and studying maths and science by years 10, 11 and 12, they are not going on to study it at university. That is self-evident and it is entirely missing from Labor's policy.What the Australian government is focusing on is supporting teachers and schools, scientific organisations and universities to work with the schools through a range of programs that the Australian government has instituted to inspire young people to study science and mathematics when they are at school - that is where the problem lies - rather than coming up with a bandaid approach at the higher education level that has been proven not to work.One thing I can say about the Leader of the Opposition: he has not had an original policy thought on anything, let alone education. He talks about his education revolution. Naughty boy! You stole that idea, didn't you? -  - You will have to go to the naughty corner, won't you? - One thing we have learned is: the Leader of the Opposition has no original thought when it comes to policy development. He talks about his brave new frontier and education revolution, but guess what? Somebody is back in vogue: What did you learn today? Creating an education revolution by one Mark Latham. So the new policy adviser on education is Mark Latham?</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Blair for his question and note that in 1996, when the Labor Party was last in government, unemployment in Blair was 9.4 per cent; today it is 5.2 per cent, and that is a great story. There are 1.9 million small businesses in Australia. The number has grown by 700,00 since 2001 and, encouragingly, the number of small businesses employing people has increased by 31 per cent in the last three years.We all know that the Labor Party's job-destroying unfair dismissal laws were a major impediment to small business employing more people, so this morning I picked up the Australian and had a look at this article: 'Labor won't turn back IR clock.' I thought to myself: 'Wow! This is significant.' I looked at a key quote from the member for Rankin and it said:It is small businesses, not political parties, that make the hiring decisions.I thought: 'That's reasonable. Hooray!' The Labor Party gave me a bit of a hard time in this place when I said that business creates jobs, not government. So finally they are starting to see the light. In the article, the member for Rankin said:... small business owners could not afford the time or expense of being dragged off to tribunals by 'ambulance-chasing agents representing frivolous or vexatious claims of unfair dismissal'.He went on to say:Such claims were often designed to extract 'go-away money.'I said: 'That's exactly what we believed.' We have been saying that for 10 years and, on the 44 occasions that the Labor Party voted in favour of the unfair dismissal laws and against small business, they never said this. I started to choke on my wheaties at this stage. -  - I tell you what: I wasn't choking on a glass of contact lenses - the member for Rankin has gone red. The member for Rankin went on to say that the unfair dismissal laws were a lawyers' picnic - he would know something about that. So I thought: 'Amen. The Labor Party at long last have seen that their job-destroying unfair dismissal laws are bad for small business,' but then I picked up the transcript of ABC Radio in Brisbane - Madonna King; it is classic reading. Madonna King to the member for Rankin:You're telling Labor Party frontbenchers that they should exempt unfair dismissal laws but you don't have an answer on that yet. Is that what you're saying?The member for Rankin:No, I have not said that in the speech. I have not said - Madonna King: No, I don't care what you said in the speech. What is the situation?The ABC is asking legitimate questions. The transcript continues:Emerson: I'm saying to you right now in answering your question that I have not said either in the speech or on your program that we are exempting small business.Madonna King: I don't understand why you didn't say this when I spoke to you a couple of hours ago about doing this interview.Hang on - saying one thing off air and another thing on air? Hello! It is compelling reading. It is quite an engaging conversation. If you need contact lenses, get a microscope and have a look at this. It continues:Madonna King: You're being a little bit tricky here, with respect, Dr Emerson, because I read you those parts of the report and at no point did you say that any of it was inaccurate. What have you changed in the last two hours?At any rate, it finishes with Madonna King saying:I think it might be better if we have a chat when you've made a decision on how to deal with small business.Amen to that! That is our position. We believe that business creates jobs, not government. We believe that the unfair dismissal laws have been an impediment to job creation by small business. We believe small business is the engine room of the Australian economy, and we believe that the best thing we can do for Australian small business and for job creation is to get out of the way, keep the unions out of the way and help to grow an Australian workplace.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, I want to start with the last part. I think that anthem belongs to the people and not to the Prime Minister. In relation to the other parts of the question: yes, I have just heard of that report from the Argon National Laboratories in Washington. In relation to the National Water Initiative, the irrigation systems of the entire nation are eligible to share and boundarilessly in what is provided under the plan, although by definition most of the money under that plan will go to irrigation systems in the Murray-Darling Basin because that is where most of the irrigation systems are. The plan is really stripped of superfluousness. It has two elements: one of them is to restore the irrigation systems through piping and lining; and the second is to deal with overallocations through, amongst other things, structural adjustments. The first takes about $6 billion and the second takes about $3 billion, but I have said that it is available to irrigation systems anywhere in the country.In relation to the so-called Bradfield scheme, I indicated that we would be happy to examine any proposal put forward. I know that my colleague Senator Bill Heffernan, whom I have appointed as chairman of the task force into Northern Australia, has already made contact with the Queensland Premier, and there will be a consideration. I do not want to raise expectations, because there are lot of experts who do not think it has a prayer of working - it is too environmentally negative and costly - but we have an open mind. In a way, that is separate from the national water security initiative, but I have indicated a willingness to have it examined.</DOC>

 - I do thank the member for Kingston for his question. The GP bulk-billing rate in his electorate has gone up by 15 percentage points since 2003. I do not know about my being a good Health minister, but that is a good result for the people of Kingston, thanks to the policies of the Howard government.The Howard government does not just talk about Medicare. We take the practical steps needed to make a good system even better. For instance, last year through Medicare the government spent some $200 million on preventive health and treating chronic disease, with 650,000 GP team care plans; 250,000 team care plans; 500,000 allied health consultations; and some 250,000 senior health checks. There is more good news on mental health, thanks to the Howard government, in particular through the good work of the Assistant Minister for Health and Ageing, the member for Sturt.In the first three months of its operation, under the government's new mental health initiative there were some 93,000 patients benefiting from GP mental health plans. There were almost 80,000 psychologist consultations funded through Medicare. That is an additional $25 million to direct patient mental health services, thanks to the Howard government. It is measures like this which mean that the Howard government is undeniably the best friend that Medicare has ever had.I was asked about alternative policies. On page 10 of a speech rather pretentiously titled The forgotten solution: primary care as the frontline of prevention, the shadow minister for health said:I haven't come here today to unveil all of Labor's proposals.In fact, she unveiled none of Labor's proposals. Labor's only health policy is to have a single funder or not to have a single funder - to have a single funder, if you believe the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, and not to have a single funder, if you believe the shadow minister for health. And I suppose around all of this is the Leader of the Opposition, like some latter-day Hamlet, stroking his chin and saying, 'To be or not to be; that is the question' - like he is in favour of the US alliance but not in Iraq; like he wants to cut greenhouse gases but not until 2050; and like he wants to be a Christian socialist but not a socialist.In the absence of any serious health policy, we have to go back to the Leader of the Opposition's record on health as the de facto Premier of Queensland. What did he do? He closed operating theatres in Brisbane, he cut 2,200 public hospital beds throughout the great state of Queensland and he allowed dental health waiting lists to blow out to three years. Members opposite do not like hearing about Dr Death, but the Courier-Mail of 2 September -  - I am quoting from the Courier-Mail of 2 September 1995, which says:Mr Rudd - that is, the Leader of the Opposition - acknowledged the nickname Dr Death, lovingly bestowed by some Queensland public servants.He acknowledged the nickname himself. I am quoting from the Courier-Mail. - To quote the Courier-Mail, the Leader of the Opposition:... acknowledged the nickname Dr Death, lovingly bestowed by some Queensland public servants. - I am quoting his own words from the Courier-Mail. - My point is that the Leader of the Opposition revelled in this particular nickname. He is quoted in the article as saying:You know, it could have been worse. I could have been called Morticia, Rasputin or Pol Pot.These are nicknames that the Leader of the Opposition used to describe himself. I say this to the Australian people: whether it is Dr Death or Pol Pot, do not trust him with the health system.</DOC>

 - Firstly, I thank the honourable member for Tangney for his question. Whether people are supporters or opponents of the government, they would have to concede that the government has sent a very clear message to people smugglers that we do not tolerate people smuggling. Despite the fact that there are some people who have been smuggled, we believe, to Australia recently - and that is being dealt with separately - in an overall sense, the government's policies, which have been tough policies, have had a substantial impact on people-smuggling operations into Australia.It is worth the House remembering that in 1999 to 2001, about 12,000 people arrived illegally in Australia by boat. By contrast, in 2005-06, 56 people arrived. This has been possible for a number of reasons. But one of those reasons is the good cooperation we have had from neighbouring countries - obviously from Pacific countries, including Nauru, but also from Indonesia. It reflects the strength of Australia's relationship with Indonesia that we have been as successful as we have been - although we have not been totally successful; nevertheless, a substantial degree of success has been achieved. There are a number of other factors contributing to this success, and one of them has been the decision by the government to excise some of the islands around the north of Australia from the immigration zone.The honourable member asks if there are any alternatives. I noticed in the Australian newspaper today that the Leader of the Opposition had apparently called together leading figures in the Labor Party in the context of the 80 or so Sri Lankans and said: 'Let's close down on this issue. Let's not talk about it.' So the member for Watson has been closed down. They do not want to talk about it because they think the public may get wise to the fact that Labor are weak on people smugglers - and that, of course, is what the Labor Party are worried about.We all know that the Leader of the Opposition has a policy for every occasion, a policy for every position. The Leader of the Opposition wants to give the impression that, on the one hand, he is tough on border protection. But what is his other point? His other point is that the government is too tough on border protection. That is his point: 'I'm tough on border protection but the government are tough on border protection and that's why I'm against them.' The Leader of the Opposition says that existing Labor policy will remain. Existing Labor policy is to set up a coastguard that sails around the coast of Northern Australia and, if it comes across a boat, to guide that boat into Australia. - It is not a coastguard, is it, Mr Speaker? It is a 'coast guide' and no doubt, as the Minister for Defence said, a unionised coast guide. The Labor Party wants to repeal the government's legislation on excision. The Labor Party wants to repeal that policy. Indeed, it will be recalled that, the last time excision legislation was put to the parliament, the Labor Party voted against it.The opposition leader had a doorstop - the opposition leader loves being in the media; he really likes being the opposition leader because he can be in the media every day - on 23 February and said, 'Labor's policy is that if people are interdicted on the high seas then those vessels should be turned around.' I heard that. Wow! They should be turned around. What is interesting - talking about turning around - is that he did a full 180-degree turnaround himself in the next sentence. He said, 'If people are on the high seas,' but then indicated that, if they are going to seek asylum in Australia, they should be taken to Christmas Island for processing. So they are turned around and brought to Christmas Island for processing. Turn them around twice, I suppose, and then they go to Christmas Island for processing. This is the point: the Labor Party is trying to be all things to all people. The Leader of the Opposition has never taken a strong stance in support of any single issue and stuck with it. He just hunts around for the populist position and, of course, the appeasing position for the various factions within the Labor Party.It is a simple point: you can talk about politics on these issues but, at the end of the day, the serious policy issue is to make sure that we deal with people smuggling. If you do not deal with people smuggling then people will undertake dangerous journeys; they will take risks. People smugglers will drive people into this situation and make money out of it. And, talking about making money, billions of dollars a year are made out of people smuggling. It is in this country's interest to make sure that we crack down on people smuggling, that we deal with it and that we do it in the most humane way we can but do it in a tough way. The Leader of the Opposition - let's face it - is weak on border security issues and is frightened that he might be exposed. Well, he is exposed.</DOC>

 - I think my reference was to the nature of the campaign being run by the Labor Party on this issue. But let me take the opportunity afforded to me by the Chief Opposition Whip of reminding the House of what is involved here. If this country decides to go down the nuclear path, it will be some years before -  - It will be some years and, in those circumstances, as I said yesterday, there is no point in the government indicating where power stations might be located. I do not intend, as I indicated yesterday, to engage in an exercise of saying, 'Nuclear power stations won't be here or won't be there.' I repeat what I said yesterday: I do not intend to engage in the game of ruling out the location of nuclear power stations in any particular part of this country, because that will prejudice a sensible debate about this issue. If there is one thing we need, it is a sensible, measured debate. We need to have all of the options properly considered.Last night on Lateline, Dr Switkowski - appearing in the absence of a positive response to an invitation issued to the member for Kingsford Smith by the Lateline program - made a very important point. It is a point validated by the views of the Chief Scientist, Dr Jim Peacock. Dr Switkowski said that there are really only two workable sources of energy for power stations for baseload power in this country: one of them is fossil fuels; the other is nuclear power. That is a fact. It is scientific knowledge; it is unarguable scientific knowledge.I am encouraged in the belief that we should have an open debate about this issue and am encouraged to renew my invitation to the Labor Party to have an open debate about this issue by a document that was released today entitled New directions for our schools. It is about establishing a national curriculum to improve our educational outcomes, and it is the document that the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Perth released today. It is a very interesting document, not least for what it has to say on page 17. I invite the House to listen to this. The document says: 'Young people need a framework of scientific knowledge' - yes, that is right - 'so they can recognise some of the science underlying important contemporary arguments about such matters as nuclear power and global warming.' In other words, it is all right for the young of this country to be invited to go down the path of scientific inquiry and to open their minds to arguments about nuclear power and climate change, but, when it comes to the political purposes of the Australian Labor Party, nothing gets in the way of a grubby scare campaign.Let me just say to those who sit opposite that I have stated a view on behalf of the government in relation to this. We believe that nuclear power should be part of the debate. We have established a public inquiry. We will be giving a detailed response to the Switkowski report. But I have already indicated that this government believes that, as the cost of powering power stations in this country rises through the introduction of clean coal technology, nuclear power will become more economic. We would be recreant and doing great damage to our future if we did not consider, in a rational way, nuclear power. Where power stations will be located if we decide to go down that path will depend upon a combination of economic, environmental and regulatory decisions made by both Commonwealth and state governments. I have no intention of responding to the Labor Party's campaign by saying, 'We're not going to have a power station there or there.' The essence of a rational debate on this issue is not to engage in that sort of exercise.As Dr Switkowski said in his report, the economics suggest that it will be in the order of 10 to 15 years before nuclear power will be an option. But, unlike the Labor Party, we are not going to turn our back on an option that could provide for future generations a clean source of power generation and a way forward in relation to the replacement of what might loosely be called 'dirty power' in the operation of our power stations. This is an important debate and I would only wish that the inquiry and open-mindedness that the Australian Labor Party's policy wants our children to have would be assumed by the members of the front bench.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member. The Lucas Heights reactor is located in her electorate and it makes an important contribution to employment and to the economy there. For the reasons that the Prime Minister has outlined, including the letter from the Chief Scientist, it is quite clear that the only alternative to fossil fuel power for providing the baseload power that a modern economy needs is nuclear power. That is the only alternative, and it is the only alternative which has zero CO emissions. Nuclear power is a proven technology. There are 443 nuclear reactors in 31 countries and nuclear power today contributes 15 per cent of global electricity generation. There can be no sensible, objective consideration of our energy options without having nuclear power on the table, without it being an option.Every single report, from the Stern review to the recent report by the International Energy Agency, stresses that in meeting the greenhouse challenge all the options have to be on the table - every technological option, including renewables, biomass, hydro, clean coal and nuclear. If you take one of those options off the table for ideological reasons then you constrain your ability to meet the climate change challenge. Australia has 38 per cent of the world's known low-cost uranium reserves. Between us and Canada, we produce more than 50 per cent of the world's natural uranium supply. Nuclear power will continue to be a growing part of the world's energy solution, and it will increase because of its zero-emissions nature.What is the alternative? We have an ideological position from the Labor Party which says that you cannot have nuclear power in Australia. They say that they will not accept it for environmental reasons. But they go off on their holidays and on their trips to Europe and go round France and are not shaking with horror or trembling with terror at the fact that France generates nearly 80 per cent of its stationary energy from nuclear power. Do they imagine that the French - or the Belgians, who produce 55 per cent of their energy from nuclear power - care less for the environment than they do? The absurdity of the Labor Party's position is that it is based on nothing more than ideology.There are serious divisions in the Labor Party. The member for Kingsford Smith does not simply want to stop the expansion of Australia's coal industry; he is opposed to uranium mining, as he said last year on Triple J:I am not supporting any uranium mining of any kind, actually. I am not in favour of us expanding the nuclear industry in Australia, uranium mining or nuclear power generation or radioactive waste storage. I can't be any clearer than that.Only a few weeks ago he said in the Adelaide Advertiser:There are serious questions about the ever-onward expansion of uranium mining in Australia.We have seen the member for Kingsford Smith do his backflip over US bases. It is not so long ago that he wanted to evict the US bases from Australia. - How long will it be before he performs another backflip? The people of Australia know that the member for Kingsford Smith, all his life, has been committed to a number of values that he holds very dear - and one of them is to stop uranium mining in Australia. - He is opposed to uranium mining. He wants to deny the world the cleanest source of baseload power available to it today. He is not prepared to be part of the solution; he simply wants to exacerbate the problem of global warming. He does not care how poor we are, as long as we are, by his lights, pure. Ideology is a poor guide to energy policy and it will not meet the greenhouse challenge.</DOC>

 - The earnings of employees on AWAs increased to $26.40 per hour and $949 per week in May 2006. These figures are based on only one month of Work Choices. In total weekly earning terms, non-managerial employees on AWAs earn nine per cent more than employees on registered collective agreements and 94 per cent more than employees on awards. I want to say this about the interesting change over the last 12 months: of the 241,000 jobs created since Work Choices was introduced, more than 109,000 have gone to women. - I make the further point that, over the last few months, as we have seen long-term unemployment reach the lowest level in two decades, we have seen more women come into the workplace -  - than at any other time. At the same time those people, who are in many cases women coming into the workforce, have been on the single-parent pension. We have made more than one million phone calls to people on the single-parent pension. There have been 100,000 people - essentially women - on parental pension referred to the Job Network. Those people have been out of the workforce for very long periods of time. They have taken up jobs in the retail and hospitality industries. Our view on this side of the House -  - is that it is always better to get a job than to remain on welfare.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Bonner for his question and congratulate him on an unemployment rate of 4.3 per cent amongst his constituents. Of course, the Labor legacy was unemployment at 6.7 per cent in the same region. Work for the Dole has been extraordinarily successful. While the Howard government has many employment and training programs that are superb, Work for the Dole is extraordinary. This is the 10th anniversary of this program. Work for the Dole recognises and overcomes the fact that the long-term unemployed can become dispirited and deskilled. They need real-life and current work experience and an opportunity to regain self-respect by giving back to the community whose taxpayers have been supporting them and their families.There have been almost 31,000 projects over the 10 years, right across Australia, delivering great results to the community and to those individuals. Nearly half a million long-term unemployed Australians have taken part. Nearly 40 per cent of those job seekers completing their Work for the Dole projects have been moved into work, education or training just three months after their participation - and most went into work. Work for the Dole projects deliver work experience in areas of skills shortages in local areas. Training credits are earned as the individual works through their six months. The training then undertaken echoes the skills in demand in that region.Because we paid down the Labor debt that we inherited in 1996 and have expertly managed the economy over the last 10 years, our government has been in a position to respond to the worst drought on record. Over $2 billion has gone directly to support drought affected farmers and small businesses. This government recognises that another victim of drought is the rural workforce, so Work for the Dole has been extended into Drought Force, a program that allows individuals driven out of their jobs by drought to work back on a farm, a drought stricken property. At the same time the worker receives Newstart allowance and a $1,600 training credit. This is a profoundly important program for the future of our rural populations.It is extraordinary that Work for the Dole is missing from the vocabulary and the future plans of the Labor Party, including the opposition leader and those who sit opposite. Labor's policy in relation to government provided employment services is barren. No doubt they hope the public will forget their legacy. They left unemployment and despair in 1996; we have brought back hope and employment to millions.</DOC>

 - When it comes to women re-entering the workforce, the government has a very proud history. Real wages have increased for women by 22.6 per cent under the coalition, compared with 8.8 per cent under the Labor Party. - Since March 1996, more than one million women have joined the workforce and the female participation rate has increased from 53.7 per cent to 57.5 per cent. As we are talking about statistics, the ABS released data showing wages growth of over four per cent over the year to the December quarter 2006. That is with inflation at around 3.3 per cent. Women coming back into the workforce in particular are looking for flexibility - the sort of flexibility that the Labor Party and their union bosses could never give them through the awards system and the sort of flexibility that they never got under the Labor Party's centralised wage-fixing system. -  - And the World Economic Forum's assessment, where they assess the wages gap has narrowed, is proof that under the coalition women have a fairer go in the workplace. - Women have better wages and they have better opportunities than certainly anything under the Labor Party.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Barker for his question. I know how he and all other South Australian members, particularly on this side of the House, care about the health of the Murray-Darling Basin. He will recall the agreement that was reached last Friday between me, the premiers and the Chief Minister of four of the jurisdictions. I am very hopeful that the Victorian government will see that the interests of the people of Victoria are served by Victoria's also joining in the historic commitment by the Commonwealth of an extra $10 billion to secure the health of the Murray-Darling Basin for decades into the future.The plan that I put forward on behalf of the government, and which is supported by New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia and the Australian Capital Territory, is a balanced plan that tackles the fundamental problems of water security. It is not a knee-jerk reaction to the problem of water security. It is not an ill thought through response to the water crisis that Australia faces. Rather, it is a carefully thought through, well-crafted proposal that addresses the seepage and wastage of water in the irrigation system and the problem of overallocation.The member for Barker asked me whether there are any alternative proposals. I saw an alternative proposal this morning emanating from the National Secretary of the Australian Workers Union, president of the Victorian branch of the ALP and endorsed Labor candidate for Maribyrnong - a man often touted as a future leader of the federal parliamentary Labor Party - Mr Bill Shorten. Yesterday he called for cotton and rice growers to be forced out of business and for their water intensive crops to be replaced by less thirsty options such as hemp. Bill Shorten is now adding the workers in the rice and cotton industries to the Labor Party's hit list of the workers in the uranium and coal industries.It is not enough for the member for Kingsford Smith to say that there cannot be an unlimited expansion of the uranium industry. It is not enough for the member for Kingsford Smith to be evasive when it comes to the future of the coal industry. Now we have Bill Shorten, who is coming to Canberra and has Labor preselection for a seat the Labor Party has now held for decades and who is often touted as a future leader of the Labor Party. The fascinating thing is that he is the secretary of the union whose members would lose their jobs if the rice and cotton industries were put out of business.Let me make it very clear: this country needs balanced agriculture. It needs balance in its water security policies and it also needs balanced agriculture. That means that you need perennial crops like horticulture and annual crops like rice and cotton. This idea that you get rid of one of them in the name of saving water is ludicrous. What you do to save water is introduce proper pricing policies and a proper trading system, as postulated by the National Water Initiative; invest $6 billion in piping and lining the irrigation systems of Australia; and allocate $3 billion to deal with the problem of overallocation, where necessary by structural adjustment. Bill Shorten is a menace to the job security of workers in the rice and cotton industries -  - just as the Australian Greens and those in the Australian Labor Party who would cuddle up to them are a menace to the job security of people in the uranium and coal industries of Australia.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Braddon for his question. I can tell him that the Productivity Commission has done an assessment of the national reform agenda which was agreed between the Commonwealth and the states at COAG in February 2006. The findings of the Productivity Commission are that improvements to competition and regulation could, after a period of around 10 years, increase GDP by 1¾ per cent, or about $17 billion in 2005-06 terms. The reforms that could benefit Australia to that degree on the competition and regulation side include nationally consistent road and rail regulations, including safety and technical standards; the introduction of performance based standards to promote flexibility and innovation for heavy vehicles; and more efficient investment spending on road and rail infrastructure. For electricity, this could arise from structural and organisational changes in the generation sector, enhanced demand-side measures and improved regulatory governance. For gas, this could result from streamlined regulatory arrangements and the establishment of a spot market for gas. Similarly, the Productivity Commission found that reforms on the human capital stream could, after a period of around 25 years, raise output by about nine per cent. The commission has modelled improvements that would come through increased workforce participation and higher work incentives.This assessment by the Productivity Commission has found tangible, real economic benefits to our country as a whole in terms of increased living standards and increased revenues for government from a reform agenda - a wide-ranging agenda to get regulatory reform in these areas. This, of course, is coming off the back of the last 10 years of the competition agenda, which had been administered under the Competition Principles Agreement, under which the Commonwealth has now distributed billions of dollars to the Labor states, according to their progress in relation to reform. As the person who administered the competition agreement I can say that it was hard work getting those states to the barrier, but the gains are worth it. This finding by the Productivity Commission is that the government's next agenda over the years to come in competition, regulation and human capital has the capacity to drive the economy forward. That is why the Commonwealth is working on them, and they are the gains to be taken from it.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Riverina for her question and recognise her great support of those irrigation industries in her area, particularly the value-adding that takes place in the rice industry. The irrigation sector of agriculture in Australia employs around 171,000 people. It is not just the farmers and their families on those farms in those irrigation areas; it is also the farm labourers and, just as importantly, the workers in the processing plants in those industries that are value-adding industries in regional Australia. They include the jobs of the workers in the cotton gins, in the rice mills and in the sugar mills - also irrigated agriculture - across Australia. We think that those people working in those industries do a fantastic job, and they are of great value not just to the Australian economy but particularly to regional economies across Australia.But it has become clear that there are other people in the community who do not value those jobs, and we do not think those 171,000 workers throughout those industries are valued by the Australian Workers Union or by the National Secretary of the Australian Workers Union, or indeed the Australian Labor Party, as well as the union movement. We saw comments this morning from the endorsed candidate for Maribyrnong, who is also the Victorian Labor Party President and the National Secretary of the AWU, who actually represents many of those workers who work in the rice mills, in the sugar mills and in the cotton gins. He was quoted in the paper this morning as follows:Union leader and Labor recruit Bill Shorten called yesterday for cotton and rice growers to be forced out of business and their water-intensive crops replaced by less thirsty options such as hemp.You would think that the head of the AWU, and someone aspiring to be a minister in this place, would take an interest in the sustainability of jobs in those mills. He certainly does not, and he has shown that he does not care for those workers. I point out, because he is talking about the scarcity of water and water-intensive crops, that the rice industry has reduced its use of water by 30 per cent in the last 10 years. It has improved its efficient use of water by 30 per cent, while at the same time increasing production by 60 per cent over that period. The cotton industry has reduced its dependence on water by 18 per cent. Those are the sorts of things that you do - such as our government's national water plan - to sustain an industry, rather than adopt harebrained ideas like that from Mr Shorten, which will put not only thousands of people out of work but thousands of his union's members out of work. In an article in the Australian, Mr Shorten said:The world wouldn't end if, instead of growing cotton, we started growing hemp.Mr Speaker, the world might not end, but the world might end for the workers in the rice mills, for the workers in the cotton gins and for the workers in the coalmines - just like the workers in the forestry industry if Labor had been elected at the last election. The one piece of advice we can give to the workers in those industries is: do not get between the Labor Party and Green preferences, because you will lose your job.</DOC>

 - I have no intention of being as foolish as the member for Richmond. I was asked where I would nominate a nuclear reactor to be in my electorate. It is the smallest electorate in Australia: 25 square kilometres. It would be like asking the member for Richmond where you would put a nuclear reactor in downtown Murwillumbah. It is a stupid question. The member for Richmond knows it is a stupid question, and she does herself a disservice by asking it.</DOC>

 - For days now I have been hearing outside the chamber that I am going to be asked inside the chamber about what I knew about Mr Walker's company, Australian Nuclear Energy. Chris Bowen promised to ask me on 27 February, Peter Garrett promised to ask me -  - On 27 February the member for Jagajaga promised to ask me. The member for Grayndler said, 'We will be pursuing these questions both inside and outside the parliament over coming days.' I am pleased that the member for Canning finally did what the Labor Party did not. As I have already made public, Mr Ron Walker certainly told me that he was forming a company called Australian Nuclear Energy - just as he told the Prime Minister, just as he told the Premier of Victoria and just as he told the Labor Treasurer of Victoria. This was, apparently, some great scandal, so scandalous that he told the Labor Party. Mr Walker is the chairman of the Fairfax companies and he is the chairman of the Commonwealth Games Organising Committee. He chaired major events for both the Labor and the Liberal Party, and he is a very respected businessman. Undoubtedly, he has every right to notify the government in relation to these matters.It is quite different when somebody is lobbied by a convicted criminal like Brian Burke. Brian Burke has been convicted of fraud and he has served time for his crimes. Brian Burke's reputation was so sullied that the former Premier of Western Australia, Premier Gallop, banned any connection between Brian Burke and members of the Western Australian government. Indeed, I pay tribute to the member for Perth, who, yesterday, said he had not had a conversation with Brian Burke for a decade and a half. He said:_ if only more people in Western Australia had followed that example.I don't believe _ that the activities and actions of Brian Burke, which have been exposed in the Corruption Commission established by a state Labor Government, deserve anything other than complete and absolute condemnation.We pay tribute to the member for Perth for taking that attitude.It will come as some considerable concern to members of this House to know that, whilst Mr Burke was under a ban and whilst the member for Perth was refusing to deal with him, there was a member of this House who was flying into Western Australia regularly to meet with Mr Burke, and that was the Leader of the Opposition. We know that the Leader of the Opposition went to Mr Burke's favourite eatery, Perugino, in West Perth on 1 August 2005.We have had an explanation from the member for Cowan that the way this came about was that the Leader of the Opposition was staying with the member for Cowan. He had nothing to do that night, so the member for Cowan said, 'Why don't we go down to Perugino's?' And guess who was there? It reminded me of the scene in Muriel's Wedding when the mistress of Bill Hunter walks into the Chinese restaurant and Bill Hunter says, 'Deidre Chambers, what a coincidence!' 'Brian Burke, what a coincidence down here at Perugino's on 1 August 2005. I didn't know you were going to be here, Brian. And while I am here, I will make a speech on China.' That is apparently what he did. He made a speech on China at the Perugino restaurant.It was not just that he was at Perugino's with Brian Burke on 1 August 2005, whilst Burke was under a ban from Premier Gallop, but that he happened to be in Western Australia in May for breakfast with Brian Burke. 'Brian Burke, what a coincidence! He's down at my breakfast place.' In November 2005, he happened to see him at lunch. Brian Burke at lunch - what a coincidence! On three occasions in 2005, whilst a convicted criminal was under a ban from the Western Australian government, the Leader of the Opposition flew into Perth to have breakfast, lunch and dinner with Mr Brian Burke. Those who understand politics in this House will say that it was no coincidence that, in 2005, when the Leader of the Opposition was looking for numbers for his leadership bid, he happened to be going regularly to Western Australia and meeting with Mr Brian Burke.Let me make another observation: Mr Brian Burke never does something for nothing. Mr Brian Burke has now been fingered by the crime commission in Western Australia and four ministers have lost their jobs because of their contacts with him, because anyone who deals with Mr Brian Burke is morally and politically compromised. If the Leader of the Opposition thought that dealing with him in 2005 did not sully him, it did. The member for Perth knows it, the people of Western Australia know it and the people of Australia deserve an explanation as to what he was doing there.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for the question and the interest that she has shown. It will not come as any surprise to members of this House that the government takes a very strong stand against terrorism all over the world, because this is not just a local problem or a regional problem; this is a global problem.On Sunday I am going to Indonesia. During the early part of next week, the Attorney-General, the Acting Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police and I will participate in a subregional meeting on counterterrorism. This meeting will include foreign ministers, law enforcement ministers and police chiefs from regional countries - Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand. We will be spending time early next week exploring ways to deepen our existing cooperation, which is very good. We will also be addressing emerging challenges: how are we getting on in countering radicalisation? What more needs to be done? What narrative needs to be challenged? How should it be challenged? We will be looking at how we can more effectively respond in the event of mass casualty attacks, and we will also be looking at law enforcement cooperation and legal frameworks.Dr Hassan Wirajuda, the Indonesian foreign minister, and I will open a regional leadership course for senior police at the Jakarta Centre for Law Enforcement Cooperation. I will be addressing students at a Muslim university in Yogyakarta, visiting a Muslim school that is part of AusAID's Islamic education assistance program and meeting with other community and religious leaders.Let me say this about counterterrorism in South-East Asia: I think governments, like the Indonesian government - I will particularly mention them - and those of Malaysia, Singapore and more recently the Philippines have been making real progress in their counterterrorist activities. Very importantly, and very noteworthy, there has been a decline in public support for terrorism and extremism in Indonesia. It is important in the war against terrorism to understand that. I do not think many people in Australia do. The last two years have been good years - not perfect years, but good years - in South-East Asia in terms of counterterrorism. There is a long way to go. There is still, day by day, the risk of terrorist attacks. There is no question about that. Nevertheless real progress is being made. I think next week our government will be able to take this matter further forward and with greater success.The honourable member asked me about a different approach. I think the Labor Party do have a very different approach. For a start, the Labor Party do not recognise that terrorism is a global problem. They think terrorism is just a sporadic problem - it is a bit of a problem, maybe, in South-East Asia. They say we need to bring troops back from Iraq to South-East Asia to fight terrorism. I am not quite sure where we would be sending the troops in South-East Asia to do this, but we look forward to that revelation. They think it is very important to fight terrorism in Afghanistan, but we should let the terrorists win in Iraq - it is important to let the terrorists win in Iraq and lose in Afghanistan, and presumably lose in South-East Asia. It is completely incomprehensible.The most incomprehensible part of this is that the Labor Party never answer the question, because in his heart the Leader of the Opposition knows the answer - that victory for terrorists in Iraq would be a massive boost for terrorism around the world, including in South-East Asia. This is not a regional movement; this is a global movement. Whether it is popular or whether it is unpopular, political leaders in this country owe it to this country to make sure that we do our absolute best for this country's security. Nobody could ever say that this government is anything but very strong and very determined on national security.</DOC>

 - I have a couple of observations. I was not aware that Noel Crichton-Browne had been sent to jail. Maybe something has escaped me. I am not aware that he has been sent to jail for fraud. As to contact between him and people on our side of the House, if you want to ask other ministers, you can go ahead and do so. But, speaking for myself, tomorrow being the 11th anniversary of the defeat of the Keating Labor government, I well remember the year that led up to that. I consumed, inside my own party, the first couple of months of that year in making sure that Noel Crichton-Browne was not on the Liberal Party Senate ticket for the election that brought my government to power. That involved taking him on. That involved going to Western Australia, not to consort with a convicted criminal. It meant going to Western Australia to make certain that my party's Senate ticket did not have on it somebody I regarded as unsuitable. I was willing to do that as opposition leader because I regarded it as my obligation as the leader of the party. It involved some difficult confrontations with some people in the party. I have never regarded that man's influence in the Western Australia division of my party as being anything other than rather negative.But let us understand what this is all about. This is all about a double standard in the Australian Labor Party. I am meant to justify and explain to the last detail a telephone conversation I had, in the course of my duty as Prime Minister of Australia, with a very reputable business man. Ron Walker has never been convicted of fraud. Hugh Morgan has never been convicted of fraud. Robert Champion de Crespigny has never been convicted of fraud. The three of them represent exemplars of ethics and good behaviour in the Australian business community. Hugh Morgan is a member of the board of the Reserve Bank. Robert Champion de Crespigny is an advisor to the South Australian Labor government. Ron Walker is proudly a former honorary federal treasurer of the Liberal Party and is now the chairman of the Fairfax company.What this is all about is a double standard. I am meant to explain every detail of that, the Treasurer is meant to explain every detail of that, but the Leader of the Opposition thinks that he can skate by with some kind of generalised answer at a news conference in relation to his contact with Brian Burke. Anybody who has any understanding of Australian politics would suspect that what the Leader of the Opposition was about was touting for preferment and favour from a man of influence in the Labor Party in Western Australia. That is what we are on about. The member for Grayndler can question me as often as he likes about the former senator from Western Australia. I will be very happy to go on answering in the vein that I have in the last two answers.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Makin for her question, and I acknowledge the many years that she has spent in the great calling of nursing. Thanks to the policies of the Howard government there are now more nurses in Australia and they are playing a more important role in our health system. According to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare there were just under 250,000 nurses in nursing in 2004, and that was an 11 per cent increase since 1999. Since 2005 the Howard government has announced a further 3,000 nursing training places. Since 2001 the government has committed some $234 million to improving the position of nurses in general practice. Thanks to the government's policies there are now at least 5,000 nurses working in general practice, and those nurses are now supported by Medicare rebates. This is the first time that this has happened under any Australian government.One thing the Howard government does not intend to do is create a Commonwealth position of chief nursing officer. Didn't our failure to do this get the opposition very excited! Last year the Deputy Leader of the Opposition said:At the most recent Nursing Leadership Conference in Sydney, Minister Abbott refused to appoint a Chief Nurse ... It seems the Minister for Health is happy to talk about the role of nurses when it suits him but has failed to take the profession of nursing seriously.A month later she said, 'A Labor government will appoint a chief nursing officer to ensure Australian nurses have a voice in the federal government.' So it could not be clearer: Labor will appoint a chief nurse. But hang on a minute: two years into his time as the de facto Premier of Queensland, the now Leader of the Opposition sacked the chief nurse of Queensland. So Dr Death killed the chief nurse of Queensland. - I am happy to assist the House by withdrawing, Mr Speaker. This is what the Leader of the Opposition's health minister in the Rudd Queensland Christian socialist Labor government told parliament in 1991: 'I can confirm that under the restructured department of health the position of chief nursing officer for Queensland will disappear.' Members opposite think the Commonwealth government, which does not employ nurses, must have a chief nurse but the Queensland government, which employs tens of thousands of nurses, must not have a chief nursing officer.What is now clear is that members opposite in the Labor Party actually have four health policies. Their first policy is to have a single funder for health, if you believe the deputy leader. Their second policy is not to have a single funder for health, if you believe the shadow minister for federalism; their third policy is to have a chief nurse, if you believe the deputy leader; and their fourth policy is not to have a chief nurse, if you believe the Leader of the Opposition when he was the de facto Premier of Queensland.He is a real piece of work, this bloke. He is not a socialist, but he is a Christian socialist. He attacks Howard's utopia but he is happy to have Brian Burke as his Western Australian numbers man. He is a disciple of Dietrich Bonhoeffer when he is seeking Christian votes, but he is the associate of Brian Burke when he wants support in caucus. - I think the people of Australia are starting to get a sense of this bloke. They understand that deep down he is a phoney. He is a phoney.</DOC>

 - So the Exclusive Brethren equals Brian Burke! That is an interesting and fascinating question! To start with, the Exclusive Brethren do not vote. That is the first thing I say. The second thing is, if they letterbox in my favour, good on them; they show great taste. And let me also make it clear -  - that like any other group -  - in the Australian community -  - the Exclusive Brethren are entitled to express their views, and I make it clear that my door is open to any lawful organisation and to any group of people who have not been convicted of crimes. Let us take it back to where the Treasurer put it: what we are talking about is the behaviour of the Leader of the Opposition supping with somebody who was under a ban by Dr Geoff Gallop and who had been convicted of a crime. To my knowledge, as a group the Exclusive Brethren have not been convicted of a crime. Individuals may have - like individual people who are members of a church may have been or individual atheists may have been - but as a group they are a lawful organisation. If the member for Grayndler thinks that by this line of questioning he is going to intimidate me out of meeting lawful organisations, he is wrong, and I encourage all -  - the good people of Bennelong, whatever their faith or no faith may be, to vote Liberal.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Page for his question. I note that I read an article in the Northern Star with the headline that the Far North Coast has shed its reputation as the nation's dole capital. It says that unemployment has hit a 30-year low as the region cashes in on the economic boom. It cites no better authority than the federal member for Page as saying:... the lifting of unfair dismissal laws gave local business owners confidence to employ more staff.That is excellent. It is a good news story. Unemployment is down to 5.6 per cent on the North Coast of New South Wales. The unfair dismissal laws are job destroying. They have had a negative impact on small business. That is why we removed them - to provide an incentive for small business to go out and employ more Australians.I was asked about alternative policies. I note that the Labor Party has had, to the best of my knowledge, seven different policies on unfair dismissal laws in the last seven months. Seven different policies! Policy No.1, from the member for Brand, the former Leader of the Opposition, was to abolish Work Choices and reinstate unfair dismissal laws. Policy No. 2 was in a transcript of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition on the ABC Insiders program where she suggested they change the threshold. Policy No. 3 scrapped Beazley's policy on dismissal and flagged reinstatement. Policy No. 4 was from the shadow minister for small business, over there, in a speech to COSBOA - a landmark speech that said nothing - on 27 February. Policy No. 5 was the next day: that fabulous interview with Madonna King on the ABC! We will not forget that in a hurry. And there were a number of policies within policies in Policy No. 5 with Madonna King. Policy No. 6 - God bless her! - was from Sharan Burrow. Sharan Burrow was asked today:Do you have the unequivocal support of federal Labor for winding back Work Choices?She said:No question. There is an absolute commitment to reinstate the unfair dismissal laws.It goes further. Today there was an article in the Australian; and this is the next policy. - It was by Sid Marris. The article says:Labor is debating internally how it can minimise a backlash from small businesses over its plan to wind back their exemption from unfair dismissal laws.And listen to this:Some in the labour movement are considering a special mediator who could go to a workplace to resolve a dispute.What sort of mediator? Brian Burke or Mark Latham? There could be a whole range of them. I was reminded of the article in the West Australian about a fellow by the name of Joe Mcdonald. It says:Unionist Joe McDonald has vowed to continue breaking the law by trespassing on Perth building sites to conduct union business after police were called to remove him from a site yesterday when he refused about two dozen requests to leave.It goes on to say:The assistant secretary of the Construction, Forestry , Mining and Energy Union conceded it was the fourth time in the past fortnight that police had been called to building sites to remove him, but on two occasions he left before they arrived.It is illegal for Mr McDonald to enter building sites ... after losing both his State and Federal right of entry permits for behaviour, including bullying and harassment.This is the perfect sort of mediator that Sharan Burrow might have been considering! It gets better:But the controversial unionist admitted for the first time yesterday that the law would not stop him entering building sites.No wonder Sharan Burrow wants to change the law. She wants to bring mediators like Joe Mcdonald into the workplace. This is policy No. 7. Seven policies in seven months!They are not only walking both sides of the street when it comes to unfair dismissal laws; they are stuck on a Canberra roundabout and they cannot get off. When is the Labor Party going to come up with a policy? At this stage the only policy that Australian business can understand is the ACTU's policy, where they are going to have trade unionists going back into every workplace, where they are going to reintroduce the job-destroying unfair dismissal laws and where they are going to leave small business and Australian workers behind.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Macquarie for his question, and I note his deep interest in developing education policy for this nation. Earlier this month the Australian government put on the agenda of the next education ministers' meeting in April a proposal for greater national consistency in curriculum. We are seeking higher standards of education in our schools through national consistency in curriculum. We want to set benchmarks for assessments across the country and, specifically for year 12 certificates, we want a consistent national approach for assessment and reporting.We see this is as a national priority. Wherever a student lives they should have access to high-quality education and high-quality curriculum. We want it to represent world's best practice and have Australia's national curriculum benchmarked internationally. And we do not want students, or indeed teachers, to be disadvantaged as they move between states.I am asked about any alternative policies or views. Labor do have some policies on education, and every single one has been a failure. Here is the totality. Members will remember the ALP education policy of the century. Remember Knowledge Nation? Remember that that was the policy to beat all policies that was instantly dismissed as a joke. 'Noodle nation' was then shot down in flames - not only by their own side but across the board. I do recall that the member for Brand took the fall for the discredited 'noodle nation' policy. They made the member for Brand take the fall for that. Members will be interested to know who the other authors of 'noodle nation' were. Hands up! The other authors of 'noodle nation' -  - Members would be interested to know that, while the member for Brand took the fall on 'noodle nation', there were two other authors of 'noodle nation' that have not yet revealed themselves - none other than the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Perth. Take a bow, Member for Griffith and Member for Perth, for 'noodle nation'.Then we had the third education policy. This was Mark Latham's 'schools hit list'. Members will recall that the Labor Party wanted to rip the heart out of Catholic and independent schools. Their crime? They were private schools. This was discredited because of the ugly politics of envy - the 'schools hit list' of Mark Latham. The member for Fowler then left the chamber.  - So we have Mark Latham's discredited 'schools hit list' policy. But this year where does Labor get its policy inspiration from? None other -  The member for Calwell then left the chamber. 
 - So after Mark Latham's discredited 'schools hit list' policy, what do Labor come up with this year? They are now taking their policy inspiration from Mark 'Education Revolution' Latham. Another one hits the dust.Then we have the maths and science policy of Labor that has been proven not to work. Cutting HECS has been proven not to work. We have the architect of HECS, Bruce Chapman, coming out and saying it will not work. This is the architect employed by Labor to introduce the HECS system. He says Labor's policy to cut HECS in maths and science will not work. And the unkindest cut of all: the Queensland Teachers Union says Labor's policy will not work. So even their own side says it will not work. That was, until yesterday, the totality of Labor's education policies. By yesterday they had run out of ideas so they started pinching somebody else's homework. Labor on education gets an 'F' for 'Fail'.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Bonner for his question. Right around Australia the Howard government is promoting the innovative reuse and recycling of water. A particular focus is managed aquifer recharge, where stormwater or treated waste water can be returned to an aquifer for later extraction and use. The government has supported a number of innovative projects of this kind in several states. Last week, together with the Western Australian government, I announced the latest of these schemes: a $30 million managed aquifer recharge project at Beenyup in the electorate of Moore. When fully developed, the project could supply up to 10 per cent of Perth's water supply.The Labor Party's commitment to recycling is somewhat different. In a speech earlier this week, the shadow minister for water recycled the coalition's entire water policy on markets, water trading and pricing. In that very speech the shadow minister confirmed the Labor Party's commitment to the Beenyup project that we had announced only four days before. The opposition leader goes beyond recycling. He has, as we know, very good sources of information in the Western Australian Labor Party and he learned of the pending Beenyup announcement from someone in the Western Australian government two days before the due date. So he promptly 'precycled' the same announcement, and of course the shadow water minister recycled it four days after that.I invite the opposition to end its trick cycling and abandon this effort in recycling and 'precycling'. I call on the opposition to stop the games, to stop running around the country front-running government announcements and just, unequivocally, commit to the leadership the government have shown and to the policies they and the Australian people know are right. I am talking about the $10 billion national plan for water security. This plan includes the assumption of Commonwealth control over the Murray-Darling Basin, which the member for Kingsford Smith said in this House a few weeks ago had always been Labor Party policy. We are still waiting for the policy document.I call on the opposition to commit to the water plan, to commit to the $2 billion Australian government water fund, to commit to the $2 billion climate change strategy, and to commit to the $3 billion Natural Heritage Trust and the $1.5 billion Low Emissions Technology Demonstration Fund. Above all, I call on the opposition to allow the national interest rather than ideology to guide their energy policy and to keep all the low-emission options on the table so that we can make the right decisions to ensure that our energy policies are consistent with a low emissions future. If common sense and practical measures guide us in our considerations then nuclear power will be on the table, not struck off for ideological reasons.</DOC>

 - Speaking for myself, I can certainly rule them out. I am not aware that any members of my government have been involved in any commercial dealings. I will find out pretty quickly after question time. If that is wrong, I will find out very quickly. I want to thank the member for Grayndler. He has rendered meritorious service to the Liberal Party. I think he should get one of those long service awards. They were actually suggested by Ron Walker when he was the Federal Treasurer of the Liberal Party.Let us come back to what this is all about. This is, amongst other things, an attempt by the Australian Labor Party to draw an equivalence between the Exclusive Brethren collectively and somebody who is a convicted felon and who is under a ban so far as contact between him and members of the Western Australian Labor Party is concerned. He is also somebody who, according to reports in the newspaper this morning, has been involved in an arrangement whereby the manipulation and the distortion of a parliamentary inquiry led to a company having to fork out $20 million in order to effect a court settlement. We are dealing here with serious corruption in Western Australia. This is an attempt by the Leader of the Opposition, and I say it is an attempt by the Leader of the Opposition because he has been talking to the member for Grayndler the whole time -  - There have been six questions asked of me by the member for Grayndler. The Leader of the Opposition has had his back turned the whole time. I do not know why he did not have the courage to get up and ask those questions of me. I mean, he is a man of great principles. The Treasurer and I have been prepared to confront him with his obligation to come clean to the Australian people about his consorting with Brian Burke in 2005, but he gets the member for Grayndler to ask a whole lot of questions. I am very happy to go on answering them because they do not really amount to a row of beans. - The simple obligation that comes out of question time is for the Leader of the Opposition to do what he demanded of me. He demanded of me that I give chapter and verse of a perfectly legitimate telephone conversation conducted in the course of my duties as Prime Minister of Australia with a reputable businessman - a person who has given service to this nation as well as being successful in business - who was going into partnership in a business venture with a member of the board of the Reserve Bank of Australia, one of Australia's most esteemed mining executives, Hugh Morgan, and Robert Champion de Crespigny, who has not only been successful in the mining industry but also been regarded as good enough by the Labor Party to have a seat at the cabinet table. That is how Mike Rann, the Labor Premier of South Australia, has described it.It is part of my job to talk to people like this, but it is not part of the job - unless you are scrounging for votes - of a Labor Party federal backbencher to be going to the sorts of gatherings enumerated by the Treasurer with somebody who is a convicted felon, who is under a ban by Dr Gallop and who - according to what has come out of the CCC inquiry - was involved in what can only be called a swindle of the Xstrata company that involved that company having to pay some $20 million. I can only brand as pathetic the attempt by the member for Grayndler to say, 'All of that is no worse than being a member of the Exclusive Brethren.' That is pathetic, and I think the House has observed that all of these questions were asked by the member for Grayndler - none were asked of me by the Leader of the Opposition.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and note the serious support that he provides to the government in securing the future, particularly of young Australians who have low incomes and are supported by this government's co-contribution scheme.I note that every time you come to this dispatch box you look at the view, and it all remains the same right across as you look out - the same old faces, the same old union hacks who have no idea what we are talking about when we talk about support through the co-contribution scheme for small business and low-income people. They are the same puppets run by the unions and of course run by Mr Burke, as we know. When you look out, you think it is no wonder that this is a party which is bad for the Australian economy. It is a party which drives the economy into the ground because it is dictated to by the union movement in this country. That is why the Australian people recognise that the changes this government has made and the support that we provide through the co-contribution scheme to lower income people in particular will set up the next generation in this country for continued economic prosperity.I am pleased to announce today that this government has provided support to almost 800,000 payments, worth more than $631 million, to Australian workers during the period 1 October last year to 31 December. That is a $1.50 contribution by the Howard government for each $1 put aside into superannuation by low-income workers earning less than $28,000. The message today is for Australians, particularly young Australians or people on low incomes across any age bracket, to think about putting money into superannuation. This government will provide 150 per cent return up front. And when people get that money into their superannuation funds, they should be reminded that the Labor Party opposed this policy at the last election at the behest of the union movement. What that demonstrates is that the Labor Party is still dominated by the union movement and it is bad for the Australian economy.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. I can confirm that there has been in the last year an upsurge in violence in Iraq - I think we are all aware of that. That upsurge was triggered by the bombing of a mosque which was particularly sacred to the Shiah section of the population. That unlocked a chain of reprisal attacks and, as a result, there has been an increase. I will not go into the precise figures, but I do not dispute that there has been an increase over the last year.The Leader of the Opposition gives me the opportunity with his question on Iraq to simply report to the House the impressions I gained on a visit to both Tallil and Baghdad in the last few days. When in Baghdad I had the opportunity of a lengthy discussion with the new American commander, General David Petraeus, a different style of person from his predecessors - a very thoughtful man, a former economics professor as well as a very distinguished soldier. It was very clear from my discussion with him that in implementing the new plan to bring greater security to the Baghdad area the coalition forces in Baghdad - that really means the Americans and the Iraqis - were going to combine military strength with a more determined effort to relate to and win the confidence of the local population.I do not want to read too much into just a few weeks - and what I am about to say is tinged with the utmost caution - but the early indications are promising. The early indications are that there has been some decline in sectarian violence. The early indications are that a determined effort is being made by the Iraqi brigades. He indicated to me that the brigades that have been brought in from other parts of the country were in some cases up to almost 100 per cent strength, which is unusual given the experience in recent times. General Petraeus, as did the Iraqi Prime Minister, indicated to me that there was no shortage of recruits for either the new Iraqi army or for the police. So the impression I took from General Petraeus was that, whilst he was not making any extravagant claims, some of the early indications - ever so cautious, let me stress - were on the optimistic and the hopeful side.I came away from my meeting with the Iraqi Prime Minister impressed that I had spoken to a person who, although deeply devoted to the Shiah population of Iraq, saw his responsibilities as being truly those of a national leader. He was a more impressive man on meeting than I had perceived from reading newspapers, reading intelligence reports or watching him on television. He struck me as a man of authority, a man of some considerable courage, a person who was deeply grateful for the commitment of countries like Australia to Iraq's future, a person who felt that there was a prospect that at long last, after a great deal of suffering and very considerable loss of life, the situation could be established where in time the Iraqis will be able to look after themselves.So I say to the Leader of the Opposition that I came away from my meetings with both of those gentlemen more optimistic about the situation in Iraq. I commend that sense of marginally more optimism to the opposition and to the government's critics on this issue. I will say two other things. Nobody can visit Australian forces in places like Iraq or Afghanistan without coming away with enormous regard for their professionalism, their sense of decency, their capacity to relate to the local population and the sheer enthusiasm they have for the job at hand. And I say that in a non-political sense, because they do what they are asked to do by the government in the name of the country, irrespective of which government is in office. No matter what your politics may be on this issue, when you go overseas and visit these men and women, you should be incredibly proud of the job that they are doing on behalf of the country. Colonel Rawlins, the commander of the Australian forces in Tallil, told me of the great strides they had made, the confidence of the locals that had been won, the feeling that they were doing an effective job in training the local Iraqis. Overall, I came away from that country feeling more optimistic than I had felt before I went there. So I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question.I simply conclude my remarks by saying that there remains in my mind a wonderment at the disconnect in the minds of those who attack the government on this issue between the fate of terrorism in Afghanistan and the fate of terrorism in Iraq. It is a common cause on both sides of the House that we should defeat terrorism in Afghanistan but, apparently, whilst it is good to defeat terrorism in Afghanistan, it is not good to defeat it in Iraq. I find that a puzzling disconnect.Finally, I saw some very interesting remarks made by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. She said that the thing about Afghanistan is that only a military operation is needed there. Can I remind her that that would seem passing strange to people, including Australians, involved in reconstruction efforts in Afghanistan. The truth of the matter is that in both countries you need a combination of the two.I do not for a moment argue that only a military solution is needed in Iraq. In fact the last thing I said to the Iraqi Prime Minister when I saw him in Baghdad was that he had a very solemn responsibility to make sure that he was a national leader and to make sure that he brought a sense of political reconciliation to Iraq. So, through you, Mr Speaker, I say to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that she does not really understand what is happening in Afghanistan if she says that it is only a military operation. You need military success and political success in Afghanistan; you need military success and political success in Iraq. You need to defeat the terrorists in Iraq as well as defeating them in Afghanistan.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Wakefield. As somebody who for 40 years both in the Liberal Party organisation before I entered parliament and in the parliament as a member, as a Treasurer, as an opposition leader, as a spokesman on various matters and for the last 11 years as Prime Minister, as somebody who has been for all of those years a true believer in choice in education, not a latter-day believer, not a political believer but a true believer in choice in education, I say to the member for Wakefield that the choice available for Australian parents is strong and real under this government.I say that as a great admirer of the government education system and as a proud product of the government education system of New South Wales. I will always be grateful for the education I received in the government system in New South Wales in the 1940s and 1950s; nonetheless, I am great believer in choice. I can inform the member that almost one-third of all students in Australia are now attending non-government schools. That represents a 21.5 per cent growth in non-government school enrolments since 1996 and that compares to a one per cent growth in government school enrolments in the same period.As I think honourable members know, much of the growth in the non-government school sector has occurred in what you might loosely call the low- or medium-fee independent sector rather than in the Catholic systemic sector or in the more traditional GPS sector, where, although there has been some growth, the growth has not been great. I notice that the Leader of the Opposition has said that his party has abandoned the hit list policies of both the Beazley and Latham periods of Labor leadership. I think it is worth recalling for the House that the growth in the small independent school sector has largely resulted from the decision taken by this government in 1997, pursuant to a promise made in the 1996 election campaign, to abolish what was unusually and inappropriately described as Labor's 'new schools policy'. Although it is 11 years ago it is worth recalling that, under that policy, broadly speaking you could not establish a new independent school in an area already serviced by a government school or a Catholic school. Effectively, that meant you would not get the funding, and that particularly restricted the efforts of people in the outer metropolitan areas of the larger cities to establish new non-government schools.We promised to change that, and we did. But we only got the change through as a result of the support we received from Senator Brian Harradine, and 10 years after the event I record my continuing gratitude to Senator Harradine for supporting us. When the parents of children at independent schools in the category I am referring to hear what the Leader of the Opposition says about his new policy, I think they should be reminded that Senator Carr, who is now the shadow minister for industry but who was then the spokesman on education, said during a debate on an amendment to reinsert the old restrictive approach of the previous policy:We believe that, on the issue of choice, private schooling is an addition, not an alternative, in terms of providing reasonable access to quality government schooling.It is also interesting to note that, on 4 September, during the debate on the bill to introduce the SES funding formula, the now Leader of the Opposition criticised the amount of funding that would go to category 1 schools under the new funding formula. This is what the Leader of the Opposition had to say when he was speaking in that debate:... the proposal put forward by the shadow minister for education, Michael Lee, to instead dedicate this funding to special needs education is in fact a wise way to go.He went on to describe funding to category 1 schools as a 'windfall allocation to schools that do not need this money at the end of the day'. In other words, this newfound believer in freedom of choice does not really believe that category 1 schools should get any funding at all, that it is a windfall to those schools. So my advice to parents who want to exercise freedom of choice when they hear the Leader of the Opposition is that he is a Johnny-come-lately on this subject. He has never believed in it, whereas he is opposed by somebody who has been a true believer in choice in education all of my active political life.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Kingston for his question. Since the House last sat, the national accounts for the December quarter have been released. They show that GDP grew one per cent in the December quarter and that growth through the year was 2.8 per cent higher than a year ago. This comes at a time when the rural sector of Australia is in a very deep drought. In fact, rural production has fallen 22.8 per cent over the last year, an extraordinary fall, as a consequence of drought. The fact that the Australian economy continued to grow at all is testament to the strength in other sectors, particularly in relation to consumption, business investment and indeed exports, which, apart from rural exports, also grew during the course of the year.In addition to that, we have seen recently the labour force figures released for February. The good news with the labour force figures is that the number of people in work in the month of February increased by 22,000. Twenty-two thousand new jobs were created in the month of February. Over the course of the last year in Australia there has been a net addition of 294,000 jobs. Think about that. In the last year there were 365 days and 294,000 jobs - that is nearly 1,000 jobs a day created in the Australian economy over the last year. Of course, nearly all of that was during the period of Work Choices. So whatever the opposition claimed about Work Choices destroying jobs, the reality is that we have seen during the last 12 months extraordinary employment growth in this country.The opposition leader says that this is 'Brutopia', that there is something wrong with this economy. Can I remind him that, when his party was in power, unemployment stood at about 11 per cent and unemployment is now at 4.6 per cent. Unemployment has been below six per cent for 43 consecutive months in Australia. I can inform the House that, for the first time since the government was elected in 1996, there have been two million new jobs created in the Australian economy. This is a government which has now presided over two million new jobs in the Australian economy, which is job creation unparalleled in recent Australian history.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Gwydir for his question and recognise his commitment to the working families whose livelihood is drawn from the coalmining industry in his electorate and to an industry that is growing in his electorate. Coal exports last year were worth $25 billion to the Australian economy. It is an incredibly important industry in Australia, particularly for those jobs generated from those exports - jobs that have made a contribution to the figure the Treasurer quoted of two million new jobs in the Australian economy over the last 11 years. A lot of those jobs are coming out of the coalmining and associated industries. Our government has continued to support the coal industry in Australia. We have invested in infrastructure to ensure it remains efficient and competitive with the rest of the world.We also need to address the issue of climate change and greenhouse gas emissions. We have been doing that through investing in the development of new clean coal technology to help the coal industry maintain a sustainable base for coal, both within Australia as an energy generation product and also internationally as an export product for the Australian economy. We have allocated $410 million towards low-emissions technology to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Four of the six projects already announced relate to clean coal technology. I know the member for Gwydir would support those projects to ensure that the coal industry in his electorate maintains a sustainable base.The practical measures that we have introduced will see Australian emissions reduced by 87 million tonnes by 2010. So investment in clean coal technology can see actual reductions in our emissions of carbon of 87 million tonnes. That is the equivalent of all the emissions from the transport sector in our economy.The member for Gwydir asked if there were any threats to the livelihoods of those families, and there are some. They have been made very clear by the Australian Greens. We need only to look at the Shift Miner magazine, which has a quote from Senator Brown. He said:I am talking about having a plan, within one term of government, for the phasing-out of coal.He wants to phase out the coal industry altogether and do away with thousands of jobs in many electorates across Australia. We have seen quotes in the same magazine from the member for Kingsford Smith. He said: 'Automatic expansion of the coal industry such as we have seen in the Hunter Valley over the past decade is a thing of the past.' I know the member for Hunter is concerned about those quotes.So there are some threats, but the threats are getting even closer. In recent days we have seen a preference deal done between the Australian Labor Party and the Greens in New South Wales. - The member for Grayndler would know all about this one. - In a press release put out by the Greens, upper house candidate in New South Wales Lee Rhiannon is quoted as saying:We have also agreed with Labor to establish a preferencing framework for the federal election in New South Wales _I think the Leader of the Opposition needs to tell the voters not only in New South Wales but across Australia what deal he has done with the Greens in New South Wales and across Australia for the federal election later this year. Is it about closing down the coalmining industry in Australia? Is it about costing thousands of Australian coalminers their jobs? We need to hear from the Leader of the Opposition what deal he has done with the Greens in which they want to, as Bob Brown has said, close down or phase out the coal industry within one term of government.They cannot walk away from this, because we all remember the preference deal the Australian Labor Party did with the Greens at the last election, which only surfaced in the last week of the campaign. If the then leader, the former member for Werriwa, was going to trash thousands of jobs in the timber industry, and that came to the surface as a result of the preference deal he had done with the Greens, what will be the cost to coalmining jobs across Australia, and particularly in New South Wales, as a result of the preference deal with the Greens done by the Leader of the Opposition? - We give them to the Liberal Party.</DOC>

 - I am aware that my office, through the person of my then principal private secretary and my now chief of staff, had a discussion with his opposite number in Senator Santoro's office regarding the categorisation of some investments which had been referred to. I know exactly what the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is referring to, and she knows I know why she is referring to it. She knows exactly why and I have to assure her: forget the conspiracy; it was a very legitimate discussion about the categorisation.While I am on my feet, can I say this: Senator Santo Santoro is no longer a minister for a very simple reason. He is no longer a minister because he failed to disclose, as he was required to do, to the Senate and also to me the share investments that he made and other investments which were first brought to my attention a few days ago. That is the reason why he is out.Can I take the opportunity of saying again that it is the responsibility of all of you, on all sides, to comply with the resolutions of the House. Everybody has an obligation - all members and senators have an obligation of complying with the resolutions of the two houses of parliament. Senator Santoro did not do that. That is the reason why he is no longer a member of the ministry.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Mitchell for his question. I can tell him that in the five years from 2001 to 2005-06 - really, six full years - the GST which has been paid to the states has totalled $187.2 billion, including a windfall of $4.7 billion. Everybody in Australia knows that the GST was introduced to replace other taxes. Many of those other taxes have been abolished, like the bank account debits tax, the financial institutions duty and stamp duties on shares. But now that the states are all in a windfall position, the Commonwealth requires the state governments to make good on the original deal and to abolish all of those taxes which have been slated for abolition as part of the intergovernmental agreement. That includes stamp duties on business conveyances and real property. The states have not yet agreed to a timetable in respect of that, even though the states will be getting a windfall in the next financial year of $3.3 billion; in the year after, $4.5 billion; and in the year after that, $4.9 billion.I notice that Mr Iemma, the Premier of New South Wales, says that if only he can be given more GST he can observe the agreement in relation to the IGA. Let me point out that Mr Iemma and New South Wales are being given more GST year after year. This year they will be getting $10.9 billion; next year, $11.9 billion; the year after, $12.9 billion; and the year after that, $14 billion. And bear in mind that the New South Wales Labor government opposed the introduction of the GST, as did federal Labor, and now demand more and more of it. We say very simply that if the states want to take 100 per cent of the GST then the states can abolish 100 per cent of the taxes that it was introduced to get rid of. We in the federal government will maintain on behalf of the Australian people their entitlement to have those taxes abolished.Who in this parliament do you think, Mr Speaker, would stand up for the state governments and try and justify the fact that they are not abolishing these taxes as agreed? None other than the state Labor patsies, the federal Labor Party, led by former Queensland public servant the Leader of the Opposition and his offsider, the member for Lilley. He comes into this place and he has every excuse under the sun for the state premiers because he will not stand up for the Australian people. Let me remind the House this government introduced the GST to get rid of other taxes. We will stand by the Australian people and we will demand that the Labor Party make good on that deal.</DOC>

 - I have already indicated, in answer to the earlier question, there was a contact between Mr Nutt and his opposite number in the senator's office and the categorisation was the subject of the contact. The reason why the discussion took place was that if you looked at the register then, manifestly, because of the small number of share investments recorded, there could not have been trading. That is why the categorisation was discussed. I know what the deputy is trying to get at -  - Hang on. I know exactly how the deputy found this out and I know why she is asking this question. The answer is that there was contact. Mr Nutt pointed out that, on the face of it, those shares held did not amount to trading and that was an incorrect categorisation. I indicated that in the previous answer. What the deputy leader is getting at is the suggestion that in December of last year Mr Nutt knew of the disclosures that were made a few days ago. He did not, and any suggestion of that is absolutely wrong.</DOC>

 - First, I would like to thank the honourable member for Pearce for her question and her interest; I know the honourable member is very focused on the problems of Zimbabwe. The government has been appalled at the barbaric actions of the Zimbabwe government in violently suppressing the activities of the political opposition, the Movement for Democratic Change, and some of their supporters. I have made my views very clear to the Zimbabwean charge d'affaires here in Canberra. My department also called in the charge d'affaires on 16 March, the day after I spoke to him, and made the government's views clear again.The Mugabe government, before this latest vicious and violent crackdown on their political opponents, had already been pursuing policies which have been disastrous for the people of Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe has the highest inflation rate in the world at 1,800 per cent, unemployment is at 80 per cent and life expectancy in Zimbabwe under President Mugabe has fallen from 61 in 1990 to 33 today. I think that statistic alone is the most shocking indictment of the Zimbabwean government and the President of Zimbabwe, Mr Mugabe.Australia has imposed progressively strengthened travel bans and financial sanctions against members of the Zimbabwean government since 2002. A number of other countries have also done that, but we would like more countries to impose those types of so-called smart or targeted sanctions against Zimbabwe. The more countries that do that, the more effective the international community is going to be in addressing the problems of Zimbabwe.Let me also say that the countries that have the greatest leverage in Zimbabwe are not Commonwealth countries, because Zimbabwe is not a member of the Commonwealth anymore. The countries that have the greatest leverage are the neighbouring countries, members of what is called SADC, the Southern African Development Community. Of course, South Africa is often talked about in this context. I spoke with the South African high commissioner this morning about the situation in Zimbabwe. I said to him we hope very much that South Africa, bilaterally and through SADC, would be able to do still more than they are already doing to place pressure on the Zimbabwean regime to adhere to international norms of human rights and start to restructure the economy. I think SADC is at least persuaded that the situation is dire, and I know from various contacts we have had with those countries that there is a growing mood in SADC and also the African Union to do more to address the problem of Zimbabwe.We have also been pressing, within the United Nations system, for the United Nations Human Rights Council to pass a resolution putting still more pressure on the Zimbabwean government. Whether it is possible to get the United Nations to do something about this, though, is questionable, bearing in mind there are some countries in the United Nations which have been fairly solid and reliable supporters of President Mugabe.Finally, I know that a number of members of the House are concerned about specific people who have been affected by this violent crackdown on the opposition. People in this House are concerned about Mrs Sekai Holland, who is married to an Australian and lived in Australia for quite some time. A number of members of the House, including me, have met her over the years. Morgan Tsvangirai, the leader of the Movement for Democratic Change, is another person many will have met and will know of. Both of them have been in hospital. Our ambassador in Zimbabwe has visited them in hospital and he has been particularly solicitous in relation to Mrs Holland. We are providing maximum assistance for Sekai Holland and we urge the Zimbabwean government to permit those who are injured to obtain the necessary medical treatment. The Zimbabwean government will not let these people out of the country to get additional medical treatment, in particular Mrs Holland, because the government want to maintain political pressure on these people. They need medical help and they need to get out of Zimbabwe for that medical help, and the Zimbabwean government should let them go and obtain that medical assistance.We will continue to do what we can, given the limited capacity we have to do so, to place pressure on Zimbabwe. We cannot impose economic sanctions on the country: it is bankrupt already. If we as an international community imposed complete economic sanctions on Zimbabwe, it would be a death sentence for millions of ordinary Zimbabweans. We cannot do that. But, Mr Speaker, we do need to keep the diplomatic pressure going, and the Australian government, you can rest assured, will do that.</DOC>

 - My advice from the relevant person in my office is that the pecuniary interest return to me and also what was on the Senate register did not, on the face of it, indicate that there had been any share trading and therefore it was an incorrect categorisation.

 - I thank the member for Lindsay for her question. I note that the New South Wales government has only been able to open a GP after-hours clinic at Nepean Hospital because of the strong support of the federal government, including financial assistance that was obtained because of lobbying by, amongst other people, the member for Lindsay. Under the current Australian health care agreements, the Howard government will provide some $14 billion towards the funding of public hospitals in New South Wales, and that is a 16 per cent real increase over the previous agreement. As well, between 2006 and 2008, thanks to the GST, New South Wales will enjoy a revenue windfall of almost $2 billion.Despite all this federal assistance, New South Wales public hospitals are still underperforming for one fundamental reason - namely, a lack of investment by the New South Wales government. In each of the five years to 2002, the Carr-Iemma government provided less money to public hospitals than in 1997. In 1997 the Carr-Iemma government provided $2.66 billion. It was less than that in each of the next five years and it was just $2.59 billion in 2002. And over the last few months the New South Wales government claims to have taken thousands of people off elective surgery waiting lists, not by doing more surgery but by extending the admission timetables from six months to 12 months in an absolutely shameless bit of pre-election fiddling.But New South Wales is not the only state Labor government to run hospitals poorly. I am quoting now from a newspaper report which said that senior doctors at three of Queensland's biggest public hospitals warned that 'patients would continue to die while the government ignored pleas to solve the state's health crisis'. That comes from the front page of the Courier-Mail in November 1994, when the Leader of the Opposition had already been the de facto Premier for five years. He can turn around but he cannot run from the hard questions about his own record. Why was it that public hospital funding per head was the lowest in Australia under the Rudd Christian socialist government of Queensland? Why was it that, under the gentleman opposite, 2,200 public hospital beds were closed? He has perfect recall of the events of 35 years ago, but challenge him on his own political record and all we get is bluster and changing the subject. Today he might have had Madam Muck asking the questions, but Mr Clean wrote them, and what we have had from members opposite for the last three or four questions is nothing but 'Rudd mud', authored, written and authorised by none other than the Leader of the Opposition. There is a clear message here. - I simply make the point that, whether it is state Labor or federal Labor, when it comes to health you just cannot trust the Labor Party. I think that the Australian public are going to get a clear message in the run-up to the next election: don't let the Leader of the Opposition wreck Medicare the way he wrecked the Queensland public hospital system.</DOC>

 - In answer to the member for Barton, I do recall using that expression. I used that expression in the context of the very early military operations in Iraq, when it did not appear at that time that the coalition would require forces to be in Iraq for the long period of time that has now elapsed. I will check the precise context, but my best recall is that I was asked this question at the end of the initial military phase and it was asked in relation to the forces including, I think, the FA18s and also the Special Forces that have been used in the initial military operation. My recall is that I spoke then of them being there for weeks and months rather than a longer period of time. I think that if the member for Barton, who normally has more regard for accuracy in these matters than some of his colleagues do, would go back and have a look at that context he would fairly conclude that the context for the question that I think I was asked was: when are the boys coming home from the initial phase? I said that I expected it to be weeks and not months. I think you will find that that is the context.There is another point that is really relevant to the debate. The group of Australian forces that the opposition now says they would bring home, and the only ones that they say they would bring home, is in fact a battle group which is in southern Iraq. That is the only group that they are saying will come home. That battle group was not in Iraq when the question I answered in relation to weeks and months was asked. So, by your own definition, you should not be asking the question.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for McMillan for his question and also for his very strong support for the coal industry in Victoria. The minister for agriculture is also a strong supporter of the coal industry in Victoria and in fact the whole of Australia. Both of them have a number of workers and thousands of families, I would think, who rely on the coal industry for their income.Around Australia we see around 30,000 Australian families relying on the coal industry. That is why this government, the Howard government, is making a long-term investment to ensure that coal remains a competitive power source both now and in a low carbon emission future. Last week the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources and I jointly announced a $100 million grant to support HRL's $750 million project for clean coal in the Latrobe Valley. The project will deliver coal-fired power with 30 per cent less emissions and use half the water of a conventional brown coal power plant. It is the fourth coal project supported under the government's Low Emission Technology Demonstration Fund and brings the total investment by this government in lower emissions coal to $275 million in projects approaching $1 billion.I notice that the Leader of the Opposition is not listening. Perhaps the member for Kingsford Smith can listen, because he and the Leader of the Opposition were both up in Queensland looking for friends in the coal industry last week. While they were there looking for those friends - I am not sure they found any - they should have taken the time to remind Peter Beattie that the Howard government has already put $125 million into coal projects in Queensland to lower emissions in those areas. That has not been acknowledged by the Premier. In fact, he must have had a lapse of memory, because he said that the federal government was putting nothing into the coal industry in Queensland. I know that Peter Beattie does not lie, so he must have just had a lapse of memory, because those projects are worth over $600 million. His Treasurer and his Minister for Mines and Energy are both shareholding ministers in those projects.I was asked by the member for McMillan about the alternative policies of those opposite. Of course, we know the policy of the member for Kingsford Smith on the coal industry. He was quoted the other day - and I am sure he said this. He told us that the automatic expansion of the coal industry is a thing of the past. This is the Leader of the Opposition's spokesman, who one day aspires to have control of the coal industry in Australia. If I were a coalminer in Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia or any other state that has coal for power then I would be worried about my future as a coalminer under any Labor government.</DOC>

 - I am aware of the issue the member for New England raises. From what I have seen in the media, the New South Wales government today committed about $4 million for this project whereas the opposition in New South Wales has committed $14 million or $15 million to the upgrade of the Chaffey Dam. As this dam sits on the upper reaches of the Murray-Darling Basin system, the best way that the water can be found to put into the dam after it is upgraded is through the efficiency savings of the New South Wales, Victorian, South Australian and Queensland governments supporting our $10 billion water plan. We are going to invest $6 billion in efficiency savings throughout the network as well as $3 billion to address the issue of overallocation. It is important that the states shoulder their responsibilities in these areas.I know the member for New England takes a great deal of interest in these things, but he really should stop being an apologist for the New South Wales Labor government. Urban water responsibilities belong to the states. Chaffey Dam supplies urban water to Tamworth, as he knows. The Labor government in New South Wales has committed only $4 million to this project; the opposition parties in New South Wales have committed all the money for this project.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Cowper for his question and note his great interest in schools policy in his electorate. The parents of Australian schoolchildren expect not only choice in schooling, as the Prime Minister indicated, but also higher standards in terms of teaching, learning and the physical environment - the infrastructure in our schools. The Howard government agrees that there should be higher standards in our schools. That is why at the 2004 election we committed to investing $1 billion in schools across Australia so that schools could apply directly to the federal government for infrastructure projects.The Howard government is now exceeding that election commitment. On top of the $1 billion to invest in our schools we have added an additional $181 million, targeted to the more needy schools. We have exceeded our election commitment under the Investing in Our Schools program. What this program has highlighted is the chronic neglect of state government schools by state governments. Basic infrastructure needs such as shade cloth, toilet blocks and air conditioning are being funded by the federal government because the state governments have failed to fund their schools properly.I am asked about alternative policies. Yesterday we witnessed the spectacle of the Leader of the Opposition running away as fast as he could from the Mark Latham hit list policy. That had been Labor policy for as long as I can remember. The Labor Party is committed to taking funding away from some Catholic and independent schools. While the Leader of the Opposition said he was running away from that policy, not once did he guarantee to fund non-government schools at the same rate of increase as they receive under the Howard government.In other words, when the Leader of the Opposition says, 'No school will be worse off,' that is code for 'School funding will be frozen.' That is Labor Party code. So on the one hand the Leader of the Opposition is running away from Mark Latham's hit list policy while on the other hand he skulks out later in the day with a new policy. He says it is a brand-new policy - $62 million for schools to share resources. Some might be gullible enough to believe that it was a new policy, but if we go back to the old hit list policy, we find it on page 12 - $62 million to share educational resources. This is Mark Latham's failed 2004 policy.What Labor is doing is finding old and failed policies, trotting them out with a brand-new cover and rebadging them as new policy. The Australian public are awake to this. Recycling old and failed policies is not policy development. Cutting and pasting Mark Latham's old policies is not providing the kind of policy development leadership that we would expect even from the Labor Party. This is doing nothing to raise standards in our schools.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hunter for that question. The answer is that we are examining at present the adequacy of the conditions in which our forces are currently operating. The defence minister has indicated that a group of defence people went to Afghanistan recently. I have said, and he has said, that we are looking at whether we might send some additional forces to provide additional support for the reconstruction group that is in Afghanistan. I had a discussion about this matter with the new ISAF commander, an American, General McNeill. I indicated that, if Australia were to send additional forces to Afghanistan, the principal task of those additional forces would be to provide additional protection to the existing Australian force.The best way I can summarise it is to say that the defence department and the ADF, in light of the report and the analysis that has been brought back, are currently examining whether we should send some more forces. If those forces do go to Afghanistan, they will have as their principal task providing additional protection to the Australian forces that are already there. That is the most up-to-date and full information that I can provide to the honourable member. I would be very happy to continue to assist him in providing such information.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Cook for his question. I read with great interest his article in the Daily Telegraph today. - It was a very good and compelling argument in support of the government's workplace relations reforms. I was convinced, having read that article. The Australian people are convinced as well. Sometimes when you are in government, if you want to keep the economy strong, you have to make some tough decisions. This government has not been afraid to make tough decisions to keep Australia competitive. In order to guarantee not just the jobs of today but the jobs of tomorrow, you sometimes have to make tough decisions such as getting the budget into surplus, which the Labor Party opposed; introducing taxation reform, which the Labor Party opposed; paying off government debt, which the Labor Party opposed; reform of the waterfront, which the Labor Party opposed; Welfare to Work, which the Labor Party also opposed; and, of course, industrial relations and workplace relations change, which the Labor Party opposed.After nearly 12 months, we are starting to see some figures that indicate that our reforms are delivering real benefits. Only last week, it became clear that since the reforms started 263,000 new jobs have been created in Australia. Interestingly, nearly 90 per cent of those jobs are full-time jobs. I well remember the former Leader of the Opposition, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and a range of union leaders predicting Armageddon. They said the world would end with these laws; there would be mass sackings; children would go to school without shoes; and a range of other things. Wages are up by 1.5 per cent since the introduction of our laws.I was asked whether there are any proposals that could jeopardise this contribution. I noted on the Sunday program the Deputy Leader of the Opposition saying that the Labor Party would avoid the flow-on impact of high wages in the mining industry by supporting collective agreements. I thought to myself, 'That's at odds with the Labor Party draft policy that says they want to introduce pattern bargaining.' On one hand, on one side of the street, the Labor Party want to introduce pattern bargaining. They released their draft policy on a Friday night. - That's an old trick, Julia. On a Friday night, they released their draft industrial relations policy, which, amongst many other things, stated that the Labor Party wanted to see a reintroduction of pattern bargaining. Then, to another audience, on the Sunday program, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition said, 'But we'll stop the flow-on impact of wage increases in the mining industry going to others.'I am intrigued by this. If you have a mechanic employed by the mine, under the Labor Party's policy how would you prevent other mechanics in Sydney or Melbourne from being caught up in the same wage net? That is what the Labor Party want to do. They want to endanger people's jobs. They are going to introduce policies that put upward pressure on inflation. Of course, that puts upward pressure on interest rates.It is again a case of the Labor Party trying to walk both sides of the street. On the one hand, they are giving one message to the union movement, saying, 'Don't worry, comrades, all will be okay - you'll be marching into every workplace,' on the dark day that the Leader of the Opposition ever gets elected. On the other hand, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is trying to tell the business community and Australians that the economy will remain strong under Labor. We have caught them out again. The Labor Party's industrial relations policy is bad for the economy and bad for Australian jobs.</DOC>

 - The Howard government has a number of programs in place that encourage schools to share resources. The Boys' Education Lighthouse Schools project, the school chaplaincy project and the Investing in Our Schools project are all programs that are designed to ensure that schools can share resources in appropriate circumstances.One of the proudest boasts of the Howard government in education policy is that we have increased funding to schools across Australia by 160 per cent since we have been in government and there has been a 118 per cent increase to government schools. So the Australian government is committed to ensuring that, wherever students go to school in this country, they have access to a high-quality education. That is highlighted by the Australian government's commitment to increased funding. What do we get from the Labor Party? No guarantee that they will not freeze the funds to Catholic and independent schools. Until such time as the Leader of the Opposition stands up and gives that guarantee, Labor have no credibility on schools policies.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Greenway for her question. Australia is boxing well above its weight in the battle against climate change. Australia, unlike most of the developed countries that have ratified the Kyoto protocol, is on track to meet its Kyoto target. That is the factual measure of the government's achievement and the test of its policies.There are only 15 countries in the world today that are likely to come in below their Kyoto targets. Twelve of them are countries of the former Soviet Union. The benchmark was 1990. Their economies completely collapsed, and it is because of that that their emissions will be below their 1990 level. Crashing the economy is well within the capacity of the opposition, but it is not a method of reaching your Kyoto target that anyone would recommend.There are another three countries that fit into that category. One is the United Kingdom, which will come in below its target because it shut down its coal industry. That will strike a warm glow in the heart of the member for Kingsford Smith. He does not believe there should be any automatic expansion of the coal industry. That is another way of meeting your Kyoto target. The remaining two countries are Sweden and Iceland. The Icelanders are very lucky to have an enormous endowment of geothermal energy. The Swedes rely on nuclear power for up to 45 per cent of their energy.The Australian government is adopting an approach to Kyoto which is based on objective science, not on ideology. We recognise that the Kyoto protocol as it stands today is not the answer. It is not achieving a significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions because it is not global. It excludes the major emitters. It excludes the fastest growing emitters. We are seeking to engage those emitters in a practical way by developing the clean coal technologies that the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources spoke about earlier, which will enable the developing countries of the world - countries like China that are so heavily dependent on coal - to have the technology to deliver the energy they need for development and at the same time lower their carbon intensity and reduce the growth in their greenhouse gas emissions. At the same time, we are working through the AP6 right across the Pacific through other fast-growing economies to develop the skills and technologies that will enable us to achieve this goal.Unlike many of the countries that the opposition talks about and holds up - countries like Spain, which is going to miss its Kyoto target by 36 per cent, and Italy, which will miss it by 20 per cent; most of the countries that have ratified the protocol are not going to meet it - the Australian government measures its performance in the climate change battle by results, not rhetoric, and by substance, not symbols.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. There is no argument that broadband is an important element of Australia's economic infrastructure. As to the suggestion that the government has not pursued the right strategy in relation to broadband, can I remind the House and, in particular, the Leader of the Opposition that Australia has the second fastest take-up rate of broadband in the OECD. Close to 90 per cent of Australian households and small businesses can already access fast multimegabit broadband speeds of between two megabits per second and eight megabits per second and we will continue to pursue policies that increase that.The Leader of the Opposition has announced something in relation to this earlier today. I understand that this is essentially the same proposal as outlined by the member for Brand when he led the opposition, but what has been revealed today is that Labor intends to raid the Future Fund in order to pay for this. One of the great economic challenges Australia faces is the ageing of her population. One way of responding to that challenge, one way of protecting future generations from the crushing burden of a decline in the number of people in the workforce because of the ageing of the population, is to save for the future. That is what we have done through the Future Fund. What the man who sits opposite me proposes to do is to raid the savings of future generations and make the burden on their backs even worse than it would otherwise be.On first blush, this appears to be an economically irresponsible way of funding a program and it also appears to be short-sighted. It has no regard for the future and no regard for the fact that of all the challenges this country faces none is greater than the ageing of her population. It is an undeniable fact that the demographic trends of this country are going to mean that in 30 or 40 years time there will be fewer people in the workforce supporting a larger number of retired people. In those circumstances, raiding the Future Fund is recklessly indifferent to the welfare of future generations of Australians.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Stirling for his question. As members of this House know, when this government was elected the Commonwealth government owed $96 billion worth of debt. Try as it might the Australian Labor Party had no plan whatsoever to free Australia from that crushing burden of debt. It sold off Qantas, it sold off the Commonwealth Bank and spent every last dollar but it still could not balance its budget and it borrowed in addition.This government through tireless hard work has now cleared Australia of $96 billion worth of debt. We have given an opportunity to future generations that will not have to pay the Labor Party debt. They will not have to pay back the capital and they will not have to service the interest. This government has gone further. We have established the Future Fund to try and begin to prepare Australia for the great economic challenge of the future - the ageing of the population. That Future Fund is well on its way to meeting the Commonwealth liability, currently $101 billion in respect of superannuation.All of this is under threat in what I regard as the most irresponsible economic announcement of the last 11 years made today by Labor. The Labor Party has announced that, if it gets elected, it is going to raid the Future Fund, steal from the future and make sure that Australia, when it comes to face the ageing of the population, is not provisioned properly, so that in a shabby little deal this Leader of the Opposition - who never had the wit to establish a Future Fund - can try and buy some votes. This is shameful economic vandalism. Let me make this point: to steal from the Future Fund as the Leader of the Opposition wants to do, he will have to change legislation and he will have to defy the guardians. Let me tell you this: once that Future Fund is open, it is open for all purposes. The only losers will be future generations of Australians.The IMF in its most recent statement on Australia said that the establishment of the Future Fund means that Australia is well placed to face the challenge of the ageing population. The raiding of the Future Fund means that Australia will not be placed in a way which can face the ageing of the population.In case you had any doubt as to how bad this fund was, up until now the Labor Party has promised that the Future Fund would always be a locked box. In fact, the Labor Party has complained that this box is not locked enough. The member for Lilley, in a doorstop interview on 15 August 2005, said this:... we have no guarantee this will be a Future Fund which is a locked box. It will be another pork-barrelling institution. We've seen from the past that these funds have been raided for base National Party ... interests ..._            _            _If you're going to have a Future Fund it has to be a locked box.Mr Speaker, let me tell you what it is going to be raided for. It is going to be raided for the base political instincts of the Labor Party; that is what it is going to be raided for. We had an announcement today that this Leader of the Opposition is going to raid the Future Fund for $2 billion in the first instalment. Once the legislation is changed so the fund can be raided, it can be raided for all purposes - and the hunger of the Labor Party for its base political instincts will not stop at $2 billion.The member for Lilley has suffered a humiliating defeat today. After complaining that he wanted the Future Fund to be more of a locked box, his leader has gone on a smash-and-grab raid, smashed the glass, taken the key, opened the fund and announced a plan to spend the money. This is absolutely irresponsible. Labor never had the wit to pay off debt, Labor never had the wit to fund superannuation, Labor never had an idea about establishing a future fund and now Labor wants to steal from the future of Australians. If people want to know why they can't have Labor entrusted with money, this proves it. You cannot trust the Labor Party with money.</DOC>

 - Overwhelmingly Australia's future is about giving future generations a fair go. How can anybody who sits opposite claim that they worry about future generations of Australians if they are prepared to load an additional burden onto the backs of future generations? We are an ageing population. We cannot avoid that reality. No amount of quotation of legislation will alter the fact that what Labor intends to do is to conduct a smash-and-grab raid on the Future Fund. Money and assets that have been quarantined to provide for future liabilities are going to be accessed to pay for a current policy. What that in plain, simple Australian English says is you are going to rob future generations to further nourish the current generation. I do not think that is fair.We hear a lot from the Australian Labor Party about fairness. I think we ought to be fair to our children and grandchildren and give them a capacity to meet the rising obligation of an ageing population. This is a problem all around the world. Fortunately, Australia is not as poorly served in this regard as other countries. But we do have an ageing population and, unless we lay aside savings and unless we lock them up and unless we cross our hearts and promise not to touch them, we are going to burden our children and our grandchildren with increasing obligations.Labor have fallen at the first hurdle of economic responsibility. They had an opportunity - and we have heard all of this trumpeting from the Leader of the Opposition, and indeed from the member for Melbourne, about how economically responsible they are going to be - but what Labor have done is they have fallen at the first hurdle. They could not resist it. They have reverted to type. They have gone back to their old habits.We quarantined this money. We set aside a fund built out of the budget surpluses that Labor opposed us accumulating. We have all of these surpluses that went into the Future Fund and the proceeds of the sale of Telstra, and the member for Melbourne has got the nerve to talk about the sale of Telstra! He opposed the sale of Telstra. The Labor Party opposed every step of the way the sale of Telstra, and now they have got the nerve to ask us questions about Telstra. There is a very simple issue of intergenerational equity involved in this. Which side of politics is in favour of giving our children and grandchildren a fair go into the future? It is the Liberal and National parties side. Which side of politics is in favour of spending for today and not caring at all about the future generations of this country? - This is the first instalment of Labor's pattern of betrayal of the interests of future generations of Australians.</DOC>

 - The member for Deakin raises a very important issue and it goes directly to one of the significant achievements of this government, and that is to have presided over a dramatic fall in the number of industrial disputes in this country. It is worth reminding the House that data released by the ABS last week highlights that in 2006 the industrial disputation rate fell to 14.9 working days lost per 1,000 employees. This is the lowest annual rate of disputation since figures were first compiled in 1913 - that is, the year before the outbreak of World War I. By contrast, when Labor was last in office there was an average rate of 193 working days lost.It is the current policy of the Australian Labor Party to do a number of things that threaten this wonderful achievement of industrial peace. It comes from a party that has always said it was better at achieving industrial peace although the record says we have done much more and have been more successful. What Labor intends to do in order to shatter this record of industrial peace is, firstly, remove the protections against secondary boycotts that are enshrined in the Trade Practices Act; secondly, scrap the 'secret ballot before strikes' provisions of the Work Choices legislation; and, finally, abolish the building and construction legislation, and the commission, which has undeniably cleaned up the building industry in Australia. Over the last year, there is no industry that has seen a more spectacular fall in the number of days lost through strikes than the building and construction industry. Talk to any employer in that industry - indeed, talk to any union official in that industry - and they will acknowledge that this is a direct result of the government's legislation. Yet Labor wants to do away with that and, presumably, bring back the anarchy that was particularly a feature of major construction sites in Perth and Melbourne.There is a further dimension to this, and that is that the New South Wales Greens - who have not only declared a preference deal with Labor for the upcoming New South Wales election but are also busily negotiating a preference deal with the Australian Labor Party for the upcoming federal election - have announced that they want to take this exercise a step further. Yesterday they said they wanted to abolish industrial torts in New South Wales. In other words, they want to take away the common-law right of a company that was damaged by union action - a common-law right that was enshrined in the famous and meritorious Dollar Sweets case, in which my distinguished colleague the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party and Treasurer was involved. That industrial tort power, the inherent common-law right to sue if you are damaged, was upheld in the Dollar Sweets case, and they want to abolish that.And if the Greens proposals were adopted at a federal level, who knows? When Labor negotiates preference deals with the Greens, the interests of the people are always second. We know what happened in 2004. We know that the present leader's predecessor sold out those timber workers in Tasmania to try and get some Greens preferences in seats like Grayndler, Kingsford Smith and all those other inner seats in the cities. So what I predict is that part of the preference deal will be to go even further than they have gone. I ask the simple question: in light of the magnificent era of industrial harmony that has been ushered in under the government of the last 11 years, why on earth would you take action to demolish that? Why would you abolish the secondary boycott provisions of the Trade Practices Act? Why would you want to scrap the secret ballot? Why would you want to bring back anarchy in the building and construction industry? Why would you want to get in bed with the Greens and, in the process, sell out not only the interests of workers but also the interests of industrial harmony in this country?</DOC>

 - I am aware of the views of Mr Murdoch and Mr Walker, and I notice that Mr Walker is now being pleaded in aid of the Australian Labor Party. A couple of weeks ago there was something infamous about having a - I wonder if anyone in the Labor Party had a telephone conversation with Mr Walker to ascertain his view -  - Mr Speaker, I am aware of the views of Mr Kirk and Mr Walker and Mr Murdoch and Mr Packer. They have all expressed views on broadband. I certainly share the view that broadband is a very important part of Australia's infrastructure future. But the issue in debate - I notice the member for Melbourne has moved off the Future Fund - and our quarrel with the Labor Party on this is that the Labor Party intend to raid the Future Fund. That is what they are going to do. They said this fund was not sufficiently locked up. I remind the member for Melbourne that, if Telstra shares are sold by the Future Fund, the money goes into the fund and therefore it is subject to the same restrictions and should be treated in the same way as all the other resources that are in the fund. But there is a very simple and fundamental issue involved here: the Future Fund is designed to relieve future generations from a greater financial burden than would otherwise be the case. That is what it is designed to do. - We have enormous Commonwealth superannuation liabilities accruing, and we have put this money aside, no thanks to the Labor Party, in order to look after those liabilities. What the Labor Party intends to do is to rob the savings set aside for our children and grandchildren in order to fund a current policy proposal. I have no doubt, and the Treasurer has no doubt, that this is the first of many. This is the first instalment. I understand that at the news conference today the third question asked by journalists was: how many more policy proposals are going to be funded by raiding the Future Fund?I say to the Labor Party: I am interested in the views of Mr Murdoch, Mr Packer, Mr Kirk and Mr Walker. I sometimes agree with them and I sometimes do not. But in the end I am more interested in the wellbeing of my children and grandchildren - and those who sit opposite are more interested in the wellbeing of their children and grandchildren - than in the views of other people, much and all as I respect the contribution that Mr Murdoch has made to this country and other countries and the contribution that James Packer and his late father have made. But in the end my obligation is to future generations, not to individuals in the current generation.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Cowper for his question and recognise the very keen interest that the member for Cowper has in the tourism industry and particularly the inbound tourism industry in Australia and our capacity in policy settings to ensure that that continues to grow, not to mention our pursuit of competition in the aviation sector, which has delivered far greater passenger movements through the port of Coffs Harbour, represented by the member for Cowper.Today was quite a significant day in terms of establishing greater competition in the international aviation sector out of Australia. Last year, the former Minister for Transport and Regional Services announced that we were going to allocate air traffic rights to Virgin airlines to fly the Pacific route from the east coast of Australia to the west coast of the United States. They took that commitment knowing that they were going to have to make a significant investment in equipment. Today I witnessed the signing of the contract between Virgin Blue and the Boeing Company to purchase six new Boeing 777 aircraft, worth $2.2 billion. This is a significant indication of the confidence that a majority Australian owned company - Virgin Blue - has in the Australian economy and in the tourism industry here to take on the challenge of providing greater competition across the Pacific route.Virgin have indicated they will also lease a seventh aircraft and have options for an additional six beyond those six that they signed a contract for today. This means that as soon as those aircraft are available they will be put into service and there will be extra capacity available across the Pacific route. There will be extra competition for the three airlines that are already flying the Pacific route between Australia and the United States.It is interesting to note also that the company's indications are that their moving into the international aviation sector will generate in excess of 1,100 new jobs in the Australian economy, which is incredibly important. The investment is important, the competition is important, but the jobs are very, very important. Of course, they will be created in Australia. In servicing this very important aviation sector, providing more competition, greater opportunity and more competitive prices for tourists to travel into Australia, there will be obviously be a flow-on effect, but it also means that there will be 1,100 new jobs in the Australian economy.In answer to the member's question: a policy setting that we put in place last year, when we took the decision that there should be an opportunity for another Australian flag carrier on this route rather than a foreign carrier - that commitment that we gave to the Australian aviation industry - was paid back in spades today by a $2.2 billion commitment by Virgin to investing in equipment that is going to take up this opportunity. This is a clear example of government policy creating and establishing and providing succour to greater competition but also creating the opportunity for more Australian jobs and keeping the Australian economy strong.</DOC>

 - I can tell the House pretty simply where the Liberal and National parties stand: we want more people in work and we want them in work at higher wages consistent with low inflation and a growing Australian economy. Here is the evidence. Since this government was elected, there have been two million new jobs created in Australia. Since this government was elected real wages in Australia - that is, over and above inflation - have grown 19.8 per cent. But it was not always that way in Australia. When the Labor Party was in office not only did people lose their jobs but people lost wages. Now remember this fact: under the coalition, real wages have gone up 19.8 per cent; under the previous Labor government, when Labor was in office, real wages did not go up at all - real wages declined by 1.8 per cent. The shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Swan, was asked about this recently -  -  - For Lilley, sorry. Thank you for correcting me, Member for Melbourne. You would not want this bullet to go off on anyone other than him, would you? - Just as the rifle is coming down the front bench, you will help me sight it, will you? Thank you very much. And keep asking questions on the Future Fund. That helps us sight that pretty well, too. When the honourable member for Lilley was interviewed by Fran Kelly on 8 March 2007, she said this:... Treasurer Peter Costello made the point yesterday that under the current government real wages have increased 20 per cent in this country. He compares it to under Labor they went down 1.8 per cent ...Answer:... Look, there was wage restraint under a Labor government to make this economy internationally competitive ...So there you have it. Under Labor declining wages was a good thing. It was a deliberate policy. That was their policy to make Australia internationally competitive. We had another idea about making Australia internationally competitive. How is this for an idea: balance the budget, repay $96 billion of debt, have an independent monetary policy, reform the waterfront, engage in industrial relations reform and set up a Future Fund? Then maybe the workers can get high wages and not have to suffer under real wage declines.The recent tactic from the Leader of the Opposition has been to say his policy is coalition policy. He supports balanced budgets now, he supports paying off debt and he supports an independent monetary policy. Whatever the coalition is for, the Leader of the Opposition would now have you believe that he endorses it. But the first hurdle: can he stand up and can he protect the Future Fund?Mr Speaker, he should not turn his back at this point and engage in conversation with the member for Lilley, as if he is not interested, because the Leader of the Opposition ought to get interested in some economic policy. I call on him to turn around and to listen to some economic policy. Ah, Mr Speaker, let us pretend to have a conversation about the Future Fund now! Then we will turn and pretend to have a conversation about education policy! The people of Australia need to know this: the Leader of the Opposition studiously turns his back in the parliament on a daily basis. Hooray! The Leader of the Opposition has just turned around to face the music. The people of Australia ought to know this: the Leader of the Opposition, if he wants to become Prime Minister, has got to face challenges front on and not with his back. - The member for Gorton then left the chamber.The member for Corio then left the chamber. - This is the biggest thing you can do when you are facing the future for Australia. When you know our greatest economic challenge of the future is going to be the ageing of the population, you ought to face up to it and you ought to do something about it. You ought to free future generations from the obligations of today. Give the young people a chance. Start providing for them. Do not raid the Future Fund and steal from the future of Australia.</DOC>

 - I am aware of a lot of research, and I am not disputing that there may have been research commissioned by the Victorian government, but the facts, as I am advised in relation to broadband, are that Australia does have the second fastest take-up rate in the OECD and that close to 90 per cent of Australian households and small businesses can already access fast, multimegabyte broadband speeds. 
An honourable member - Megabit. - Yes, megabit. That is not really the big point at issue today. There is probably a view on both sides of politics that more continues to be required in relation to broadband, but it is how you provide it that matters and how you pay for it. What has been opened up today is an enormous gap between the commitment of the coalition to Australia's future and the desire of the Labor Party to spend the savings of future generations -  - to finance the consumption of the current generation. There is something called intergenerational equity. I have just been in Japan, where it is predicted that by the year 2050 42 per cent of the population will be over the age of 65 and that there will be a situation where the burden of those in the workforce caring for those who are out of the workforce will be on a ratio of 1.2 to one. That is dramatically worse than the situation in this country. Ours is a lesser problem, but it is still a problem. The reason why we paid off debt and the reason why I very strongly supported the proposal of the Treasurer and the finance minister to have a Future Fund was that I wanted to set aside money that would not be touched by any government to meet the liabilities of the budget in decades into the future because I did not want to put the sort of burden on the backs of future generations of Australians that would otherwise be the case if we did not make that provision.The debate here is about the future; it is not about the present. The future is very important. There are many people in older generations who worry about how their children are going to cope with an increasingly ageing population. It is the biggest single economic challenge that this country has. The way you care for it is to set aside money out of today's surpluses to provide for tomorrow's liabilities. In plain language, Australians call it putting money aside for a rainy day - and we have not had too many of those recently; we pray there will be a lot more. The greatest obligation we have collectively in today's generation, a very rich and fortunate generation, is to harvest some of that richness and some of that good fortune and lay it aside for the future.I thought we had the support of the Labor Party on this. I thought they believed in caring for the future. But what they have done today is to sell out the interests of future generations. This is the tip of the iceberg. Once you have started with the Future Fund in relation to broadband, once you have tasted it, you will find it irresistible. You will be seduced into doing it for something else. This is the old Labor back in business: they raid the savings for future generations in order to pay for current consumption. We are against that. We want to make prudent provision for future generations. That is why we established the Future Fund.</DOC>

 - Firstly, can I thank the honourable member for Fairfax for his question and for his interest. After four years, I think we can look back with pride and say that we made a contribution to bringing down a vicious dictator - a man who tortured and murdered his people, who used chemical weapons against his own people; a man who invaded neighbouring countries, who started a war with Iran in which a million people were killed. We are proud that we contributed to destroying that regime. Secondly, we are proud that we made a contribution to the start of a new democracy. The people of Iraq have voted three times. The last time, 12 million of those people went out and voted for a democratically elected parliament which has elected a government.On this side of the House, we are champions of democracy. We believe in democracy and we believe in it with a great deal of passion. We are very proud that we have made a contribution. We accept that the situation in Iraq, particularly in Baghdad and Al Anbar province, and the four provinces in and around Baghdad, is very difficult. People are being attacked by terrorists, by al-Qaeda in Iraq. The suicide bombings are mainly conducted by those people. There have been battles between death squads and militias in and around Baghdad as well, and this has been a very great threat to democracy in Iraq. And there have been attempts, particularly by al-Qaeda in Iraq, to foment civil war.It is the view of this government that these people must be defeated. The Baghdad security plan is unfolding and we will have to wait and see how successful that will be. We are not making any false claims. At this stage, there are some early and encouraging signs. We are hopeful about the future. We are not certain, but we happen to think it is a good idea to support the Baghdad security plan. The Labor Party think it should be opposed. They oppose the Baghdad security plan. They said it was wrong. It was not wrong. It is worth trying to defeat the terrorists in and around Baghdad. I must say I have a great deal of admiration for those who have the courage to take up the fight to those terrorists, and I do not have any admiration for people who think the solution is to run away.I will give the House an example. Some terrorists abducted two children in a car. They drove this car full of bombs into a crowded area. They left the children in the car because the children gave them the opportunity to get the car through security - security people did not think a car with children would be a problem. The terrorists ran away from the car, they detonated the bombs and they killed the children in an attempt to kill other people as well. These are not the sorts of people that we on this side of the House would ever want to give in to. We would never want to let people like that win. We would never want to see people as depraved as that victorious.What about the opposition? It seems to me that the opposition says it has an exit strategy. Its exit strategy can be summed up in one word and that word is 'surrender'. That is the opposition's exit strategy. Our exit strategy is conditions based. When the Iraqi security forces can sustain their democracy, that is the time to leave. If they cannot, and you leave then, it is time to surrender. It is as simple as that.Let me make the point that when in this country we debate the issue of Iraq people need to answer this question: do we want democracy to succeed in Iraq or do we not? On this side of the House we do want it to succeed. Will the Labor Party ever stand up and say it wants democracy to succeed in Iraq? I have not heard it yet. Do we want the insurgents and the terrorists to win in Iraq -  - or do we want the Iraqi army and the coalition - Australians and Americans - to win? I would have thought the answer to that question was that we wanted the Iraqi army, the Iraqi police and coalition forces to win. On this side of the House we want them to win. - We do not want the insurgents and the terrorists to win; we are against that. We are against those people. Funnily enough, we want our side to win. People are rightly appalled at the killing that has been taking place in Iraq. We are all appalled at that. But do we want it to get worse or do we want it to get better? Do we want to see a decline in the killing or do we want to see it get worse? Those who argue for a precipitate withdrawal from Iraq are arguing in effect for an environment where many more people will be killed, where Darfur will look, as I have said before, like a Sunday afternoon picnic. That is what will happen with a so-called exit strategy which is premature and which leaves the country in a state of chaos.At the end of the day, on this side of the House we know this is a tough issue to argue; we accept that. But we also know that to allow terrorists to win, to allow the insurgents to win, would be not just a catastrophe for the Iraqis and the Middle East, as former Prime Minister of Spain Aznar said overnight, but a disaster for security in our own region because of the inspiration such a defeat would give to terrorists in South-East Asia. It is as simple as that. I think that as a country and as part of the international community we have to have the courage to win this war, not just to say our exit strategy is surrender.</DOC>

 - I can inform the Leader of the Opposition that none of our contingencies is surrender. I can certainly inform him of that. The answer I gave to the question yesterday, as I indicated, was in relation to the American position. So far as Australia is concerned, the government has not made any requests of the ADF to have a contingency plan to withdraw because it is our policy to maintain the current commitment, but I am quite certain that the ADF would have the operational capacity to handle any contingency.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Corangamite for the question and note that in 1996 the unemployment rate in his electorate was 8.6 per cent. It is now 4.7 per cent, which is a good news story. That sort of result comes from a partnership that has been forged between Australian workers, Australian business and the Australian government. We are prepared to make the hard decisions in relation to government policy which help to create an environment in which business can employ more people. That is why we undertake reforms such as taxation reform, which the Labor Party opposed; industrial relations reform, which the Labor Party opposed; independent monetary policy, which the Labor Party opposed; paying off $96 billion of government debt, which the Labor Party opposed; getting the budget into surplus, which the Labor Party opposed; and Welfare to Work, which the Labor Party opposed. One reason the Labor Party oppose our tough economic decisions is that they take a popular approach and another is that they are in the pocket of the union movement.The latest Australian Bureau of Statistics data on industrial disputes, as the Prime Minister stated, indicate that in 2006 the level of strike action in Australia was at its lowest level since 1913. In fact, industrial disputes under the Labor Party in government were 13 times higher than today and the ABS now, in some states, has strike action at such a low level that it will not identify where there are strikes because it might identify the companies.That is what old Labor is about: giving unfettered access to the workplace to the union bosses. We have seen a classic example of that in Queensland. I saw these quite horrific ads in the Courier Mail about SJ Electric. One says:Attention all electrical workers: SJ Electric is attacking your wages and working conditions. Electrical workers on the Bundamba water treatment plant site are being paid substandard wages.I thought: 'Hang on! They are saying that the water treatment plant workers are being paid substandard wages by SJ Electric.' There was another ad by the union movement - the same union movement that has put aside $30 million for the next federal election - and here in my hand is a full-page ad from the Courier Mail. Unbelievable - using the sparkies' money to run these political campaigns! I said to myself: 'What is the true story? They are saying that the workers are worse off at SJ Electrics than they would be in a deal constructed by the ETU.'So we had a look at a few of the ETU negotiated union collective agreements. We found that, in comparison with SJ Electric, the average increase in wages under the SJ Electric greenfields agreement was $110 a week over the union collective agreement. So in fact the workers were far better off - more than $110 a week better off - under the SJ Electric greenfields agreement than they were under a union negotiated collective agreement. And yet I thought: 'The ETU wouldn't lie in these ads! The union bosses wouldn't tell a fib! They wouldn't try and mislead the people of Queensland in relation to wages, surely!'The point is this: as Greg Combet said, in 2006 - and, gee, you are going to hear these words a lot between now and the end of the year:I recall we used to run the country and it would not be a bad thing if we did again.The Labor Party is about the interests of the union bosses. The coalition is about the interests of the workers. We want the workers to have jobs. We want the workers to have careers. And we want the workers to have better pay.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question to me on my inaugural question time as Minister for Ageing. I can answer that by saying that, because I knew that I was being appointed on Sunday, I obviously took the time to do a bit of briefing, a bit of work, before this morning's swearing in - as you would expect any new minister to do. And what I said is true. - We have no reason to believe or suspect that there is anything untoward in the last round of aged-care approvals. However we are conducting a review which has entailed interviewing the officials concerned -  - having the documents sent from Brisbane to be reviewed again -  - and, if they turn up any information that will be of any interest to the Prime Minister, you can be certain I will tell him about it. I am surprised to get this question because the member for Lilley, the member for Griffith and the member for Rankin might remember that, when I was chairman of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters inquiry into electoral rorts in Queensland, I conducted a pretty close scrutiny of their activities. So you can be confident that, if there is anything at all wrong, I will get to the bottom of it.</DOC>

 - It is an honour to follow the new Minister for Ageing. The Leader of the Opposition will have to be a lot better at scripting muck-raking questions if he is going to trip up this good new minister.I do thank the member for Macquarie for his question and I can inform him that this government supports oral health in a number of ways: first of all, through PBS subsidy of prescriptions written by dentists; secondly, through modest - and I do stress 'modest' - Medicare support for dental treatment under team care plans prepared by GPs; thirdly, through increasing dental training places from 221 commencements in 1995 to 312 commencements in 2005, to a planned 561 commencements in 2010. But, most importantly, the government supports oral health through subsidising the 90 per cent of dental services that take place in the private sector to the tune of about $400 million a year.I certainly regret, as all members of this House do, that there are an estimated 650,000 people on public dental waiting lists. But the blame lies fairly and squarely at the feet of the state Labor governments, which have consistently failed to deliver timely public dental treatment. Members opposite from the great state of New South Wales should be ashamed that there are 210,000 people on New South Wales public dental waiting lists because the Carr-Iemma government has consistently short-changed dental services in that state.At the Westmead dental hospital, patients with no teeth of their own and with no false teeth are supposed to be treated within three months. That is bad enough, but thanks to the neglect of the Carr-Iemma government those poor people with no teeth whatsoever are now waiting nearly 2½ years for public dental treatment. Patients in severe pain are supposed to be treated within five days. That is bad enough, but thanks to the mismanagement of the Carr-Iemma government those patients now have to wait in severe pain for up to three weeks before they get public dental treatment.It is very clear where the blame should lie: the blame should lie with the consistent underfunding and the consistent short-changing of the Carr-Iemma government, which spends 25 per cent less on public dentistry per head than the next stingiest state in Australia. - I have to say that New South Wales is not the only state where Labor governments run public dentistry badly. I regret to inform the House that in the mid-1990s, after the Leader of the Opposition thought he had been the real Premier of Queensland for about five years, public dental waiting lists in Queensland were more than three years, despite the Keating dental scheme. Queenslanders have 50 per cent worse dental decay than other Australians because when this bloke opposite reckoned he was the real Premier of Queensland he refused to fluoridate the water supplies of Queensland.Mr Speaker, I ask you: is this miserable result due to the fact that he is not a socialist or is it due to the fact that he was a Christian socialist? I put this question, Mr Speaker, through you: if this bloke opposite is such a genius - if he is the genius he thinks he is - why couldn't he run health services in Queensland? The real question for the people of Australia is: why would you trust Labor to run the country when you cannot trust them to run the states? People are concluding pretty fast that you will not trust this guy with Medicare. You will not let him do to Medicare what he did to the health services of Queensland.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question and say that the government was deeply concerned and disappointed, as I have said before, by the coup that took place in Fiji. We have on many occasions condemned the action of the Fiji military. Last Friday, 16 March, the foreign affairs ministers of all 16 Pacific Island Forum countries met in Vanuatu to discuss a report which was produced by an eminent persons group, also established by forum foreign affairs ministers at the meeting in Sydney in December. This report by the eminent persons group not only condemned the Fiji military for an illegal and unconstitutional act but also put forward a road map for the restoration of democracy. I am glad to say that ministers at this meeting in Vanuatu affirmed that the interim government should commit to a firm timetable for a national election within the next 18 to 24 months, if not sooner. Only a rapid return to democracy and the rule of law will restore political credibility and also, importantly, the investor confidence that Fiji requires.I made the point at the meeting that, if the Fiji military agree to a credible road map for the restoration of democracy, Australia can help. For example, the military say that there needs to be a census in Fiji. A census actually is overdue, and we could certainly help bring forward that census and help with some of the work to ensure that it not only is a credible census but can happen in a relatively short period of time. The military say there need to be new electoral rolls. On the back of the census, that would not be a complex job. They also say there needs to be a reapportioning of electoral boundaries. There needs to be an independent electoral commission that does that. I do not think we would expect the commander of the military to draw the electoral boundaries for some reason or other; I think it should be done by an independent electoral commission. We can help with all those things.Australia will help with the restoration of democracy in Fiji. The eminent persons group is now charged with once more engaging with the Fiji military and seeing, on the back of the offers that countries like Australia and New Zealand will make to assist with the restoration of democracy, how quickly that can be done.It is important it is done quickly because Fiji is on the slide economically. This coup has done enormous damage to Fiji's economy. It was already reasonably fragile, but Fiji is now in great difficulty. Its GDP is declining. It needs democracy restored and it needs it restored soon. It is important that the military leadership in Fiji listen to the voices of the Pacific, which unanimously want a rapid restoration of democracy.</DOC>

 - I thought I indicated yesterday - but, if I did not, I do so today - that the contact was initiated by my office. It was initiated by Mr Tony Nutt, then serving as principal private secretary, now my chief of staff. It was initiated because, on examination of the assets on the register of pecuniary interests put there by the senator, it was clear, given the relatively small number of share investments referred to in the return, that they did not amount to trading and that therefore trading was a misdescription. That is the reason why Mr Nutt made the inquiry. In fact, I am surprised that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is querying this. I would have thought that evidence that this transpired indicated that a very careful watch was being kept, which is absolutely contrary -  -  - Anyway, let me continue with the narrative. Mr Nutt got in touch with the senator's office and said: 'Look, I've had a look at the senator's return, and it's obvious from the number of investments listed that that doesn't amount to trading. It is a misdescription and you shouldn't give the description of 'trading' to something that manifestly does not amount to trading.' And he also, so I am told, said to his equivalent in the senator's office, to whom he spoke, 'You'd better check with the minister as to whether the return accurately depicts the situation, and if it does then it seems to me' - and I think this was a reasonable conclusion drawn by Mr Nutt-, doing his job - 'that the description 'trading' is inaccurate because of the limited number of investments and that another description would be more appropriate.' I think Mr Nutt was doing his job. When he looked at the return - and this does rather illustrate the point - as it then was, it did not show the 72 trades.I know that the dark, sinister mind of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition in these matters will be saying that somehow or other we knew. The truth, let me say it again for the record, is we did not know about those 72 investments until a few days ago. I think what Mr Nutt did back in December was entirely appropriate. And I think the fact that he sought and obtained through the then minister's chief of staff or relevant adviser an assurance that the register accurately depicted the situation is far from being evidence of some cover-up, conspiracy or failure by my office - quite the reverse.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kingston for his question and acknowledge the huge support that he gives to all schools in his electorate. The Howard government believe that a high-quality teaching workforce equals higher standards in our schools. We believe that teachers should be rewarded and recognised for their performance and their professionalism. One significant way in which the Australian government is rewarding and recognising teachers is through the National Awards for Quality Schooling. For the fifth year these awards have been presented in Parliament House, and today I announced over $1 million in funding, for teachers and principals and schools, to recognise excellence in teaching and performance. I know the member for Kingston will be delighted that a school in his electorate, Seaford 6-12, were awarded the inaugural Medal of Distinction for the work that they are doing in raising standards in their school. I want to congratulate Seaford 6-12 on that outstanding performance.What needs to happen, though, is for the state governments to complement this recognition of teacher performance. Currently, as is self-evident, state governments employ the majority of teachers in this country through state government schools. The current system is not ensuring that we can attract the best and brightest into the teaching profession and retain them. Currently there are rigid pay structures and inflexibility in the system that is working against people being attracted to teaching and people staying in the teaching profession. So we believe state governments should follow the lead of independent schools and introduce an element of performance pay in the terms and conditions of teachers' salaries. This flexibility and the recognition of performance would ensure the ability to attract bright young people into teaching and indeed retain older teachers, who I am afraid are leaving the profession because of a lack of incentive in the system.I was asked about alternative policies. The Australian government will continue to press the state governments to introduce performance pay; we will continue to show leadership in that regard. I notice that the Labor Party have said that they support, in principle, performance pay. But what we know about the Labor Party is that they will say one thing publicly, to curry favour with the public, but then say another thing behind the scenes. They will not be able to deliver performance pay for teachers because the education unions are against it and the Labor Party are beholden to the education unions in this country. We had an example yesterday when the Leader of the Opposition said that the Latham schools hit list was over. That had been a Labor policy for decades - to take money away from Catholic and independent schools. So the Leader of the Opposition comes out and says, 'We've got rid of the hit list.' Yet what do we read in the Age newspaper? The old union hacks that make up the Labor Party are still committed to the politics of envy and driving a wedge between government and non-government schools. The fact is that the Labor Party have no credibility on education reform because they cannot and will not stand up to the education unions.</DOC>

 - The Australian government has put on the agenda for the next education ministers meeting an item for performance pay. We will be discussing with the education ministers how they can incorporate an element of performance pay in their arrangements with teachers and to follow the lead of the independent schools.The Australian government currently provides $33 billion to schools across Australia. What is proposed over the next funding agreement is that there will be an additional $9 billion, so the Australian government's commitment will be some $42 billion. Nine billion dollars is a lot of money to use to encourage state governments to introduce performance pay for teachers so that we can attract and retain the best and brightest in the teaching profession.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Leichhardt for his question and I can inform him that 83 Sri Lankans were caught by the Royal Australian Navy in international waters attempting to illegally reach Christmas Island. The engine of the vessel upon which they were travelling had been sabotaged twice. On the first occasion the Navy was able to repair the damage but on the second occasion they were not able to do so. Some of the members of the group had spent time in Malaysia and Indonesia before boarding a people smuggler's vessel for the voyage to Australia. I am advised that there is no evidence that by those who spent time in Malaysia any attempt was made to access the international protection system. A number attempted to do so in Indonesia and, of those that did, most did not await the outcome of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees assessment.So let us get this absolutely clear. This was a package deal. These people paid the people smugglers up to $US10,000 to be transported from Sri Lanka to Australia. These are international criminal networks that operate on a high-profit basis and show no concern or care for the people they smuggle or the lives they endanger. The trade of people smuggling is odious, it is dangerous, it is repugnant and it is illegal, and it should be seen that way. The Australian government has done, and will continue to do, all in its power to prevent and deter the perpetrators of people-smuggling activity. We are determined to protect the borders of Australia and to maintain the integrity of the immigration system.I am asked by the member for Leichhardt whether there are any alternative policies. There is an alternative policy: essentially to run up the white flag. The opposition spokesman on immigration, the member for Watson, has demonstrated that nothing has changed so far as the Australian Labor Party is concerned. He said, firstly, that the Sri Lankans should have been processed on Christmas Island and, secondly, that if any of the Sri Lankans are given refugee status then they should be let into Australia automatically. That would be no more than a promotional tool for the people smugglers to use in their marketing programs. This is a business, an odious business but nonetheless a sophisticated and profitable business for those who are engaged in people smuggling. Left to Labor, the Labor Party would give a green light to people smuggling. We know that the people smugglers will seek to continue their activities. The Australian people can be assured that this government will do everything it can to discourage them and close them down. On the other hand, under Labor the success of people smuggling is assured.</DOC>

 - I agree with the Leader of the Opposition that broadband is a good idea and it will make a contribution to future economic growth. I do not have any argument with that proposition. I might remind the Leader of the Opposition that the last national accounts figures showed a very significant lift in productivity. While I am on my feet, I want to quote from something which is not generic to the issue of broadband but is specific to what was announced yesterday. It is the economic advice tendered on Wednesday, 21 March, which was yesterday, by ABN AMRO, under the title of Broadband dreaming. What the report says is as follows:The ALP has proposed a Broadband PPP to build a ... network with a minimum 12 Mbps to 98% of households. We think it is an impractical proposal on many levels and is unlikely to be implemented.It then goes on to say:We think the proposal for a regulated access monopoly with a guaranteed return takes the industry back 20 years to Government provision, gold-plating and restricted rollout. It is productively and allocatively inefficient. It does not resolve access regulation issues but entrenches them and adds new inefficiencies. It re-establishes a conflict between Government as owner, whose dividends rely on access prices, and as regulator of access. It draws on funding it may not have legitimate right to.Let me say in relation to that last sentence that I do not think any government in this country has the right to take the savings of future generations to fund today's aspirations.</DOC>

 - It is not surprising that a member from the great state of Western Australia, representing the electorate of Hasluck, should be concerned about Australian workplace agreements, because the resources sector, which is of course heavily located in Western Australia, delivers $110 billion a year in exports for Australia. That is 38 per cent of all Australia's commodity export earnings. It employs 140,000 Australians directly and over half a million indirectly. AWAs are the most popular choice of federal agreement, with 62 per cent of all resource sector employees who are covered by a federal agreement being employed under AWAs.As everyone knows, Labor has promised, if it is elected, to abolish Australian workplace agreements. There is no debate, there is no argument, and there is no qualification; if Labor wins, AWAs are dead - we all know that. It is interesting therefore, to read the views of the Australian Mines and Metals Association released today, titled Australian workplace agreements - a major matter for miners. It took apart the Labor myth that AWAs could be replaced by common-law contracts.I think the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is paying attention, and that is good because she is responsible for this policy and she believes in it. Every time I see her on the television, she says how strongly they are in favour of getting rid of AWAs. The report mentions 15 reasons, including the inability to customise working arrangements in a legal manner and also that they cannot prevent the unwanted intervention of unions, particularly where there are no union members. That is a very significant element. Under a common-law agreement, even if the people were not members of the union and nobody in the workplace was a member of the union, there would still be no capacity to prevent the unwanted intervention of the union.That is one of the differences between an AWA and a common-law agreement. According to the Australian Mines and Metals Association, abolishing AWAs would cost the economy $6 billion. There will be nearly a million AWAs in operation by the end of this year. I think it was most succinctly summed up in an article I read at the weekend, written by the commentator Paul Kelly, an article that was otherwise, I might say, very laudatory of the Leader of the Opposition and critical of me. I invite the House's attention because it does sum up what is involved here. He said:Rudd is embarked on one of the most audacious political scams in Australian history: seeking to resurrect trade union power and privileges by abolition of Australian Workplace Agreements, restoring union access to workplaces, saving the award system and entrenching collective union power in the name of work-life balance and family values.I think that brought all of it together. Common-law contracts in place of AWAs involves the reassertion of union power and the realisation of the dream given voice to by Greg Combet when, a few months ago, he addressed a rally in Adelaide and said that there was a time when the unions ran Australia and it would be a good thing if we brought back those days.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Blair for his question. I can tell him that in 2002 the government released its Intergenerational report, which found that over the next 40 years the greatest economic problem to face the Australian nation will be the ageing of the population. The percentage of people aged over 65 will increase from 12.7 per cent of the population to 25 per cent of the population in 2042. So we will have more people of retirement age and fewer people of working age. At the time that this is going on, we will have a huge draw-down on medical expenses and pharmaceutical expenses and age pension expenses - when the proportion of the population which is of working age, and therefore of prime taxpaying age, is declining.The government has laid out a series of measures to deal with this problem. Australia is not alone in facing this problem. Every industrialised Western country is facing this problem to lesser or greater degrees. But Australia has been at the forefront of dealing with this problem - first of all, by paying off all Labor debt so that future generations will not have to service the $96 billion of debt which the Labor Party ran up before 1996 and, secondly, with the establishment of the Future Fund, for the first time to provision for superannuation liabilities which are going to hit over the next 20 years. In 2020, those liabilities will be $140 billion. So you will have a $140 billion liability at the same time as health is blowing out, pharmaceuticals are blowing out, the age pension is blowing out and the proportion of prime taxpayers is declining.We can handle this problem with the establishment of the Future Fund, as long as it preserves its capital and all earnings inside the fund. But, to the extent that you take out that capital or take out those earnings, you will be robbing the future, right at the time when the great crunch comes - the great generational crunch that we are all facing up to.Yesterday the Leader of the Opposition, in what must be the most economically irresponsible and short-sighted decision, announced that he would be robbing the Future Fund to pay for Labor election policies. He will be taking $2.7 billion out of that fund, money he never had the wit to set aside, to pay for Labor election policies. As I said yesterday, the first burglary is the hard one: once you have done the first burglary, the second and the third and the fourth get much easier.In a press conference yesterday, the member for Melbourne was asked whether or not there might be future raids on the Future Fund. He was asked this question - and we had better put it on the record:JOURNALIST: Mr Tanner, how often do you envisage raiding the Future Fund to pay for election promises?TANNER: This is a specific commitment _JOURNALIST: So this might not be a one off?TANNER: I can't comment on other specific propositions, they're still obviously in consideration on a whole range of policy areas _One burglary down and another in contemplation! Where the member for Melbourne goes, you can bet your bottom dollar other ferrets on the Labor front bench will be following. We then had the member for Perth coming into parliament today, and he was asked this question:JOURNALIST: Would it be reasonable to use the Future Fund for projects like road funding or major rail projects?SMITH: Well, you do need to speak on that detail to Lindsay rather than me.JOURNALIST: He won't answer that.SMITH: Well, it's not a matter for me. I am the education spokesman.Then AAP reports the member for Lilley, not to be outdone, under 'Labor will use Future Fund for infrastructure projects'. It says:Today, Mr Swan said Labor planned to use the fund for various other 'productive projects'.When reporters asked what that meant, Mr Swan replied:'Basically hard infrastructure, but we've not made announcements in  that area yet.'So this is not a one-off; this is the first in a series of raids: the member for Melbourne is getting ready for it, the member for Perth is lining up and the member for Lilley has announced it. Every raid on that Future Fund steals from future Australian generations. The coalition is the party that has the long-term vision to face up to Australia's greatest economic challenges. The Labor Party, like bears to a honeypot, have got their paws into this and once they develop a taste for that honey there will be no going back.</DOC>

 - I have not seen what Mr McCrann said, but I will go back and have a look and I will produce a list of the sayings of Chairman Terry on the member for Lilley, because he has said quite a lot of interest about the member for Lilley. Lest the member for Lilley pretend that he supports this policy, I am going to table at least 10 occasions on which the member for Lilley has demanded the Future Fund be a locked box and that no money be taken out of the Future Fund. For example, on 7 November 2005:It has to be a locked box. We have to make the Future Fund a locked box._            _            _We'd like to see parliamentary oversight and complete transparency. It's very important there is public confidence in the Future Fund and that it is a locked box that can't be raided by the National Party _Let me get this straight: the Future Fund can't be raided by the National Party because the Labor Party is going to get there first! My goodness, what sort of a principle is that? These people are a group of tomb raiders: burglary 1, burglary 2 and burglary 3 - accessory before the fact, the bloke who did it and accessory after the fact. Let us go to 18 August 2005, when the whole point of the Future Fund was to have budget surpluses and the proceeds of assets put in the hands of 'independent experts and locked away in a box'. Who is the independent expert who is going to take the money, $2.7 billion, and put it into their election projects? None other than the opposition leader. Some independent expert! Let us hope for the sake of future Australian generations that Labor never gets elected. If Labor gets elected, I figure sometime in about 2015 or 2020, when the ageing of the population crunches down on this country, when a $140 billion liability comes and it has to be met, nobody is going to be sitting around saying, 'Let's thank Kevin Rudd for raiding this, for mortgaging our future for his grubby election promises back in 2007.'Mr Speaker, I table just a sampling of the list. There are only 10 quotes on that particular press release, but we will be finding a lot more.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kalgoorlie for his question. I recognise that he understands the need to have certainty as to the delivery of modern communications to rural and remote Australia, particularly to his electorate of Kalgoorlie. He also understands that you cannot pick winners, that you cannot pick technology and that there needs to be flexibility with technology to be able to get the penetration and get services to the people that live throughout rural and remote Australia. That is why the government decided when we did to invest $3.1 billion in the Connect Australia package, which has a number of components. The first component that it has got is the $600 million Broadband Connect infrastructure program. The Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts will announce the winning tenderers for this program that will deliver the speeds that working families need on their broadband across rural and regional Australia. They do not have to wait until the next election and they do not have to wait until the Labor Party raids the Future Fund and the Labor Party completely steals the telecommunications fund; it is going to happen very shortly as a result of the policy put in place by the Liberal and National parties in the coalition government.Following on from that, we have also recently announced a further $162.5 million for the Australian Broadband Guarantee - a guarantee that every Australian can access an affordable broadband service, regardless of where they live; and it is technology neutral. It does not pick winners as far as technology is concerned, because individual technologies do not work uniformly across Australia, particularly remote Australia.But the most important aspect of the Connect Australia package when we announced it was the $2 billion perpetual communications fund. This is about ensuring that people living in rural and remote Australia - the seven million Australians who live outside of the metropolitan areas - have certainty that there will be funds available to provide them with technology that we do not even know about yet, which in 10 years time may come on stream and which the market will provide to the metropolitan areas and the viable markets in Australia but might not provide to regional Australia.We recognise there would be a need to have a guaranteed funding stream to pay for that technology so that rural and regional Australia can keep up with the rest of the country, so we established the $2 billion perpetual communications fund, which is invested as we speak and has already earned about $150 million in interest. After the first three years, when it is first accessed, there will be in excess of $400 million in revenue that has been produced by that perpetual communications fund - leaving the $2 billion intact - that can be invested in new technology for regional and remote Australia. This is the plan that we put in place to guarantee that seven million Australians living outside of the metropolitan areas would not get left behind. This is our guarantee to future proof the bush as far as telecommunications are concerned.The Labor Party announced in their policy yesterday that not only are they going to become burglars and burgle $2.7 billion out of the Future Fund that the Treasurer spoke about, but they are going to engage in grand theft and thieve $2 billion from those seven million people who live in regional Australia. When the Labor Party talk about investing $4.7 billion to cover the country in broadband, they should be reminded that it cost South Korea $50 billion to cover a country that is one-third the size of the new electorate of Flynn - $50 billion to do what the Labor Party is proposing to do.With our policy of Connect Australia we want to future proof the bush. The Labor Party want to desert it. They want to conduct burglary on the Future Fund and they want to conduct grand theft on the perpetual communications fund and thieve $2 billion worth of certainty from seven million Australians in remote Australia.</DOC>

 - If I can address the second part of the Leader of the Opposition's question, with regard to comments this morning, as is usual he selectively quotes from the doorstop. What Senator Boswell was referring to was that, with our package of $3.1 billion, broadband will be adequate in regional Australia, because we are going to start investing now and there will be a guarantee into the future to future proof consumers in regional Australia. Concerning the first part of the Leader of the Opposition's question -  - now we know that he does not listen to the answers in the House. I just answered that question in my answer to the question from the member for Kalgoorlie -  - when I outlined our strategy and what we have committed to future proofing rural and remote Australia. - We understand how the market works. We have put a $2 billion capital investment in place to guarantee that there is an ongoing funding stream to pay for new technology that the market might not provide in rural and remote Australia. When the Labor Party thieves $2 billion from the seven million people living outside of the metropolitan areas in Australia, that opportunity will not be there. And that is the issue that the Leader of the Opposition should be addressing.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Riverina for her question. Since 2004, as a direct result of the government's Broadband Connect program and its predecessor, HiBIS, more than one million additional premises have had access to metropolitan comparable broadband services, more than 200,000 additional consumers in regional Australia have been connected to broadband services and more than 1,500 additional exchanges have been ADSL enabled. And now the government's $162½ million Australian Broadband Guarantee will provide universal broadband for all Australians, regardless of where they live, because anybody unable to gain a reasonable level of broadband service at their home or small business can receive a subsidised broadband service.I am asked about alternative proposals. I have now had an opportunity to look very carefully at the Labor proposal as launched yesterday and found it to be utterly implausible and lacking entirely in credibility. There is nobody in the communications sector who for a moment thinks that its grand ambition can be nearly realised. I invite those who would not normally rush to read a Labor Party proposal or paper to look at it because, out of 20 pages, there is but one page of anything resembling details. It gives you some idea when so small amount of space is allocated to a massively complex and technical area. There are no maps or costings of the proposal. There are no details.Then there are the funding figures. We are told that it is an $8 billion plan. By four o'clock yesterday afternoon, only a couple of hours after the press club launch, the communications spokesman, Senator Conroy, was telling Steve Price at 2UE that the number could be as high as $9 billion. Steve Price asked, 'So we are up around the $10 billion mark, are we?' Senator Conroy answered, 'It is about $8 billion to $9 billion.' The figures are going up already. What sort of costed proposal is this? But why worry? They will just dip into the Future Fund to top up any overspend.Moreover, it is a stupid policy. It is stupid because the private sector was going to invest anyway. Telstra and the group of nine consortium were going to invest through the fibre-to-node program without any government funding assistance because they were going to invest in the commercial areas of built-up populations. Now they are laughing all the way to the bank because the Labor Party recklessly, negligently -  - and incompetently are going to support the major telcos. There was no need to fund them. Instead, you have to fund the areas that miss out - regional, rural and remote Australia, outer suburban areas and so on. Labor are trashing the Future Fund and abolishing the telecommunications fund, which is targeted at regional and remote Australia, to support the big end of town. There can be nothing more stupid than that. There is nothing in the policy about pricing or affordability. No proposal can have credibility unless you address that. They do not address the issues of regulation. What is the regulatory regime? That is crucial to fostering private sector investment and the like.Above all else, this proposal is anticompetitive. This will lock in Telstra as the sole network provider. Already the telcos know that Telstra is the only realistic bidder because the opposition has ruled out preventing or blocking Telstra from overbuilding any competitor's network. We all remember the dual pay-TV rollout of the early 1990s - incompetently managed and devised by the then Labor government - where Telstra readily admits it overbuilt the Optus infrastructure network to stifle competition. They will do it again. Telstra is the only winner from this and so, of course, one or more of their ranks might be enthusiastic supporters. Labor is deserting regional and rural Australians. It is subsidising the big end of town unnecessarily. It is putting future generations of Australians at a disadvantage. I say again: you cannot trust Labor with money.</DOC>

 - I can certainly confirm -  - that the government has had a number of programs over a period of years. I will take the member at his word that it is 17. If you want active government, vote for us - we have all these programs. The reality is that we have the second highest take-up in the OECD. I noticed that the member did not mention that.The real issue here is twofold. The first element of the debate is: why should money set aside for future generations be used to fund something that the private sector ought to provide itself? I think that is a very simple question. I think a question that, as public analysis of this debate proceeds, more and more people are going to ask is: why should $2.7 billion of public money that has been set aside for the liabilities of future generations be used to fund the provision of a service now that the private sector ought to provide itself? You can quote all the documents and interject and make noise as much as you like, but can I politely bring you back to the simple question: why should we use $2.7 billion that has been locked up for future generations to fund the provision of something that the private sector ought to provide in a normal market situation? That is a very simple proposition. That really goes to the essence of the issue.The second issue is that what the Labor Party proposed yesterday was a return to the old days of the conflict between the regulator and the participant. The opposition will recall that one of the reasons we advanced as to the sale of Telstra - a sale that was vigorously opposed until yesterday by the Australian Labor Party - was the conflict between the government as owner and the regulator. - The member for Melbourne can carry on with that cacophony, but let us analyse what is really involved here. What you are doing is, in the words of ABN AMRO, taking the industry back 20 years to government provision, gold plating and restricted rollout. They are not my words; they are the words of one of the most respected economic analysts in Australia. That is what we are doing. There are two fundamental flaws. What Labor is proposing to do is to use $2.7 billion of the assets of future generations to fund provision that ought to be made by the private sector and, in the process, they are taking the regulation of this industry back 20 years.I do not think that speaks of a party or group of men and women who have an idea of what we need in the future. Sure, broadband is important; there is no argument about that. The Leader of the Opposition got up and quoted me something that said broadband was important. That is not in debate. We are all in favour of broadband. But this side of Australian politics is not in favour of raiding the savings of our children and grandchildren in order to provide something that ought to be provided by the private sector through the normal operation of the market.Leave not granted.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Stirling for his question. I note that when Labor was last in government in 1996 the unemployment rate in Stirling was 9.4 per cent. Today it is 5.4 per cent and I think it is going to go lower. - That is right: Brian Burke created low unemployment! Young Australians today have more employment opportunities, thanks to a lot of the initiatives of the Howard government, than at any other time in the nation's history. In the past 11 years - The member for Cowan then left the chamber. - Youth unemployment is still too high at 9.7 per cent, but it is certainly lower than the 15.2 per cent when Labor was last in government. However, teenage wages have risen by 6½ per cent in real terms, whereas under 13 years of Labor they fell backwards 5.1 per cent. What we have to do is to try and encourage young people into jobs. So I was quite alarmed when I saw a notice go out at a Kiama public school for a meeting with 'John Robinson' of Unions New South Wales - they misspelt John Robertson. He was going to conduct a lesson for students on how to get a job. I thought to myself, 'This would be interesting.' It turns out that Mr Robertson's lesson delivered was about anti federal government legislation and was anti-Work Choices. He was encouraging students not to get a job but to vote Labor - in a New South Wales public school.Despite the furore - I read the Illawarra Mercury for this - at least one other Illawarra school, Keira High School, is likely to hold a similar meeting, the principal said. The principal, who happens to be the vice-president of the New South Wales Teachers Federation, said 'it would benefit pupils who have entered or were about to enter the workforce'. So I asked myself: what is it that the New South Wales Teachers Federation are doing to encourage young people to get jobs? I came across a CD-ROM put out by the New South Wales Teachers Federation. The CD-ROM shows teachers how to spread the union's anti-Work Choices campaign using every subject in the HSC syllabus, from drama and physical education to food technology. This CD-ROM, issued by the Teachers Federation to careers advisers in the schools - rather than teaching the careers advisers how to teach young people how to get a job - is trying to turn every student into a victim, trying to generate a culture of -  - pessimism amongst young people. That is what it is about. The manual has class tests for students, including fictitious case studies such as Toula, a year-12 pupil forced to accept $1.50 an hour at a part-time job. It also urges PE teachers to exploit the industrial relations side of sport as students learn to develop and practise enterprise skills as they organise, conduct and evaluate physical activity. History teachers are urged to steer their classes towards subjects such as 'The role of unions in participatory democracy'. This is what the Labor Party is about. The Labor Party and the union movement are trying to create a culture of victimisation amongst young people -  - rather than encouraging them to get jobs, to develop careers and to earn a living. This is what the Labor Party is about. A vote for Labor is a vote for the union bosses. I see the member for Grayndler laughing there. I do not see the New South Wales education minister saying this is outrageous. We cannot expect the New South Wales education minister to conduct an investigation into the unions going into schools. We cannot expect a New South Wales education minister to do that! That would be like asking the fox to investigate occupational health and safety in the henhouse, wouldn't it? That is what it would be like. The Labor Party is for union bosses and about protecting union bosses; the coalition is about jobs, jobs for young people that lead to well-paid careers.</DOC>

 - First, I thank the honourable member for Fadden for his question and, for that matter, for his interest. Last week senior officials, on my instruction, visited North Korea - officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and AusAID. The delegation met with senior North Korean government representatives, including the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Trade. The delegation obviously first and foremost welcomed the agreement that had been reached under the auspices of the six-party talks that the North Koreans would close down the Yongbyon nuclear reactor and that there would be progress made towards the eventual denuclearisation of North Korea. The delegation went on to emphasise to the North Koreans that they had now reached a pivotal point in their relationship with the international community: they can either adhere to this agreement by shutting down the Yongbyon nuclear facilities and allow International Atomic Energy Agency monitors to return to North Korea by mid-April and give a full account of their nuclear programs and facilities, or else they will of course once more become isolated in the international community.The important point that Australia makes is that the more North Korea fulfils its obligations in taking steps towards denuclearisation the more Australia can do to help the ordinary people of North Korea. To put that into some perspective, child and nursing mother malnutrition rates in North Korea are over 50 per cent in some parts of the country. It is estimated that 32 per cent - about one-third - of all North Koreans at no time have enough food to eat. So the dimensions of the humanitarian problem in North Korea are simply enormous. A country like Australia, rich in agriculture, can support the people of North Korea to a greater extent than we already do through the World Food Program, but we can only do more if North Korea works with the international community. The six-party process is making progress and Australia has been a strong supporter of it. The fact that we would send officials there - an initiative much welcomed by countries like China, Japan, the Republic of Korea and the United States - I think demonstrates the useful role we can play.Finally, while it was in North Korea the delegation did raise Australia's great concern about two other things: firstly, the still yet to be resolved issue of abductions of Japanese citizens - and that is an issue that needs to be resolved; and, secondly, the broader human rights abuses that clearly take place in North Korea. I congratulate the delegation on the good job they have done. It is another illustration of effective Australian diplomacy in Asia.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Solomon for his question. I know of his interest in these matters and I know that members generally would want to know of the involvement of the Australian Federal Police with their colleagues abroad. On Tuesday of this week, the Indonesian National Police conducted operations against Jemaah Islamiah suspects in Yogyakarta, Central Java. As a result of these INP actions, five suspected JI operatives have been arrested, including one who was seriously wounded during the arrests. One person, also a suspected JI operative, was fatally wounded during an exchange of gunfire with INP officers.This operation by the Indonesian National Police is associated with ongoing investigations into a key JI member, Abu Dujana. Media reports claim that he is the current leader of JI. I am advised by the Australian Federal Police that Abu Dujana remains a person of interest to the ongoing Indonesian National Police investigations and that unfortunately he has not been arrested. These operations continue and, for reasons of security, I cannot provide the House with further details at this time but will do so at a later date when I am in a position to do so.In relation to the second aspect of the honourable member's question, we congratulate the Indonesian National Police on their efforts against JI. This is the latest in a series of actions that they have undertaken. Of course, JI was responsible for the Bali bombing in 2002 and other attacks in Indonesia, including the bombing of our embassy and the bombing of the Marriott Hotel.There is a high level of cooperation between Indonesia and the Australian Federal Police over counterterrorism activities. Unfortunately, that cooperation is often linked to tragedy such as the bombings as well as the recent air crash in Yogyakarta, where the Australian Federal Police have been providing forensic assistance. This cooperation exists throughout the region. The AFP have been resourced under a number of initiatives, including rapid response in fighting terrorism at its source. A counterterrorism liaison position has recently been established in Thailand, and an AFP officer commenced in that role in the Australian embassy last month. Assistance has been given by the AFP and the Australian Bomb Data Centre, and that will strengthen regional cooperation and provide a network for sharing intelligence, particularly in relation to the unlawful use of explosives. A Philippines bomb data centre has been established. As well, the establishment of a bomb data centre in Malaysia and in Thailand is being progressed at this time.I think Australians need to appreciate that they and Australian interests remain one of the targets of JI. It gives us a great deal of confidence that the Australian Federal Police are able to work so cooperatively with our neighbours to bring about an end to the activities of those who would seek to destroy our way of life.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. The Investing in Our Schools Program was introduced to meet the failure of state governments to properly invest in their schools. The original commitment was $1 billion. There are 10,000 schools in Australia. The program was competitive and panels were set up in each state to assess the applications because we anticipated that there would be more applications than there was funding available, and that certainly has been the case. Over 18,000 applications were received from schools across Australia. The original guidelines made it clear that schools could apply for up to $150,000. That is not a guarantee. - The member agrees with me: that is not a guarantee. It is a competitive process. Applications were made to the panels, who then made recommendations based on need. Due to the overwhelming number of applications received, particularly from state government schools, where the most chronic neglect has been identified, a bill was passed through this parliament, and members voted on it, to bring forward the funding to 2006 and 2007 so that we could meet the enormous demand, particularly from state government schools. The House voted on that and that legislation passed.The Australian government has met its election commitment to expend $1 billion on state government and non-government school infrastructure. In addition, the Prime Minister announced a further $181 million to exceed that election promise, so that schools that had not applied or had only received a small amount of funding could apply again in a fourth round.This is one of the most successful programs that the Australian government have introduced. The reason for its success is that we have met the failures of state governments to properly fund their schools. It is very interesting to note that all of a sudden the New South Wales Labor government has come up with a plan to fund toilet blocks in their schools. In the 21st century, in a First World country, the New South Wales Labor government thinks that an election promise ought to fund toilet blocks. We believe on this side of the House that wherever a child goes to school, they should be in a high-quality environment, and that is why we have exceeded the election commitment of $1 billion: it is now an almost $1.2 billion program.</DOC>

 - The Howard government, I say in response to the member for Page, certainly is committed to delivering better cancer services to people in country Australia. Since 2001 we have committed $160 million to this end, and thanks to this funding there are now new or expanded radiation oncology services operational or about to commence in Toowoomba, Geelong, Traralgon, Bendigo, Ballarat and Perth.It will be of particular interest to the member for Page that in June 2004 the Howard government offered $8 million to the New South Wales government towards the construction of two linear accelerators at Lismore Base Hospital. New South Wales accepted this money and said that detailed planning would be done in 2006 and construction would commence no later than July of this year. When absolutely nothing whatsoever had happened at the end of last year, I wrote to the New South Wales government reiterating that the federal money remained available but demanding to know when these services would begin. I regret to inform the House that it now seems radiation oncology services at Lismore Base Hospital will not start until late 2009 at the earliest. This is a disgrace.Meanwhile, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is giggling while the cancer patients of northern New South Wales are forced to travel long distances for services or else not get the services. Cancer patients in northern New South Wales deserve better than this kind of giggling from members opposite. Either people will not get services or they will die because of a broken promise that was made by Premier Iemma when he was the New South Wales health minister back in 2004. This is a total betrayal of the people of New South Wales - the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is still giggling - by the Iemma government, which on this matter, as on so many others, has been guilty of procrastination, incompetence and deceit. To put it in the vernacular, the Iemma government could not organise a booze-up in a brewery, but with typical born-to-rule Labor arrogance it now thinks that it can coast to victory on Saturday.Let me remind the House that today in Penrith the Leader of the Opposition was with Premier Iemma, his new political mentor. If the Leader of the Opposition wants to perform some immediate service for the people of New South Wales and if he wants to demonstrate that he is a potential leader of this country and not just a patsy for the premiers, he will get on the phone this afternoon and say to Morris Iemma: 'Honour that commitment. Start building that radiation oncology centre in Lismore now.'To assist the Leader of the Opposition in making that phone call, I table correspondence between the Australian and New South Wales governments and also a newspaper interview from December 1994 in which the Leader of the Opposition said of himself:I don't believe I have the goods to be Prime Minister.I am giving him a chance to prove that that was just false modesty. I say to him: prove you have the guts to be the leader; get on the phone to Premier Iemma this afternoon.</DOC>

 - I thank the member very much for his question and for his commitment to older Australians - people who are saving for their retirements to make sure that they can lead a fantastic retirement and benefit their children as well into the future. The Australian people know that the Labor Party stands for nothing but two things. One is that they are here to represent only the interests of the union movement in this country. The second is that they know that the Australian Labor Party is full of economic idiots. - Mr Swan is one. As the Treasurer says, he stands up with his back to the coalition on a regular basis. He represents the unions in this place. He shows arrogance not just in here but outside on the doors every morning, firing the bullets for the Leader of the Opposition. He is the mud-thrower from the ALP and he is a danger to the future economy in this country.When you talk about Labor and you talk about the Labor threat to the future of this economy, look no further than superannuation. This government recently announced the abolition of the 15 per cent end tax on superannuation benefits for people over the age of 60 from 1 July this year. Why did we do that? We did that because we have a serious ageing of the population in this country. We have an ageing of the population which poses a serious threat to the future stability of the economic success of this country, and so we abolished the end tax and simplified superannuation to make it easier for people to accumulate money in their superannuation, to fund their own retirements wherever possible and to ease the burden and the stress that would otherwise be placed on the Australian economy.I know that the ALP is coming up to a conference very shortly, and we know that it is dictated to by the union movement. We know that, in a document that has been produced by Doug Cameron, Jeff Lawrence, John Sutton, Susan Hopgood and the illustrious Stephen Jones, representing all of those collective union hacks, they are advocating for the Labor Party to 'Restore taxation of lump sum superannuation benefits'. It goes on to say:The recent Budget decision to remove taxation of superannuation payouts for people aged over 60 greatly aggravates unfairness and waste in the superannuation system. It is especially unjustifiable to remove taxation from lump sum benefits.'Restore taxation of lump sum superannuation benefits'. Right now, as we speak, people are putting money into their superannuation policies; they are putting money into superannuation before 30 June because this government has put in place a generous system. And what they do not want from the Labor Party is uncertainty on superannuation. Up until this point, they were of the view that the Labor Party supported the coalition in ending the end tax on superannuation. But what we know now is that this announcement has been made by the union movement - the bosses of the Labor Party - and the Leader of the Opposition has not refuted this claim. He has had an opportunity, as have many members of the Labor Party at recent superannuation forums, to dismiss this suggestion. They have not. And so there is great uncertainty in the superannuation market at the moment. The Leader of the Opposition must come out and refute this claim and say that Labor supports the government stance to make sure that we can protect the stability of the Australian economy as we go into the future. The greatest threat to the Australian economy remains the Australian Labor Party.</DOC>

 - The answer is no. The letter that I wrote to the member pointed out that registrations for the Metropolitan Broadband Connect program commenced on 8 March last year with the release of the program's guidelines. Service providers had until 1 January 2007 to register with the program. The funding of $1.3 million related to the development of guidelines, mapping and scoping of the program. This expenditure was budgeted. It was entirely consistent with a program of this nature and has formed the basis for the seamless integration into the new Australian Broadband Guarantee. It is not right of the member to use the word 'ended' in relation to this program. It has been rolled into the Australian Broadband Guarantee program and, as often occurs, the member for Grayndler is misrepresenting the situation.Leave granted.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. The member for Dobell has a particularly longstanding interest in water, because his community on the Central Coast suffers severe water scarcity. It is appropriate to discuss water scarcity today, which is World Water Day. The theme of World Water Day is 'Global water scarcity'.No Australian government has ever devoted more money to or had a keener focus on water scarcity and water management than the Howard government. Paul Kelly correctly described the government as having been 'prescient' on the matter of water. The National Water Initiative in 2004 is widely recognised as the international gold standard for water management. But that has been surpassed by the National Plan for Water Security, which tackles for the first time more than a century of dysfunctional mismanagement by state governments of the Murray-Darling Basin, our largest system of surface and ground water, and seeks to commit over $10 billion to ensure that the curse of overallocation, the misallocation, of water as between the environment and agriculture is set right. That $10 billion includes $6 billion to invest in efficient irrigation methods, both on farm and off farm, thereby ensuring a win-win, a more efficient, more resilient, more sustainable irrigation sector, and a better balance and a better return of environmental water for our ecological assets right through our river systems.Water scarcity is a global problem and we are working internationally with many countries. Only today I met with the Chinese State Environmental Protection Administration Minister, Mr Zhou Shengxian, and we agreed to renew and reinvigorate the collaborative relationship that we have on water management and water science. Australia and China, though very different countries, share similar challenges, particularly in terms of water scarcity and overextraction of groundwater resources and the consequent impacts on rivers and agriculture. The strong cooperation between our two countries in so many areas related to the environment will continue with renewed vigour following the meetings that we have had today.The scene in urban water is a very different one. Urban water is wholly within the province of the states. Naturally the federal government is focused on interstate water resources that cross state boundaries and where state management is obviously awkward and, as we have seen in the Murray-Darling Basin, dysfunctional. In city after city in Australia we have seen a tragic neglect of investment in water infrastructure. We have droughts in our cities which are wholly the consequences of years of complacency and neglect. We have urban water utilities controlled by state governments that are run as cash cows. The states plunder their customers and do not support them.The member for Dobell has a classic case in his own area. Not so long ago the Commonwealth government, through the Australian government water fund, committed $7 million as a grant to a pipeline between the Hunter Valley and the Central Coast connecting Hunter Water and the Central Coast. The Hunter Valley has substantial water resources; the Central Coast is facing severe water scarcity and stress. The state government of New South Wales put not one penny into the pipeline. The rest of it was funded by Hunter Water, the state government owned water utility, and the Central Coast shires themselves. Hunter Water's contribution was $10 million, as a business, and from that $10 million they will generate every year an additional $8 million in revenues. That investment will add $6 million in profit to Hunter Water for Mr Iemma to spend on whatever his mind turns to. Yet Mr Iemma had the effrontery to turn up to the opening of the pipeline and play the big benefactor of the Central Coast because he had made probably the most lucrative water investment ever seen in New South Wales. The constituents of the honourable member for Dobell know how the state government in New South Wales regards them in terms of water security. It regards them as bunnies to be plucked, to be ripped off -  -  - to be plucked from their burrows and skinned!</DOC>

 - I am very happy to answer a question on the subject matter that the leader has raised - that is, the value of Work Choices to Australia's economic future and the relevance of Work Choices in the recent New South Wales election campaign. We introduced Work Choices as a major contribution to the further strengthening of the Australian economy. Whatever the Leader of the Opposition or the deputy leader may say about Work Choices, the truth is that if this reform is reversed it will be the first time in 25 years that a major economic reform in this country has been reversed. It would be akin to reimposing a controlled exchange rate, reintroducing tariff protection or dismantling taxation reform. It would signal not only to the Australian people but also to the rest of the world that this country had downed tools on economic reform. The contribution that Work Choices makes to the future strengthening of the Australian economy is undoubted, and that is why the government remains committed to Work Choices.As far as the New South Wales election is concerned, the evidence is pretty mixed. I do not know what was said to an individual candidate in a particular electorate; I am not in a position to know that. But I am in a position to observe that the National Party secured its greatest vote ever in the city of Broken Hill, which is a quintessential union town. I also note with some interest that there was an average nine per cent swing against the Labor Party in the Hunter Valley. Whilst messages out of the state election are being referred to, perhaps the member for Kingsford Smith might find a message in the fact that the member named Hunter, who is the member for Lake Macquarie, is in danger of losing his seat. Maybe the member for Kingsford Smith should have a look at the anti-coalmining remarks of the Labor member for Lake Macquarie, who is in danger of losing his seat.</DOC>

 - Tomorrow is the first anniversary of the introduction of Work Choices, and I am pleased to inform the House that since Work Choices was introduced over 263,000 new jobs have been created. It makes something of a mockery of remarks made by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition outside parliament today to the effect that there had not been jobs created as a result of Work Choices. Secondly, real wages - that is, the wages that you receive over and above inflation - have risen by 1.5 per cent, taking to 19.7 per cent the real wage rises that have occurred under this government, compared with the regression in real wages which occurred under the previous Labor government. The ABS has recorded industrial disputes at the lowest level ever recorded, indeed, since statistics began to be collected in 1913.In the face of all of this, the trade union movement of Australia is, not unnaturally, waging a ferocious campaign. It is spending an estimated $30 million on this campaign, no doubt encouraged by the 70 per cent of the opposition frontbench who are former trade union officials and no doubt encouraged by the member for Batman, the member for Hotham and the member for Throsby. They are shortly to be joined by the National Secretary of the AWU and in the Senate by Senator Doug Cameron - and so the list goes on. The member for Charlton made it clear on radio this morning that if Mr Combet replaced her then that would be another illustration of independent voices in the federal parliamentary Labor caucus disappearing.The union movement are angry about Work Choices not because they care about the working conditions of men and women in this country. The union bosses are worried about Work Choices because they want to re-establish union power over Australia's industrial relations system. Let me quote again, as I did last week, from an article written by Paul Kelly in the Australian, which was otherwise praiseworthy of the Leader of the Opposition. Mr Kelly had this to say:Rudd is embarked on one of the most audacious political scams in Australian history: seeking to resurrect trade union power and privileges by abolition of Australian Workplace Agreements, restoring union access to workplaces, saving the award system and entrenching collective union power in the name of work-life balance and family values.The union movement are against Work Choices because they want to reclaim their control of the industrial relations system in this country. It has nothing to do with the rights and the interests of working people in this country. Working families in Australia have never been better off. We have a 30-year low in unemployment. We have had a massive rise in real wages. We have had historically low industrial disputes. In other words, the individual worker is doing well under this government. What is not doing well under this government is the collective called union bosses, and that is why the union movement are hurling a $30 million campaign against the federal coalition government.</DOC>

 - I reject the analysis provided by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, and the reason I reject it is that the analysis failed to take into account other benefits that have flowed, particularly to families, particularly to women and particularly to young people, out of the new regime. It is very hard to put an economic benefit on the value of job-sharing for women. It is very hard to put an economic benefit on the value of shift-sharing for women. It is very hard to put an economic benefit on the value of bringing more long-term unemployed people into the workplace than ever before, and the Labor Party is constantly opposing initiatives that help those most vulnerable in the community. None of our initiatives has had a greater impact on those most vulnerable than our changes to the industrial relations regime. The reason why, as the OECD says, was that the punitive laws of the Labor Party most disadvantaged women and young people who had been out of work for long periods of time. - They do not like to hear it. They do not like to hear that real wages in the last 12 months have gone up more than under 13 years of Labor. They do not like to hear that 263,000 new jobs have been created in the last 12 months; nearly 90 per cent of those jobs are full time. They do not like to hear that the unemployment rate is 4.6 per cent, at near record lows. They do not like to hear that the level of industrial disputation in Australia today is at its lowest level since records were first kept in 1913. They do not like to hear that the workers are better off under our laws than they would be under the Labor Party.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Maranoa for his question. The first and obvious answer to the question is that small business people throughout regional Australia are delighted with the changes that we have made under our workplace policy reforms in terms of getting rid of the unfair dismissal laws that were introduced by the former Labor government in this country that were an absolute handbrake on employment opportunities for young people across regional Australia. I suspect that a lot of the 263,000 jobs that have been created in the economy over the last 12 months since Work Choices was introduced have come from the small business sector and small business in regional Australia.It goes without saying that the policies we have put in place over a number of years, the reforms we have made to the Australian economy in terms of making it more competitive and more efficient, have encouraged greater employment opportunities across the country, particularly in regional Australia. As the Prime Minister just indicated a while ago, we are experiencing the lowest level of unemployment in Australia in 30 years: 4.6 per cent unemployment in the Australian economy; real wages have grown by 17.9 per cent; and the lowest level of industrial disputes on record at a time when there is a coalition government in power in Canberra. The most graphic of all examples is the creation of new jobs in the economy since Work Choices began 12 months ago - 263,000 new jobs - and a lot of them have been generated in small business where we got rid of the burden of those unfair dismissal laws that were introduced by Laurie Brereton in the former Labor government.The member for Maranoa asked about regional Australia. In regional Australia job growth has continued in spite of the drought: 63 per cent of regional areas recorded a drop in unemployment in the past 12 months notwithstanding the effects of drought; 63 per cent increased employment in regional Australia; and 64 per cent of regional areas have an unemployment rate of less than five per cent compared to 16 per cent under the former Labor government. That is what is happening in regional Australia because there is more flexibility in the way people want to engage in the workplace, so there are more jobs in regional Australia and that means more security for working families in regional Australia.The Labor Party and the union movement are running a scare campaign on Work Choices and they are also running it around regional Australia. We have seen the orange signs up everywhere, and they are running it hard. The union movement is spending a fortune of their members' money to try and save their own necks, and many would comment that it is working.I will give a couple of examples of what regional Australians are saying about the policies in Work Choices. I have only to remind those opposite of the result in the seat of Murray-Darling - the old bastion of the Labor Party and the union movement in Broken Hill. For the first time in history at a state level, Murray-Darling is now represented by a member of the coalition and not a member of the Labor Party. John Williams, the Nationals candidate, has done a fantastic job in Broken Hill. He is from Broken Hill. He lives in Broken Hill.But there is more. If you go back, the same campaign was run in the Queensland election last year, and we won the seat of Bundaberg for the first time in a hundred years. In Victoria last year, when the same campaign was run, for the first time we won the seat of Morwell in the Latrobe Valley from the Labor Party. The Labor Party can make all the claims they like, but people in regional Australia know who is best placed to deliver strong economic growth and create job opportunities in regional Australia.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Stirling for his question. The long-term effect of the ageing of the population is that we are going to have a smaller proportion of people of working age supporting a larger proportion of people of retirement age, basically from now right out until 2040 and possibly beyond. Our first Intergenerational report showed that a gap would open up between spending requirements and tax of around five per cent of GDP - around $40 billion per year - as a consequence of that, meaning that either you would have to run a budget deficit of about $40 billion in 2003 dollars per annum or you would have to find another $40 billion per annum of tax revenue in order to cope with the ageing of the population.One of the things that this government announced in response to that was a scheme to start curtailing some of those payments which we know are coming down the track. That is why we established the Future Fund - so that we could begin provisioning now for one element of payment which will start hitting the Commonwealth account in 2020 and onwards. The Future Fund invests money that the government deposits into it, which is managed by guardians, and the capital and the earnings on that Future Fund begin to accumulate so that it can pay future liabilities at 2020 or earlier if we have properly provisioned for those liabilities. Let me make this clear: the more money you take out of the Future Fund, the weaker you will make it, because you lose not only the capital but also the earnings. The first raid on the Future Fund is always the easy one. The second is quite simple after you have done that the first time, and by the third you are really in business.The Labor Party used to complain that the Future Fund was not enough of a locked box and that it could be raided. The member for Lilley used to run around the country saying:We need a Future Fund which is a locked box, where the proceeds of asset sales are placed so they can't be raided by the National Party.That is what he said on 26 August 2005. We now know that the assets of the Future Fund are not going to be raided by the National Party but going to be raided by the Labor Party. Having announced the first raid of $2.7 billion, the Labor Party is now working up successive raids. When the member for Lilley was asked about this on 22 March, which I think was last Thursday, he said:Journalist: _ you and others say that you could use the Future Fund for 'productive purposes'? What does that mean?Swan: Basically hard infrastructure _He was asked the quite reasonable question today, 'What is hard infrastructure?' and his answer was this: 'I am not buying into that at the moment.' Let us think of things that are hard infrastructure. Roads are hard infrastructure. Rail is hard infrastructure. Ports are hard infrastructure. The environment is hard infrastructure for sure - irrigation canals. Building a hospital would be hard infrastructure. Hornets are hard infrastructure. Air warfare destroyers are hard infrastructure. If the principle is that anything that is hard infrastructure can be the subject of a raid on the Future Fund, basically you can raid the whole thing; you can take the whole income. And while you are at it, what is the principle that says you can raid the Future Fund for hard infrastructure but not human infrastructure? Human infrastructure may well be more important than hard infrastructure in the future.What we have seen here from the Leader of the Opposition - a proposal to raid the Future Fund and superannuation entitlements - is a policy that has not been taken by any state government or opposition. All the state governments, to one degree or another, are now funding superannuation liabilities. But not one single one of them has ever said that they would raid those liabilities for their election promises. The Leader of the Opposition ought to know this. He was a public servant in Queensland; Queensland has a fully funded superannuation system. They have fully funded their liabilities, and nobody - not Goss, not Borbidge, not Beattie, not Seeney, not Flegg - has ever said that they would raid that fund for their election promises. There is only one political party in Australia that is as irresponsible as that. It is the federal Labor Party, under this Leader of the Opposition. This is economic irresponsibility on a grand scale.</DOC>

 - If you believe the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, we are in a conspiracy to cover up what is in an AWA. The only problem for the Labor Party is that at the end of the year one million people will be engaged in that conspiracy with us, because there will be one million AWAs out there, and one in five Western Australians -  - By the end of the year, one in five workers in Western Australia will be on an AWA. Are you saying that they are part of that conspiracy of silence, or a conspiracy of cover-up? At the end of the year more than two million Australian workers would have signed up willingly to agreements under the new industrial relations regime. What the Labor Party fails to appreciate is that we are about trying to keep the economy prosperous. We are about trying to keep the economy strong. - What the Labor Party does not understand is that, in order to keep the economy strong, in order to keep the economy prosperous, governments have to make decisions that are in the national interest and not in the interests of the union bosses. Four out of five workers in Australia choose not to join the unions because the unions are more about the interests of the union bosses than they are about the workers. We are about the interests of the workers. The Australian Bureau of Statistics latest data figures have indicated that since the introduction of the new laws real wages have gone up 1.5 per cent. In the 13 years of Labor, real wages went backwards 1.8 per cent. The ABS statistics illustrate that since the laws were introduced the number of jobs created -  - The most authoritative figures come from the ABS, and the ABS figures indicate that, since the introduction of our new laws, wages are up 1.5 per cent, 263,000 jobs have been created in Australia - and nearly 90 per cent of those jobs are full time - and industrial disputation is at its lowest level since 1913. We all know that, when it comes to industrial disputation, because the Labor Party are beholden to the union bosses, they want to see more strikes in Australia, not fewer strikes.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Fisher for his question. I note that by the end of the year nearly two million Australian workers will have willingly signed agreements under the new workplace relations regime and nearly one million workers will be on Australian workplace agreements. These laws were introduced because it is important for the Australian economy to remain competitive with the rest of the world. Economic reform does help to deliver a stronger economy.Of course, the Labor Party and the union bosses were predicting Armageddon when these laws were to start, nearly a year ago. We remember the former Leader of the Opposition saying that there would be more divorce when these laws came into effect. I can reassure him that there is not more divorce in Australia. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition said that these laws would be bad for the economy. I can reassure the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that the economy has continued to have reasonably strong economic growth over the last 12 months.Sharan Burrow said, 'Children won't see their parents at Christmas.' I can reassure Sharan Burrow that parents did see their children and children saw their parents - and saw Santa Claus as well - at Christmas. Bill Ludwig from the AWU said, 'Our children will be going to school with bare feet because parents can't afford shoes.' I can assure Mr Ludwig that our children are going to school with shoes. Mr Speaker, it went on and on. There was none better than Bill Shorten, who said it would be 'a green light for mass sackings'.Bill Shorten is coming into this place to unfairly dismiss the member for Maribyrnong. And now we have Greg Combet, part of the Rudd-Gillard-Combet combo. Greg Combet wants to replace the poor old member for Charlton. Leave her alone! The member for Charlton worried about our unfair dismissal laws. The member for Charlton votes against our laws and then seeks to rely on them, because the Labor Party is the party for union bosses; it is not the party for workers. Seventy per cent of its frontbench are ex union officials, former ACTU heads like the member for Batman; the member for Hotham, right next to him; and the member for Throsby, who is here. And now we have Greg Combet wanting to come in, and Dougie Cameron up in the Senate - have I missed any? - Bill Shorten - I have had a strike - and Richard Marles in Corio. The member for Corio will be going for unfair dismissal as well, using our laws. The Labor Party is the party for union bosses and union officials. The coalition has the parties that go in to bat for the workers, better wages and real jobs.</DOC>

 - Because, with the introduction of AWAs and the changes made under our laws a year ago, no-one has shown me a formula that allows you to compare apples with apples. -  - I know this is beyond the thought process of the Labor Party, but, under the Labor Party's old rules, if you took the Labor Party -  - If you took the Labor Party's approach -  - I'd better go and stand over that side - put her through it! The fact of the matter is this: if you have an AWA, that trades off penalties for higher wages - and bear in mind that Greg Combet said that he regularly traded off penalty rates. So I ask the question: why is it okay for Greg Combet to negotiate a worker's penalty rates away, but it is not okay for the worker to negotiate on their penalty rates?That is where the Labor Party does not understand the aspirations of everyday Australian workers, those workers who want to be able to negotiate with an employer. Some of those workers will want to have job sharing and shift sharing. There is a whole raft of women in particular who want to go back to work but want to be able to work from home. They want to be in a position where they can have some flexibility in the workplace. The fact of the matter is that you can have a penalty provision but it might be the case that it is never accessed because an employer never lets an employee access the penalty rates. But there might be a bonus pool involved for the staff, at the end of the financial year. That bonus pool might have a value, and we do not know whether it is accessed or not. So the question is: how do you compare apples with apples? If the Labor Party thinks that the solution is to have a one-size-fits-all approach - which is the Labor Party's approach - to workplace relations that goes in to bat for the union bosses, we reject it and the workers of Australia reject it.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Moreton for his question. The Reserve Bank today published its six-monthly detailed assessment of the health of the financial system. It noted that in some countries around the world, particularly the United States, there has been a sharp pick-up in loan arrears in what is regarded as the subprime market. But its finding in relation to the Australian financial system is that it is in very good shape and very stable. To quote the Reserve Bank, it said:In the financial sector, both the banking and insurance sectors continue to record high rates of return on equity, benefiting from continued balance sheet expansion, low levels of non-performing loans and the strong performance of equity markets.The RBA noted that household finances remain very healthy in Australia, saying:... the household sector remains in good financial shape, which is not surprising given the ongoing strength in the economy.And it noted, of course, that one of the reasons why defaults on loans in Australia are so low by international standards is the very strong employment in this country, with unemployment now down at 4.6 per cent, around the lowest level in 30 years.It is important, however, that in these circumstances, where employment is strong, we take care to ensure that wages do not run away and that inflation pressures in the economy are not heightened. One of the problems in the past for Australia has always been that, in periods of strong economic growth, wages have become unsustainable - certainly that is what happened during the terms of trade boom for the Korean War. It is what happened in 1981, when the metalworkers went after wage demands which were unsustainable, and it was certainly a contributing factor - although not the principal one - to Paul Keating's recession that the Labor Party gave us in 1990.It is important that we make sure that terms of trade improvements do not result in unsustainable wages. One of the reasons why the government is having some success with this at the moment is the Work Choices policy. The Work Choices policy allows wage increases in highly profitable industries, such as the mining industry, without them being automatically translated back to less profitable industries, such as the manufacturing industry, which is facing competitive challenges at the moment. As former Reserve Bank Governor Ian Macfarlane said, as quoted in the Sydney Morning Herald on 25 August 2006:Obviously, it makes the job of monetary policy easier, the more deregulated the labour market is.I would urge the Labor Party to think about that statement. Any reversal of the current industrial relations system, at a time when the terms of trade are strong, risks wages in the general community being unsustainable; risks, therefore, inflation; and risks thereby a monetary policy response. Any move back to the award system or pattern bargaining, which would open up the opportunity of taking a wage settlement from a highly profitable area of the economy back through less profitable areas of the economy, risks unsustainable wages, risks increases in inflation, and thereby risks a monetary policy response - which is why Governor Macfarlane said, 'It makes the job of monetary policy easier, the more deregulated the labour market is.'We have had the populist attacks from the Labor Party - but we had populist attacks from the Labor Party when we balanced the budget, and we had populist attacks from the Labor Party when we paid off $96 billion of debt. We had populist attacks from the Labor Party when we introduced the GST, we had populist attacks from the Labor Party when we introduced an independent monetary policy, and we had populist attacks from the Labor Party when we reduced tariffs. We had populist attacks from the Labor Party when we set up the Future Fund, when they claimed that it was not enough of a locked box and could be raided by the National Party. But it was all of those decisions that got the economy to where it is today, and it is the decisions in relation to Work Choices which are important to get it to where it has to be tomorrow, and the decision makers in this country are the coalition.</DOC>

 - The Leader of the Opposition is telling a porky pie. I made this point: obviously our new regime is far more flexible than the previous regime. It takes into account far more significant factors, such as the fact that you can negotiate on a range of different provisions, as outlined under the Work Choices regime; but the Labor Party do not like that sort of flexibility for workers. They are opposed to flexibility, they are opposed to fairness and they are opposed because the Labor Party are fairly and squarely about the union bosses. It is not about the interests of the workers.While I am on my feet, I have come across a very interesting news report that has just come out. This AAP report says:A construction union has been fined $20,000 after workers were told they were obliged to become financial members of a union to keep their jobs at NSW sites.The Federal Court today also ordered the Construction Forestry Mining and Energy Union (CFMEU) to destroy all 'code of conduct' forms which told union delegates to 'ensure that all workers on site are financial members of the relevant union'.If this is what is happening when the Labor Party are in opposition, what would happen if the Labor Party, on a dark day, were to get into government? The CFMEU would not be worried about the law; they would be going in, in partnership with the Labor Party, to try to recruit members and to get more money for the Labor Party's scare campaign.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Boothby for his question and for his interest. The government welcomes the United Nations Security Council resolution on Iran, which was passed at the end of last week, and it was passed unanimously. The fact that the Security Council should pass a unanimous resolution in relation to Iran's nuclear program is very relevant. It draws attention to the fact that Iran has failed to comply with two earlier resolutions which did make mandatory the suspension of all Iran's uranium enrichment and its reprocessing facilities. I am pleased that this decision was unanimous, and it does impose a range of measures on Iran, including a legally binding embargo on the transfer of arms from Iran and limits on arms transfers to Iran. It also expands the list of individuals and entities which are subject to financial and travel measures. Australia will, consistent with the resolution, implement that resolution to ensure that Australia adheres to these international obligations.Having said all of that, it still remains open for Iran to cooperate fully with the United Nations Security Council and the broader international community. These measures are reversible, but they are reversible only in the event that Iran suspends its uranium enrichment plant. In my view, the problem for Iran is that, as time goes on, Iran is becoming increasingly isolated. This unanimous passage of a Security Council resolution demonstrates that point, but so does the fact that the Iranian military seized 15 British sailors in the Shatt al-Arab waterway in what the British have said - and the Americans have confirmed - was in Iraqi territory. They have taken those British sailors to Iran. I think it would be very wise for Iran to return those sailors as soon as possible to the British, because, by seizing those sailors, the Iranians are continuing to alienate not just the British and Britain's allies but also the broader international community.The Shatt al-Arab waterway, where these sailors were seized, is from time to time patrolled by Australian ships. An Australian ship, I think the HMAS Toowoomba, has recently been patrolling that waterway. I can only say that therefore we have a particular focus on what has happened to the British sailors, and it is important for Iran that it returns those sailors as quickly as possible.I say those things, in conclusion, before the Australian Defence Force parliamentary internship program and say how delighted I am to see people from our defence force here in question time today who are working with some of our MPs.</DOC>

 - I thank the Member for Hughes for her question, and I can inform her that vaccination against cervical cancer will start next week in South Australia and Tasmania and shortly thereafter in the other states. In the next four years the government will spend more than half a million dollars to vaccinate women against cervical cancer, using the vaccine developed by Australian of the Year Professor Ian Frazer. There will be an ongoing program for schoolgirls aged 12 and 13. There will be a catch-up program for older schoolgirls; there will also be a catch-up program for women aged up to 26, delivered through GPs, and that program will start in July.I want to say that the Howard government has an extremely good record on vaccination. The federal government's spending on vaccination has increased from just $13 million in 1996 to over $200 million in the last financial year. Rates of childhood vaccination have increased from just over 50 per cent, which were Third World levels, to 90 per cent today. I should also point out that the Howard government also has a very good record of protecting taxpayers. As well as preparing her censure motion, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition might like to be reminded that, if the government had accepted her advice on HPV vaccine, taxpayers would have been worse off to the tune of some $90 million. Health spending is important, but so is protecting the economy that pays for it. The Howard government is the best friend that Medicare has ever had because we have run an economy that can afford it. I say to members opposite that if they want to see health services they have to have a good economy, and you cannot run a good economy by surrendering to the ACTU.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker -  -  - The premise of the deputy leader's question is wrong. There was no requirement; there was a condition that it be offered. There is a difference. I would say to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and all those who sit opposite: what happened in respect of university funding was that we overcame a longstanding practice of the academic unions which had required universities to conform to a particular approach. What we said as a condition of funding was that one of the options should be AWAs.Let me emphasise that the conditions that apply in relation to the employment of nurses in our view is quite different and that is why we have absolutely no intention of introducing any conditions, either of the type contemplated in the question that I answered a few moments ago or indeed of the type that were introduced in relation to academics. We have no intention of doing that in relation to nurses. - I happen to take the view that nurses in this country, given their responsibilities and the onerous work they carry out, are grossly underpaid. I happen to think that state governments should be a lot more generous with the nurses of this country, and I would give some advice to the re-elected Premier of New South Wales: you ought to pay nurses more generously.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Wakefield for his question and his very strong support of small businesses in his electorate. I can tell him, and all members in the House, that Work Choices has cut red tape and has delivered the flexibility to enable small business to grow and to employ more people. One year on, Work Choices is still about job creation. It is about low levels of unemployment. It is about continued growth of real wages. Most importantly, it has been about getting rid of unfair dismissal and allowing small business to have the confidence to employ more people. I am talking about small business people like Mr Phil Connelly, a small business man from the Gold Coast. He has said: 'Following the inception of Work Choices, I have employed six additional staff members. Staff are enjoying the flexibility of AWAs, which includes a number of financial incentives.' - I repeat: this includes a number of financial incentives for hard work that cannot be offered under a traditional wage structure.I am asked if there are any threats to this. I have to tell the House that there are very real threats because in 33 days time the national conference of the ALP will be held. That will decide their small business policy. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition and the member for Rankin have been wandering around the country making vague statements and pretending that they are listening to small business, when in fact we know that the only people they are listening to are Greg Combet and his mates - and he is on record as saying that there should be no exemptions to unfair dismissal.I notice that, once again, the Leader of the Opposition has turned his back to us in question time. That means that he is actually turning his back on small business at the moment. Mr Speaker, through you, I ask the Leader of the Opposition: do you have the courage to face small business? - I will repeat my question: does the Leader of the Opposition have the courage to face small business and ask small business if they want unfair dismissals reinstated? I think not.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Melbourne for his question. Let me go through it, and I will start with broadband. I think everybody believes that we should have high-speed broadband in this country. The debate is not about whether we should have broadband; the debate is about how broadband should be provided and by whom, and what investments and assets are used to provide it. The point of departure between the government and the opposition is that we believe that broadband, where it can be provided by the private sector, should be provided by the private sector. We do not believe that taxpayers' money should be used to subsidise the provision of something that in the normal market operations would be provided by the private sector.We certainly do not believe that there should be investments of taxpayers' money in something that would, in the normal way, be provided by the private sector. We certainly do not believe that the Future Fund should be raided in order to fund something that should be provided by the private sector. The Future Fund is a provision for our future, as its name implies. What it is designed to do is to assist in meeting the great demographic challenge that this country has through the ageing of her population.No matter how much the member for Melbourne may plead with me, the Treasurer or the Minister for Finance to stop talking about it, we are going to continue to talk about it because we think that there is quite an important principle at stake. That principle is that if you are making provision for future generations you should not diminish that provision in order to satisfy today's consumption. That is the principle that is involved. What is being proposed by the Australian Labor Party is precisely that. You either have a locked box comprising the Future Fund or you do not. I can assure the House that while ever the coalition remains responsible for these matters, the Future Fund will be used for the very purpose for which it was established.So far as payments into the Future Fund and estimates of when particular targets will be reached are concerned, I am not confirming anything. I simply remind the member for Melbourne that when we established a Future Fund the complaint of his side of politics was that it had not been quarantined enough. And at the first temptation, the Labor Party gives in. As the Treasurer rightly said last Thursday, the first burglary is always the hardest. Once you have robbed the Future Fund once, you will do it again and again. The whole idea that this nation would have the discipline and the self-restraint to put aside some money for the liabilities of our children and grandchildren is a concept that I believe most Australians support and think makes a lot of sense.We are living in very prosperous times at the moment. A lot of commentators are saying, 'Why don't we use that prosperity to build for tomorrow?' One of the best ways of using that prosperity to build for tomorrow is to set aside today's surpluses to meet tomorrow's liabilities. That is what the Future Fund is about. We can do that and we can also have broadband. We should not have broadband at the expense of the future of our children. That is what the opposition is advocating, and that is why we are opposed. We are not opposed to broadband; we are as much in favour of broadband as the opposition. What we are opposed to is the methodology that they are employing. We are especially opposed to the idea that taxpayers should fund something that in the normal course would be provided by the private sector.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and note his deep commitment to environmental matters, particularly in his electorate. The Australian government is working closely with industry and with the community on practical programs that will ensure that Australia continues to lead in its climate change strategy.The Australian Greenhouse Office is the oldest institution of its kind in the world. One of its key programs is the Greenhouse Friendly program, which encourages companies to invest in greenhouse emission reduction projects and provides businesses with the opportunity to offer carbon neutral products. Indeed, as part of the $31.6 million Greenhouse Challenge Plus program, over 750 members, all Australian businesses, are projected to achieve 15 million tonnes of greenhouse gas emission reductions by 2010. That is a reduction of about three per cent of our total greenhouse gas emissions from that one effort alone. In the last month, we have seen three very innovative programs which have had the close involvement of Greenhouse Friendly. The first was from V8 Supercars, which are going to offset all of the emissions from their races this year through carbon offsets from planting trees. They are working very closely with the Greenhouse Office to accredit their whole operation - not just the emissions from the cars but the whole operation - as a Greenhouse Friendly project.Then a week or so ago Virgin Blue announced that it was going to be the first Australian airline to offer carbon neutral flights. Customers will be able to tick a box, pay a little more for each flight and, by buying a carbon offset - which will be certified by the Greenhouse Friendly program - offset the carbon emissions from their flights. Then today I announced that CO Australia, an Australian forestry company, will be the first forest carbon sink abatement project to be accredited by the Greenhouse Friendly program. Businesses will be able to invest in CO Australia's tree planting to offset their greenhouse gas emissions. These are practical measures. We are working with Australian business. This is indicative - typical - of the approach of this government, which is ensuring that Australia will be one of the very few developed countries that is able to meet its Kyoto target without buying in hot air credits from Eastern Europe or clean development mechanism credits from other parts of the world. We will do it through our own efforts.That stands in stark contrast to the attitude of the Labor Party. The member for Kingsford Smith earlier this year famously said, 'The automatic expansion of the coal industry, such as we have seen in the past, is a thing of the past.' A few years before that - he has been quite consistent in this area - he said to the National Press Club, 'Our reliance on coal for energy and exports puts the Australian economy at risk.' Think of that: our reliance on coal for energy and exports - it is only our biggest export! - puts the Australian economy at risk. So our economy is put at risk by our best export - that is the view of the opposition; that is what the Labor Party has in mind for the coal industry of Australia and for the jobs of Australians. So outrageous were the member for Kingsford Smith's statements that even the New South Wales Premier, Mr Iemma, had to abandon him, reminding him that in our fight to save the planet we have to be sure that we do not destroy our country.The Australian government is committed, and has been committed for many years, to dealing with the challenge of climate change. We are dealing with it with practical, workable measures that have results. We are dealing with it with substance, not symbols; practical measures, not ideology; protecting jobs, not sacrificing them for a political agenda.</DOC>

 - I would like to thank the member for Blair and note that since 1996 in his electorate the number of apprentices has gone from 710 to 2,190. That is an increase of more than 200 per cent in the number of apprentices in his electorate. The member for Blair has worked very hard with the six Australian apprenticeship centres in his electorate, along with all the other initiatives the Howard government plan to increase the participation in his electorate in technical and vocational education. It is all part of the Howard government plan to tackle labour and skills shortages in this country, and it is a plan that is working. Today, 72 per cent more apprentice carpenters exist than did in 1996. Today, four times as many bricklayers started apprenticeships this year than in 1996.What is the plan of those opposite? We are now one-third of the way through this year, on the way to a very important election, with an issue of fundamental importance to the future of the country, and all we have heard from those opposite so far is one lonely policy - that is, to hand the 25 Australian technical colleges over to the states and the unions. Mr Speaker, you know what will happen if the unions get a hold of these colleges. We all know what will happen. The links with industry, which are so important to these colleges, will be severed. They will choke off all the traditional trades, as they have done in the past. We will see a return to the lost generation of Australian trades men and women and a further betrayal of future generations.</DOC>

 - I stand by what I said yesterday and indeed the day before and the day before that. Let me remind the House, and in particular the Leader of the Opposition, as we mark the first anniversary of the introduction of Work Choices, that that historic economic reform has contributed to the strengthening of the Australian economy. The reason the government introduced Work Choices was to lay the foundation for a further period of economic growth and expansion.It is true that there are other voices and other views about Work Choices, but those are the voices and views essentially of the organised trade union movement of this country, which seeks not so much to advance the welfare of Australian workers but rather to reimpose union control over the industrial relations system of this country. This debate is not about the rights and interests of Australian workers, because those rights and interests have been promoted by Work Choices.I remind the Leader of the Opposition that a very successful Labour leader, Tony Blair, once said, 'Fairness in the workplace starts with the chance of a job.' Measured by that, fairness is at a 32-year high in Australia; so I would say to the Leader of the Opposition, as we mark one year after the introduction of Work Choices, that if you apply the test of fairness embraced by Tony Blair then you will acknowledge that this country is fairer and better as a result of the introduction of Work Choices.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Gilmore for her question. Members will be aware that earlier today the arraignment in the new military commission trial of David Hicks took place. As members will also be aware, David Hicks pleaded guilty to the overall charge of providing material support for terrorism. In particular, he pleaded guilty to specification 1 of the charge. The specification of the charge to which David Hicks has pleaded guilty as outlined in the charge sheet was:... a person subject to trial by military commission as an alien unlawful enemy combatant, did, in or around Afghanistan, from in or about December 2000 through in or about December 2001, intentionally provide material support or resources to an international terrorist organization engaged in hostilities against the United States, namely al Qaeda, which the accused knew to be ... an organisation that engaged ... in terrorism ...That is the charge to which Mr Hicks specifically pleaded guilty. I am informed that he pleaded not guilty to the second specification of the charge.The government remains concerned at the length of time that has passed before reaching this point; however, the government does welcome the progress towards resolution of Hicks's case. It has always been our view that Hicks should face justice, but we have been very concerned about the time that it has taken. I understand that the military commission judge has requested that the parties file an agreed stipulation of facts on 27 March, United States time. The full military commission will then consider the guilty plea, the stipulation of facts and a statement from David Hicks before determining a sentence.I note that, should the military commission impose a custodial sentence, Australia and the United States have an arrangement in place under which Mr Hicks can apply to serve the remainder of any sentence imposed in Australia, subject to the agreement of all parties. The timing and details therefore of any arrangements for Mr David Hicks's return to Australia are not clear. Given that the military commission has yet to finalise proceedings, I do not propose to make any further comment.</DOC>

 - I am prepared to have a bit of a punt. I bet the blacked out section says that Work Choices has been good for the economy. I am prepared to say that there are more jobs, higher wages and fewer industrial disputes. The Labor Party, on the first anniversary of Work Choices -  - The Labor Party, on the first anniversary of Work Choices, is asking about a document from 2005, before the introduction of the laws. What does that say about the Labor Party? It says that it does not want to deal with the issues relating to workplace relations. Workplace relations, over the last 12 months, has been one of the foundations upon which has been built a stronger economy for today's jobs and tomorrow's jobs. In the last 12 months, 263,000 new jobs have been created in Australia - 90 per cent of those jobs full-time.The unemployment rate is at 4.6 per cent. The Labor Party believed that the rate of full employment could have been around six per cent, seven per cent, eight per cent or maybe nine per cent. The unemployment rate today is 4.6 per cent. Isn't that good for the workers? Isn't that good for Australian families? Even better, strike action today is at its lowest level since records were first kept, in 1913, and that is good for the workers as well.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Bass for his question. It is an undeniable fact that the strength of the Australian economy in 2007 is a direct result of 20 years of economic reform - indeed, perhaps a generation of economic reform. The real essence of the debate about Work Choices that is going on in this chamber and around the nation is whether, for the first time, this nation is going to be so unwise as to reverse one of the great economic reforms of the last generation, which has given us the prosperity we now have.It would be unthinkable for anybody to propose to re-regulate the exchange rate, to reimpose foreign exchange controls and to go back to the old days of a regulated financial system. It would, I think, be unimaginable that we would seek to reimpose tariffs as a method of protecting Australian industry. It would be unimaginable that we would go back to the pre-1998 days in relation to the Australian waterfront, when the crane rates were 17 or 18 an hour. They are now 27 or 28.It would surely be unimaginable if we were to reverse the new taxation system to bring back the wholesale sales tax, to overturn the introduction of the GST or to turn our backs on all the hard-won reforms that existed there. It would be unimaginable that this country should go back into deficit, that we should accumulate $96 billion of government debt. It would surely be unimaginable - and even the Australian Labor Party has indicated that it would be unimaginable - that we should seek to renationalise former government owned enterprises such as Telstra, Qantas and the Commonwealth Bank.Therefore, that recitation, that statement of the obvious, makes a very clear and compelling point: that what the Labor Party is proposing to do in relation to Work Choices is to reverse a generation of economic reform that has been contributed to by both sides of politics in Australia. -  - Yes, it has been contributed to by both sides of politics. There is, however, a caveat to be placed on that observation, and that is that the Liberal and National parties, when in opposition, supported those reforms of the former government that were beneficial to the Australian economy, whereas those reforms of this government which have been beneficial to the Australian economy - such as taxation reform, waterfront reform, getting the budget back into balance and paying off $96 billion of government debt - have all been trenchantly opposed by the opportunistic members of the Australian Labor Party who sit opposite.What Labor want to do is to turn back the clock. What Labor want to do is, for the first time in the modern era of economic management in this country, reverse a major economic reform. What they are proposing to do - driven by their real masters, the bosses of the ACTU - is akin to reregulating the financial system, ending the floating of the Australian dollar, dismantling taxation reform and going back to the bad old days of the waterfront. They are not only talking about rolling back Work Choices; they are also talking about rolling back the reforms that were introduced in 1996, because what we have heard from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is a description of an industrial relations system which takes us back beyond the reforms of 1996. Why is this occurring? This is not occurring in the name of helping the working men and women of Australia; this is occurring in the name of reimposing union domination over the industrial relations system.As I look along the Labor Party frontbench - no disrespect to them as individuals - 70 per cent of them are former trade union officials. They are going to be joined, of course, after the next election by an honour roll of the brothers and sisters. - You have Bill Shorten. You have Doug Cameron. You have Richard Marles. You have Mark Butler. And I reckon, after the equivocal things he has said in the past few days, you have Greg Combet. If I were the member for Charlton, I would be pretty concerned that Greg was after my seat. But this is not about the rights of workers; this is about the power of union bosses. That is what this is about. It has nothing to do with the rights of workers. If they had concern for the rights of workers -  - they would not be adopting the policy they have. The last thing I want to say is this: I saw in a newspaper this morning from a very respected columnist a suggestion that the Leader of the Opposition was going to do a Blair at the ALP national conference. Can I say to the Leader of the Opposition that the defining moment in the march of Tony Blair to respectability as leader of the British Labour Party was when he told the Trade Union Congress in that country that, if he won office, he would retain the industrial relations reforms of the Thatcher government.</DOC>

 - I obviously have not seen that document. I am happy if the Deputy Leader of the Opposition wants to give me a copy of it. It is a Treasury document. I am familiar with other documents relating to economic management, such as the OECD report that said that the prescriptive, job-destroying policies of the Labor Party, such as the reintroduction of the unfair dismissal laws, are bad for workers and that the people who are most disadvantaged by prescriptive labour laws are in fact women and young people, particularly those who have been out of the workforce for a long time.I am also familiar with the most recent testimony of the Governor of the Reserve Bank who said that it was a threat to heavily reregulate the labour market because it could put upward pressure on inflation and therefore upward pressure on interest rates. And I am very familiar with the economic data that indicates that everything we have done in industrial relations over the last few years is helping to deliver more jobs and better pay.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Cowper for his question. The member for Cowper, since being elected to this place, has taken a great deal of interest in how to improve the circumstances of the unemployed in his electorate. The unemployment level in Cowper under Labor got up to 17.8 per cent. It was just outrageous in that part of the mid North Coast. But since then, under the policies of the coalition government, it has come down to 7.9 per cent.The member for Cowper is working very hard to get it even lower with creative ways to find people opportunities in the workplace. One of those - and it was very strongly supported by the member for Cowper - was our Work Choices policy, particularly getting rid of the unfair dismissal laws that Laurie Brereton introduced back in the nineties. If there is anything that has assisted the small businesses and the people that work in those small businesses in the seat of Cowper, it is getting rid of those unfair dismissal laws and the burden that they placed on small businesses in that electorate.The record shows that, since Work Choices was introduced, there are 263,000 new jobs in the economy, many of those in the small business sector. We now see unemployment at a 30-year low, and wages growth has reached a level of 19.8 per cent. Most importantly, we have witnessed the lowest levels of industrial disputes on record during the term of the coalition government. Our policies have certainly unshackled regional economies to do what they do best: generate economic growth and wealth in their areas and therefore generate employment opportunities for young people in regional Australia. It is critically important that we do not go backwards on this reform agenda, that we continue to go forwards.The Prime Minister mentioned a while ago the battle that we had to have, particularly with the union movement and the Labor Party, to reform the waterfront. They told us you could not achieve anything better than 16.9 crane lifts per hour. They said, 'This is world's best practice and we're doing it in Australia.' Since those reforms have been introduced, they are now doing 27 lifts an hour. It is the single most important reform and has made us much more competitive in the international marketplace as far as our exporters are concerned.When those reforms were introduced - and you can look around the ranks of the Labor Party on the other side of this place - we remember that the President of the ACTU who opposed those was the member for Throsby -  - and she happily acknowledges that they opposed them every inch of the way. There was a battle but it was a battle that we believed we had to win to ensure the efficiency of Australia and the competitiveness of our export industries and to generate jobs for the future. We do not have to go too far back into history to find a bit more form sitting on the front benches of the Labor Party. Regional Australians, particularly the beef producers in regional Australia, all remember the Mudginberri dispute back in the 1980s. It cost the beef industry millions of dollars. Who was the head of the ACTU then? None other than the member for Hotham. We well remember that battle in the Mudginberri dispute. It gives you an indication of the roots of the policy of the Labor Party. We know that the Leader of the Opposition is no great mate of Bill Ludwig's, but I am sure that the tentacles reach in there somewhere. There is one more example we need to give. When the member for Batman left the presidency of the ACTU in 1996 there were 928,000 days of work lost per annum in the Australian economy. That was the rate of industrial disputes in 1996. Today it is down to 132,000. When the member for Batman was last the President of the ACTU it was 928,000.With the advent of more representation coming into the Labor Party from the ACTU and the union movement, we know in which direction industrial relations policy is going to go. It is not going to go in the direction of assisting small businesses in the electorate of Cowper to put on more people and generate economic growth. If the voters in Australia want to support job creators, they need to support the coalition government.</DOC>

 - We have no plans for further change to the laws. -  - I am prepared to rule it out; that is right - absolutely. The reason is this: this is where the Labor Party -  - have got it so wrong. They predicted when these laws were started that there were going to be mass sackings, that children would not see their parents on Christmas Day and that parents would not be able to afford to buy their children shoes to go to school in. They predicted Armageddon, the end of the world, when these laws were to start a year ago. The reason it did not happen is that our laws were part of the evolution of the modern workplace. Our laws were about responding to the demands of the workers, who wanted flexibility in the workplace, who wanted to be able to engage in job sharing and shift sharing and who wanted to be able to work from home. - Women wanted to be able to use the internet and the phone at home to undertake some part-time paid work and yet receive appropriate remuneration at the same time. The reason our laws did not bring about a workplace revolution was that they were simply responding to the modern workplace.At the next election it is the Labor Party promising a workplace revolution. They are the ones going to the electorate to say that they want to go back to the days when the union officials were beating down the doors of every workplace. Only this morning I went to a business in Queanbeyan where a worker, Greg, said explicitly that the fear of the workers is that the unions will come back into the workplace. He said that they were able to negotiate an agreement that was fair to all without the unions being directly involved. - We are about the interests of the workers; the Labor Party is about the interests of the union bosses.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Deakin for his question. Under the Charter of Budget Honesty Act the government is required to produce an intergenerational report every five years to benchmark the intergenerational equity and the way in which our country is preparing for the great challenge of the ageing of the population. The first report was released in 2002 and the next one, the five-yearly update, will be released next week.We have made some progress since the first Intergenerational report was released, particularly in the area of retiring Labor debt and establishing the Future Fund to meet unfunded superannuation liabilities. The OECD, in its annual survey of Australia, lauded the establishment of the Future Fund, saying:The Australian government has established the 'Future Fund' to build up assets to pay for future pension liabilities ... The Future Fund is explicitly quarantined from other possible medium-term objectives. This is laudable, especially in the light of cross-country evidence which shows that attempts to pre-fund public pension liabilities by accumulation in social security systems have, without a high degree of explicit separation, often been thwarted by increases in general government expenditure.So the OECD was saying that it is very important to quarantine the funding of future liabilities from other spending, because other spending can completely undermine the objective that you have in funding those pension liabilities. It is making the point that if you set up one of these funds, the moment you start raiding it for other expenditures is the moment you undermine the whole improvement that it is designed to have.I was very interested to see more support for the independence of the Future Fund in today's Australian at page 23, in an article by Joseph Kerr under the headline 'Tanner promises to run a tighter ship'. Mr Tanner made lots of promises in this article, but get a load of this one. This is what the Australian records this morning:The Future Fund needed to be more independent of government, as the governance arrangements currently allowed for too much government interference.So here is a party that has announced it is going to -  - They asked the question a week ago, he said. What, they asked the question before you decided on the raid? Was that the point? So, a week ago - he said they asked the question a week ago - the Future Fund had to be more independent, but that was a couple of days before he decided on a $2.7 billion raid. - Here is a political party that has decided for political reasons to raid the Future Fund for $2.7 billion whilst it is demanding that governments not be allowed to engage in political interference. Here is the safecracker demanding that banks up their security. He is out there raiding the Future Fund and demanding that it not be allowed to be raided by people like him. He was right a week ago - he was absolutely right a week ago - and he is wrong now. Let me make the point: the first burglary is the hard one. Once you have done it once, you can do it twice; you can do it three times; you can do it four times.The other thing that Mr Tanner promised in this article is that he is going to run a tighter ship than Peter Costello. The article says:Labor wants business to believe a Rudd government would run a tighter ship than Peter Costello - and the evidence for that is a $2.7 billion raid on the Future Fund. That is a much tighter ship! How about this for the tighter ship? The Gold Coast Weekend Bulletin records that Eddy Sarroff, a Gold Coast councillor, has been asked by opposition leader Kevin Rudd to be the Labor candidate in McPherson. Councillor Sarroff said he agreed to run on the Labor ticket only after Mr Rudd promised a $2 billion infrastructure upgrade for the Gold Coast. Two billion for one seat! They saw Eddy and they said to Eddy, 'Who wants to be a millionaire?' and Eddy said, 'No thanks; I'll be a double billionaire.'We have Eddy Sarroff - $2 billion for the seat of the Gold Coast. We have Eric Ripper out there today. He says he has his own infrastructure promise from the Leader of the Opposition, for Western Australia. We have the $2.7 billion raid on the Future Fund. And all of this is designed to show that Labor can run a tighter ship than the coalition! If you would believe that, you would be like Eddy Sarroff. You would believe that there is $2 billion coming to buy his seat in the Gold Coast.The member for Lilley sat down. He was just about to intervene, no doubt. I figure that 150 seats at $2 billion a pop is $300 billion that the Leader of the Opposition is out for, which of course is more than all of the Commonwealth revenue collected in one year. Let me say that this Leader of the Opposition gets played as a patsy. Any time someone wants money, they are down asking for it. He cannot say no. He cannot stand up to a state premier. He cannot even stand up to Eddy Sarroff.</DOC>

 - Let me assure the member for Lilley of one thing: my attacks on his raids on the Future Fund are going to go on every single day until the next election. If the Labor Party were not worried about attacks on their policy to raid the Future Fund, they would not be demanding that they stop. I have never heard the Labor Party actually demand that we do something which they believed to be in their interest. The reason why the Labor Party are sensitive on this issue is: not only do they know it is wrong; they also know that if a private sector employer tried to raid the superannuation funds of their employees it would be illegal. The last time this was tried it was done by a bloke called Robert Maxwell, the newspaper owner, in the UK. Robert Maxwell had a great plan to raid -  - Was he in the ALP? Yes, I think he was in the ALP. The member for Grayndler asked me whether he was in the ALP. I think he was, from memory, but I will go back and have a look at that. I must thank the member for Grayndler. He always thinks up my best lines for me. It is quite possible that the whips sent this dorothy dixer around to the member for Lilley by mistake.The member for Lilley has been out there, day after day, demanding that the Future Fund be a locked box so that it cannot be raided. He is on the record, day after day, saying that. We have now got the member for Melbourne on the record, as late as today, saying that it has to be independent from political interference. His defence is that he gave that answer a week ago. If this opposition believed that this was such a great investment for the Future Fund, presumably they would believe that the guardians would see that for themselves. But no. They have stepped in themselves, they have done no financial due diligence, they have overridden the independence, they have raided the fund, they have said that this is not a loan, they have said that this can be done subsequently, and they have said that they reserve the right to do it over and over again.Let me make this point: in relation to the inner cities and the suburbs where broadband is commercial, we now have at least two consortiums - Telstra and the G9 - that want to build it because they think they can make a profit out of it. Nearly 50 per cent of the population can access even higher speeds of 12 to 20 megabits per second from ADSL2. Where it is not commercial for a private sector operator to do it is out in rural and remote Australia. The government has anticipated that and has set aside a communications fund of $2 billion to look after rural and remote Australia. The Labor Party wants to use taxpayers' funds in an area where the private sector can make a profit out of it and take away taxpayers' funds from the area where the private sector cannot make a profit out of it - out in rural and regional Australia. This is why I say that you cannot trust the Labor Party with money. - Who said, 'Yes, you can'? Murphy's Law! Everything that can be said that's silly will be silly at the most inopportune time. Yes, you can trust the Labor Party with money - Murphy's Law. The telecommunications operators would have seen the Leader of the Opposition coming. They have said to him, in relation to proposals they already have on the books, 'Raid the Future Fund and give us the money.' Eddy saw him coming; Eric Ripper saw him coming. You cannot have somebody who is a patsy for state premiers and commercial interests running Australia's economy.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Tangney for his question. Members of the House will know that recently the government passed the Trade Practices Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2006, commonly known as the Dawson bill, which delivered an easier notification system for collective bargaining for small business, increased powers for the ACCC to search premises and higher penalties for contraventions of the act.In relation to the collective bargaining regime, to be eligible the annual value of a transaction must not exceed $3 million. That is the general case. But, from today, I announce that small businesses in selected industries who have annual transactions greater than $3 million will still be able to take advantage of those collective bargaining provisions. In particular, in petrol retailing the transactional limit to take advantage of those collective bargaining provisions will be $15 million; in motor vehicle retailing it will be $20 million; in farm machinery it will be $10 million; and in primary production, generally speaking, it will be $5 million. That provides a very generous threshold in those particular industries to take advantage of the collective bargaining provisions, and it is a very direct benefit to small business.I want to thank and congratulate the Minister for Small Business and Tourism for the work that she did in getting this legislation through. The Labor Party opposed this legislation. We had to fight for it in the Senate. We have now enacted it; we have now brought in regulations which will allow better thresholds. This will be of benefit to small business, and I want to thank members of the House for their support for that legislation.</DOC>

 - There is one way that the nurses could receive a pay rise tomorrow - that is, if the Leader of the Opposition picked up the phone to the premiers and asked his mates to give the nurses a pay rise. The nurses are employed by the state Labor governments in state hospitals. I make this observation. If the Labor Party really care about nurses, if the Labor Party really care about teachers - and they employ, through the state governments, those nurses and those teachers - I urge them to do the right thing and pay those hard workers more money.</DOC>

 - I certainly can, and I thank the member -  - She's annoying, isn't she! - She's something else, isn't she! I thank the member for Lindsay for her question. It was a good question I thought. I note that, since the introduction of Work Choices a year ago, the number of average hours Australians are working has come down by half an hour overall per week. I also recognise that wages have gone up by 1.5 per cent in real terms. I also note that 263,000 new jobs have been created. Nearly 90 per cent of those are full-time jobs and over 109,000 of those are for women, which is a great story. I also note that the level of industrial disputation is at its lowest point since records were first kept in 1913.One of the great stories about the introduction of the laws a year ago is that it has encouraged employers who previously employed people as casuals to bring them onto AWAs and to give them some permanency in their workplace. The reason why they have been able to do that is that the AWA is a flexible instrument. - I note today the decision by the Leader of the Opposition to stage a bit of a stunt at the national conference. 'Rudd set for brawl with Left'. This happens regularly, doesn't it? Am I missing something? This happens regularly. It is like that great scene out of Casablanca, where Captain Renault said at the end, 'Roll up the usual suspects.' Well, at every national conference the leader of the Labor Party rolls up the left - rolls over the top of them at a pretend, staged event - and says, 'We're strong, and we're going to stand up to the union bosses.' How extraordinary it is that the Labor Party has always been opposed to casualisation of the workforce and, at a time when we are moving people from casual labour into permanent part-time or full-time work, the Labor Party wants to wind back to the casualisation of the workforce. The Financial Review said today:Given the concern expressed by the labour movement over the past two decades about 'casualisation' of the workplace, you would think the unions and the Labor Party would be celebrating the record level of full-time jobs being created. Not a bit of it. Unions are running a desperate campaign of misinformation to shore up their power, and Labor is in lock-step,Absolutely. The Labor Party is about the union bosses - the union bosses outside and the union bosses within the parliament. Only today I heard the Prime Minister on Radio National. Who did the Labor Party put up to be the spokesman on industrial relations for the Labor Party? It was not the Leader of the Opposition or the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. Greg Combet was there to debate the Prime Minister on industrial relations. I then went onto Jon Faine's program, in Melbourne. I was being interviewed and they said, 'We have a spokesman for the other side.' I asked: 'Who's that? Julia Gillard? Kevin Rudd?' The answer was, 'No, Greg Combet is the spokesman.'So the Rudd-Gillard-Combet combo comes into play, which says that the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition do not control their own policy - Greg Combet does. That is why he wants to knock off the poor old member for Charlton. Stay here, don't leave your seat! Greg Combet wants to knock off the member for Charlton. A union boss knocks off the poor old member for Corio. A union boss knocks off the poor old member for Maribyrnong. You have the union boss in Hotham, You have the union boss in Batman. Do not forget the union boss in Throsby; we cannot forget her! Dougie Cameron and all of them are coming in because they want to get rid of the monkeys. Just bring the organ grinder in. He is out there playing the tune on radio. He is debating us on industrial relations. Forget the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. Just bring the organ grinder in.</DOC>

 - I thank the Deputy Leader of the Opposition for the compliment. I would like to see more of you, too, Julia - I really would. I have not seen the comments from Mark Wooden. But I note that obviously one of the great success stories of the government is the massive infusion of long-term unemployed into the market. In particular, over the last few months we have seen a number of people who have remained out of the workforce coming into the workforce for the first time, sometimes after an absence of a decade or more. Those people are obviously low in skills. As they come in, they have low productivity. The more time that they spend in the workplace, the better their productivity will become.On 1 July this year, through our Welfare to Work initiatives, we are going to create a work obligation for 233,000 people who are currently on a single or partnered parent pension so that they come into the market for the first time. That is because Australia is short of labour and we need to increase the number of people working to address some of the demographic challenges that Australia is facing today and into the future. This is very important. In 2007, Australia needs people to work if they have the capacity to work. And it is not some ideological drive from the government; it is a fact from an economic perspective. In 2007, if you have the capacity to work, we need you to work. - As the participation rate increases and as low-skilled people come into the workplace for the first time in many years, that is going to have a downward impact on productivity numbers. That is a fact. The second fact is that the drought has had an impact on productivity over the last 12 months. That is beyond doubt as well. When you make significant economic change, you do it as the foundation for future growth - future growth in jobs and wages - based on productivity improvements. This will bring better wages for workers, fairer jobs for workers and job security for workers as well.</DOC>

 - First, I thank the honourable member for Moore for his interest in the issue of Zimbabwe. I know he joins with me and the government generally in expressing our horror at what has been happening in Zimbabwe. I have used some statistics during the last week or so to do with Zimbabwe. Honourable members might also like to know that in southern Africa the average GDP growth is around 5½ per cent, which honourable members would agree is not too bad. But in Zimbabwe, GDP declined by 7.1 per cent. That puts Zimbabwe and the administration of President Mugabe into some perspective. In the year 2000, Zimbabwe was a net exporter of food. Today, 3.2 million Zimbabweans - and the population is about 10 million or 11 million - are fed by the World Food Program, by the United Nations and by the international community. Zimbabwe has the highest proportion of HIV-AIDS victims anywhere in the world without access to treatment. It also has the highest orphan population per capita in the world. Out of around 11 million people, there are 1.3 million orphans. Those sorts of statistics explain the full horror of Zimbabwe.We as a government feel very strongly about this. We feel that we have to do everything that we reasonably can to help the ordinary people of Zimbabwe. In the last year, we have increased our aid budget to Zimbabwe by 33 per cent. Obviously, we are focusing on ordinary people. We are not providing any assistance which the leadership of Zimbabwe could go anywhere near. We provided assistance through non-government organisations, through the World Food Program, through UNICEF and through the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations. We have been helping with food, shelter, water and sanitation. We have also been helping in the area of HIV-AIDS. Just last week, I approved an $82,000 grant to a Zimbabwean non-government organisation to support their work in assisting victims of political violence. I will not name the organisation, because that will leave it vulnerable to Mugabe's thugs. We are determined to help non-government organisations and civil society meet the challenge of the Mugabe government.We are moving to establish an Australian Fund for Zimbabwe in the next financial year. Under this Australian Fund for Zimbabwe, we will be supporting non-government organisations which protect ordinary Zimbabweans. We will be looking for ways of broadening our humanitarian assistance and we will provide fellowships for civil society organisations. No amount of thuggery or brutality by President Mugabe will cover up the truth of his failure and nor will it deter Australia from trying to help the ordinary people of Zimbabwe. We can proudly say that Australia helped to bring about reform in Zimbabwe and helped to bring democracy originally to Zimbabwe some years ago. All of us are profoundly disappointed at what President Mugabe has done with that democracy. Australia owes it to the ordinary people of Zimbabwe to do everything we can to help them see the restoration not only of their living standards and their livelihoods but also of their human rights.</DOC>

 - Mr Cheng Hong appeared before the inquiry that was set up by John Della Bosca into Tristar on a reference to the Industrial Relations Commission of New South Wales. Mr Cheng Hong tabled what I understand to be some notes from another person - they might have been from him as well; it is very difficult to tell according to the transcript - of a conversation that he claimed to have had with me. I will make this point: I never asked Tristar to break the law. I would not ask them to break the law. I asked Tristar, the management of Tristar and Mr Cheng Hong, to pay the workers their full entitlements. I make no apology for that whatsoever. The workers who are left at Tristar have been treated terribly by the management of that company.The Labor Party voted against our attempts to protect the workers of Tristar. Shame on the Labor Party for that. They voted against it, and then they went down to Marrickville and claimed to the workers that they were the workers' best friend. Yet in this place previously the Labor Party voted against the 12-month protection for the redundancy entitlements of the workers of Tristar. That is why the Deputy Leader of the Opposition did not ask the question. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition got a backbencher to ask the question because she knows that they have been batting for the management of Tristar and they have been batting against the interests of the workers. Those workers, in the view of the government, have no work to do. - And, in the view of the government, which has commenced through the Office of Workplace Services legal action in the Federal Court -  - We want to see the workers paid their full entitlements. We make no apology for going in to bat for the workers on this - no apology whatsoever. We stand by what we are doing. We are not going to be sidetracked by the allegations made by Mr Cheng Hong, on unfounded information, in the New South Wales Industrial Relations Commission. To back up my side of the story I have six witnesses who are prepared to verify all that I have said.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Leichhardt for his question. Last year the Prime Minister announced a $1.9 billion mental health initiative, by far the biggest initiative ever announced in this area. He did so in part because of the convinced advocacy of the member for Leichhardt. I thank him and congratulate him for the work he did.Thanks to this initiative far more Australians are now getting the care that they need. I can inform the House that in the first four months of the operation of this initiative Medicare supported more than 130,000 mental health care plans prepared by GPs. Under Medicare, there were more than 40,000 consultations with clinical psychologists and more than 100,000 consultations with psychologists and other health professionals. I can also inform the House that there are now nearly 1,400 clinical psychologists and more than 7,000 psychologists who are registered to provide services under Medicare thanks to this mental health initiative. Yet again we have more services from the Howard government. Yet again we have more proof that the Howard government is the best friend that Medicare has ever had.I have been asked about alternative policies. Since 3 May last year the Australian Labor Party has officially been a policy free zone on health. There is a very good rule when you are talking about the Australian Labor Party: do not believe what they say, believe what they do. So I was researching this whole question of Labor policy on mental health. I discovered that, after the Leader of the Opposition had been the de facto Premier of Queensland for four years, Queensland had the worst mental health system of any state in the Commonwealth of Australia. The then Human Rights Commissioner said in 1993:There is no question that there are very serious problems in Queensland, including a pathetic lack of services for young people.That is the Human Rights Commissioner of the regime under the de facto Premier. The following year a research paper prepared for Schizophrenia Australia said:People who suffer mental illness in Queensland should move interstate because of the woeful health services ...It was possible to move interstate when the Leader of the Opposition was the de facto Premier of Queensland. It will not be possible to go overseas if he ever gets to be the Prime Minister of this country. If you could not trust the Leader of the Opposition to advise on good health services in Queensland, you can never trust him to run good services. I think there is a clear message here: don't let Kevin Rudd wreck Medicare like he wrecked Queensland's health services. - Mr Speaker, don't let Dr Death wreck Medicare like he did the health services in Queensland. - I am happy to withdraw if the Leader of the Opposition requests it. - I just make this point: he should not get other people to do his dirty work for him.

 - I thank the member for Macquarie for his question and note his deep interest in matters affecting schools in his electorate. The Howard government believes in greater choice, values and standards in our schools. In relation to standards, I think it is telling that the state governments released today the results of literacy and numeracy tests that were taken two years ago. The data that has come out in these results shows that far too many students are failing to meet the minimum acceptable standards in literacy and numeracy, and the trends are equally worrying - for example, the percentage of students in year 3 who are failing to meet minimum acceptable standards in mathematics was about six per cent. By year 7, the percentage of students who were failing to meet minimum standards in mathematics had increased to 18 per cent - in other words, the longer they were at school, the worse they were doing. This is a real concern.Back in 1998, the state and territory governments gave a commitment to the people of Australia that every child commencing school that year would reach minimum acceptable standards in reading, writing and mathematics within four years. The states and territories said that every child would reach those standards within four years. Clearly, that has not happened.The Australian government has committed almost $2 billion in additional funds to education authorities to help lift the standards in maths and reading and writing, particularly focusing on disadvantaged schools. Yet, it is evident from these results that students are not getting the full benefit of that investment of additional funding. So the Australian government has insisted that next year it will have the first national assessments in reading and writing and mathematics for years 3, 5, 7 and, for the first time, year 9. The government will ensure that the results of these tests are available in a timely fashion - not two years later - so that action can be taken and interventions can be put in place.It is also telling that, through these national tests, it will be the first time that we will be able to compare results school by school, state by state. If the Australian government had not intervened, if it had not made this a condition of funding for state governments, they would continue to ignore this very serious problem. The Howard government is committed to supporting parents in their wish for higher standards in literacy and numeracy and for greater choice, greater values and greater standards in our schools.</DOC>

 - I am aware of the views expressed by Sir Nicholas Stern. Some of the views that he has expressed I agree with, some I have reservations about and some, I believe, if implemented, literally would do great damage to the Australian economy. When it comes to the decisions of the government, uppermost in our mind will be the national interest, not the views of any one individual, however eminent he may be regarded by some. The truth is that there is no one single solution to the global climate change challenge but, quite plainly, market mechanisms, including emissions trading, will be integral to any long-term global solution on climate change.In the Sydney Morning Herald this morning he is reported as advocating - and I am not sure whether Sir Nicholas has been correctly quoted - 'Greenhouse gas emissions should be cut by up to 30 per cent by 2020.' I would be interested to know whether the Australian Labor Party supports that goal. The Leader of the Opposition has asked me whether I would join the Labor Party in committing to that goal. I am not going to join the Australian Labor Party in destroying the jobs of Australian coalminers, I am not going to join the Labor Party in committing to targets which will do disproportionate damage to the Australian economy and I am not going to commit this government, or this country, to targets that impose an unfair or disproportionate burden on this country in the contribution it makes to responding to the challenge of climate change.I note, incidentally, that Sir Nicholas Stern has also had something to say about clean coal technology, and that is an area where our views and the views of Sir Nicholas are very similar. I also note that he is a supporter and not an opponent of nuclear power. That of course is an area where we would agree and which represents a point of departure.Let me say in conclusion that I am interested in his views. They make a valuable contribution to the debate, but they are the views of another expert. They should be treated with respect, but they should not be treated as holy writ.</DOC>

 - In replying to the member for Hasluck, can I note that in March 1996 the unemployment rate in that part of Western Australia was 7.4 per cent. At the end of 2006 it had fallen to 3.5 per cent. That is a remarkable achievement. It has been more than cut in half in the 11 years that the government have been in office. Why has that happened? It has happened because we have followed strong and consistent policies in relation to the management of the economy and, notwithstanding the consistent opposition by the Labor Party to all of those policies, the implementation of them over the last decade has produced that wonderful employment outcome in the electorate of Hasluck.Amongst the policies that we have strongly supported are policies giving a right of choice to Australian workers, policies that recognise - unlike the views of the member for Jagajaga - that having casual work is better than having no work at all and policies that have extolled the importance of choice in the workplace, the importance of independent contractors and the importance of small business. Our policies have been ones of consistent support for the small business sector, consistent support for contractors and consistent support for the value of casual work, as well as indeed part-time and full-time work.On the subject of consistency, my attention has been drawn to articles successively yesterday and today on the front page of the Australian, which illustrate a certain degree of inconsistency on the other side of politics. Yesterday we had the rather breathless claim, no doubt briefed with authority, to Sid Marris of the Australian:Labor will make improving the lot of individual contractors a priority in an industrial relations platform that declares that work arrangements should serve social as well as economic goals. The platform, Restoring the Balance in our Workplace, retains a solid pro-union agenda and is similar to that taken by Mark Latham to the 2004 election. But it is peppered with changes that federal Labor leader Kevin Rudd is expected to emphasise in the coming months. It re-embraces the desire of workers for part-time and casual employment and the integral role those jobs can play.When I read that I thought, 'This is very interesting. This is the Leader of the Opposition perhaps dragging his party into the 21st century and into the modern workplace.' But my enthusiasm was dashed this morning when I picked up the Australian and this time, under the by-line of Steve Lewis as well as Sid Marris, it had this to say: 'Rudd backs down on casuals.' It said:Labor has dumped explicit support for casual workers and contractors in a stripped-back draft platform as the Opposition struggles to contain union tensions over policy direction.What has happened is that the policy released the day after that rather breathless briefing, which suggested that contractors and casual workers were going to get a place in the sun, has been dumped. The article carries the description 'vanishing number' and it repeats 'the clause that has been removed'.This clause was there yesterday; today it has disappeared. Yesterday's clause said:Greater attention needs to be given to the growing casualisation of the workforce, home-based work, the needs of independent contractors, and the increasing demand in balancing work with personal and family life.I would have thought that any modern political party would want to have a clause like that in its platform. I think the question that everybody on this side of the House would like to ask is: which of the former ACTU presidents or currently serving senior officers of the ACTU told the Leader of the Opposition to take that clause out?</DOC>

 - The policies that I particularly referred to on the Today program and that we hold in common with Stern are those relating to nuclear power and clean coal technology. -  - The opposition reacts negatively to that but the truth is that if you want to run power stations in a modern economy there are really only two ways you can do it. You do it by fossil fuels or you do it by nuclear power. That is the view not of John Howard; that is the view of Jim Peacock, the Chief Scientist of Australia. I will take my advice on scientific matters from the Australian Chief Scientist before I will take it from the Leader of the Opposition.This is at the heart of this debate: you cannot run power stations on renewables. Yet the Leader of the Opposition and those who sit behind him believe that you can. The only way that you can run power stations in Australia, and therefore provide electricity for a modern economy, is to run them on fossil fuels. If you believe in reducing the greenhouse gas content of fossil fuel usage you must clean up the use of coal. And as you clean up the use of coal you make its use more expensive, and that is where nuclear power comes into the equation.That is the irreducible common-sense minimum of this debate about the future of greenhouse gas emissions in a country such as Australia. We can have all the flamboyance and all the rhetoric under the sun but, if we are to sustain our standard of living and if we are to remain a modern economy, we need to run power stations. And you cannot run power stations on solar or wind power. You can only run them on fossil fuels or on nuclear power. They are the two most reliable, logical ways of running power stations.So let me say to the Leader of the Opposition that there are areas where I do not agree with Stern, and I do not think I ever will. I think one of the things that Australians should understand about this climate change debate is that some of the prescriptions that come from Europeans come from a European perspective. They do not come from an Australian perspective. Nations that do not have vast reserves of fossil fuel have a different view about this matter than nations that do. Australia is in a very unusual position: we have a small population but we have been blessed by providence with large reserves of fossil fuel. We should play to our natural advantages and I am simply not going to agree to prescriptions that are going to damage the future of the Australian economy, and I am not going to agree to prescriptions that are going to cost the jobs of Australian coalminers.We have no intention of turning our backs on the coalminers of Australia. We do not have the view about coalmining that is held by the shadow spokesman on environment matters, the member for Kingsford Smith. And so far as Kyoto is concerned, the reason the Australian government has not signed Kyoto is that if we had entered into the Kyoto protocols in their present terms it would potentially have put this country at a competitive disadvantage. I note, incidentally, that unlike many of the countries that have ratified the Kyoto protocol, this country is on track to meet its Kyoto target, unlike many of the countries that presume to lecture Australia on what she should be doing.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Boothby for his question. As the Prime Minister told the House yesterday, and as honourable members all know, Mr Hicks has pleaded guilty to one count of providing material support for terrorism. I know that honourable members will be interested in how this whole process will proceed. The prosecution and the defence have today been working to settle the facts that lie behind Mr Hicks's guilty plea. I understand the expectation is that they have agreed on those facts.In accordance with the procedures laid down in the Manual for Military Commissions, Judge Kohlmann, who is the judge presiding in this case, will then reconvene the military commission for what is called the providence hearing. During this hearing, which will be held in an open court, Mr Hicks will be questioned by Judge Kohlmann, on oath, about the offence. Judge Kohlmann needs to satisfy himself that there is a factual basis for Mr Hicks's plea or that Mr Hicks has voluntarily pleaded guilty because he is convinced the prosecution could make out its case against him.The chief prosecutor, Moe Davis, said on radio this morning - and some members will have heard this - that he thought this hearing could occur in the next day or two. We do not have any further light to throw on that. That time scale may be slightly out; we will just have to wait and see. If Judge Kohlmann accepts Mr Hicks's guilty plea, sentencing proceedings will be convened before the miliary commission members. The military commission members are commissioned officers of the United States military, appointed by the convening authority. Following submissions by both the prosecution and the defence, the members of the commission will deliberate and then determine the sentence. Colonel Davis said this morning that he hoped the military commission members, who come from different parts of the United States, could be assembled at Guantanamo Bay in time to allow these proceedings to be held before the end of this week.There has been quite a lot of speculation, understandably, about Mr Hicks returning to Australia within a matter of weeks. We do not know at this stage the sentence that will be imposed on Mr Hicks by the military commission, so it is premature to speculate. Suffice it to say that the Australian government has an agreement with the government of the United States, under which Mr Hicks would be able to serve out the remainder of any custodial sentence that may be imposed upon him here in Australia - in an Australian prison - but, until we exactly know what the sentence will be on the back of the guilty plea which has already been made by Mr Hicks, we are unable to throw any more light on whether Mr Hicks will serve time in an Australian prison and, if so, how much time that will be.</DOC>

 - Can I just go back to something I said in answer to the first question asked of me. Sir Nicholas Stern is reported in the Sydney Morning Herald today as advocating a reduction of 30 per cent in greenhouse gas emissions by the year 2020. That would have a devastating effect on the Australian economy. It would cost thousands of jobs in the Australian coal industry. It would put back technological progress towards clean coal technology because of its impact on the operation of the Australian economy. Nobody argues or contests the challenge of climate change but what I do argue and contest is the kind of knee-jerk reaction advocated by the member for Lilley. - If the member for Lilley wants to become a destroyer of the Australian coal industry, let him go and justify that. There is an idea that this country could achieve that kind of reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by the year 2020, which is a bare 13 years from now, but the economic dislocation, the level of unemployment and the damage that would be done to Australia's competitive position is self-explanatory. It is imperative that we do not take action as a nation which puts us at an unfair disadvantage with the rest of the world. That kind of action would do that and, whilst there are quite a lot of things in Stern's report and in his work that we agree with, we will take decisions in the national interest. History is littered with examples of nations having overreacted to presumed threats to their great long-term disadvantage.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Wakefield for his question. I can inform him that the government has gone to considerable lengths with legislation to protect employees' superannuation funds. The reason for that is that these funds are for the benefit of employees over the long term and, if those who get control of managing them do not discharge their duty in the interests of the employees, employees will suffer - they will either retire on less or, at worst, they will have nothing to retire on at all. So independent trustees are given the legislative requirement of investing solely for the benefit of members. They cannot be given directions on how to do that and, most especially, in respect of company superannuation funds, the company cannot appropriate any of those superannuation savings for the benefit of the company or its investment plans.The same should go whether they are private employees or government employees. There have been a lot of demands in Australia for government employees' superannuation to be protected. The member for Lilley has been a persistent demander that the superannuation savings of employees be locked up in the Future Fund and not raided. For example, on 7 November 2005, he said of the Future Fund:It has to be a locked box. We have to make the Future Fund a locked box.It's very important there is public confidence in the Future Fund and that it is a locked box that can't be raided by the National Party, Peter Costello or anybody else.What he did not say is that he apparently had a plan for it to be raided by the Labor Party and Kevin Rudd. On 18 August 2005, the member for Lilley said:The whole point of the Future Fund was to have Budget surpluses and the proceeds of asset sales put in the hands of independent experts and locked away in a box.The idea of an independent expert is that the expert makes the investment decision - not the government, not the trade union movement, not the member for Melbourne, not the member for Lilley and not the member for Griffith but an independent expert. Right over the top of all of those demands that the Future Fund be a locked box has come the bear to the honey pot. Once the Leader of the Opposition, the member for Melbourne and the member for Lilley got the sniff of honey on their paws, they could not resist.I said yesterday that no state government had ever tried to influence a state government employee superannuation scheme. I received information after question time yesterday which indicated that I may not have been entirely accurate in that claim. I received information after question time yesterday that in 1987 there was a state government that tried to use the Government Employee Superannuation Board to prop up a failed company in the state of Western Australia. In 1992, the royal commission into WA Inc. found:In our view, as a result of his association with Mr Laurie Connell, Mr Brian Burke demonstrated a disposition to assist Rothwells from the moment he became aware it was in difficulty. He was instrumental in Rothwells obtaining support from the Government Employees Superannuation Board Fund.So it was a finding of the Western Australian royal commission that there is a precedent for a government directing employees' superannuation. It is Mr Brian Burke, and it was done in relation to Rothwells.One can only imagine whether at breakfast, at lunch or at the dinner down there at Perugino - 'the guess who's coming to dinner' dinner - any discussion about the subject of using superannuation funds for pet investment projects came up. There is one precedent and one precedent alone for what the Leader of the Opposition now proposes. It is the precedent of Brian Burke, Rothwells Bank and WA Inc. And that says it all.</DOC>

 - I am of course aware of the modelling that has been done by Sir Nicholas Stern. The Treasury, along with economists around the world, have assessed that modelling. There have been criticisms of a number of the assumptions which underpin that research. I am not even aware that the UK government has accepted all of the findings of that research. In fact, in meetings that we will be having today with Sir Nicholas Stern, we will obviously be exploring that.There is some disagreement about discount rates, some of the suppositions and the technological changes. There is also quite considerable disagreement about what national effects there would be. To my knowledge there has been no economic modelling done as to the effect on particular countries. All of the economic modelling is done in relation to global effects. That is obviously because it is very hard to disaggregate in relation to individual countries - a point that I have made previously in this House and a point that the Treasury have taken into account.Having said all that, the important thing to bear in mind is that countries should do what they can to reduce carbon gas emissions. I make the point that this country is probably one of the few countries that is on target to meet its Kyoto target. There is a lot of talk about signing Kyoto, but those countries that have signed Kyoto are some of the countries that are furthest away from meeting their targets. One thing about Australia is that when we sign something we like to keep to it. Even though we have not ratified Kyoto, we are well on the way -  - The point I was making was that, although this country has not ratified its target, this country could well be one of the few countries in the world that will meet the target, contrasting with many European countries which have ratified Kyoto and are nowhere near meeting their targets. That is one of the things about Australia: when we sign and ratify these things we like to actually observe them. This country is on its way to meeting its target. With measures that have been put in place by this government, Australia will make a positive contribution in the decades which lie ahead.</DOC>

 - That was a very good question, if I may say so, from the member for Mallee. I do not think that there would be any leading think tank around the world - whether it is the OECD, the IMF or the World Bank - that would deny that in the modern global economy the degree to which you enhance flexibility in your labour market is the degree to which you improve economic performance. I heard the Leader of the Opposition engaging in extreme gobbledygook on the radio this morning trying to explain why a centralised labour market would somehow boost productivity. I must say that the AM reporter was as astounded as I was as they asked the question over and over again and met stonewalling from the Leader of the Opposition.The Leader of the Opposition made the assertion this morning that he could prove from New Zealand that decentralised labour markets had not improved productivity. He claimed that, if you looked at New Zealand, you would see that New Zealand with a decentralised system had done worse than Australia with a centralised system during the 1990s. I do not know where he gets his figures from, because the New Zealand Bureau of Statistics released statistics for their measured sector - which is similar to Australia's market sector - in March 2006 for the period 1988 to 2005. They recently updated those statistics to include 2006. This is the evidence: during the period in which the New Zealand Employment Contracts Act operated, which was from 1991 to 2000, New Zealand measured-sector labour productivity grew by an average of 2.9 per cent per annum, while in Australia labour market productivity growth in the market sector was 2.5 per cent per annum. Comparing like with like - New Zealand with Australia - during the period of the New Zealand Employment Contracts Act, labour market productivity grew faster than in Australia. It grew at 2.9 per cent compared to 2.5 per cent.There could be many factors affecting labour market productivity. You cannot say that one act is the sole differentiation. But you can conclude from that that there is no evidence whatsoever for the proposition that was advanced by the Leader of the Opposition this morning that somehow New Zealand demonstrated that under this legislation productivity either declined or was not enhanced or was slower than that in Australia. He went to great lengths, and that was the only evidence that he could put out there this morning.He said, for example, 'If employers and employees are working together as units of production' - let me interpose there. This is a Labor leader. Let me read those words again: 'If employers and employees are working together as units of production'. Now an employee is a unit of production, according to the Leader of the Opposition. I tell you what: you would not have heard Ben Chifley talk like that; you would not have heard John Curtin talk like that. I wonder how all those members of the ACTU - those thousands of units of production - feel about being so described by the Leader of the Opposition. He said -  - The unit of production from the seat of Lilley interjects. - May I say that the member for Lilley is a very low-productivity unit of production. The Leader of the Opposition said: 'If employers and employees are working together as units of production - as firms - that is how in fact you best yield the best productive outcome.' That is what decentralised wage fixation is all about. If you make sure that, at the level of the local workplace, employer and employee are working together as human beings on terms and conditions that are suitable to that workplace, you get the best outcome.But centralised wage fixation says that we should take a particular trade and say in relation to that - either through an award or through pattern bargaining - that that trade, whether it is done by a person on the Pilbara, whether it is done on a coalfield in Queensland or whether it is done in a Moorabbin shop, should be paid according to centralised principles. That is why every economic think tank that has thought about this says, 'Get it down to the workplace, get it down to employer to employee, make it relevant to that place and get the best outcomes.' That is why labour market productivity is enhanced by decentralised wage fixation. The rollback proposed by the Labor Party is completely in the wrong direction for a modern economy.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Melbourne Ports for his question. I have not read the particular remarks attributed to the gentleman you refer to; I do know whom you are referring to, but I have not read those particular remarks. I am aware that some people are critical of our decision not to adopt some three years ago the recommendations of an investigation, I think chaired by former senator Grant Tambling, to significantly increase the mandatory renewable energy targets. We took a decision then to go down the path of providing greater incentives to such things as clean coal technology, and if you look at the energy white paper you will see laid out in very clear language our support for that.The member asks me to follow Labor policy in extending mandatory renewable targets; that is a very interesting proposition, because I have been told in briefing sessions from officials representing the eight Labor state and territory jurisdictions of Australia that, in advocating the national emissions trading scheme which the eight Labor states and territories want, part of the package is a phase-out of mandatory renewable energy targets because they are incompatible with the notion of a national emissions trading scheme. Perhaps the member for Melbourne Ports might like to factor that into his reflections on what Dr White has said.</DOC>

 - First can I thank the honourable member for Mackellar for her question and her interest in the issue of terrorism. I think all members are very familiar with the tragic deaths of a large number of Australians as a result of terrorist activity. Australians were killed on 9-11 in New York and Washington; one was killed in Washington. Eighty-eight Australians were killed in Bali in October 2002. Australians were killed again in Bali more recently, and our embassy in Jakarta was attacked in 2004 by terrorists. Ten people were killed as a result of that.For us, not only does the government have a fundamental obligation to provide as much protection as it can for the Australian community but on this side of the House anyway we regard it as enormously important that we fight terrorism, and we do so very effectively. That is why we have troops in Afghanistan, because we want to help the people of Afghanistan embrace freedom and democracy, and we want to ensure that Afghanistan cannot once more become a base for terrorist activities.It is why we keep arguing our corner on the issue of Iraq. The other night I saw on television the opposition spokesman on foreign affairs claiming that the only fighting that took place in Iraq was between Sunni and Shia militias - there were not any real terrorists there. Actually, the honourable member is completely wrong. Al-Qaeda in Iraq is a very major force and has been doing everything it possibly can to create sectarian violence and as much chaos as it can. We on this side of the House do not want to give Al-Qaeda in Iraq any comfort or any victory, and we will do our best in Iraq to counter terrorism as well.In our own region, I think the government has been doing a very effective job working with our neighbours in Indonesia and also other countries in South-East Asia to counter terrorism. Just three weeks ago I co-chaired a subregional counterterrorism meeting with Hassan Wirajuda, my Indonesian counterpart. It included police chiefs as well, and at that meeting we reinforced our determination to counter terrorism; not just congratulating ourselves on what we have done but, very importantly, reinforcing cooperation between our countries.In conclusion, some people may wonder why we have been tough on the Hicks case, and that is of course all part of the same narrative. As a government we are deeply concerned about terrorism. Any Australian who may get involved one way or another with a terrorist organisation is a person who gets no sympathy from us as a government. It is important to understand that. I have often said to people that there are not all that many Australians who read day by day in the media about Sergeant Andrew Russell, who was killed by terrorists serving in the Australian Defence Force in Afghanistan, compared to the amount of publicity that someone like David Hicks gets. He has pleaded guilty to providing material support to a terrorist organisation. So it is very important that we have a proper sense of perspective and a strong sense of determination to counter, to fight and ultimately to defeat terrorism.</DOC>

 - The member in his question is referring of course to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Heritage report on sustainable cities. It is a very good report and I commend it to the honourable members on both sides. My understanding of the Labor Party's announcement today is that it is not to double the rebate at all but rather to extend it. I believe it is still a maximum of $4,000 per household. If that is the case then they have not doubled it at all. It is exactly the same rebate. The rebate is currently -  - There he is. The member for Kingsford Smith does not even know what his policy is. The rebate is $4 a watt up to a maximum of $4,000. - Is the maximum $4,000 or not? - It is. He does not know. Mr Speaker, I cannot help the member for Kingsford Smith. He does not know what his policy is. If he cannot tell us what it is then I am afraid I cannot enlighten him.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kingston for his question and note that in 1996 the unemployment rate in Kingston was 11.6 per cent and today it is still too high but it is down to 6.8 per cent. So it has come off around five per cent in the last 11 years.The Australian Bureau of Statistics has released a labour force survey that indicates that the number of persons with marginal attachment to the labour force has dropped. That is good news. There are more people going into work, and people who were previously discouraged from entering the workforce are no longer discouraged. In fact, only in the last 12 months, from September 2006, we saw the number of people discouraged from entering the workforce drop by about 90,000. That is a good story. The reason why it is a good story is that the economy is strong. The economy is strong for a number of reasons. Firstly, the government is prepared to undertake tough measures, difficult measures, that help to deliver a stronger economy such as tax reform, such as getting the budget into surplus and so on. No reform has had a more significant impact in the last 12 months than the introduction of Work Choices. Those laws have helped to free up the marketplace, have helped to make for a more flexible working environment and have helped to encourage business to employ more people, particularly those who have been out of the workforce for a while.I am asked about threats to the strong economy. No greater threat exists than the Labor Party being elected into federal government, particularly with what seems to be the ninth version, or maybe it is the 10th version, of their industrial relations policy. I did see the Australian yesterday. As the Prime Minister pointed out, on the front page of the Australian was a story by Steve Lewis. 'Rudd set for brawl with Left' was the headline. He says the Labor policy 'jettisons previous discomfort with the casualisation of the workforce in a move that will alienate left-wing unions' such as the ACTU. So the Labor Party is embracing casualisation.I thought, 'I have to get a copy of this policy.' I went in search of it. I came across the latest version and could not find anything about casualisation - not a word. So either Steve Lewis is wrong - and I do not believe Steve is wrong; he is not shaking his head. Either Steve Lewis is wrong - and I find that very difficult to believe; when it comes to information from the Labor Party, I do not believe it - or alternatively the Labor Party deleted all references to casual labour. I said to myself, 'Why would they do that?' I looked in the Australian today and saw the headline 'Rudd backs down on casuals'. I thought, 'Why would he back down on casuals?'I found an article in the Age which quotes the chief spokesperson for the Labor Party on industrial relations, ACTU President Sharan Burrow. Shazza is back in town. You can create this mental picture. Last night Shazza belts down the door on the way into Kevin Rudd's office, puts him in a half-nelson - with not a hair out of place from the Leader of the Opposition at this time - and says: 'Hey, listen, Kev. We're going to tell you what a Kevin is: a Kevin is when you back down on a policy within 12 hours. That is what a Kevin is. A Kevin is where we call the shots as union bosses and you go to the people of Australia and you try to spin them a line. At the end of the day we run the Labor Party.'Do you know what? The union bosses pay for the Labor Party's campaign. The union bosses set the Labor Party's policy. And now the union bosses want to come in and represent the Labor Party in parliament. It is not the Australian Labor Party; it is the Australian union party. That is why Greg Combet wants to come into parliament. That is why all the union bosses want to come into parliament. That is why Dougie Cameron wants to come into parliament. And that is why the Leader of the Opposition changed his policy within 12 hours.</DOC>

 - The commitment that the government has made is an amount of $2.3 billion, which I understand is the largest single infrastructure development investment made in this part of Australia by any Commonwealth government - $2.3 billion. The reason why we do not support the upgrade of the Ipswich Motorway is that there is clear advice that, as soon as that upgrade were completed, it would be necessary to reinvest in a further expansion because of the enormous amount of traffic. We are supported in our decision by the recommendations of the feasibility study carried out by Maunsell and Partners.I might also say to the Leader of the Opposition that the Queensland transport minister indicated to the Deputy Prime Minister as recently as yesterday that, although the Queensland government has a different view in relation to this particular upgrade, it will cooperate to the full because this is a national highway and therefore is being totally funded by the Commonwealth government. In fact, we have chosen a more expensive option because it is a longer term option. The option supported by the Queensland government, by the Queensland Liberal Party and by the Lord Mayor of Brisbane is a short-term option and it will not provide a long-term solution to the traffic problems of that part of south-east Queensland. I might say that in making our decision, which I was happy to announce in Queensland only a couple of weeks ago, the government reflects the strongly held views of the federal members representing this part of Queensland. - We think the building of the Goodna bypass is better long-term transport policy, better economics and overall the right decision for the people of south-east Queensland.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Bass for his question. I can tell the House that immunisation rates in 1989-90 in this country were at 53 per cent, one of the worst outcomes in the Western world, and today they stand at over 90 per cent, one of the best outcomes in the Western world - directly because of the government's national immunisation program, Immunise Australia. Spending in 1996 on immunisation was $13 million a year and this year it will be $207 million a year, 16 times the rate that the Labor Party left immunisation at when it left office.I am very pleased to be able to announce today that the Minister for Health and Ageing has kept his promise to make an announcement on rotavirus vaccines by the end of March. I can tell the House that rotavirus vaccines will be listed on the national immunisation program from this year at a cost of $124 million over the next five years - a very good outcome. GSK's Rotarix and CSL's RotaTeq will be the two vaccines listed. This is very good news, particularly for families in Australia, who have been very well represented and looked after by the coalition government in the last 11 years.In Australia, the rotavirus accounts for 10,000 hospitalisations of children a year. Half of those are cases of children aged under one year and almost all are children under five. Of course, amongst Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander populations it is a particularly serious problem. The vaccine will commence from July 2007 and all babies born after 1 May 2007 will be eligible. This further strengthens the national immunisation program - and, in the absence of the Minister for Health and Ageing, I can say it is further evidence that the Howard government is the best friend that Medicare has ever had.</DOC>

 - There were two issues raised; the first was about small business. I say to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that there is nothing more fearful for small business than the reintroduction of the unfair dismissal laws. Small business hates the Labor Party's job-destroying unfair dismissal laws. There is no doubt about that. If the Deputy Leader of the Opposition were to understand anything about small business - and she certainly does not - she would know that small business went through absolute hell trying to comply with the Labor Party's unfair dismissal laws. - On the second issue, I will tell you what small business are fearful of. They are fearful of the union bosses walking back in on the dark day that the Labor Party is elected to federal government; that is what they are worried about. When I went to a small business in Queanbeyan in Eden-Monaro yesterday, without any prompting from me, a worker pointed out that he was fearful of the unions walking back into the workplace and interfering in negotiations between employers and employees at the end of the collective agreement.In relation to the second issue that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition raises on families, I will make this point: we see today more women in the Australian workplace than at any time in Australia's history. We see today a narrowing of the wages gap under the coalition, when the wages gap between men and women grew under the Labor Party. We also see today that it has been the coalition government that introduced the family tax benefit, which provides choice for families. It is the coalition that has doubled the number of childcare places. It is the coalition government that has taken the cap off childcare places. It is the coalition government -  - It is the coalition government that introduced that outstanding initiative: the baby bonus. It is the coalition government that is in there batting for families and providing them with the opportunity of undertaking work if they choose to, or supporting them if a mum chooses to stay at home in full-time care of the children.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kalgoorlie for his question and his interest in this matter. I can report to him and to the House that the two Indonesian crew members of the boat that had 83 Sri Lankan passengers who were arrested by the Australian Federal Police have been charged with facilitating the unlawful entry into Australia of persons contrary to the Migration Act. They have been remanded in custody in Perth and are due to face a court hearing in Perth on 5 April this year.In 2000-01, there were over 4,000 attempted illegal arrivals by boat into Australia and, in response to this, this government introduced new measures to deter people-smuggling and the people smugglers involved. As a result of that, last year there were just 263 attempts - so from 4,000 attempts down to 263. It is obvious to anyone who looks at the evidence about this that illegal boat arrivals have virtually stopped because of this government's very strong border protection policies. Indeed, that is quite obvious to everybody on this side of the House. The only people who are oblivious to this and the link between a strong border protection policy and the good results are once again those in the Australian Labor Party.In a recent interview with Sky News the opposition shadow minister was asked this question:But, Tony Burke, aren't we sending an important message to people who try to come into this country illegally by processing them in Nehru? Aren't we saying to them, 'Don't even try to get into Australia unless you want to use the proper means'?The reply from Mr Burke was:I just don't believe this is part of the equation. I just don't believe that Nehru is part of the equation.The danger of this is that a weak response from the Australian Labor Party once again may be just enough to encourage more people-smuggling activities and more attempted boat arrivals in Australia. One thing we can say for sure is that if the Labor Party's policies were ever implemented by the ALP in government then we might as well open up the wharves to boats coming from Indonesia. We might as well put a green light up and say, 'Come on into Australia,' because that is the policy of the Australian Labor Party.The Leader of the Opposition needs to stand up on this issue and declare whether he is going to continue to pursue these weak border protection policies of the Australian Labor Party or whether he is going to take border protection seriously. The threat of illegal arrivals by boat is very real and, instead of dodging the issue, it is about time that Kevin Rudd stood up to be counted.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Rankin for his question. The first thing I would say is that all workers have to be protected. I have noticed that both the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow minister have been making a number of claims about small business and Work Choices. Let me put on the record some more quotes about small business and the benefits they find from this. Let me tell you about a small businessman from the Illawarra, Mr Jim Eddy, who says that businesses chasing tourism dollars now have more opportunities and greater freedoms. The IR laws create jobs. Diana Williams from the Fernwood women's health club said, 'Ninety-nine per cent of my staff are female and they are very happy with our AWA arrangements, as they provide flexibility and accommodate the -  - I can assure you that I do know what small business have to say. They know that we provide fairness and flexibility -  - They know that you lot stand for bringing back unfair dismissal and ripping up AWAs. It does not matter what you say, either here or in the other place, we will get the words of small businesspeople on the record, because there is no doubt that small businesspeople around Australia unanimously support the reforms that the Howard government has brought in for small business.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for McPherson for her question. I am pleased to report to the House that the latest figures on Australia's services exports show a record $41.9 billion worth of service sector exports, up a significant six per cent on the previous year. That is a pretty solid answer to the Leader of the Opposition, who tries to pass off Australia's export performance as just being China's mine and Japan's beach. The reality is that the services sector, which makes up about 80 per cent of our economy and 85 per cent of our employment, is also 20 per cent of our exports.Many people may not think that an electorate like that of the honourable member for McPherson is a major contributor towards Australia's exports. But it is an important tourist destination and therefore a vital part of our services sector exports. Indeed, two services categories are in our top four national exports, including personal travel, which comes in at No. 3, and education services, which comes in at No. 4. Those services exports are making a very significant contribution to Australia's export performance.It is also interesting to note that our most important market for export services is the United States. There were many critics opposite of the US-Australia free trade agreement, but it is one of the sectors that has benefited significantly from that agreement. I notice that one of the major critics of the free trade agreement a couple of years ago was none other than the Labor left-wing union leader Dougie Cameron. He had plenty to say about the free trade agreement. He said, on 2 August, that the free trade agreement with the United States was going to cost the Australian economy $56 billion. I have not noticed any of that cost being built up so far.It was also going to cost 50,000 to 60,000 jobs. Mr Cameron obviously has not caught up with the Leader of the Opposition's new political correctness. It would now be 50,000 to 60,000 units of production that would be lost. This great economic luminary and free trader, who is trying to write Labor's free trade policy for the upcoming Labor convention, is also likely to be rewarded with a post in the Senate, we are now told. If this is the kind of approach that Labor is going to take towards a trade policy then indeed our potential as a major exporter of services to the world will be dashed. The reality is that services are an important part of Australia's export performance, and they are helping to boost our exports right around the world and particularly into the United States.</DOC>

 - I say to the member that the number of women who have entered the workforce over the last 12 months represents about 109,000, and there has been a significant infusion of women coming back into work for the first time in the last 10 years. The number of long-term unemployed coming in, particularly the number of women coming in, has meant that they have gone into low-paying jobs as a starting point - particularly in the hospitality and retail industries - whereas in industries such as the mining industry - where, overwhelmingly, the majority of workers are men - the wages have gone up.I make this further point: there are more women today in the Australian workforce than ever before, and they have more choice. One of the areas that they consider to be very important is in relation to casual work. - That is why I wonder why the Labor Party is so opposed to casual work. That is why I wonder why the Labor Party is so opposed to women coming back into the workforce.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Moncrieff for his question. When this government reformed the tax system in 2000, it introduced a broad based goods and services tax to replace a number of inefficient indirect taxes. The taxes that the GST was designed to replace were wholesale sales tax, bed tax, financial institutions duty, stamp duty on marketable securities, bank account debits tax, stamp duty on non-quotable market securities, stamp duty on leases, stamp duty on mortgages, stamp duty on credit arrangements, stamp duty on cheques and stamp duty on non-residential conveyance of real property. Since the Commonwealth introduced the goods and services tax, the states have agreed to abolish nearly all of those taxes. But the states still refuse to abolish stamp duty on non-residential conveyance of real property. As far as the government is concerned, the GST was introduced to get rid of other taxes - not in addition to other taxes. The people of Australia deserve to have all of those taxes abolished. That is something that the Commonwealth will require the Labor states to do.The Labor states have commissioned a report on federalism and the GST. I managed to get hold of it today. It has been produced by Glenn Withers and Anne Twomey, I believe. - Yes, it was on the front page of the paper. And it was a very accurate report on the front page of the paper, too, about a Labor state plan to increase the GST rate. I am glad I was reminded. You will see many of the Labor spokesmen stand with their backs to me at this point. - I have got hold of this report, which was commissioned by the Labor state premiers. It says, 'If the Commonwealth had been serious about giving the states fiscal autonomy, it would have ensured the states had access to revenue that covered and eventually exceeded the loss of state taxes' - which we did - 'the loss of financial assistance grants' - which we did - 'and specific purpose payments.' A 10 per cent GST covers the abolition of state taxes and financial assistance grants. But the premiers say that that was not serious enough and that it should have also covered the loss of specific purpose payments. Let me inform the House that specific purpose payments from the Commonwealth to the states are at $29 billion. In order for the GST to cover specific purpose payments, the GST rate will have to increase to 17.2 per cent. That is the report which has been commissioned by the state premiers - a report that says we should have been serious enough to introduce a 17.2 per cent GST to cover specific purpose payments.Le me make this clear: there is only one way that the GST can be increased in Australia. It can only be increased if every state and territory wants it, if the Commonwealth agrees to it and if it is legislated through the House and the Senate. We now have eight Labor state premiers and chief ministers. If there were an increase in the GST, they would get all of the revenue. They have a very strong incentive for an increase in the GST rate. This government will not agree to any increase in the GST because we believe that the states already have sufficient revenue - which they are not properly accounting for - and we are not going to increase it. But if we had a new federal government with a majority in this House - which it would have by definition - and in the Senate, then that new federal government, with the agreement of the states, could increase the rate of the GST.You would then have the situation, if the Leader of the Opposition becomes Prime Minister, where you would have an inexperienced Prime Minister with eight premiers and chief ministers, all with a lot more clout and experience than him, putting the weights on him for an increase in GST, which they would get the benefit of. There would be no checks; there would be no balances. I have said in this House before: when the state premiers say 'jump', the Leader of the Opposition cannot jump high enough.Whether it is in relation to royalties demanded by the Western Australian government, whether it is in relation to infrastructure demanded for the Gold Coast by his candidate, Eddy, the other day or whether it is in relation to a whole host of other state demands, the risk of Mr Rudd being Prime Minister is the risk of an inexperienced person being beholden to the demands of eight Labor premiers and chief ministers, who have commissioned a report saying that they believe the GST should give them enough to cover specific purpose payments - and that is a 17.2 per cent GST. This is the risk with an inexperienced Leader of the Opposition becoming an inexperienced Prime Minister: that the Labor Party would be able to have its way - and the Labor Party, in government at every level, would be able to increase the GST.</DOC>

 - For the information of the Leader of the Opposition, governments do not construct markets; markets are developed by people who buy and sell goods and services. That has been the truth for many generations and it will continue to be the truth. But, as the Leader of the Opposition knows, currently there is a task force comprising the most senior bureaucrats in the federal government and leaders of companies, both resource companies and power generation companies, looking at the possible shape of an emissions trading system. On that emissions trading system that might operate in Australia, having regard of course to the interface with the international community, I expect to have the benefit of that report by some time in May. I think it is proceeding in an orderly fashion. I am sure it will be an informed report. I would say to the Leader of the Opposition that he can read the report as much as I can and he can draw his own conclusions.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. Deforestation is the second biggest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions in the world today. It has been largely overlooked by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. It is not factored into the Kyoto protocol. As a consequence deforestation continues apace. Action is needed to breathe new life into the forests, which are after all the lungs of the world.The Australian government - the Prime Minister, the Foreign minister and I - announced today a $200 million program to kick-start a global initiative on forests and climate change. This is designed to support new forest plantings, limit destruction of the world's remaining forests and promote sustainable forest management, which is so essential not simply to battling climate change but to relieving poverty in developing countries.We will be building the technical capacity of developing countries, particularly those in our region, to assess their forest resources, putting in place the effective regulatory arrangements to protect forests and to promote the sustainable use of forest resources.We will be working with like-minded countries both in the developed world, like the United States and the European Union, and in the developing world, in particular our neighbour Indonesia, which is the second-largest deforester in the world because of its large tropical forests - a nation which has been criticising the failure of the Kyoto protocol to address deforestation and which will welcome the initiative that we are taking today.This initiative is the beginning of the opportunity to build the momentum to breathe new life into the lungs of the world. We cannot wait for the Kyoto protocol framework to catch up with this anomaly. We must deal with it now, and we will.</DOC>

 - I am not going to rule things in and out in advance of getting the assessment of the expert committee that has been established. This expert committee is made up of the best brains in the federal Public Service. There is a considerable store of talent there. The group, chaired by the secretary of my department, includes the Secretary of the Treasury, other very senior public servants - all of whom have got a big contribution to make - and leaders of industry. I think they should be allowed to take submissions and then to provide some advice.But I can tell you what I can rule out: I can rule out embracing responses to climate change that are going to damage the Australian economy. I refer all those who sit opposite to page 71 of today's Melbourne Sun-Herald, to an article by Mr Terry McCrann in which he says, 'The Leader of the Opposition proposes to damage the Australian economy in the short term and to destroy it in the long term.' That is a very interesting description from Mr McCrann of the impact of the climate change policies that the Leader of the Opposition has embraced.The Leader of the Opposition has embraced a policy of cutting by 30 per cent greenhouse gas emissions in Australia by the year 2020. So in 13 years we are meant to cut our greenhouse gas emissions by 30 per cent. Anyone with an atom of common sense would know that that would visit enormous dislocation on the Australian economy and would throw thousands of people in the coal industry out of work. I have to ask the rhetorical question: why does the Labor Party have it in for the coal industry of Australia? Why does it have as an environmental spokesman somebody who is very sceptical about the expansion of not only the uranium industry in this country but also the coal industry? Let me say to the Leader of the Opposition: I will certainly rule out knee-jerk reactions that are going to greatly damage the Australian economy, reduce our international competitiveness and rob hardworking Australians of their jobs. I will rule all of those out.As to the form of any carbon trading system, we have set ourselves a path of getting some advice from people who know about that. I intend to wait until I get that advice before committing myself to the specifics of what form that system might take.</DOC>

 - Firstly, I thank the honourable member for Deakin for his question and for his interest. I know that he, along with other members on this side of the House, understands only too well that Australia has credibility on this issue because we not only believe the issue of greenhouse emissions needs to be addressed - and addressed internationally - but also know that no country wants to address the issue in a way that will destroy its economy or undermine its economic prospects. When you are dealing with developing countries, that is a particularly important formula to understand. A lot of ideological ranting at developing countries is going to yield a response about patronising Westerners who do not care about poverty in the Third World - and understandably so.We are leading positive international action to address the issue of climate change. The initiative that was launched today by the Prime Minister, the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources and I - the Global Initiative on Forests and Climate - is a very good illustration of a practical Australian approach to this problem. As the minister for the environment has said, we are putting $200 million into this project, which will have a very major impact on new forest planting, on limiting the destruction of existing forests, on promoting sustainable forest management - which in many developing countries is a very important priority - and, of course, on encouraging, as we must, contributions to this project from a range of other countries.We have had discussions with Britain, the United States, New Zealand and Germany about the global initiative, and the responses we have had have all been very positive. Not surprisingly, developing countries which are likely to be beneficiaries - in particular, Indonesia - have responded very favourably as well. AusAID will be able to build technical capacity to assess and manage forest resources, particularly in Indonesia and Papua New Guinea, and help those countries to put in place robust regulations and a law enforcement framework to protect forests and, in particular, to counter illegal logging.As the honourable member suggested in his question, we have other initiatives as well. The historic initiative launched in Sydney in January of last year, the Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate, has got off to a very strong start. I think the $60 million that we have so far committed as a first tranche - we have committed more than that but that was the first tranche of spending - to AP6 is going to achieve real and practical outcomes in concert with other countries which are part of the initiative.Next week I will be in China. During my visit to China, one of the issues that I will be focusing on is climate change and CO emissions. As is well known, it is estimated that China's CO emissions are to exceed those of the largest emitter, the United States, by 2009. So engaging China in the architecture of dealing with climate change is crucially important. We already have China as part of the AP6 initiative, and the Prime Minister and Chinese Premier, Wen Jiabao, recently announced the Australia-China Joint Coordination Group on Clean Coal Technology. I look forward to discussing with my Chinese counterparts the whole issue of reforestation and protecting existing forests, because that is obviously a significant issue for China.This is the sort of diplomacy that can yield real and substantial outcomes and declines over time in CO emissions while allowing countries, including developing countries, to continue economic growth, to protect and create still more jobs and to build the prosperity of their people. That is the balance that all of us in the international community have to achieve. If I may say so, it is a lot better to approach this issue in that mature and constructive way than with the kind of ideological ranting that we hear from the other side of the House.</DOC>

Just as I ruled out walking away from the forestry workers of northern Tasmania in 2004, I can promise the coalminers of Australia that the coalition will remain their best friend.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Blair for his question, because there have been some developments about which I should inform the House. The International Transfer of Prisoners Act 1997 facilitates the transfer of prisoners between Australia and certain countries with which we have entered into agreements. The Australian government obtained undertakings from the United States to develop such an arrangement to facilitate the return of citizens, in particular Mr Hicks, serving any sentence that might be imposed by a military commission and to serve that sentence in Australia. I am therefore pleased to be able to advise members that this morning the Governor-General, on the advice of the Executive Council, made regulations to give effect to an arrangement between the governments of Australia and the United States. The arrangement, signed in Washington last week, facilitates a transfer to Australia of prisoners sentenced to imprisonment by a military commission. The making of regulations clears the way for Mr Hicks to apply for transfer should he receive a custodial sentence. The arrangement provides for enforcement of the nature and duration of any sentence, so that the Australian government could not unilaterally shorten or dispose of any such sentence.I note that the Leader of the Opposition, when he was asked whether he would honour any sentence, uncharacteristically, I suppose it might be said, declined to give an answer, saying that he would seek advice from the Attorney-General's Department. It is interesting that he needs advice on matters before coming to a view. Perhaps I could be forgiven for having come to a view that the Leader of the Opposition thought the Prime Minister should form views without advice. I simply make the point, and I assure the member for Griffith that the arrangement with the United States is such that only the United States can pardon a prisoner.I spoke earlier this week with the Premier of South Australia, Mr Rann, and I explained to him the law dealing with the handling of Commonwealth prisoners. I note that he indicated that he would be positively disposed to an application from Mr Hicks to serve out any sentence in South Australia if that situation arose. The Australian government will of course work quickly to progress any application if that situation arises.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Corangamite for his question. The purpose of superannuation is to build up savings during a person's working life so that when they cease working and do not have an income they can draw down on those savings to look after themselves. In the private sector an employer puts aside money every time they pay you, and it goes into a superannuation fund and you cannot touch it until the preservation age. It can be drawn down when you need to draw down on savings.The Commonwealth government has never put aside money to pay for superannuation for its employees. As a consequence, we currently have an unfunded liability of about $100 billion, and that is growing. A very large component of that is Australia's defence forces. The men and women of Australia's defence forces are, of course, entitled to superannuation, but that is unfunded. This government is building savings to ensure that those liabilities can be paid when they fall due. In doing that, we will make sure that we do not transfer the debts of today to the children of tomorrow.This is what Liberal and National Party policy is all about: doing something for future generations, not passing on generationally transmitted debt but making sure that this generation funds its debts and passes on opportunity to young Australians, and it is young Australians that we really want to help with the removal of Labor debt and with saving for the future. If you take money from future generations to pay for your election promises, at the end of the day the election comes and the election goes and the liability is still there and unfunded. Anybody who knows anything about superannuation knows that superannuation has to be a locked box. We have no higher authority for that than the member for Lilley himself, who is on the record time after time after time demanding that the Future Fund be a locked box.All the states are now funding superannuation to greater or lesser degrees. Apart from Mr Brian Burke, who tried to get hold of Western Australian superannuation to prop up Rothwells Bank, no state government has tried to raid its superannuation fund to date. But there have been proposals, and I came across a proposal in September 2005, where various business groups went to the Victorian government and asked it to draw down on the superannuation fund for the biotechnology industry - a very good cause, the industry of the future. Business asked the Victorian government to direct its superannuation funds into the biotech industry. In response, Treasurer John Brumby told the Age:The premier and I are as one on this issue.                         _                   _                   _The state will not be requiring any superannuation funds to invest in the biotech industry, full stop. ... We don't mandate at a federal or at a state level what superannuation funds should invest in.That is quite right - and a very good decision. I am reminded that the member for Lalor was a one-time chief of staff to Mr Brumby. Let me say this: John Brumby was right; Victoria was right. Once you start using superannuation funds for hobby horses of politicians, everybody is at risk, not just state superannuation funds, not just private sector superannuation funds, but the Commonwealth as well. The Future Fund was not built up for Labor Party election promises. It was built up for the men and women of Australia's defence forces, and it was built up for future generations.This Leader of the Opposition will come and he will go, but if he is remembered as the person who established the principle no other state has yet breached - that it is legitimate for political parties to raid superannuation funds for their election promises - he will have done this country a great disservice. This should never happen - and, if the coalition is elected, it will not happen. But if the Labor Party gets its way superannuation throughout Australia will be at political risk.</DOC>

 - I will direct the Leader of the Opposition's attention to the ABARE study, which spelt out in detail the implications of a 60 per cent reduction by the year 2050. I would invite - I would not be so presumptuous as to direct - the Leader of the Opposition to use common sense and extrapolate that and imagine what the implications are of the other proposition he has embraced, and that is a 30 per cent reduction by the year 2020.What the Leader of the Opposition is arguing is that in a bare 13 years we cut by 30 per cent our consumption of electricity and that we cut by 30 per cent our use of motor vehicles and trucks, our agricultural activities and all the other things that contribute to greenhouse gas emissions. That would do great damage to the Australian economy. It would cost tens of thousands of jobs, particularly in the coal industry. It is a scenario that I do not embrace. While ever this government remains in office we will not sell out the medium and longer term interests of the Australian economy and the medium and long-term interests of Australian workers for a particular commitment to a specific target. What we on the contrary will embrace is an approach that in a practical way, as outlined by the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources, tackles the problem of deforestation around the world. Deforestation in fact contributes more to greenhouse gas emissions than does the entirety of the contribution of the transport sector. If we were able to achieve even modest outcomes in relation to deforestation, the greenhouse gas emissions eliminated thereby would far exceed those postulated by the implementation of the Kyoto protocol. What we need in relation to climate change are decisions taken by people who have been tested by experience and who understand that you need a balanced approach which produces a measured reduction in greenhouse gas emission but not at the price of destroying thousands of jobs for Australian workers, particularly in the coalmining industry.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hinkler for his question, and I am happy to inform him and the House that the government's broader health cover legislation has just passed through the parliament. That is very good news for the 59,000 people in Hinkler who enjoy the benefits of private health insurance. I confess that this is complex legislation, but there are two significant changes that it brings about. Firstly, the private health funds will be able to cover from their main tables out-of-hospital treatment that reasonably substitutes for or prevents in-hospital treatment.Secondly, the funds will be required to provide much greater information about their products, and the Private Health Insurance Ombudsman will provide a comparative product website to enable patients to make more informed choices about the particular product which best suits them. Over time, these changes should mean that private health insurance is a more customer-friendly product, a more patient-friendly product, and that should build on the nine million Australians who currently enjoy the security and choice which private health insurance brings.I have to say that everyone knows where the Howard government stands on private health insurance. We believe that a strong private health system is an essential complement to a strong public health system, to a strong Medicare system. But no-one knows where members opposite really stand. What we do know is that, deep down, members opposite hate private health. Deep down, they hate private health, and if they ever got the chance, they would rip the guts out of private health insurance by abolishing the private health insurance rebate or by means testing. -  - They say, 'Rubbish!' now. That is not what they will say when they have the chance to give a considered opinion. The member for Gellibrand, the shadow health minister, said that the government should spend less on private health and it should instead spend more on public hospitals. Do you deny that, do you? What did you say? - Bill Shorten, the incoming member for Maribyrnong, recently called the private health insurance rebate:... a subsidy to the rich.He said it created:... a bonanza for the multinational insurance companies.Just last week in the Senate, Senator Sterle - who I believe is a new senator from Western Australia; he is probably Burkie's latest addition to the Western Australian contingent in this parliament - said of the private health insurance rebate that it was 'a monumental failure', 'shonky' and 'a monstrous failure'.That is what those opposite say about the private health insurance rebate. How can they credibly expect anyone to believe that they would not rip the guts out of it if they had the chance in government? How can they say they support something which they are constantly criticising? What all this means is that, when it comes to private health, you just cannot trust Labor. I know that the Leader of the Opposition does not like being called Dr Death, but how can we be sure that he will not kill the private health insurance rebate stone dead?</DOC>

 - In relation to the last part of the question, I cannot update the House because I am not the taxpayer and, as the member knows, the secrecy provisions of the taxation act prevent my knowing the details. The New South Wales government knows the details, and I suspect that the member for New England is closer to the New South Wales government than I am. Perhaps, therefore, through you, Mr Speaker, he would be able to obtain an indication from the New South Wales government.I am quite surprised, given the importance of this issue to the communities affected, that we do not know what the tax office has communicated to the New South Wales government. I do not blame the tax office for that; I blame the New South Wales government. I think the New South Wales government has deliberately played around with this issue. It played around with it before the New South Wales election and it continues to play around with it. I want the issue resolved, and I assume the member for New England wants the issue resolved.The person who really drove a proper re-examination of this issue is the member for Gwydir, the former Leader of the National Party. He organised a delegation of irrigators to my Sydney office almost a year ago. They persuaded me that the whole cast of the approach being taken in relation to this matter by the New South Wales government, which was denying the capital nature of the transaction, was completely wrong. I hope the substance of the communication to the New South Wales government from the tax office reflects that, but I do not know. And I cannot know without the permission of the taxpayers. The member for New England knows that I cannot know, and he must have had that in mind when he asked me the question.In relation to the first part of the question asked by the member, the design of the scheme is that there are really two elements. The first element is to provide infrastructure investment to restore the irrigation systems of this country. I do not rule out the second part, which involves buying back of water overallocations, buying back of excess water entitlements. I do not seek at this stage to be totally prescriptive as to what form that assistance might take, but that is the general design of the scheme.</DOC>

 - First, can I thank the honourable member for Pearce for her question and her interest. I think people from Zimbabwe reside in her own electorate, so she has a real interest in this. The barbaric actions of the Mugabe regime in Zimbabwe just continue. Overnight, Morgan Tsvangirai, who is the Leader of the Opposition in Zimbabwe, was detained by Zimbabwean authorities. The headquarters of his party, the MDC, were raided. This is part of a campaign of intimidation by President Mugabe. It is a campaign of intimidation which is not just being resisted by a courageous opposition in Zimbabwe; it is an opposition which will be supported by many in the international community.This kind of behaviour is not going to cover up the complete destruction by President Mugabe and his cronies of that beautiful country. Their vindictive brutality is designed to hide their shameful incompetence. Our ambassador and our embassy in Harare have been monitoring the situation closely and have been constantly reporting to us. We will continue to argue our case for a free and democratic Zimbabwe, not one which is beholden to a leader like President Mugabe.The Prime Minister and I have said on a number of occasions that we are encouraging the African leadership more generally to do what it can to place more pressure on ZANU-PF, President Mugabe's party, to resolve these problems in Zimbabwe. Yesterday the Prime Minister and I met with the President of Uganda and the Minister of Foreign Affairs. We took the opportunity, the Prime Minister in particular, during lunch with him to press our case on Zimbabwe. I hope that the President of Uganda will take that message back not just to his own country but to leaders around Africa.Today, 29 March, the heads of government of the Southern African Development Commission are meeting - there are 14 countries in SADC - and I believe they are going to discuss the crisis in Zimbabwe. I very much hope that SADC will deliver a strong message to President Mugabe, telling him that his brutal tactics are no longer tolerated and that far-reaching political and economic reform is desperately needed.I mentioned a couple of days ago that we are setting up an Australian fund for Zimbabwe to alleviate some of the worst impacts of President Mugabe's economic failures. We are also doing what we can to support the political and civil rights of ordinary Zimbabweans through our support for non-government organisations and other civil society activities. We will also be keeping in place our targeted sanctions to apply maximum pressure on the Mugabe regime. We very much hope that a broader range of countries than already is the case will support sanctions against the Mugabe regime.I have talked about this issue from time to time over the last couple of weeks, because I think for many Australians what is happening in Zimbabwe simply appals them. Our country, a significant country in the international community, needs to be at the forefront of ideas and action to put pressure on ZANU-PF, President Mugabe's political party, and encourage President Mugabe to stand down.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Stirling for the question. I note that, in 1996, the unemployment rate in Stirling was 9.4 per cent, and today it is 5.2 per cent. Good news there, Mr Speaker! The economic reforms of past years have helped to deliver a strong economy today, and today's reforms help to deliver a strong economy for tomorrow. All the reforms undertaken by this government - such as getting the budget back into surplus, paying off $96 billion of Labor government debt, taxation reform, reform of the waterfront - have been opposed by the Labor Party. More recently, the Labor Party has opposed the Future Fund -  - and now want to raid the Future Fund, as the Treasurer reminds me. All of those initiatives, including the changes to workplace relations, have helped to deliver a stronger economy. One of the most significant groups which has benefited from the changes to workplace relations has been women. Since March 2006, when Work Choices was introduced, employment for women has risen by 113,500 jobs. Most significantly, 87 per cent of those 113,500 jobs have been full-time jobs. Since March 1996, the participation rate of women in the workforce has increased from 53.7 per cent to 57.6 per cent. The wages of women in the workforce have increased in real terms by more than 22 per cent. That is pretty positive stuff.Everyone is wondering what the Labor Party's policy is on workplace relations. You should not have to go too far because the chief spokesman for the Labor Party, Greg Combet, and his deputy, Sharan Burrow, are out there every day defending the Labor Party's workplace relations policy, which is to reintroduce pattern bargaining, reintroduce the unfair dismissal laws, centralise the industrial relations system and so on. We have heard a bit of speculation recently that the Leader of the Opposition is seeking to manufacture a 'Blair moment' at the national conference - that is, to set up a straw man and then knock him over. He is going to pretend that he is being tough on the unions. I wondered to myself, 'What is a Blair moment?' I went back to what I think is a pretty impressive speech from Tony Blair at the Trades Union Congress, Brighton, on 9 September 1997. That was 10 years ago. In that speech Tony Blair commits to reduce tax - of course, the Labor Party oppose that. He commits to welfare to work - and the Labor Party in Australia oppose that. He said:We will keep the flexibility of the present - labour - market. And it may make some shiver, but ... in the end it is warmer in the real world.He is saying that he is going to keep the reforms of the Tory government, the Thatcher government, and continue them because they are in the best interests of the workers of Britain. If that is a Blair moment, we cannot expect that from Kevin. The Leader of the Opposition speculated on what 'a Kevin' is. We know what a Kevin is: it is Sharan Burrow putting a half-nelson on the Leader of the Opposition. That is a Kevin. He is going to pretend that it is him putting a half-nelson on Sharan Burrow. - What we do know, as the member for Stirling would know, from the well-written editorial in the Western Australian today is:His - meaning the Leader of the Opposition - failure to break ranks with the unions locks him into a regression to industrial turmoil, which ACTU secretary Greg Combet has referred to as the good old days when unions ran the country. Even if it was intended as a joke, it was revealing of union ambitions and demands of a possible Labor government.It is not the Australian Labor Party; it is the Australian union party. It is funded by the unions, its policy is written by the unions and, significantly, the union bosses are coming into parliament to replace all the patsies here.</DOC>

 - It is going to disappoint the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, but I am not going to give a running commentary on something she holds up in question time or an investigation by the Office of Workplace Services. But I do make this point: the real spokesman for the Labor Party, Greg Combet -  - The real spokesman on industrial relations for the Labor Party, Greg Combet, has said that it is okay for him to trade penalty rates off -  - The Deputy Leader of the Opposition is not the real spokesman on industrial relations for the Labor Party - Greg Combet is. Greg Combet said that, on many occasions, he has traded off penalty rates for higher wages. -  - If it is okay for Greg Combet to trade away penalty rates, why isn't it okay for individuals to negotiate their own employment outcome? The Labor Party does not like that. The Labor Party never likes to take into account the interests of the workers because it is just a party for the union bosses.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Lindsay for her question and for her very passionate support for small businesses. Over the past 12 months, small businesses have been speaking out very strongly in support of the Howard government exempting them from Labor's unfair dismissal laws. Since becoming the Leader of the Opposition, the member for Griffith has said that Labor would listen to small business on this very important issue of unfair dismissals. In fact, when asked on ABC radio on 28 March about the Labor Party's policy on unfair dismissals, the Leader of the Opposition said in no uncertain terms:Julia Gillard at present is working that through with the small business community ... trying to get the balance rightEarlier, on Channel 10, the deputy leader said:I'm prepared to talk to small business on the substance of their concerns and see what we can do to address those concerns. That's a genuine offer, it's a serious offer.Then, of course, we had the member for Rankin - who unfortunately appears to have gone missing in action - in a memorable interview with Madonna King on 28 February. He said:_ we will take account of the special circumstances of small businesses in developing our policies and we have not arrived at a position on how we will do that in terms of a precise policy because that will be released after we consult _Small business today has spoken out very strongly with one voice. It is now time for the Labor Party to demonstrate whether in fact they have been listening. I can tell you, Mr Speaker, that after listening to the member for Rankin, the Small Business Coalition, a group of 26 small business groups, today released their policy statement which sets down their opposition to any changes to the current exemption from unfair dismissals.I think that we should know exactly who the members of the Small Business Coalition are. Let me tell you. They are the Association of Consulting Engineers, the Australian Newsagents Federation, the Australian Petroleum Agents and Distributors Association, the Retailers Association, the Council of Small Business Organisations of Australia, the CPA, the Franchise Council of Australia, Master Builders Australia, the Motor Trades Association of Australia, the National Farmers Federation, the Pharmacy Guild of Australia, the Real Estate Institute of Australia, and Restaurant and Catering Australia, plus the state chambers of commerce from the ACT, Western Australia, Queensland, Tasmania, Victoria and New South Wales.Let me advise the House of what all 26 of these small business organisations have come out today and said with one voice:A key WorkChoices reform for small business was the introduction of the exemption for small and medium businesses from unfair dismissal claims. This exemption has finally provided small businesses with increased confidence in hiring, demonstrated by increased employment levels following the introduction of WorkChoices.The SBC considers retention of this fundamental exemption as absolutely essential to ongoing growth and success of small businesses.Importantly, all 26 of them say -  -  - I can stand here for as long as is necessary to get this on the record. Importantly, they say:Any moves to roll back or water down these reforms would be against the interests of small businesses.It is now time for the opposition to release their unfair dismissal policy. They have an opportunity. Who is the Leader of the Opposition listening to: small business or Greg Combet? I will table the list of all of those small business organisations.</DOC>

 - I refuse to accept the facts provided by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. That might come as a rude surprise to some, but I have been misled by her on a few facts previously. I know that is hard to believe, but it is quite true. I will tell you what: there is nothing family friendly about 11 per cent unemployment. There is nothing family friendly about real wages decreasing as they did under the Labor Party. I have been sitting there wondering what the motivation of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition would be on this last sitting day before Easter to ask this question. I reflected on the fact that it was Sharan Burrow who said that Santa Claus would not come last Christmas because of Work Choices. Now we have the Deputy Leader of the Opposition invoking Darrell Lea and saying the Easter bunny is not going to come this Easter. I say to her: leave the kiddies alone. They deserve to think the Easter bunny is coming this Easter.Leave granted.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Canning for his question. As he will know, this week the state governments finally came clean with comparative schools test results in literacy and numeracy, which finally gave parents a national perspective, a national picture, of what is going on in our classrooms, although the data was two years late in coming. Not surprisingly, parents had raised concerns about the worrying decline in standards in reading and mathematics. It seemed that students' skills were getting worse the longer they were in school.So what did the state Labor education ministers and the education unions say in response? In Western Australia, the results were the worst in the country. According to the West Australian newspaper, WA students rated lowest for the three 'Rs' - their primary students were amongst the worst in the nation when it comes to reading, writing and arithmetic. It found that Western Australia had the highest percentage of students failing to reach the national benchmark in five of nine categories and that the state standards were dropping, with the 2005 results worse than the 2004 results in six of the nine categories. The West Australian Labor minister blamed the federal government for those results. Apparently he does not take any responsibility for what goes on in his schools.In Victoria the year 3 reading results were below the national average. The Labor Party in Victoria thought that that was a testament to their continued commitment to the highest standards. They do not meet the national benchmarks, but they think that is a testament to the highest standards. The Australian Education Union Victorian branch head, Mary Bluett, thought it was all a cause for celebration.In Queensland, the education minister actually welcomed the Australian government's additional $1.8 billion to lift literacy and numeracy standards, but this is a man who dismisses calls for higher standards in literacy and numeracy as a tired old cliche. The Queensland Council of Parents and Citizens Associations could not disagree with him more. In fact, they are calling for a refocus on the teaching of the three Rs in classrooms, according to the Courier-Mail, and are asking that the Labor education minister refocus on teaching the fundamentals.The Queensland Teachers Union, though, have come up with the answer. Instead of teaching the fundamentals, including spelling and punctuation, they want us to just replace it with text messaging. As reported in the Courier-Mail today, spelling is overrated; apparently it just gets in the way, and the Queensland Teachers Union President, Steve, Ryan, has accused those who are pushing a traditional curriculum of reading, writing and mathematics of 'outdated thinking'. So, while the Howard government is assisting 16,000 students who have been failed by the state school system with reading assistance vouchers that are helping students on a one-on-one basis to meet reading and writing standards, the teachers union have given up. They think that young people can get by in this world by text messaging.</DOC>

 - Unlike the Leader of the Opposition, I know what my party's policy is. I take the opportunity of reminding this House that last Friday I announced that the government would legislate a fairness test in relation to those circumstances where any employee might agree to trade away such things as penalty rates and overtime. The purpose of the fairness test will be to ensure that fair compensation has been given in return. We have decided to introduce this fairness test because, when the legislation was put through more than a year ago, it was never the intention that it become the norm that such things as penalty rates and overtime would be traded away without proper compensation.I also take the opportunity of reminding the parliament, and in particular reminding the Leader of the Opposition, that since the introduction of Work Choices more than 276,000 new jobs have been created, real wages have continued to rise and unemployment has hit a 32-year low, while strike action is now lower than at any time since 1913.You may have heard me say those things before, and you will hear me say those things again in the future. But I will add another thing you will hear me say a great deal of in the future, and that is that long-term unemployment in this country, namely the measure of people who have been out of work for more than a year, is now at its lowest level since that particular statistic began to be kept. In fact, it has fallen by 22 per cent over the last year. So I conclude, in responding to the Leader of the Opposition, by saying that I think I am across the detail of our policy, and the minister is across the detail. I suggest the Leader of the Opposition bone up on his own policy.</DOC>

 - I might best answer that question from the member for Hasluck by asking him to come along at half past seven tonight to hear the Treasurer, who has been the principal architect within the government of our great economic prosperity, outline the plan on behalf of the government. But without in any way pre-empting my colleague, let me say that the sorts of policies that have brought us to a situation where we are now enjoying the longest unbroken economic expansion in Australia's history are not things that have come by happenstance. There is a line being run by the opposition that the economy is something out there and it does not matter who runs it, it will keep going well - as if the economy were on autopilot. The truth is that the strong economy we now have is the result of decisions taken by this government over the last 11 years - difficult decisions, all of which, incidentally, have been opposed by the Australian Labor Party. The Australian Labor Party opposed us getting the budget into surplus, they opposed us paying off $96 billion of government debt, they opposed the first round of industrial relations reform, they opposed waterfront reform, they opposed taxation reform, they opposed the second round of industrial relations reform and they opposed the sale of Telstra - although they are now happy to use that as a launching pad for their own attempts to raid the Future Fund in the name of providing this country with broadband when, in reality, it is not the business of taxpayers to fund broadband; it should be a product of the proper operation of the market circumstances of our economy.The member for Hasluck asked me if I am aware of any alternative policy. One alternative policy I am aware of - I think I am aware of it, because it keeps changing - is the industrial relations policy of the Leader of the Opposition. Isn't it interesting? We now have a situation where the real extremists on industrial relations are the members of the Australian Labor Party. They are the people that would hand industrial relations in this country over to the union bosses. You can be certain of these things about Labor's industrial relations policy: firstly, they will put union power ahead of workers' jobs; secondly, they will bring back the job-destroying unfair dismissal laws; and, thirdly, they will hand over to an industrial relations system dominated by collective bargaining - a return of union power at a time when trade unions in this country are peopled by only 15 per cent of the private sector workforce. Only 15 per cent of the private sector workforce of this country now choose to belong to a trade union, yet the Labor Party want to give union power and union bosses 100 per cent control of our industrial relations system. Maybe that has got something to do with the fact that 60 to 70 per cent of the Labor Party frontbench are former union officials.</DOC>

 - I can give an unequivocal response to the member for Deakin, who is doing a remarkable job as chairman of the government members task group on industrial relations reform, in saying that the hallmark of this government's policies concerning workplace relations has been to produce greater stability. We have made three major changes to the industrial relations laws in the 11 years we have been in office: there were the Reith reforms of 1996, bitterly opposed by the Labor Party; there were the changes to the operation of Australia's waterfront - we were told you could not possibly have any more than 17 or 18 crane movements of containers per hour, yet, as a result of the changes that have been introduced, we now have world's best practice performance of something like 27 or 28 an hour; and then, of course, there have been the changes introduced by the government through the Work Choices legislation. All of these changes have improved the flexibility of the Australian economy.The sad thing is that the alternative government of this country want to destroy that flexibility. They talk about fairness with flexibility or 'forward with fairness and flexibility', but the reality is that their policy would destroy that flexibility. Their policy would create a situation where, if 51 per cent of people in a workplace voted in favour of a collective agreement, the employer - the person who invests the money to employ the people and to start the business - would have no right to have a workplace agreement with any one of the remaining 49 per cent. They would introduce a system which says that, if you had 100 employees in a firm and 99 of them wanted to negotiate as a group with the employer, one person could say, 'I want the union to represent me in the negotiation' - nothing wrong with that, no objection to that, no objection at all. But, under the other provisions of the policy, if there were not an agreement reached with the union representing that one person, it would then go off to this body called Fair Work Australia, where an arbitrated solution or outcome would be imposed on the employer and the 99 employees. I do not call that 'forward with fairness and flexibility'; I call that backwards with inflexibility and unfairness - and that is a feature of the policy.What is fascinating about this policy is that the Leader of the Opposition is not across the detail of it. Time and time again he was asked questions about the policy and he brushed them off. He said, 'I have left all of that to the deputy leader; I am not quite across all the detail of it.' My advice, through you, Mr Speaker, to the Leader of the Opposition is: you had better get across the detail of it very quickly, because when you are in the sort of position you occupy you should be across the detail of your policy. You should understand the implications it has for workers. You should understand that what you have done is to hand back the power of trade unions' control over Australia's industrial relations position.The real story of Labor's industrial relations saga is that the Leader of the Opposition was running around the business community saying, 'Don't worry, it will be all right: I will not be stood over by the trade unions.' He goes along to his national conference, he hands it over to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, she goes off and does a deal with Greg Combet and, lo and behold, the business community comes out shaking its head and saying, 'This is the same old Labor Party, the mob that always cave in to the union bosses.'</DOC>

 - I can inform the House that between now and the caretaker period, whenever that may begin - and I have not the faintest idea, for the information of the Leader of the Opposition - there will be no bad policies from this government; and between the caretaker period and the election there will not be bad policies either, not from our side of politics. But I am already seeing a lot of bad policy from the other side.To start with, we have an industrial relations policy which is an absolute dog's breakfast for the Labor Party. I cannot believe it. They were running around telling Australians that we had an extreme industrial relations policy. They are the people with the extreme policy. It is the Australian Labor Party that wants to hand over workplaces not to workers or to employers; they want to hand over the control of workplaces to trade unions, which represent only 15 per cent of the private sector workforce.I saw the Leader of the Opposition speaking in Brisbane. He was addressing a rally. That is fine; we all like addressing rallies - and I will not make any comment about that. But what he has to understand is that, when you have a business, somebody invests money in that business, and the somebody who invests the money actually takes the risk. I think there is something fundamentally unfair about an industrial relations policy that says that, if an employer wants to make an agreement with some of his employees of a certain kind, he will be prohibited by law from making that agreement. That is the consequence of what the Leader of the Opposition has proposed. Let me take him back again to his policy. I know he does not understand it, but let me tell him what his policy means.Let me tell the Leader of the Opposition that, if you have a firm of 100 people and 51 per cent of those vote in favour of a collective agreement, it means that the man or the woman who started the business - who put up the capital, who took the risk, who borrowed the money and, in the case of a small business, probably mortgaged their house in order to secure the business overdraft - has no right to make an agreement with one of the other 49 people. I think that is outrageous and I think that is unfair. The fact that the Leader of the Opposition supports such a policy shows that he does not know anything about small business in this country. Not only will he support something like that; he will also support a situation where, on top of that, the employer will once again be burdened with the outrageous unfair dismissal laws, which create a situation where it becomes impossible to properly manage your business in certain circumstances. So I say to the Leader of the Opposition that if he is talking about bad policy I suggest he have a read of his own party's policy on industrial relations.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Cowper for his question. Obviously and self-evidently, the best thing that this government has done for regional Australia is that it has kept the Australian economy strong; got rid of debt; put ourselves in a position where we can continue to invest in infrastructure across Australia, particularly in regional Australia and in regional economies; and supported regional economies. A lot of the reforms that the Prime Minister mentioned earlier in question time have delivered us into a situation where the Australian economy is one of the strongest in the world, where there is downward pressure on interest rates, where unemployment is at a 30-year low and where we are experiencing the lowest level of industrial disputes on record - imagine that under a coalition government - where we continue to run budget surpluses and where we are net savers rather than net borrowers, as we used to be under previous Labor governments.The member for Cowper asked about policies that benefit regional Australia. Of course, the coalition government has continued to work in partnership with regional communities to find answers to some of their problems and to assist them in addressing the questions they have about strengthening their economies. There have been a number of programs that we have been able to support and fund as a result of that strong economic management in Australia. We have been able to fund programs without having to borrow the money to do it, and we have been able to fund them out of surpluses. The Sustainable Regions Program is one and the Regional Partnerships Program is another. That is a great program for regional Australia, and I know that those members of the Labor Party that have been recipients of grants under Regional Partnerships in their electorates have welcomed them as well. In that program, since 2003 we have funded more than 1,266 projects worth more than $1.2 billion. Our contribution has been $278 million worth of taxpayers' money, which has leveraged $1.2 billion worth of projects in regional Australia. That is $972 million in cash and in-kind contributions coming from those communities. Every $50,000 that we have invested in those communities has generated three new jobs. That is taxpayers' money invested wisely in regional communities - generating new jobs in those communities.That investment has seen a significant fall in unemployment in regional Australia. Sixty-four per cent of regional areas across Australia now have unemployment rates of less than five per cent. When Labor was last in power only 16 per cent of regional Australia had unemployment rates of less than five per cent. It is now 64 per cent under the coalition government because we have been targeting investment in those communities. We have been keeping the economy strong, investing in infrastructure in those communities and creating an environment where the private sector has been generating employment. Those targeted policies have worked.We are watching a slow rollout of some policies from the Labor Party this year, but how are the Labor Party putting together their policies? There is one word to describe how the Labor Party are doing it: outsourcing. They are outsourcing their policy development. They have outsourced their industrial relations policy to the ACTU and we read in the paper they are going to outsource economic policy to the Democrats. They have outsourced their preselection process to the union movement, and now they are getting a bit of a backlash from their rank and file members about the preselection process. They have outsourced the defence of their industrial relations policy to the old head-kicker, Paul Keating. We want to see more of him on the television. We want to see more of Paul Keating defending Kevin Rudd's policies in the media because that will help us a hell of a lot. The Labor Party have outsourced their policy development to the dinosaurs of the past. We will continue to develop our own policies in the interests of all Australians, in particular regional Australians, who have seen a significant improvement in their economic fortunes.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Stirling for his question. I note that the unemployment rate in Western Australia is now 2.7 per cent, and by the time of the next election one in five workers in Western Australia will be on an AWA. This government has never supported compulsory union bargaining fees. Working Australians should have the right to choose whether they are members of a union or not, and working Australians should have the right to choose whether they pay fees to union bosses or not. We believe strongly in this right. Indeed, today I have announced that the prohibition on compulsory union bargaining fees will now be enshrined in legislation. Previously it was included in the regulations, but the government wants to make this a core issue in the legislation.I was asked about alternative views. It is hard to keep up with the alternative views because the Labor Party keeps changing their alternative views. Just as I am getting across this wonderful document, Forward with fairness, it changes - in fact, it has changed five times in 10 days. When it comes to bargaining fees, I note that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has just put out quite a cute press release trying to claim it was not in their policy, but she omitted the key section. Page 14 of the policy of the Labor Party says:Under Labor's system, bargaining participants will be free to reach agreement on whatever matters suit them.And when she went on Neil Mitchell's program - and we are all intrigued about this - he asked:_ are we getting to the essence of this now then that bargaining fees are banned at the moment ... under your system - that is, the Labor system - they wouldn't be banned, they'd be there for negotiations. Is that a fair comment?And Gillard replied yes.So, imagine: I am eating my Weeties this morning, and I picked up the Australian. On the front page of the Australian they say that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has released a new policy overnight on the internet. So I go to the internet. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition says:Consequently, agreements containing matters like union preference clauses in hiring or promotion, bargaining fees and preference for particular, highly unionised contractors will not be lawful.Another change! So, during the course of the night, you can imagine the Deputy Leader of the Opposition saying furiously: 'Gee, we're burning a bit on this bargaining issue. We'll go and put out a press release via the internet to the Australian, changing laws.'This is the fifth backflip in 10 days. Their policy is unravelling. Policy No. 1: they said they were going to have a one-stop shop. Within 24 hours, the Labor Party realised that they were in breach of the doctrine of the separation of powers. So now the one-stop shop is a two-stop shop.Secondly - oops - they set down 10 minimum standards but they forgot to add in the minimum wage. The minimum wage - how could you forget that? You can imagine Greg Combet and Julia Gillard sitting there and negotiating on Greg Combet coming into parliament. They forgot to put in the minimum wage. They are so concerned about the workers out there that they forgot to put in a minimum wage! After the Australian asked the Deputy Leader of the Opposition's office about that, it reported:Ms Gillard's proposed 10 legislated minimum standards also omitted a minimum wage, but her office insists there will now be 11 conditions ...Eleven! Imagine Moses coming down from Mount Sinai. He has been carrying these tablets. He has got 10 commandments. Someone is there with a hammer and chisel, belting away at the minimum wage. Hard work!The third reversal is on page 9 of their policy. The Australian Labor Party will:... guarantee that Australian working families have the flexibility of up to 24 months' unpaid leave to provide care for their child.God bless. Where's the member for Rankin? We need him at this moment. He says that if a small business cannot accommodate a request for an extension of parental leave, it need only write a letter giving its reasons. That does not sound like a guarantee to me. So it is not 24 months guaranteed parental leave; it is the 12 months guarantee which is already in the coalition's legislation. This must be hurting!The fourth issue is pattern bargaining. I quote from page 13 of the Labor Party's policy:Where more than one employer and their employees or unions with coverage in the workplaces voluntarily agree to collectively bargain together for a single agreement they will be free to do so.That was from page 13 of the Labor Party policy, 10 days ago.On The 7.30 Report, Kerry O'Brien put a question to the Leader of the Opposition: 'Do you endorse pattern bargaining where whole industries are brought into line with an enterprise agreement model that has been imposed, coerced - whatever word you want to use - or negotiated with a single company?' Rudd answered: 'That is not the approach we support at all.' So there he was, on The 7.30 Report, reversing the policy. Maybe he didn't know. I think he doesn't know. - I am trying to help, Mr Speaker. So, the fifth change in 10 days: bargaining fees. You know what undoes this opposition? It does not get the policy right. The opposition does not understand its own policy. There are some sad faces there amongst the opposition. It does not get the policy right. It introduced a policy 10 days ago. It has changed five times in 10 days. Its policy is unravelling. The Labor Party is not fit to govern this nation. And on the single biggest test the Leader of the Opposition has had, in introducing a major policy at his own national conference, an economic policy, he gets an 'F' for failure.</DOC>

 - I have nothing to add to the previous answer, but I do make two points. The first is that we believe Australians should know where they stand in relation to the current system. We make no apology for that, and that is in the face of a $100 million union and Labor Party fear campaign. The second point is: isn't it interesting that the biggest criticism the Labor Party have of our policy today is that we are telling the Australian people about it? Do you know what? We wish the Labor Party would spend some money promoting their own IR policy.</DOC>

 - Can I firstly thank the member for Pearce for her question and for her interest. I know that, over in Western Australia particularly, a lot of people are interested in this issue, as are people elsewhere. Firstly, there is no doubt that President Mugabe is trashing democracy in Zimbabwe - the savage crackdown on opposition figures and the systematic oppression of the media clearly mean that democracy is coming to an end in Zimbabwe. Secondly, the economy has been completely crippled. Eighty per cent of Zimbabweans now have no job; life expectancy has fallen, since 1990, from 61 years to just 33 years; and inflation is now at 2,200 per cent. It is a great tragedy when you think of the hopes for Zimbabwe's independence and the faith that was placed by Malcolm Fraser and others in Robert Mugabe as the new leader of that country and then see what has subsequently been delivered.Our cricket team are scheduled to visit Zimbabwe in a few months time to play three one-day games. It is the view of the government that it would be better if they did not go. It is a common argument, and one I am largely sympathetic with, that you should try to separate sport from politics, but the fact is the Australian cricket team are caught in a political situation through no fault of their own - that is, if they were to go to Zimbabwe they would create great political controversy. Back here in Australia there is no doubt that, on the one hand, President Mugabe and his regime in Zimbabwe would make propaganda capital out of such a visit. On the other hand, of course, if the Australian cricket team do not go to Zimbabwe there will be a suggestion that they did not go for political reasons. But either way they are in a political situation which is not of their own making. It is certainly the view of the government that we do not want the world's greatest cricket team to be caught up in a propaganda exercise for a wretched regime like President Mugabe's.The Prime Minister and I have made our views clear on this. I have spoken with the CEO of Cricket Australia and I will be meeting with them more generally towards the end of this week in Melbourne. We will have to work through the details. If the Australian cricket team do not visit Zimbabwe then a penalty will have to be paid, as there is a contract with the International Cricket Council, of at least $US2 million - $A2.4 million. That money would go to the Zimbabwe Cricket Union by way of compensation for loss of gate earnings, television and radio earnings and so on. Of course, some people will say, 'It's pretty unfortunate if Cricket Australia have to pay out that sort of money,' but the government would certainly cover the costs of that for Cricket Australia. Others will say, 'That money shouldn't go to Zimbabwe at all. Won't President Mugabe's regime get hold of some of that money? Won't they be able to use it?' However, if the cricket team go to Zimbabwe the money will be earned in any case. So the fact that the contract exists means that, almost certainly, there will be some transfer of money to the Zimbabwe Cricket Union. We obviously hope in those circumstances that the money would be spent on cricket development, not on anything else.The point is that it would be much better if the Australian cricket team were not allowed to go to Zimbabwe - so not enabling the Zimbabwean government to exploit a visit of that kind - and if the greats of Australian cricket were not put in a difficult, if not embarrassing, situation with the likes of President Mugabe. I hope we can find a satisfactory way through this to persuade Cricket Australia that this tour should be cancelled.</DOC>

 - I cannot comment on a document I have not seen. - But if we are to be criticised for listening to the Australian people then we plead guilty. It is a shame the Labor Party does not listen to the Australian people. It is a shame that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition only consults with Greg Combet and not with Rod Eddington. - Where is Rod Eddington in all of the Labor Party's musings? If the Labor Party consulted people like Rod Eddington, they would know that their industrial relations policy is bad for business and bad for the economy. So I would urge the Labor Party to consult the Australian people and also to give Rod a call.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Riverina for her question. She well knows, as do so many other members of the House, the severe and prolonged effect of the drought - which before the recent rains seemed to be never ending. I do hasten, of course, to caution that the recent rains could well prove illusionary in that they were not uniform or heavy enough to break the drought. Nonetheless they are welcome. They have given some hope for the future, but we do need follow-up rain urgently if we are to end the curse of this long drought. A great deal of hardship has been caused to farmers, their families, farm businesses and the general community - not to mention the effect on the Australian economy. It is for this reason that the government has been unstintingly in its support of drought affected farmers, to the extent where, since we relaxed the eligibility criteria late last year, we are now spending $17 million a week on income support and interest rate subsidies for around 19,000 farming families. I would expect that number to continue to grow exponentially. In New South Wales alone, the home state of the member for Riverina, we are providing more than $1 million a day to 8,700 farming families. In Victoria, which is now 100 per cent drought declared, more than $5 million a week is being provided to 6,300 families and businesses. This is a level of support, as the wider Australian community would expect, which is unprecedented but consistent with the extent and severity of the current drought.I was asked about alternative policies. I was interested to observe the goings-on of the Labor Party's national conference, especially its 265-page draft national platform and constitution. Drought gets a mention once, and only in a phrase relating to its impact on our cities. Of course, we expected the agricultural section to be perfunctory and shallow in its analysis, to the extent that it existed, but we did expect drought to be mentioned more than once. It is mentioned only in the sentence which reads:Labor believes the Commonwealth has a responsibility to support innovation in urban planning, which is critical to combating the threat of climate change and the impact of drought on our cities.Labor have always failed to understand farming. We fully understand that. But what we do not accept for a moment is their callous disregard of the greatest problem in Australian agriculture today. It was up to the Leader of the Opposition to rescue the situation. In his 45 to 50 minute diatribe, in which he canvassed all aspects of Labor policy and world affairs, he used 5,772 words to describe his views. He mentioned drought just once. I quote:We have faced great threats in the past - through drought, depression and the threat of invasion.That is it. Well, I have news for the Leader of the Opposition. The threat of drought is not in the past; it is with us now. Farmers and the rural communities of Australia expect a great deal more analysis, commitment and thought from the Labor Party than you have demonstrated. The greatest threat to farming families in Australia, apart from the drought, is the Labor Party.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kalgoorlie for his question. As the member well knows, the Royal Flying Doctor Service, operating from bases at Derby, Port Hedland, Meekatharra and Kalgoorlie-Boulder airports, is an indispensable part of the delivery of health services in that vast area of Western Australia. The Royal Flying Doctor Service is one of the most respected aeromedical services in the world and is a great Australian icon. Although it was the brainchild of the Reverend John Flynn, it only began because it received financial support from the Bruce government, which half-funded the maintenance of its original aircraft back in 1928.In the last financial year, having developed from those times, the Royal Flying Doctor Service flew more than 20 million kilometres. It treated some 237,000 Australians, and it carried out some 34,000 aeromedical evacuations. It did all this on a precarious donation base and with uncertain levels of support from state governments. Last month the Prime Minister committed an additional $154 million to the Royal Flying Doctor Service, bringing total federal funding for this great service to $247 million over the forward estimates period. In the spirit of avoiding the blame game, I would respectfully suggest to the state governments that they would do well to match that federal commitment. While the Leader of the Opposition has already anointed himself as a sure-fire election winner, in front of a May Day rally no less, and while the union heavies are being shoehorned into safe Labor seats in the federal parliament, the Howard government is getting on with the job of delivering ever-improving health services to the people of country Australia.</DOC>

 - Let me say in reply to the question asked by the member for Kennedy that I certainly agree that the least qualified government in Australia to give lectures about efficiency is the Queensland government - although it is a near-run thing with the government of the state that I come from, I have to tell you.I am aware of a lot of concern, especially in rural Queensland, about the arbitrary and very dictatorial way in which the Queensland government has declared that certain councils are inefficient and, whether the councils like it or not, they are going to be amalgamated or abolished. I think it reminds all of us that, when it comes to exercising central power, state governments of Australia of both political persuasions are infinitely worse than federal governments. When I hear state premiers complaining about the centralist tendencies of the national government, I wonder that they have no shame. When it comes to dealing with others, I have watched the views of local residents in the state that I come from being overridden with a flick of the fingers, with the stroke of a pen by the minister for local government - or whatever title he romances under - Mr Sartor, in New South Wales. I saw it happen in Victoria under a government of my own political persuasion, and I think some of the forced amalgamations in Victoria wreaked a very heavy political price on the then Victorian government.I should tell the House that a rally involving more than 1,000 people, many of whom had travelled 700 kilometres, was held at Barcaldine this morning. I am told that Rugby League legend Shane Webcke led the protest march to the tree of knowledge, where the Mayor of Barcaldine, Robert Chandler, and concerned residents of Queensland laid wreaths in protest at the Queensland Labor government's plans. There will be no right of appeal for councils or residents once the decision has been made by Premier Beattie to close the councils; his forced amalgamations have the capacity to affect some 45,000 existing jobs in Queensland - and the member for Kennedy asks me: will we take an interest in this matter? Can we do anything? Let me say that I am already taking a very big interest in this matter, because I think this is an abuse of power. I think you ought to talk to people. These premiers every day of the week are saying, 'Canberra is running roughshod over our rights and our interests,' but, if a local council gets in their way, they essentially rub it out - they put down a regulation; they deal with them in a most contemptuous fashion.I think that the Premier of Queensland has misread the mood and the temper of his own state. My sense, as I move around this country, is that people, so far from developing a lesser sense of local identity, are developing a greater sense of local identity. What they are really saying is that they care about their country and they care about their local community and sometimes, if they have enough time for it, they might care about whatever occupies the middle. But the thing that they worry about most is their nation's welfare and their community's welfare. I think many Queenslanders will feel very angry about this, and many Queenslanders will wonder why the Leader of the Opposition, himself a Queenslander, has remained silent on the subject.Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Moncrieff for his question. The budget which the government announced last night will invest for Australia's future. It will invest in higher education, with an innovative fund called the Higher Education Endowment Fund which will set up for a generation investment in higher education. It will give incentives for apprentices to take up first- and second-year apprenticeships in skills shortage areas. It will improve primary education. It will grow the capacity of the workforce. By improving child care, we will be able to give encouragement to those mothers who want to return to the workforce to do so.Last night I announced income tax cuts for every Australian, which will increase the rewards a little for skill and effort. Our economy has come through a period of continuous economic growth, the like of which we have never had before in Australia. In order to keep Australia strong we now need to boost the capacity of the Australian economy. We will do that with an investment in skills, we will do that with an investment in education, we will do that with a better tax system, we will do that with investment in roads, we will do that with investment in rail, we will do that with our education endowment fund and we will do that with the Future Fund. This is a budget which locks in the benefits and the hard work of the past, and it invests for a future which our country deserves and wants to have.</DOC>

 - The basis on which the Leader of the Opposition asked the question is wrong because, whereas some years ago Austudy assistance was included in the education provision, it is no longer the case, and that gives a radically different outcome. While I am on my feet, can I remind the Leader of the Opposition that, when the government came to power, it inherited a $10 billion annual deficit and a $96 billion debt. As a consequence of that, it was necessary for us to make very significant spending reductions in our first budget. I can well remember that at the time I resolved that the only areas that would be quarantined from expenditure reductions were those relating to essential income support and defence and that every other area of the budget, because of the profligacy and the irresponsibility of the Australian Labor Party, had to bear its share of cuts. So that explains why some decisions were made in 1996.But can I just say to the Leader of the Opposition that this groundbreaking historic commitment of $5 billion into the Higher Education Endowment Fund represents a genuine education revolution. This is an education revolution of which this country can be very proud. It reaches not only into universities but into technical education and schools. The Commonwealth is picking up the ball dropped in many areas by state governments.I say to the Leader of the Opposition that the parents of Australia actually believe that, when their children leave school, they ought to be able to read and write and add up. They think those basics of education ought to be delivered by the education systems, which are the responsibility of the states. We are only too happy to plug the gaps that are emerging. That is why we have introduced this outstanding across-the-board voucher system - a voucher of $700 a year to address literacy and numeracy requirements. It is a wonderful provision and it is a wonderful earnest of this government's long-term commitment to the education future for all Australians.</DOC>

 - It so happens I am aware of those claims. Those claims are made every day by the Leader of the Opposition and by the member for Lilley. They are made every day by people on the front bench of the Labor Party. It is very interesting that that question has been asked of me by the member for Greenway, and the last time I checked there were no iron ore mines in Greenway. The last time I checked there were no major coal deposits in Blacktown. The last time I checked there was no source of gas in the western suburbs of Sydney. -  - You know the gas I am referring to. - Natural gas. It is very interesting that, despite the absence of all of those wonderful commodities, the unemployment rate in Greenway was 8.8 per cent in March 1996 and it is now 4.2 per cent. What the Leader of the Opposition would have us believe is that all of that is due to what is happening in Western Australia and Queensland - that it has all been transported, courtesy of I do not know what, over to the western suburbs of Sydney.The truth is that most sections of the Australian economy have undergone massive growth over the last 10 years. I point out to the House that the December quarter national accounts show that in the year to December 2006 mining output grew by 5.8 per cent in real terms compared to 8.8 per cent in construction, 7.4 per cent in transport and storage, and 6.7 per cent in communication services. The latest statistics of the Australian Taxation Office show that the fastest growth in company income was in fact in finance and insurance, which comprised 23.7 per cent of company income in 2003-04 compared to 25.4 per cent in 2004-05. There is no doubt that it is a great time to be in mining in Australia. There is no doubt that the mining boom is contributing massively to the strength of the Australian economy. But it is totally fallacious to claim that the only reason we are now doing well is that providence gave us a wonderful array of resources that are in great demand around the world. The Australian economy has performed strongly right across the board. Mining has made a great contribution to that.On the subject of mining, there is a risk to the strength of the mining industry in Australia. There is a real risk, and I reminded the people of Western Australia of this when I spoke on Western Australian radio. I pointed out that the real risk to the mining boom is Labor's industrial relations policy. The real risk to the mining boom is the abolition of AWAs. The real risk to the mining boom is to bring back the supremacy of collective bargaining across all the mining operations of this country. The real risk to the mining industry is that this country, once again, if a Labor government were to be elected, would be burdened with an industrial relations policy not serving the interests of the mining industry, not serving the interests of workers in the mining industry, not serving the interests of the future prosperity of our nation but rather serving the interests of union power. That is why if we worry about the mining industry, if we care about the mining industry, we will understand that the greatest threat to the mining industry is the election of a government with the policies of the Australian Labor Party.</DOC>

 - As it turns out, that is not the case. I must say there are traps for young players. -  - I am sorry, there are traps for middle-aged players. I have heard this being recounted on radio over and over again. Let me put the facts on the table. Australian government expenditure on education has increased by 38 per cent in real terms from 1996 to 2007. What the honourable member for Lilley has been unable to fathom, and the Prime Minister explained it to him in the answer to the last question on this, is that Austudy was absorbed into Youth Allowance in the 1998-99 budget and thereafter Austudy - which was about $1.5 billion and had previously been classified as an education outlay - was classified as family and community services outlay. If you add in that $1.4 billion that moved classifications then in fact you do not get that decline at all. A modicum of research would have actually disclosed this to the opposition. But the opposition is not worried about research; the opposition is more worried about tomorrow's headline. - The claims made against the budget have gotten more and more shrill as the last 24 hours have proceeded. First of all we were warned that we should not cut taxes; and now these are tax cuts that were required for working people. We were warned that we had to invest in education; and then when we invest in the biggest build-up of education ever it is not in the right areas. We were warned that we had to have investment in road and rail; and when we have investment in road and rail it is in the wrong areas. If you want to run a $1 trillion economy, you have to get up early and you have to do some work - and that is what the member for Lilley cannot do.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. Last night I announced cuts to income tax for all Australians - for all Australians that pay income tax. We will do that in two stages. In the first stage, we will lift the threshold for paying 30c in the dollar from $25,000 to $30,000, and in the second stage we will lift the threshold for the 40c rate from $75,000 to $80,000 and the threshold for the 45c rate from $150,000 to $180,000. All Australians get an income tax cut as a consequence of that. For those that are on average wages - between $40,000 and $50,000 - this will be a tax cut of $16 a week. That will be helpful for families, it will improve work incentives and it is consistent with our policy.The shell press release that the Labor Party delivered to all its candidates has been sent to me, and I will table it in a moment. I am pleased to see that it starts off as follows:Federal Labor Candidate for &lt;Insert Electorate&gt; Mr/Mrs &lt;Insert Candidate Name&gt; tonight welcomed tax cuts for working families and carers ...That is good. That is in the shell press release that the Labor Party has put out. It continues:'Make no mistake, all &lt;Insert Electorate&gt; families deserve to share in the profits from the mining boom - a boom ...This reads like a text from the Leader of the Opposition on radio this morning - he probably was reading this out. What is the name of his electorate? Insert name here - K. Rudd, electorate Griffith. It continues:'Their inclusion in tonight's budget is welcome', &lt;Insert Candidate Name&gt; said.Mr/Mrs &lt;Insert Candidate Name&gt; said the 2007 Federal Budget was a cynical, pre-election budget.How do you like that? You have got a cynical shell press release which accuses the government of cynicism. You have got to say it has chutzpah. As George Burns famously said, 'Sincerity is everything. If you can fake that, you've got it made.' Cynicism is everything, and, if you can cynically accuse someone of cynicism, you have got it made. There is the shell press release. That is about all the work that the Labor Party did on the federal budget. I table it and will take further questions from that shell press release.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Hinkler for his question. As he has been for some considerable time the chair of the House of Representatives transport committee, I know that he takes a great deal of interest in investment in transport infrastructure in Australia for today and into the future.As the Treasurer has indicated, the budget is about locking in future prosperity in the Australian economy and capitalising on the work that has been done in this country over the last 11 years. There is no aspect of the budget that is more important than the investment in future transport infrastructure in Australia, particularly in our roads and rail networks. Giving certainty in all the areas that we participate in funding and giving certainty to funding partners, both at state and local government level, is well into the future. Last night's announcement in the budget by the Treasurer that we would be committing $22.3 billion to the second stage of AusLink funding for road and rail infrastructure in Australia is a historic increase and a historic commitment to that infrastructure investment in Australia.We have invested $15.8 billion in AusLink 1 and $22.3 billion in AusLink 2, if you want to call it that. A 41 per cent increase in AusLink 2 will take the total 10-year investment of this government in land transport infrastructure to $38 billion - $38 billion over a 10-year period. Part of the budget announcement includes $15.8 billion on the national roads network - significant funding to start planning and detail work on rail infrastructure in Australia. We are already investing and we need to continue to invest. We need to continue the economic growth that is delivering the prosperity that we have in this country and we need to lock that in into the future.Put very simply, the programs that are contained within AusLink build better highways, safer highways and more efficient highways across the nation. They improve local roads, so mums and dads taking their kids to school are much safer. They build safer roads in local communities. They build road and rail systems that will be more efficient in getting our exports to marketplaces across the world. These are serious investments that secure the future prosperity of the Australian economy. As I indicated, we have funding partners in this. We have arrangements with the states and with local government. We expect those arrangements to share the costs and the risks. Commonwealth taxpayers are not going to carry the burden of all the risks. We need to engage with the states. We need to have a serious discussion with them about how this $22 billion will be delivered in the future.There have been some very interesting comments on last night's budget from some interested observers - and from some who have not always been supporters of this government, I might add. The first quote is from a press release from the NRMA in New South Wales. The president of the NRMA, Mr Alan Evans, said:This strong investment in Australia's road network is key to sustaining a growing economy.He went on to say:Tonight's budget is great news for motorists, businesses and industry.The Australian Trucking Association - obviously an organisation that is very interested in the infrastructure investments of the future in Australia - said:We applaud the Australian government on its commitment to land transport.It went on to say:This is a clear sign the Australian government is listening.That is absolutely right. We are working with industry; we are consulting industry. We are also working with communities to address their infrastructure needs in their local areas. I say again: this investment in infrastructure, in the future of Australia, is all about locking in the future growth and the future prosperity that we expect to see in the Australian economy.</DOC>

 - I always analyse what the Leader of the Opposition puts to me, but nothing can gainsay the fact that this education announcement made by the government has been applauded across all sectors of education. Some of the vice-chancellors have said that it is far ahead of anything they ever dreamt of receiving. The truth is that the Leader of the Opposition, who has talked long and hard about an education revolution, now finds himself in the embarrassing position that this government has done far more for education than he has ever promised to do. That is the dilemma of the Leader of the Opposition.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Solomon for his question. I can confirm that, last night, the Treasurer announced an unprecedented investment in our universities - a $1.7 billion package of funds for our universities, plus a $5 billion Higher Education Endowment Fund. The income from this fund, which we estimate to be about $300 million a year, will be distributed to universities. They will be able to use this fund to invest in capital works and research facilities. We believe that over time all universities in Australia will be able to build world-class facilities so that our students will have the opportunity to study in world-class institutions.Our universities will be able build state-of-the-art facilities, science blocks, computer laboratories, libraries and lecture theatres. This will apply to universities across the country, including universities in the member for Solomon's electorate, particularly Charles Darwin University. Charles Darwin will also be eligible for a range of other initiatives contained in this higher education package. The raft of reforms will give our universities the freedom, the flexibility and the funding to manage student demand and to offer courses that students want to study.Last night the Treasurer announced that almost $560 million in additional funds will be available for universities to deliver high-quality courses in areas of national need - in science, maths, engineering, allied health, medicine, dentistry, nursing and teaching. I want to point out that our universities will receive more funding for our teaching courses and more funding to improve the practical experience of student teachers so that our universities will be able to produce high-quality teaching graduates for our schools.We are also going on to support teachers in schools. Teachers will be eligible to apply for Australian government summer schools, where they can upskill their qualifications and abilities in areas and receive a $5,000 bonus on completion. We will also reward schools that make a significant improvement in the literacy and numeracy standards of their students. These schools will be eligible for rewards of up to $50,000.With a total package of $3.5 billion for schools and universities, plus the $5 billion Higher Education Endowment Fund, we have put our schools and universities in a strong position. This was possible only because of the strong economic management of the Howard-Costello government; it was possible only because we had budget surpluses. The Labor Party can only dream of coming up with initiatives that put our universities on a sustainable, long-term footing. This is unprecedented.</DOC>

 - I think the record speaks for itself: continuous economic growth of 3½ per cent per annum, inflation averaged at 2½ per cent per annum, two million additional jobs, unemployment falling from 8½ per cent to 4½ per cent, interest rates falling from 10½ per cent to eight per cent, a budget deficit of $10 billion turning into a budget surplus of $10 billion, $96 billion worth of debt paid off, $100 billion of superannuation liabilities now provisioned with $50 billion of the Future Fund and an endowment fund that will rebuild Australia's educational capacity forever. I think that, if Australians look at the record of this government and compare it with the record of the predecessor government of the Labor Party, they will draw their own conclusions.Having said that, let me make a couple of points in relation to productivity. The first point is that productivity will be enhanced in the Australian economy by a better industrial relations system. There would be nobody in Australia who would believe that by going back to collective bargaining and getting rid of AWAs you would do anything other than detract from productivity. The people who think that include Sir Rod Eddington, the Labor Party adviser in relation to industrial relations, the person the Deputy Leader of the Opposition dismissively refers to as 'another voice' -  - Not true? Not true, she says - she says didn't refer to him as 'another voice'. You didn't call him 'another voice'? We've got that on the record - apparently she did not call him 'another voice'. - What did you call him - not a voice at all? All right, we will get the transcript. But there is no need to be embarrassed about it, because this was the first policy that was released by the Rudd opposition. It was something that you were proud of not so long ago. Maybe some realism is beginning to intervene. I will say, if Labor is embarrassed about its IR policy, that it is a step out of the Stone Age. Let us hope that embarrassment leads to realisation, that realisation leads to change and that change leads to the embracing of AWAs and an industrial relations system that will generate future income for Australia.One of the reasons that productivity in the mining industry at the moment looks as though it has actually turned down is that the mining industry is going through a huge investment phase. If you go through a huge investment phase, if you are in a phase where large investment of capital is going out before you get volume, it shows as productivity declining. Does that mean that the mining industry has suddenly become unproductive? No, it means it is going through a huge investment cycle which, when it leads to more volumes, will actually dramatically increase productivity.One of the other reasons you find that at times of full employment you get temporary downturns in productivity is that you begin to bring back into the workforce people who were previously marginalised - people who have been locked out, people whose skills are not great. But, as you bring them into the workforce, as they learn those skills over a period of time, their productivity matches that of other employees. So you always find that at a time in the cycle when you have near to full employment.With good industrial relations, with good investment, as we make sure that we increase the capacity of the Australian economy, I believe that we have more productivity to unleash in this economy. But I tell you this: we will only unleash productivity in this economy if we are flexible and forward looking. If we go back to centralised industrial relations, if we go back to the old conflict between labour and capital that the ACTU and all of their minions in this parliament believe in, that will be going back to the 20th century, the 19th century or worse. We are about the 21st century, about flexibility. We are the coalition: we build for the future!</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Macquarie for his question. The 2007-08 budget was certainly another very good budget for health. It will be very good for the people of Australia. It will be very good for the people of Macquarie, thanks in part to the new dental school that will be established at Charles Sturt University - which I believe is already being called, in some local circles, the Kerry Bartlett dental school. It is a well-deserved title! 
A government member - Not the Tony Abbott dental school? - No, not the Tony Abbott dental school; not even the Peter Costello dental school - the Kerry Bartlett dental school! I have to say that the new measures in last night's budget are possible only because of the great economic management that has been delivered to this country by the Treasurer and the Prime Minister. New measures in last night's budget will add $4.6 billion to federal government health spending. They will take total health expenditure to $52 billion next year, and they will take health spending as a percentage of total federal government spending to 22 per cent. That is up from just 14 per cent back in 1996. But we are not just spending more money; we are getting better results. According to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, since 1996 there has been a three-year increase in the life expectancy of average Australian males and a two-year increase in the life expectancy of females. That is because of the sensible investment of this government in better health services.It was a particularly good budget for people with chronic disease. In addition to care plans from their GPs, people with multiple conditions will soon benefit from longer consultations with specialist physicians, and that measure is estimated to cost some $291 million. But even more importantly, for people with chronic conditions whose poor oral health is impacting on their general health, there is now greatly expanded access to Medicare funded dentistry. Instead of just three consultations a year, under Medicare those patients will be eligible for an initial consultation and up to $2,000 worth of subsequent treatment a year.We are not relieving the states of their responsibility for public dentistry but we will not leave people in health crisis. Many of the 650,000 people on those public dental waiting lists will be eligible for a team care plan. My message to them is this: the Howard government will not let you down. It is a tribute to the way the Treasurer has managed health that it was only after question time began that we finally heard from the member for Gellibrand who, after two o'clock, finally surfaced with a press release that said: 'Dental program lacks bite.' Well, I tell you what: Medicare has a lot more bite than ever before; it has a lot more bite than it ever had when Labor was in charge. The Howard government is proving by its actions, not just by its words, that it is the best friend - the very best friend - that Medicare has ever had.</DOC>

 - I believe that high-speed broadband is important to the education future of this country. I just do not believe that the Australian taxpayer should pay for something through raiding the Future Fund and plundering $2 billion from the budget which is available for enhancement of communications services in the Australian bush. I do not believe that that $4.7 billion should be taken - $2.7 billion from the Future Fund and $2 billion from rural people - to subsidise commercial operations which ought, as an operation of market forces, provide the broadband that the Australian community needs. This is the Australian Labor Party equivalent of the great debates the British Labour Party used to have about clause 4 of the Constitution and whether you would renationalise a whole lot of industries.While I am on my feet, can I say that the member for Lilley asked me to validate the argument I made that this was an education budget. His leader had asked me some questions and invited me, and I have now had an opportunity to look at the paper from which he quoted. It is a very revealing examination. Let me read from under the title 'Education', 6.10 of Budget Paper No. 1. Bear in mind that the Leader of the Opposition asked me two questions that were calculated to demonstrate that expenditure on education, so far from rising, had actually fallen. -  - I see. To start with it was 7.5 and 7.4, but that 7.5 and 7.4 was not a percentage of GDP. It was not an attempt to compare education spending from one year to the next; rather, they were percentages of aggregate government spending and made no allowance for the fact that expenditure in other areas may have increased at an even faster rate than education - such as expenditure on defence and expenditure on family benefits.I would like the member for Lilley to leave question time with a feeling of tranquillity and peace about the subject of education. I will quote from Budget Paper No. 1. It reads as follows, and I invite the member for Lilley and the member for Griffith to listen to this:Total expenses under the education function are estimated to increase by 9.0 per cent in real terms from 2007-08 to 2010-11, or 3.4 per cent annually on average. The major drivers of this growth are the significant new measures for schools and universities announced in the 2007-08 Budget ...This is specifically on the point that I know worries the member for Lilley; I know he worries about this. It goes on to say:Higher education funding is estimated to rise by about 9.7 per cent in real terms from 2007-08 to 2010-11 or 3.7 per cent annually on average.All I can conclude is that the Leader of the Opposition is being trickier than usual with his figures. The truth is that we have had an education revolution. The truth is that on the centrepiece -  - I am broadbanding my answer. I will repeat it because I think the member for Grayndler may have missed it. This really is the thing that I know bugs the opposition. They have been talking about education for the last four or five months. Everywhere they go: 'Education revolution!' Everywhere they go: 'The way forward is education.' That is absolutely right, and the way you go forward in education is in part to spend more money on it, which we are doing. It is also to raise standards, which we are doing. It is also to acknowledge the professionalism of teachers in Australia, which we do. It is also to recognise the passion of parents to make certain that our schools actually teach children how to read and write and add up. That is what the Australian public wants and that is what this education revolution will deliver.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Lindsay for her service to our country in the Royal Australian Air Force and for now doing a magnificent job looking after the mainstream Australians in Western Sydney, in the electorate of Lindsay. The Treasurer last night, in 'Locking in the gains, investing in Australia's future', announced the largest increase in defence investment over the past 30 years for a single budget. Last night it was announced by the Treasurer that defence expenditure will increase by 10.6 per cent over the next year, which will take it to $22 billion. Over the last 11 years, since this government came to office, defence expenditure has increased in real terms by 47 per cent. In fact, when this government came to office in 1996, the deficit inherited from the Labor Party was almost as large as the defence budget in that year alone.Last night an additional $14 billion was committed by this government to defence over the next 10 years, investing not only in equipment but also in people, who are indeed our most important asset. The $2 billion announced for recruiting and retention includes, for example, a significant increase to the home loan subsidy for Defence personnel, both regulars and reservists. Whereas the home loan subsidy was $136 a month for eligible diggers, it is now going to as much as $470 a month tax free. In addition to that, 18,000 nonofficers, the lower ranks in our military, will receive pay increases of up to some $5,000.We are also announcing that we will be going into partnership with schools and the private sector to drive apprenticeships and training in the Australian Defence Force. There will also be a significant increase in advertising to make sure that we not only focus on having a very visible presence for our three service uniforms in the Australian community but also get back to promoting service in the Australian Defence Force on the basis of the values represented by the three uniforms. There is also an additional $100 million for cadets, and I encourage all parents - and my own son was in the Army Cadets - to do what they can where possible to get their kids into cadets. Another 1,000 cadets will join as a consequence of this budget.In addition to that, the Treasurer announced $6 billion over the next 10 years for the acquisition of 24 FA18F Super Hornets, which will enable us to retire the F111 and safely transition to the Joint Strike Fighter in the next decade, and another $4 billion for spares and repairs - logistics so important to ensure that we do not get back to Labor's defence force, where we ended up having to cannibalise FA18s on the ground to keep ones in the air flying. It is very important to this government that we never return to the days of the Australian Labor Party. It is very important that Australia has a cutting-edge high-end warfare fighting capability, whether it is antisurface ship or air combat, at the same time as preparing the Defence Force for the next decade in security stabilisation, maritime border protection, counterterrorism and security, and humanitarian relief in our region. This budget delivers on the economic dividend of the last 11 years and makes Australia, its interests, its people and its values more secure on our borders, in our region and throughout the world.</DOC>

 - No, because the answer to that question is that I confirm all of the figures in the budget paper, and those figures reveal that expenditure on education is going to increase in real terms very significantly over the next three or four years as a result of the measures announced last night.What I think the Leader of the Opposition is getting at is the proposition that, although there has been an increase in expenditure on education, in other areas of government expenditure there may have been an even bigger increase than has occurred in the area of education and, therefore, the percentages of total expenditure from one year might be lower than in a later year, or the other way around. That does not prove, as the Leader of the Opposition is trying to allege, that we have cut government spending. The whole point of this tawdry exercise - and it is a tawdry exercise - by the Leader of the Opposition is to try to establish that we have  reduced spending on education. We have in fact done the complete reverse, and education spending is going to rise over the next four years by more than 3.5 per cent a year in real terms as a result of the measures announced by the Treasurer last night.I say to the Leader of the Opposition: yes, I confirm these figures; yes, I confirm that from one year to the next, because there will be differential rates of increase in expenditure, there may be a situation where a given area as a percentage of total outlays will fall from one year to the next without the real level of that expenditure falling at all. There is nothing remarkable about that, and the Leader of the Opposition is just trying to be too clever by half.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Moreton for his question. This budget unashamedly puts families at the centre of the priorities of the Howard government. This is an additional $4.5 billion commitment to Australian families over the next five years. Of course, there are tax cuts for all Australians who are in the workforce. Those who are retired are getting their superannuation tax free but high-income, self-funded retirees will get a tax cut. Beyond that, we have taken into account childcare costs, and we have dramatically reduced that burden on Australian families.For the member for Moreton, about 6,600 families in the Moreton electorate will benefit. For an average family on a low income with one child in care, that means about $20.50 less in the cost of child care as a result of the increase of 13 per cent in childcare benefit. The member for Moreton, along with all other honourable members, might like to tell families that are in child care that this year they will be able to claim two lots of childcare tax rebate. That means they will be able to claim up to $4,000 of their out-of-pocket expenses between now and the end of the year. That is as a result of the Howard government listening to families who said they really appreciated childcare tax rebate, but they would like it to be a bit more timely - and the Howard government has delivered.We have not forgotten those families who have disabled children. We have increased our spending by an additional $62 million to assist some 3,000 families to have their disabled children, those kids with slightly higher needs, supported in child care. I think that is a really important measure.For those in the bush, sometimes child care becomes quite marginal as far as viability is concerned. Regional and rural members on both sides of this House can go back and say that the Howard government is committing an additional $43 million for those families so they can access a quality childcare place.We do not always get positive comments from ACOSS, but on this particular occasion Lin Hatfield Dodds said she welcomes the government's initiatives on child care and education - the minister for education will be happy to hear that - which are targeted at low-income Australians; not those 'Mr Rudd battlers' on one-quarter of a million dollars but the real battlers. ACOSS said that, rather than cutting taxes, they were looking for the government to invest in these sorts of things - and that is why Lin Hatfield Dodds is right; we have actually cut taxes for those people and we have improved their access to child care.There are other important families that the Howard government has paid attention to: for example, older families. In the electorate of Moreton, some 11½ thousand older families will receive the one-off $500 bonus before 30 June this year to help them with their out-of-pocket expenses. - Real money, as the Minister for Defence said. - It exists. I know the member for Lilley thought that the family tax supplement was not real. I can tell him that that was real. This is real. It will be appreciated by those families out there, who say that the Howard government is listening and helping them share in the wealth of this nation that they contributed to. In the past, the Howard government has given larger families - those who have been blessed with triplets or quadruplets - a bonus, whereby they got $3,000 for a family with triplets and just over $4,000 for a family with quadruplets. That used to cut out at when the children were six years of age but now it will go right through to 16 years of age or when the children turn 18, in their last year of education.It does not matter how old you are, it does not matter how many children you have, and it does not matter if you are struggling with the complexities of being a carer, the Howard government has listened to Australian families. We have shared the prosperity of this nation, and we have allowed everyone to benefit from the strength of the Australian economy.</DOC>

 - I can confirm that under a Howard government no accounting student will be paying $200 million for an accounting degree! 
Government members - Ha, ha! - Last night in the budget the Treasurer announced in the $1.7 billion higher education package that some $560 million in extra funding would be delivered to universities for courses such as science and maths and engineering and allied health and medicine and dentistry. In maths and science there will be an increase of some $2,729 per place; in allied health, some $1,889; and in engineering, science and surveying and clinical psychology, $2,729. So all told, that is $560 million in increased funding for specific courses that are part of our national priorities. In the case of accounting and commerce, we have put that into the same category as law because that reflects the cost of delivery of that course, it reflects the demand and it reflects the gross lifetime earnings of accounting graduates. Universities can decide for themselves whether or not there should be any change to the HECS.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Bowman for his question and for his very genuine interest in this area. I might begin with the alternative policies, because there I can be brief. In Labor's much touted Education Revolution document, on skills needs, the so-called skills crisis, and vocational and technical education the sum total of discussion was four lonely paragraphs - and not one idea amongst them. Yet the member for Lilley last night was out asserting that Labor had set the agenda on vocational and technical education. Fortunately, we have not waited for Labor to tell us what to do, and I can report for the benefit of the member for Lilley that in 1996 there were 1,500 people doing apprenticeships in his electorate. He can now go back and report to his electorate that today there are 4,280 people doing apprenticeships - nearly a threefold increase in the last 11 years. So we have done a lot. We have now spent around $3 billion a year compared with $1 billion 10 years ago when we took over office. That is a 99 per cent real increase in spending on vocational and technical education in the last 11 years.Yet we have a rapidly ageing population and the experience of well over a decade of uninterrupted economic growth. This means that we have further challenges. That is why last night we made a further substantial investment of $668 million in vocational and further education. That adds to the $837 million that we announced last November, just six months ago, for the Skills for the Future package. So, in total, in the last six months the government has announced $1.5 billion for technical and further education.Last night's announced initiatives were aimed at three things: improving the status, improving the opportunity, and raising the level of vocational and technical education across our workforce. Specifically the measures included, in the trades areas facing a skills shortage, a tax-free $1,000 wage top-up to every first- and second-year apprentice under 30 years of age. On top of that, every first- and second-year apprentice, without age restriction, will get a fee voucher worth up to $500 a go towards their TAFE or other training fees. When you put that together with a trade scholarship, each first- and second-year apprentice across the country in areas of trade skill shortage will get a total of $1,500 a year as a tax-free top-up for their wages and a $500 contribution towards their TAFE fees - nearly $2,000, or up to $2,000, for every first- and second-year apprentice.The government also announced the establishment of three more Australian technical colleges, one in southern Brisbane, one in Western Sydney and one in northern Perth. This means that in the five largest cities we will have two technical colleges across the country to combine with the other 18 technical colleges in regional and other cities in Australia. Furthermore, we announced nearly $60 million to develop fast track apprenticeships. We have extended fee help to full fee paying students pursuing diploma and advanced diploma courses through the VET system and we have provided further assistance for our Indigenous community and for people with disabilities to enter the workforce. So, along with the tax cuts and the childcare and the superannuation initiatives last night, these new measures will further expand our productive capacity at a time when the economy is at full stretch.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Perth for his question. He obviously does not understand that the endowment fund is on top of what the Australian government already provides universities for capital works and research facilities. Last year alone the Australian government provided over $240 million for capital and $460 million for research facilities. What the Treasurer announced last night is an endowment fund that will be invested, with the income from that endowment fund being distributed to universities on top of what we already fund. This is an unprecedented level of investment in Australian universities. The Australian Labor Party could only dream of such an initiative.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hughes for her question and acknowledge her very keen interest in environmental and water matters. Last night's budget continues the Howard government's record levels of environment spending. Over the last 11 years the government has invested almost $20 billion to protect the environment and in the next year we have committed $4.3 billion in funding to tackle the pressing issues of climate change, water scarcity and natural resource management. At the centre of the budget - the environmental part of the budget - is the $10 billion National Plan for Water Security.Water scarcity is a global problem. There are many countries facing water scarcity problems as severe as Australia's. There is no country in the world which has a comprehensive national plan to tackle water scarcity like Australia does. It is thanks to the leadership of the Prime Minister, the leadership of this government, that we have that $10 billion plan, that we have a coordinated effort that is capable of restoring efficiency to our irrigation systems, restoring environmental flows. That $10 billion plan has been welcomed around Australia and admired around the world, but it is still not enjoying the support of the Labor government in Victoria.At the grassroots level, saving water and setting an example of using water efficiently, is vital. We have committed -  - $200 million towards community water grants. These provide the opportunity to save a considerable amount of water, but far more importantly than that -  - they provide the opportunity for schoolchildren and communities to understand how water can be saved and preserved. On climate change, the Australian government, once again, is showing global leadership. In the budget we provide for our global initiative on forests and climate. This is the first substantial national commitment to attack the global problem of deforestation. The opposition like to talk about global warming but they will not recognise that it is a global problem. A tonne of CO that goes into the atmosphere in China does as much damage as a tonne of CO that goes into the atmosphere here. We are tackling that globally with our global initiative on forests and climate.At home, we are genuinely doubling the solar panel rebate. We all remember that the member for Kingsford Smith said he was doubling the rebate, but he did not know that double meant twice as much. That is sort of important. Two times four equals eight. We have doubled the rebate from $4 a watt and a maximum of $4,000 to $8 a watt and a maximum of $8,000. The member for Lalor then left the chamber. 
 - The member for Hughes asked me to consider alternative policies. There are no alternative policies on water from the opposition. The $10 billion national plan had no counterpart in the Labor Party's repertoire. When it was announced the member for Kingsford Smith said - and I was sitting right here, listening to him intently - 'It's Labor Party policy.' I could not find it, and neither could he. He had as much difficulty proving that misstatement as he did with the solar panel rebate. The opposition's policy on climate change is a unilateral 60 per cent reduction in emissions in Australia by 2050. It proposes to do that regardless of what the rest of the world does. If the member for Kingsford Smith had read the IPCC report published recently, he would be aware of the lengthy discussion on the problems of one country imposing restrictions and the carbon emissions just leaking over to other countries. There would be no gain to the world. There would be massive economic loss in that country.Global warming needs a global solution. We are committed to a global solution and we are working towards it. We are not going to devastate the Australian economy in a futile, ideological gesture that is more about gratifying the prejudices of the member for Kingsford Smith and his colleagues than achieving the outcomes the world needs.</DOC>

 - In the latter part of the 1990s we had very strong productivity growth after the election of the coalition government. We exceeded Australia's long-term average, which is around 2.3 per cent to 2.5 per cent. Labour productivity in 2005-06 was 2.3 per cent. In December it was 1.4 per cent, reflecting strong GDP growth and stable hours worked. Various cycles are determined and called by the Australian Bureau of Statistics over a five-year period. In 2003-04, the latest completed cycle, labour productivity was 2.1 per cent - so 2005-06 was a little higher than that.Various things can and should be done in the Australian economy to lift productivity. One of those is to improve skills in the workforce. The government made a major announcement in relation to apprenticeships in the budget. But I do not think there is a productivity reform more important to the Australian economy than improved industrial relations. If you want, for example, an industry which can benefit from productivity then you do not have to go any further than the mining industry of Australia - and Australian workplace agreements have been absolutely critical to that industry. - There goes the sound effects man again! One of the companies that has used Australian workplace agreements more than any other is Rio Tinto. One of the directors of Rio Tinto is Sir Rod Eddington, who the Deputy Leader of the Opposition describes as 'another voice' in relation to Labor's industrial relations policy. She even came into parliament last night and attempted to deny that she had used that phrase. Not only had she used that phrase but if you download the transcript of 3 May 2007 on her own website - and I will table it; she obviously did not get to her own website in time - you can read the transcript where Neil Mitchell asked Julia Gillard this question:What is your main adviser's view on the policy you've come up with?Gillard: Well I, I am happy to talk to Rod about it but that would just be another voice in the voices we've got _It is in black and white and on her own website. She tried to deny the undeniable. I suggest you go and have a chat to that other voice and get rid of your industrial relations policy. And I make this prediction: tonight, if the Leader of the Opposition does not junk Ms Gillard's industrial relations policy, the rest of the speech will be window-dressing. We have had Medicare Gold, and this industrial relations policy, known as 'IR Platinum', is taking the failure of Medicare Gold to a new level. If you are interested in productivity, there is one big challenge for the Leader of the Opposition: cut her loose tonight, cut the policy loose and let us get on with productivity in the Australian economy.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Boothby for his question. I observed that, in March 1996, the unemployment rate in Boothby was 7.3 per cent. It is now 3.7 per cent. There is a nice bit of symmetry about that - 7.3 per cent to 3.7 per cent. I have often said that good economic policy is not an end in itself; it is only of value if it produces a human dividend. And the greatest human dividend of all is to give people the chance of a job. By that measurement, this country's economic policies are delivering a 32-year record of human dividends, because you have to go back to 1974 to find an unemployment rate of 4.4 per cent. That is the figure that has been recorded today. It is a wonderful result.I happened to be at a school, the St Francis Xavier Catholic high school, in Canberra this morning. I was able to say to the school assembly - and most particularly to the young men and women who will be leaving the school and going out into the world next year - that they will enter a labour market stronger, more benign and more beckoning than it has been in 32 years. That really is what debates in this parliament and arguments between the two sides of politics are all about: which side of politics is better able to deliver the great human dividend of low unemployment. If we look at what has happened over the last year, we see that there have been no fewer than 326,600 jobs created since the introduction of the new industrial relations system. Of those jobs, 85 per cent have been full time. I am delighted to tell the House that long-term unemployment - that is, Australians who have been out of work for more than a year - is at its lowest level since that individual statistic began to be kept. It has fallen by 22 per cent over the last year. One of the reasons - I cannot put it more strongly than that because I cannot prove that it is stronger than that - unemployment has fallen from 5.1 per cent to 4.4 per cent since the introduction of the current industrial relations system is that small business has been encouraged to take on more workers because we have abolished the unfair dismissal laws.I am asked by the member for Boothby what threats there are to a strong economy producing low unemployment. One of the threats is, of course, the industrial relations policy of the man who chooses to turn his back on the House. I might say, extending the metaphor, that he has turned his back on the unemployed of Australia by committing himself to reintroducing the job-destroying unfair dismissal laws. If you go around this country, every man and woman in small business will tell you that the greatest thing that has happened to them over the last year is the removal of unfair dismissal laws. The greatest boon for the long-term unemployed and for the unemployed generally has been the removal of those unfair dismissal laws. It can only be union-dominated ideology that would lead a political party in the present state of the Australian labour market to commit itself to the reintroduction of those job-destroying unfair dismissal laws.This is a wonderful day for the young of Australia because it is their future that, more than anything else, will be conditioned and influenced by the labour market over the years ahead. We have a labour market for the workers of Australia like we have not had for more than 30 years. I again remind the Leader of the Opposition of the words of a Labour leader who in opposition had the courage to tell the union movement of his country that the national interest went ahead of union power. I refer of course to Tony Blair, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. He told the unions of Great Britain that if Labour were to be fit to govern, it had to be willing to stand up to the union movement of that country. He told those same unions, after he became Prime Minister, that fairness in the workplace started with the chance of a job. The gulf, the difference, the demarcation between Mr Blair and the Leader of the Opposition in Australia could not be starker.</DOC>

 - The government is about to receive a report on emissions trading prepared by an interdepartmental group which senior members of the Treasury have been participating in. I look forward to receiving that. As soon as the government receives that report it will announce its response, and I expect that to be a good response. - Oh, yes, the former ACTU president comes in on cue. There is a former ACTU president over there, one over here, one over there and another one to come. - Labor might regard Rod Eddington as 'another voice', but it regards the ACTU as a multiple chorus. I am going to go on and make another point about receiving the report on the carbon emissions trading scheme. This government will actually receive the report before it announces its policy, and it will actually consider the consequences of various emissions targets before it names that policy which it will undertake. That is quite different from the Labor approach, which was to name an emissions target. This is what the Leader of the Opposition did: he named an emissions target and then he set up an inquiry to figure out what it would mean. He said that he was going to have this target by 2050 and then he said to Ross Garnaut, 'Go and find out what the effect would be.' I tell you this: when you are dealing with economic consequences, when you are dealing with people's lives, it is a much better principle to find out what the effect of your policies will be before you adopt them - and that is what this government will be doing. - Yes.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Blair for his question. I can inform the member that the budget provision for education has had a wonderfully positive response from the university sector - and I am not surprised. In many ways the changes announced by the government are quite historic. One has to go back almost to the time of the Murray report commissioned by the Menzies government in the 1950s to find changes of such lasting significance to the university sector in this country. I can report to the House, and specifically to the member for Blair, that there has been a strong, consistent and positive reaction from the vice-chancellors and other spokesmen for the universities around Australia.I cannot report that there has been the same strong, consistent and positive reaction from the Australian Labor Party regarding one element of the announced policy on tertiary education - that is, the question of full fee paying degree courses at Australian universities for Australian students. It was my understanding, reinforced by very strong statements made by the former shadow minister and member for Jagajaga, that it was implacable, unalterable Labor Party policy that the full fee paying courses would not be allowed by a Labor government. In other words, they would be abolished, and the universities would be reimbursed the $500 million, over a period of four years, that would be required to put them in the same financial position.That was my understanding until yesterday morning when the Leader of the Opposition did a very revealing interview on Sky News. During that interview, he was asked whether it was Labor's policy to get rid of full fee places. I expected him to say immediately, 'Yes, it is. It has been our policy for a long time.' But he did not. He said:Let's have a look at what's in the detail of the Budget papers on that.This was a very strange answer because the budget really did not have anything to say about Labor policy; it actually had something to say about government policy. So the budget papers would be an odd place to look if you wanted to find out about Labor policy.That was fascinating. It was obvious after he had given that interview that the Leader of the Opposition was manoeuvring for a change in policy. The confirmation came in this morning's Australian with the banner headline: 'Rudd shifts on fee degrees', which was obviously an article written after close consultation with the Leader of the Opposition's office. The article said, inter alia:Last night, Mr Rudd's office confirmed the Labor leader was now leaving the door open to a change of policy, allowing some full-fee degrees for the first time.There is no way that respected journalists like Samantha Maiden or Steve Lewis would have written that without getting it right. They are journalists of impeccable ability and their integrity should never be questioned. It is quite obvious that they went to the leader's office and the leader's office said, 'Just give him a couple of days. He's got to manoeuvre around the troglodytes, but he'll get it through and it will be all right.'Sure enough, this morning, faithfully, the member for Perth and the member for Jagajaga kept the door open for a change of policy - although there is a bit of a sting in the tail from the member for Perth; he reminded the Leader of the Opposition of Labor's longstanding policy. Both of them said, 'Don't worry, there will be a detailed statement before the election.' Little did they know that there would be a detailed statement before morning tea.Not very long after, the Leader of the Opposition went on to say, amongst a whole lot of other things, on Sky News again - they are doing very well out of this, Leader of the Opposition - 'So our view is consistent with the policy we've laid down over quite a period of time now that we will phase out full fee paying degrees.' In the space of less than 24 hours he has gone from deliberately leaving the door open - either because he wanted to change the policy and ultimately got rolled or because he did not know what the policy was when he was first asked; it was a toss up, because he is not very strong on detail this Leader of the Opposition - to where Labor's policy has always been. There may be a $500 million hole in that already shonky list of savings that the member for Melbourne has produced.I thought to myself, 'What has brought about this change?' I searched the bits and pieces of scraps of paper I had of transcripts, and I saw in the flesh one of the two people I am talking about: Dr Allport who, I think, runs the Tertiary Education Union. She effectively said that the world would come to an end if Labor altered its policy on full fee paying degrees. I thought that was obviously a factor, but then I got the answer - I saw Senator Brown. Senator Brown was saying to the Leader of the Opposition, 'Hold the line. Don't retreat. Don't become an imitation of the coalition. Don't betray your true principles. Reject Howard's outrageous policy.' That is what Senator Brown was, more or less, saying - but not as eloquently as that.In the end, the bottom line of all of this is that in the space of 24 hours the Leader of the Opposition, in my view, wanted to change the policy because he knows that the present policy is unsustainable, it is expensive and, what is more, it discriminates against Australians. The worst thing about this policy is that it discriminates against Australians. It is all right to charge foreigners and give them a chance to come into our universities and buy a place, but it is wrong to let Australians do that. Let me simply say to the Leader of the Opposition: if that is the way the the opposition makes policy in relation to a crucial area like this, heaven help the country if they ever get a crack at government.</DOC>

 - Let me remind the member for Perth that the total number of students who are full fee paying students within the present 'case load', as the Leader of the Opposition called it in his interview this morning with Sky News, is precisely three per cent of the total number. Let me also remind the member for Perth that no better authority than Gerard Sutton - the President of the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee - said at the beginning of this year that the shortage of HECS funded places had been eliminated. The boss of the universities said that there is no problem with the aggregate number of HECS funded places available. We have a booming labour market, which does have some impact on the number of people wanting to go to university. It is a known fact that in times of higher unemployment the demand for university places rises, and in times of lower unemployment there is some stepping back in the demand for university places. Against the evident need to provide more flexibility for the university sector, it is desirable to get an additional revenue stream into the universities from people who are able to contribute that revenue and there is an evident case for not discriminating against Australians - why does the Labor Party believe it is all right for somebody from America, China or England to come here and pay, but it is not all right for Australians? Or are we going to stop the foreigners as well? It is a totally illogical policy.The fascinating thing about it is that the man who sits opposite me knows it is an illogical policy. He wanted to change this illogical policy but Bob Brown and the tertiary unions would not let him. The Leader of the Opposition wanted to change the policy. We know how much power the tertiary unions exert over the Australian Labor Party, and we all know how desperate the Leader of the Opposition is for Green preferences at the next federal election. He is as desperate for Green preferences as Mark Latham was for Green preferences before the last federal election - and you know what Mark Latham did to the forestry workers of Tasmania in order to get Green preferences before the last election. If I were a coalminer in Queensland, I would be worried about the Leader of the Opposition.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Cook for his question. I can say to him that discipline and hard work over the last 10 years has put the Australian economy in a much stronger position today than it was in 1996. If you want some evidence of the benefits that good economic management can bring, it is in today's labour force figures. Labour force figures for the month of April 2007 show that unemployment fell again - to 4.4 per cent, which is the lowest since November 1974. Nearly 50,000 jobs were created in April. Over the last year, 300,000 new jobs were created in Australia. Job creation is occurring at the rate of about 850 jobs a day. Let me say that again: in the last year in Australia, we have been putting on jobs at the rate of about 850 a day. As a consequence of that, there are more Australians in work than ever before and unemployment is at a 32-year low.Benefits that good economic management can bring include more people in work, families with a breadwinner and people who can pay their mortgages and educate their children. We are not in the situation we used to be - where breadwinners were thrown on the scrap heap and unemployment was at the level we had in the 'recession we should never have had' in 1990. In this budget, coming off the back of strong employment growth, we are also able to share economic benefits with others - with pensioners, who will be getting a $500 bonus; with self-funded retirees, who will also be getting a bonus; and with low- and middle-income earners, who will be getting a deposit into their superannuation scheme if they have taken part in the co-contribution. These are the benefits that good, strong economic management can bring. The Commonwealth will be doing that because, for the 10th year in a row, the Commonwealth budget will be balanced.Mr Speaker, you will no doubt hear the Labor Party claim that they believe in balanced budgets. They opposed every step we took in Australia to drive the budget back into balance, but now of course they are in favour of balanced budgets. I always say: 'Don't listen to what Labor says. Look at what Labor does. Look at what Labor did when it was in office at the Commonwealth level.' One way of measuring the Labor Party is to look at the position of the state Labor governments. As a whole, what surplus would you think the state Labor governments will have in the next financial year? What would they have? The state Labor governments did have surplus in 2005-06 but they have now collectively driven state budgets into deficit. The state budget sector as a whole is in deficit. The states have to borrow to fund that deficit. The net borrowing for state-territory governments and their trading enterprises will increase by $56 billion over the forward estimates.Here is the Commonwealth paying down debt and balancing its budget whilst the state Labor governments will be running up debt of $56 billion - but you will never hear anything about that from the Leader of the Opposition. You will never hear anything from him about what effect borrowing $56 billion would have on financial markets. You will hear a lot from him about how he is concerned about interest rates. But is he concerned enough about interest rates to ask his cobbers at the state level to get out of financial markets and to stop putting pressure on savings? He is not that concerned. Do not listen to what Labor says; look at what Labor does. Labor is running a deficit and debt combined over the six states and two territories in this country.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Kingston his question, and I congratulate him on the good work that he is doing on behalf of his constituents. The economic growth which we have had in Australia in our longest continuous expansion has been broad based. That is one of the reasons why Australia was able to come through the Asian financial crisis, the tech wreck of 2001, the US recession of 2001, SARS, the threat of terrorism and the challenges that we have had over the last decade.The mining industry is an important industry to Australia. It contributes about 5.9 per cent to the Australian economy and about 1.3 per cent of employment. In the last year, as I said earlier, there have been about 300,000 new jobs created in Australia and of those about 13,000 have been in the mining industry. That is something to be valued and it is a great outcome. In the time that 13,000 jobs have been put on in the mining industry, wholesale trade has put on 33,000 jobs, cafes and restaurants have put on 50,000 jobs, finance and insurance have put on 34,000 jobs, and health and community services have put on 16,000 jobs. You can see there has been a broad contribution to the Australian economy. That of course is the best economy - a balanced economy.I have seen repeated claims over the last day or two that all of Australia's growth and employment and its budget position are somehow just the result of the mining industry. I said that the mining industry is an important industry to Australia - and it is - but it is not the only industry that is creating jobs or creating wealth in this country. There has been a repeated claim from the Leader of the Opposition that the mining boom has contributed $283 billion into the budget over a seven-year period. That is the claim he has been making over and over again. It is a precise claim - not 'words to that effect', incidentally - of $283 billion.Company tax in Australia is a little over $60 billion. The mining industry contributes eight to 10 per cent of company tax receipts - that is, about $6 billion a year. The total amount of mining tax revenue is not as a result of the increase. Some of that $5 billion or $6 billion would be part of that increase. The Treasury estimate is that the increase in commodity prices over the last four years may well have contributed $11 billion and, over the forward estimates, may well contribute another $11 billion. That will be $22 billion over eight years, as against the claim that the Leader of the Opposition repeatedly makes of $283 billion. He is only out by a factor of 10, as it turns out! No doubt he will apologise and correct the record tonight. There is nothing like $280 billion. The Treasury estimate over eight years - four gone and four to come - is more like $22 billion.Any person who is familiar with the Australian economy would know immediately that that claim of $283 billion could not be true. You would know it immediately by looking at the Commonwealth revenue statement. If you did not know it, your advisers ought to stop you making that particular claim immediately. We are beginning to learn something about the Leader of the Opposition. He has not done his homework. He does not understand the Australian economy. He is the man who has a focus-group-tested cliche available for every occasion. Running a $1 trillion economy takes skill and the ability to do hard work to get on top of the figures. It is not for Queensland public servants to walk in and think they can do it just as they used to get away with it in the state of Queensland. It cannot be done by bullying newspapers, either, when they start writing about it. It takes skill and it takes management because people's lives depend on it, their houses depend on it, and the coalition is committed to it.</DOC>

 - I do not think there is any doubt that as a result of the reforms announced in the budget speech on Tuesday night things will get immeasurably better in Australian universities. That is not just my view. I remind you it is the view of every vice-chancellor who has spoken on this subject since Tuesday night. We all know that the academic community of this country does not normally represent a chorus of praise for this government. It is often the case that we are criticised, I think unfairly, on occasions. Nonetheless, we respect freedom of speech as we respect academic freedom. People are free to express their views. The Leader of the Opposition and the member for Perth are clutching at straws on this issue because the Leader of the Opposition has been caught out. He has to make a choice. He has to fess up either to not knowing his own party's policy or to being heavied out of doing something he wanted to do. That in reality is what the Leader of the Opposition faces. He knew, when he did that first interview on Sky, that the policy position his party had was absurd. He knew it discriminated against Australians. He is now having a mock, humorous conversation with the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Treasurer. They confect humorous disinterest. - Let me say to the member for Perth, through you, Mr Speaker, that what I would regard as monstrously unfair and monstrously discriminatory would be a situation where you could have full fee paying foreign students sitting side by side with HECS funded Australian students in the full knowledge that Australian students would like to be sitting beside those HECS funded students but were not allowed to do so by an anti-Australian Labor Party policy.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Maranoa for his question. He would recognise the significant investment that we will be making in future to land transport infrastructure networks in Australia as a result of the budget announced this week. $22.3 billion has been committed over future years to the land transport system in Australia - roads and rail - for which we take responsibility. This is to be added to the $15.8 billion that we are currently spending in AusLink 1, a 41 per cent increase in investment into Australia's land transport system. That is $38 billion that the Australian government is spending on the land transport system over a 10-year period.The important part about this is that it is not just about a single strategy in respect of what used to be known as the national highway system, which we inherited from a former Labor government; it goes right across the networks of road and rail systems in Australia. There are those important national corridors, both road and rail, that are important freight links into our ports across Australia. There are state highways that we are now funding improvement projects on, in conjunction with the state governments where we can negotiate an appropriate contribution from them. There are investments in key arterial roads in regional Australia, some of which are in the member for Maranoa's electorate - an important electorate that supplies a lot of agricultural product and also resources and energy from Queensland that has to get to the port.There is also funding for local roads and local black spots. There are very good local road and local black spot programs, and also key rail freight infrastructure, where we have had to negotiate to take over corridors from some of the state governments to improve the efficiency of rail in Australia. In this program we want to ensure that our partners, the state and local governments, help share the costs and help share the risks to ensure that the taxpayers' dollars are being wisely invested and that we get maximum advantage out of that. So it is not just the major highways; it is the local roads that improve the lot of all Australians as far as our land transport network is concerned. We have given a long-term commitment to that.The member for Maranoa asked whether there were any alternatives. We have seen that really the answer to that is no - certainly not from the Labor Party. There are no alternatives from the Labor Party. In fact, the shadow Treasurer was asked on radio, after the budget came out:Is there anything in this budget that you would take out?He said:No, not really.He was saying, 'We support it.' No, really, he would not take anything out. So he is supporting the commitment that the government is making to the Australian land transport system. Then we saw a press release from the shadow minister, the member for Batman. The member for Batman had this to say:... Auslink I must build on the investment of Auslink II - that is our policy, AusLink 1, and our policy, AusLink 2 - in Australia's strategic economic transport infrastructure.I can assure the member for Batman that that will be the case. It will build on the investment we have already made. We will get the states to invest, we will get local government to invest and we will make sure that we have a national land transport system in Australia that continues to drive economic growth in this country so that we can see the sorts of job creation that we have experienced in recent years as a result of the reforms in Australia.We welcome the Labor Party's support for our land transport policy. We welcome their support. We have seen, in the last week or so, the outsourcing of a lot of Labor policy development. We have seen that the Labor Party has outsourced industrial relations policy and some of their preselections to the union movement. We have seen the outsourcing of budgetary and economic policy to the Democrats. They have got it right at last because they have outsourced their land transport policy to the coalition government.</DOC>

 - I can confirm everything which is in the budget papers in relation to education. I happily and freely do that. I repeat what I said yesterday: those budget papers reveal that over the four years of the forward estimates there will be a rise of something like 9.7 per cent in real terms in spending on education, and it will be at a rate of, I think, 3.7 per cent in real terms in relation to tertiary or university education. So I am very happy to confirm that.Can I also confirm something else. I heard the Leader of the Opposition say something yesterday and I also heard it repeated this morning by the member for Perth while he was defending the intention of the Leader of the Opposition to change a policy he ultimately did not change through fear of upsetting Senator Brown. The member for Perth asked, 'If the Prime Minister had been interested in tertiary education and university education, why hadn't the government, earlier in time, invested $5 billion in the Higher Education Endowment Fund?' That is a fair question, but do you know what the answer is? Earlier in time we were still paying off Labor's $96 billion debt and we did not have the $5 billion. This little reality appears to have escaped attention.I think I anticipate correctly: no doubt this little line will be a runner tonight in the Leader of the Opposition's speech. He will say, 'It's four months before the election; why didn't they do it a few years ago?' We did not have the capacity to do it responsibly a few years ago because we were still in a net debt position. Now that we have made provision for the superannuation entitlements, inter alia of the men and women of the Australian Defence Force, years into the future through the Future Fund, we are in a position to make this magnificent investment.And I have other news for the Leader of the Opposition which he will not like to hear. If the Australian people were to re-elect this government in the next election - and, unlike the Leader of the Opposition, I make no boasts on that subject - they can rest assured that we will make further contributions out of future surpluses into the Higher Education Endowment Fund. It is a magnificent investment in Australia's future. It is a feature of this year's budget that we have taken the great prosperity this country has and we have deployed it in two ways: we have given a human dividend to the present generation, to which they are entitled, and we have laid aside a portion of that prosperity for our financial security and for the young of Australia in the future. Thank heavens we are in a position to do it! I say to the Leader of the Opposition, through you, Mr Speaker: if we had been in a better financial position a few years ago, we would have done it then. The reason we were not was that the mob who sit opposite left us with a $96 billion debt. They tried to stop us getting rid of that debt. Now we are in position to do so -  - we can make this decision. - We are proud of it, and we will be happy to proclaim the value of it from one side of this country to the other.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Indi for the question. I can report to the House that today the ABS reported that the unemployment rate in Australia is 4.4 per cent. I was reflecting, as I looked at the member for Adelaide, that in her lifetime the unemployment rate has never before reached that level. In fact, 1974 was the last time that the Australian unemployment rate was at 4.4 per cent. In the 12 months since we introduced a new industrial relations system for Australia, 326,000 new jobs have been created; 85 per cent of those jobs are full time; and anyone with an ounce of compassion in their body would be pleased at the fact that the teenage full-time unemployment to population ratio has fallen to 3.7 per cent. Teenage unemployment is 3.7 per cent.I am asked about threats. The greatest threat to the continuing economic prosperity of the nation is the possible election of a Rudd Labor government. No better evidence of that have we seen than the Labor Party's industrial relations policy, which was released at their national conference - the policy that now is in a total mess, the policy that, before it had actually been delivered, had been changed in the moments before, when the one-stop shop became a two-stop shop. Secondly, they changed on the minimum wage. They said there were 10 national employment standards, but - oops - they forgot the minimum wage, and now there are 11 national employment standards. They said that there were 24 months of 'guaranteed' leave for Australian families, and then we find out from the member for Rankin that in fact it is 12 months with a nice letter. And, on pattern bargaining, the Labor Party in their policy document say they will allow it to come back into the workplace, and then we find out from The 7.30 Report that the Leader of the Opposition has changed that policy as well - reversal No. 4. In reversal No. 5, we heard about bargaining fees. They seemed to make this policy on Neil Mitchell's program, where the Deputy Leader of the Opposition said that, yes, you could charge bargaining fees. Only a few days later on 3AW, on the same program, the Leader of the Opposition said, 'No, you can't charge bargaining fees.'But I can report to the House that there is now a sixth change - can you believe it? Six in 12 days. This is on arbitration. It gets a little tricky here, but in their policy the Labor Party say that there will be last resort arbitration. Reading the Australian today, I nearly choked on my Weeties again. It is going to happen one of these days when I am eating Weeties. If they keep changing their policy, I am going to just fall over and choke on the Weeties. This morning in the Australian I read that the Labor Party had changed its policy on arbitration.So small business is confused about the Labor Party's IR policy. Big business is confused about the Australian Labor Party's policy. The workers of Australia are confused. I can only hope that the Leader of the House will get the answer on the Today show tomorrow morning, when he debates the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. -  - You are not debating her tomorrow morning? The Deputy Leader of the Opposition is debating herself tomorrow morning! It should be a good debate - there are two sides to the argument on a number of issues. You do not need to have two people for a debate; just put the Deputy Leader of the Opposition on TV. It will be great entertainment.Do you know what, Mr Speaker? This is a fundamental issue. The Labor Party has failed on economic policy. The Labor Party is failing on industrial relations policy. And, when it comes to running the nation, you cannot make a mess of your industrial relations policy the way the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Bonner for his thoughtful question. I noticed in the opposition's responses to the budget that one of the constant refrains of the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Treasurer, the member for Lilley, is that in the budget the government is doing nothing about climate change, which simply demonstrates that the opposition is not reading the budget but just using a bit of focus group work and parroting a few lines. The truth is that there is a lot in this budget that the government is doing to address the issue of climate change, importantly including in the Asia-Pacific region, because our aid program has a particular responsibility and a particular focus on the Asia-Pacific region.One of the issues that needs to be addressed is the environment and, rather more specifically, climate change is a significant issue. In Pacific island countries there is nervousness about the possibility of rising sea levels. That is an issue that we are addressing. For example, we are spending money on the Pacific meteorological services to help predict climate in the Pacific, including extreme weather events such as cyclones, which have a devastating effect on small island countries. We are spending money on the South Pacific Sea Level and Climate Monitoring Project. This supports 12 different monitoring sites that use GPS and satellite to monitor sea level movements and the impact of those sea level movements on small island states.If the opposition is serious about the issue of climate change, it would have something to say about these issues. It would understand what the government is doing and it would talk about those things and, I would have thought, endorse what the government was doing. We are doing other things, like helping with a global environment facility to improve land use and introduce better farming practices - for example, the planting of drought-resistant crops. This is an important issue for people who live in, for example, parts of Indonesia, where there is concern that climate change may lead to drier conditions and therefore the need to change the sorts of crops that they plant. The most important single thing the government is doing to address the issue of climate change internationally in this budget is the $200 million that we are investing in the Global Initiative on Forests and Climate. So, every time the opposition says the government is doing nothing about climate change, it rather conveniently and opportunistically ignores the importance of this great initiative.This global initiative on reforestation and stopping the process of deforestation has been enormously well received around the world. It does not matter where you go; in developed countries and developing countries there has been very real interest in this initiative - and why not? Deforestation in developing countries accounts for 20 per cent of global CO emissions. Halving deforestation would offset emissions by several billion tonnes a year. The simple fact is that, although it was announced before the budget, in this budget, funding is now being made available to address those issues.As the year wears on there will be initiatives such as the APEC summit. The Prime Minister has already written to APEC leaders about the environment and climate change being a central issue at the APEC meeting. Of course more will be done, but the fact is that, when the Leader of the Opposition gets up tonight to make his budget reply, one of his themes will be climate change. I would expect that in articulating that theme he will begin by congratulating the government on the many initiatives in the budget designed to address climate change.I note that the narrative of the Labor Party is that the government does not do anything about climate change. When we do, they continue with the same narrative and endeavour to convince the public that, for example, $200 million is not being spent on reforestation in the Asia-Pacific region. It is about time the Labor Party started to use the facts as part of their armoury, not just empty socialist narratives.</DOC>

 - No, you are wrong. I just make this point: when it comes to policy in relation to industrial relations -  -  - I am sorry, Mr Speaker. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition is wrong. When it comes to industrial relations policy, it is vitally important that you actually consult the people -  - When it comes to industrial relations policy, I would like to give the Deputy Leader of the Opposition a bit of a tip: I think you should consult the business community before you release a policy. I think that is a good idea, because it is business that employs Australians, not the union movement.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for McMillan and acknowledge his keen interest in clean coal technology. We were only recently at Loy Yang announcing the investment from the Low Emissions Technology Development Fund of $100 million into a clean coal joint venture between HRL, an Australian company, and the Harbin Power Engineering Company, from China.Coal is an essential part of the world's energy source today. It provides more than half of the world's electricity. Over the next 23 years the International Energy Agency estimates that coal will deliver 83 per cent of the overall increase in energy demand. Coal will be with us for a very long time. In large measure that is because of the fact that, in the fastest growing economies, and the fastest growing greenhouse gas emitting economies, China and India, coal reserves are to be found in abundance. China, for example, has one per cent of the world's oil and gas reserves but 13 per cent of its coal reserves. That is one reason why China's growth in CO emissions between now and 2030 will be double that of the OECD. So Australia, as a big coal producer and coal consumer, has a vital joint vested interest with China in finding the technologies that will clean up coal - because, unless we can clean up coal, we will struggle to meet the very large reductions in emissions that we need to meet by mid-century.The Australian government has invested more than $400 million in clean coal technology under our Low Emissions Technology Demonstration Fund. We are doing that bilaterally with China, as I mentioned a moment ago, and we are also doing it through the AP6, the Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate. Our position is clear. We recognise our reliance on coal. We recognise its importance to the world. We recognise that you cannot achieve the big cuts in global emissions needed without tackling emissions from burning coal.So what is Labor's policy? Earlier this year the member for Kingsford Smith famously said in a speech in his electorate that 'the automatic expansion of the coal industry such as we've seen in the past is a thing of the past'. Only a few years previously the member for Kingsford Smith told the National Press Club: 'Our reliance on coal for energy and export puts the Australian economy at risk.' On the other hand, the leader of the member for Kingsford Smith's own party in his own state, Mr Iemma, the Premier, who sat alongside of Mr Rudd at the Labor Party conference only weeks ago, has announced that he is looking at establishing a new coal-fired power station. Of course, he previously criticised the member for Kingsford Smith, saying that, in our fight to save the planet, we ought to be sure we do not destroy the country.What does Labor stand for? Labor stands for symbols, not substance. The Leader of the Opposition wants to have a 60 per cent unilateral cut in emissions by mid-century. We all agree that we need a big cut in global emissions by mid-century, or at least in the course of this century, but for Australia to make that cut without regard to the actions of other countries would be as destructive as it would be futile and it would be sending exactly the wrong message - sending the wrong message to the country that the Leader of the Opposition claims to understand. It would be sending a message to China to the effect of saying: 'Don't worry, the developed world will continue cutting; you don't have to do anything.' The world cannot achieve the cuts in emissions that it needs without the engagement of the major developing and rapidly industrialising countries like China. The Australian government's approach is one that recognises the reality of the greenhouse challenge and is taking the measures and developing the technology that will enable the world to meet it.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for La Trobe for his question. It is the case that the tax cuts announced by the Treasurer in the budget are particularly valuable in relative and absolute terms for working mothers in Australia. It is the case, according to the most recent figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics, that some 62 per cent of all working mothers in Australia earn below $35,000 a year. The reason for that is not that they are poorly paid. The reason is that the great bulk of them work part time. As the House will know, the most typical family formation working-wise at the present time is a full-time male breadwinner with his wife and mother of their children working part time. So a 1½- or a 1¼-income household is the most typical. It is certainly not universal but, according to the latest analysis, that is the most typical household formation so far as working parents are concerned.What the impact of the tax changes indicates is that, in relative terms, the greatest benefit goes to people earning between $30,000 and $40,000 a year. The budget delivers a tax cut of $21 a week to wage and salary earners on incomes between $30,000 and $40,000 per annum. In 2004-05, 60 per cent of female taxpayers had a taxable income of $35,000 or less. What this indicates is that the Treasurer's tax cuts have been deliberately designed to provide the maximum benefit to those that need assistance the most. Not only are the tax cuts of benefit to that section of the Australian population but also changes to child-care assistance in the budget will benefit working mothers. Child-care benefit will increase by 10 per cent, on top of annual indexation, which will reduce out-of-pocket child-care costs as a share of disposable income for all families. The payment of the child-care tax rebate, which further reduces out-of-pocket child-care costs, will be brought forward, providing more timely help with child-care costs to all working parents.I might also observe that since 2004-05, compared with the financial year to start on 1 July 2007, a taxpayer earning $35,000 or less will have enjoyed a tax cut of almost one-half compared with the total tax that that person paid only three years ago. That particular comparison is a measure of the way in which these tax cuts have been designed to assist low- and middle-income earners. They have delivered and they are of particular benefit to the working mothers of Australia.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Dobell. I remind the House that this year's budget cut taxes for all income tax payers by lifting the threshold for the 15c rate and by increasing the low-income tax offset. As the Prime Minister has just said, this has been particularly good for working mothers, who tend to work part time and who have had increased incentive to come back and join the workforce or to take extra time away or to improve their skills. The government is also amending the tax thresholds on 1 July next year so that you will not go onto the higher rate of 40 per cent until you have income over $80,000 and on the top marginal tax rate of 45 per cent until you have income over $180,000.Are there any alternative tax policies? Apparently not. The member for Lilley went to the National Press Club to reply to the budget and apparently could not find any fault with the budget. More importantly, he said:I am not anticipating taking forward any significant change to the personal income tax system at this stage.He went on to say, in relation to tax:I can't raise any expectation we could move in that area in terms of the election platform.It was reported - quite rightly - by the press on the basis of that statement that the Labor Party apparently intends to have no tax policy at the next election. Labor is going to go to the next election without a policy on the most significant area of economic management - tax. When he was asked about this on the weekend, the shadow Treasurer said this:If Peter Costello wants to know what Labor's tax policy will be, he can start with our announcement to support every dollar of the tax cuts announced in this year's budget.So if we want to find out what the Labor policy is, we have to look at the coalition policy to work it out, which is why I say to the people of Australia: go to the originators and not the imitators. It was not the Labor Party that thought up moving those thresholds and increasing the LITO and producing tax cuts for working mothers. It was not the Labor Party that thought up increasing the threshold for the top tax rate to $180,000. It was not the Labor Party that thought up cutting the top marginal tax rates. Now we find out that if we want to know what Labor thinks, we have to read coalition policy. We have to write our policy and their policy now! Come round and we will write you a few more, if that is what you really want. Nobody in their right mind would believe that the Labor Party want to get elected so they can be a Liberal government. The true explanation is that Labor do have tax plans, but they do not want to tell you about them before the election. They would like to spring them on taxpayers after the election. If they were good plans -  -  - Mr Speaker, I am interrupted. I ask you to call for the videotape and do an investigation, as the Labor Party is demanding over the budget reply. If it were a good tax plan, presumably you would hear about it before the election, but if it is no tax plan, you are only going to find out about it after the election. That entitles us to see what the Labor Party has on the record when it comes to tax. One of the people who is on the record more than most is the would-be finance minister in a Labor government, somebody who proudly proclaimed in his maiden speech that he is a socialist. In a speech on the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill, in this House in 1994 - get a load of this -  - In 1994, when he was a member of this House, after having been elected, as he claimed, with a mandate to reinvigorate socialism. That is what he said in his maiden speech. I wonder if the member for Melbourne remembers saying this in the House:There should be a return to a tax rate of 60c in the dollar for people earning over $75,000.That is what he said - a 60c-in-the-dollar tax rate for people earning over $75,000. He might be reading News Weekly over there. It won't cleanse your soul of socialism, Lindsay, we know.The Leader of the Opposition believes there should be a red thread running through all government policies. Let me make this point: under this government's tax reforms you won't be paying, on $75,000, 60c in the dollar; you will be paying 30c in the dollar. We do not think people on $75,000 ought to be persecuted by some kind of socialist shibboleth. If thinking like that is what you are getting from the person who would be the minister for finance in a Labor government, no wonder Labor will not be telling you about its tax plans before the election. You can't trust Labor on tax. It never had the wit to reform the taxation system. It does not support our changes and it ought to come clean with the Australian people.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kalgoorlie for his question. The member for Kalgoorlie would be well aware that, through a whole series of decisions that our government have taken over the last 10 years, we have positioned the Australian economy to be one of the most prosperous in the developed world. We have achieved record low levels of unemployment. We are witnessing record low levels of industrial disputation. We are running budget surpluses. We have become net savers, not net borrowers, thus keeping downward pressure on interest rates. But the member for Kalgoorlie would recognise that one of the most important reforms that we have undertaken is paying off Labor's $96 billion debt. That took a lot of hard work and a lot of determined decision making by the government over the last 10 years. That has been achieved.But what has that delivered to the broader economy in Australia and to those massive tracts of Western Australia that the member for Kalgoorlie represents? The first thing it has done, by paying off $96 billion of debt, is relieve the Commonwealth budget of having to pay $8½ billion a year in interest payments. That is $22 million a day we were paying in interest. So that is $8½ billion a year we can invest in other much needed investments in the Australian economy for the future.In this year's budget we announced that we were going to invest a further $22.3 billion in the AusLink 2 land transport program. That takes the overall investment in AusLink 1 and AusLink 2 to $38 billion since we have been in office. That is only half of the savings of the interest we would have paid on Labor's debt, had we not paid it off. Had we not retired that debt, we would have paid $85 billion in interest payments over 10 years. We have now reallocated $38 billion of that onto land transport across Australia. That is what you can do if you are prepared to run good fiscal policy with the Australian economy. And there is no question that the benefits are beginning to be seen right across the nation.As part of the announcements on budget night, we announced that we are going to spend $250 million on local and state government road projects across the nation. There was one critical one in the member for Kalgoorlie's electorate in the shire of Derby-West Kimberley - something you would expect the local authority should have been doing with assistance from the state government, but that is not the case. Because of the decisions that are being taken by state Labor governments across Australia, many of these pieces of road infrastructure are going wanting. So we have stepped in and, as part of our overall strategy in investing in land transport, we are investing in a lot of the local road infrastructure. As a result of the government paying off Labor's debt and saving $22 million a day on interest, we can now afford - without borrowing - to invest in this much needed road infrastructure across Australia. It gives better roads at a local level for farmers to ship their produce out along; it gives better roads to the road transport industry, which can become more efficient; in the member for Kalgoorlie's electorate, it gives better roads for the mining industry - they are earning the export wealth for Australia; and it gives safer roads for mums and dads in urban areas.In announcing extra money to those local and arterial road projects, that $250 million equals only 11 days of the interest payments the Labor Party were paying on the debt they had clocked up when they were in office. Only 11 days: $250 million of projects, 89 projects across Australia. If there is a threat to this, it is the track record of mismanagement by the Labor Party in government. It is a track record they would move back to. I will finish on a comment by the Labor spokesman on transport after the budget. He said in his press release:Auslink II must build on the investment of Auslink I in Australia's strategic economic transport infrastructure. - In answer to the member for Batman: we will, as the government. It is good to see him endorsing government policy. And the only reason we can do it is that we are saving $22 million a day in interest payments which the Labor Party were paying to bankers overseas.</DOC>

The member for Lalor might approve industrial relations policies before the union movement writes them but -  -  - The information campaign was finally approved on Thursday, 17 May. - The process undertaken was exactly the same as the process for any government information campaign. It was the same as the campaign on cervical cancer and the same as the campaign on defence recruitment, on which you have asked no question whatsoever. The process was the exactly the same. 
Opposition members - How much? - The budget for campaigns is a matter for the departments. The MCGC approves the way in which the campaign is run with respect to TV, radio and print.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Gilmore for her question. One of the hallmarks of this government has been to so manage the Australian economy as to keep it growing with low inflation and to give young people the opportunity of a job. Two million Australians who were not in work before this government was elected now have work. That has involved balancing the budget, repaying debt, reforming the waterfront, encouraging people to move off welfare and into work, tax reform, privatisation, tax cuts and industrial relations reform. The proof of the pudding is in the eating. Those policies are now delivering results: more jobs, increased wealth in our community, balanced budgets, better investment in health and aged care and better investment in education. Most people would say that those economically conservative policies have served Australia well through the challenges of the Asian financial crisis, SARS, September 11, war and terrorism and the one-in-100-year drought.You do not become an economic conservative just by retaining an advertising agency to say that you have become an economic conservative. The opposition are very interested in TV advertising and no doubt they would have seen the oh-so-serious Leader of the Opposition on television recently, declaring himself to be an economic conservative. With his oh-so-serious face, sitting in front of a high-rise tower, he was telling people how economically conservative he actually is. But it is not a question of an advertising agent declaring you to be an economic conservative. In this business, the way you prove you are an economic conservative is with deeds not words. Every time the crunch has come in this House, the Leader of the Opposition has gone missing on reforms. Would an economic conservative have opposed those measures that balance the budget? Would an economic conservative have opposed paying off government debt? Government members - No. - Would an economic conservative have voted against the biggest tax reform in Australian history? Government members - No. - Would an economic conservative want union control of the waterfront? Government members - No! - Would an economic conservative oppose industrial relations reform? Government members - No! - Would an economic conservative want nationalisation of telecommunications? Government members - No! - Would an economic conservative have opposed tariff reform? Government members - No! - Mr Speaker, let me ask this question: would an economic conservative want to raid the Future Fund to steal from future generations of Australians? 
Government members - No! - Would an economic conservative want to do that? No, of course an economic conservative would not want to do that. Would an economic conservative, if he really supported all of the hard economic work that has got us to where we are now, describe it as a 'brutopia'? I see that the member for Lilley is now describing himself as 'Scrooge McDuck'. I told you they got their inspiration from Donald Duck cartoons, did I not? 'Brutopia' is a description that the Leader of the Opposition found in a Donald Duck comic and ever since then he has tried to portray that it came from Michael Oakeshott and he just cannot find the reference. Let me tell you: economic conservatives do hard work. Economic conservatives are prepared to make the tough decisions. Economic conservatives are those people who are there in the hard times, setting the economy up for the future. You do not retain an advertising agency, go and have a look at a focus group and say you are entitled to all of the outcomes of all of the hard work and all of the effort. The people of Australia know that economic management comes from hard work and hard effort. It is hard work and hard effort that this Leader of the Opposition has not done, and he does not deserve to call himself an economic conservative.</DOC>

The MCGC does act in accordance with the guidelines, which in fact were brought down by the previous Labor government.

 - First, can I thank the honourable member for Fadden for his interest and say how delighted I am to have my friend Foreign Minister Zebari in Australia today. I think it is his first visit as a foreign minister, but of course we have known each other for quite some years.The foreign minister is a representative of a democratic government. Iraq is one of the bastions of democracy in the world and we are delighted to have that country as a member of the family of democracies in spite of the difficulties that it is enduring. The minister made it very clear that he strongly values the support of Australia for Iraq and Australia's support is deeply appreciated by the vast majority of the Iraqi people. We obviously agreed that the stakes in Iraq are high - high for the Iraqi people first and foremost, for their freedom and for the integrity of the country. The stakes are very high for the stability of the Middle East. Iraq's disintegration would cause a catastrophe. We agreed that Iraq's survival and stability is important to global security. Iraq must not become a safe haven for terrorism or be a place from which terrorists can export death. The foreign minister and I agreed that Iraq is undoubtedly facing a difficult situation that requires resolve and effort. This is not a time to give up. That is the view of the Australian government, that is the view of the Iraqi government and it is the view of many people.The Baghdad Security Plan, as it is sometimes called, or the surge, was discussed and the minister made it clear that although it is not at this stage complete there is a clear-eyed road map for success and there are some positive signs - for example, a drop in sectarian violence. But that is not to underestimate of course the continuation of the violence that is taking place in Iraq. I highlight in particular the endeavours since the implementation of the Baghdad Security Plan by al-Qaeda to create as much chaos and havoc as it possibly can by murdering people, and in large numbers. These are early days for the Baghdad Security Plan; it is still very difficult. But there is a determination on the part of some of us to ensure that those people do not win.I again underline the view expressed by me to the foreign minister - and I know that the Prime Minister and other ministers who have and will meet with him will reiterate these words - using the words of Tony Blair, 'We should not walk away or give in; we should stand by the people of Iraq.' We are prepared to do that. I explained to the minister that this is a controversial issue in Australia, as it is - it is not unusual - in many countries. But, in the end, when people think about this issue and put aside their personal, partisan positions, they need to think about where they ultimately want to see Iraq. What do people believe is going to be a good outcome for Iraq and for the people of Iraq and the Middle East? To put it the other way around, those people who think we should just give up - and, of course, the Leader of the Opposition is one of them - need to ask themselves whether they honestly think it would be preferable for sectarian conflict and al-Qaeda in Iraq to succeed. Do they really think that would be good for the Iraqi people? Do they think it would be good for the Middle East for Iraq to disintegrate into total violence and chaos and to become a base for al-Qaeda? Do they think that would be good? Do they think it would be good for global security if Iraq became a base for al-Qaeda operations around the world? Our answer to those questions is no. We think what would be good for Iraq would be greater stability - and greater stability built on the pillars of democracy. We wish the minister well during his visit and we have been delighted to host that visit.</DOC>

 - Can I say in reply to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that we did not spend $55 million on advertising a name. - We spent $55 million on explaining the implications of the most significant change to Australia's workplace relations system since World War II. I take the opportunity to remind the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that the framework, and indeed the overwhelming substance, of the legislation passed into law in 2005 remains completely unchanged. With respect to what is new, I do thank the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, who is fascinated by brand names -  - but is rather insensitive to the substance of policy. She invites me to talk about focus groups. I invite her to get a few focus groups to try and explain the meaning of her policy, to try and explain that her policy -  - has undergone changes on a daily basis. I will spend a moment on the Labor Party's policy, but before I do so, for the benefit of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, who I know has an interest in these matters, let me assure her that the great substance, the framework, of the legislation that was advertised about 15 months ago has remained completely unchanged. What we have done is to propose - and the minister will introduce legislation next Monday - the introduction of a fairness test. This fairness test will guarantee that any worker who trades away penalty rates or overtime loadings must receive fair compensation in return. I think that is a very good reform. - It is a reform that people have urged on us. - I don't mind acknowledging that there was concern in the community that it might become the norm that those entitlements were traded away without proper compensation. I think, when you make a change like that, you have an obligation to tell the public that you are making the change. I can't understand why the opposition is getting worked up about some ads that simply state a few facts. These ads tell the Australian public that there are rules and obligations on employers under the workplace relations law. That is what they do. They tell you where you can ring. - We are very happy to take questions on the change that we propose to the workplace relations legislation. I thank the Deputy Leader of the Opposition for asking me that question. Let me simply say that the policy which represents a threat to the Australian economy is not the policy which has seen the creation of 270,000 more jobs over the last 12 months, which has seen a continued rise in real wages and which has helped to drive Australia's strike rate to a level lower than it has been since 1913.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Cowper for his question. Many members will be aware of a report released today by the Australian National Council on Drugs, an advisory body chaired by a former minister in our government and a former ambassador to Ireland, Dr John Herron. This body is the peak advisory body to me and to the government on the scourge of drug abuse in the Australian community.Sadly, this report has found that 13 per cent of Australia's children live in a household where there is substance abuse. That includes 230,000 with a binge drinking problem, 40,000 with cannabis abuse and 14,000 with methamphetamine abuse. It has also found that families with parental substance abuse have many other complex problems, including mental illness and a history of abuse and poverty.Although the findings of this report make distressing reading, we should be grateful to the council for having carried out the analysis and made it public. It reminds us that, although a lot of progress has been made - over the last 10 years the government has invested more than $1.4 billion in the Tough on Drugs strategy, which aims to target law enforcement, education and rehabilitation - there is still a great deal more to be done. On 22 April, the government announced a further $150 million over four years to strengthen its fight against illicit drugs and tackle amphetamine type stimulants, including what is colloquially known as 'ice'. This includes more than $100 million for new drug treatment services, with an emphasis on family support, and additional resources to tackle these stimulants; $9.2 million to strengthen drug prevention; and $37.9 million to increase Australia's law enforcement efforts.I think what Dr Herron's report has done is to bring to the attention of the community, and particularly Australian parents, the impact on families and those otherwise closely associated with people who have a severe drug addiction. Many people would have heard the interview with the young mother on Radio National this morning - and perhaps it was on other radio stations, but I heard it on Radio National - in which she described the terrible experience of suffering a seizure, as a result of drug abuse, in her car with her three young children. She was also made deeply conscious of just what a threat her drug abuse represented to the children that she was charged with caring for. That particular personal testimony certainly had an impact on me; I think it would have an impact on many other people throughout Australia, particularly Australian parents.We have come a long way - we have fewer deaths from heroin overdoses and we now have a more intelligent attitude to marijuana abuse. We no longer, as some Australians did only a few years ago, romance in this stupid idea that you can take marijuana, you can use cannabis, without it having any harmful effects. We now realise the enormous contribution that marijuana abuse has made to the level of mental illness in this country and the number of suicides it has been responsible for. I think our campaign has been very, very successful, but this report is a grim reminder that there is a great deal more work to be done, and this government remains totally committed to the task.</DOC>

 - I can certainly understand the member for Kingston's enthusiasm for this question because I can inform him and the House that the GP bulk-billing rates in his electorate have gone up by more than 10 percentage points since the government's 'Strengthening Medicare' program began. Bulk-billing is not the be-all and end-all of Medicare but it is important and it should be widely available, particularly to families and pensioners, and that is precisely what has happened thanks to the policies of the Howard government.We have had the latest statistics on bulk-billing released since the parliament was last sitting. I am sure members opposite in particular will be delighted to know that the bulk-billing rate for children under 16 is 84.9 per cent, an all-time high; the bulk-billing rate for people over 65 is 87.3 per cent, an all-time high; the bulk-billing rate in country areas is 72.6 per cent, also an all-time high; and the overall bulk-billing rate for GPs and specialists, at 73.2 per cent, is at an all-time high, significantly higher than the bulk-billing rate we inherited in March of 1996. Members opposite, including the sound effects man over there, hate hearing this because what these bulk-billing rates prove is that the Howard government is undeniably and indisputably - and I know they do not like hearing it but let's hear it again - the best friend that Medicare has ever had.What these figures also demonstrate is that the Australian Labor Party now has no distinctive health policy of its own, except, if the Leader of the Opposition is to be believed, actually cutting Medicare spending. In a rather rambling interview on the Jon Faine program last month, the Leader of the Opposition said:Well when you look at the amount of money which is wasted in duplication overlap in the health and hospital system ... I believe there is great scope to extract significant savings.When I heard him say, 'I believe there is great scope to extract significant savings' on health, I wondered whether that was him being an economic conservative or whether he was back in his previous guise as an old-fashioned Christian socialist. Either way, the Australian people deserve to know exactly what he meant. If there are significant savings to be made, how much and where exactly are they going to come from? Let me make this point: the Howard government can only afford to increase spending on Medicare because we have a strong economy. If the economy is ever taken for granted, Medicare funding will be put seriously at risk too.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Boothby for the question. I know what really matters to the people of Boothby. The unemployment rate in 1996 was 7.3 per cent in Boothby; today it is 3.7 per cent. That is what matters to the people in Boothby. The flexible workplace relations system that the government has introduced in two tranches - 1996 and then 2006 - represents an opportunity to help to build a stronger economy. We are just starting to see the dividends of the significant Work Choices reforms we announced and delivered last year into the parliament. The ABS - Australian Bureau of Statistics - data that came out last week showed that real wages growth continues at a reasonable and sustainable pace.Of course, since the coalition has been in government, real wages - that is, after inflation - have increased by 23.4 per cent. After 13 years of Labor, real wages went backwards 1.8 per cent. The ABS data last week indicated that women in the workforce, in the last 12 months, have had a real increase in their wages of 3.5 per cent, and for men it has been two per cent. So the wages gap between men and women narrowed over the last 12 months after the introduction of Work Choices. The Melbourne Institute, also last week, released its wages report. You will not hear the opposition talking about this. The Melbourne Institute report said that employees on individual contracts had the largest annual increases in wages in the last 12 months - 6.8 per cent, which is double the wage increases of people on collective agreements, at 3.4 per cent.I was asked about threats. There is no greater threat to the economic prosperity of the nation than the election of a Rudd Labor government. You just need to look at the only economic policy they have released, their industrial relations policy, to gain a better understanding of the risk to the economy. The Labor Party want to reintroduce compulsory union bargaining fees, allow inflationary pattern bargaining, abolish Australian workplace agreements and, most significantly, abolish the Australian Building and Construction Commission, which has helped to deliver the lowest level of strikes in the construction industry since records were first kept in 1913.On the weekend we heard from a number of concerned interests about the fact that the Labor Party want to re-regulate shipping - to take back the industrial relations regime to 13 years ago. They are going to try and regulate every external ship coming into Australian ports. I noticed a report in the Australian only a few weeks ago that said that there were 153 idle ships offshore, cluttering the ports in New South Wales and Queensland. Can you imagine what it would mean for those ports and, most significantly, what it would mean for Australian farmers, miners and exporters, if the Labor Party were able to apply their old-time industrial relations system to external crews that are carrying Australian goods and services? That is taking it back; that is bad for the economy.We know it will happen because Greg Combet said that once upon a time the unions ran the economy in Australia and it would not be a bad thing if they did it again. That would be bad for the Australian economy and very bad for Australian workers.</DOC>

 - The Australian Education Union has embarked on one of the most dishonest campaigns that we have seen. -  - This is a blatant ongoing campaign designed to mislead the Australian public about the true state of education funding in this country. - The Australian Education Union has embarked on a blatantly dishonest campaign designed to mislead the Australian public about the true state of funding for state government schools across this country. This campaign is a not-so-subtle attack on Catholic and independent schools, and the Labor Party have got the Education Union to do their dirty work. This is an attack on Catholic and independent schools and -  - For example, this advertising campaign by the Australian Education Union leaves out entirely the fact that funding for state government schools is primarily the responsibility of state governments. It falsely claims that the Australian government has decreased funding for state government schools, when in fact the Australian government has increased funding for state government schools in real terms by over 70 per cent since 1996. The AEU's advertising campaign also suggests that there is a bias in favour of Catholic and independent schools when in fact that is not the case. - The fact is that there is a bias in favour of state government schools in terms of public funding. Sixty-seven per cent of Australian students attend a state government school, and those schools receive 75 per cent of total public funding. This is a fact, yet the Australian Education Union is out there misleading the Australian public, putting out false information to Australian parents and attacking Catholic and independent schools. The Australian government is obliged to set the record straight and it is considering its options.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Blair for his question. I know that he, along with other members of the coalition, support the announcement by the Australian government that we will invest $5 billion into an endowment fund for Australia's universities. This announcement has received widespread support - virtual acclamation - from all vice-chancellors across the country. We have also committed to ensure that this fund grows over time. We will invest more of the budget surpluses over time in this fund so that we have a perpetual growth fund for our universities and so that they can receive potentially billions of dollars for capital works and research infrastructure into the future.In the face of this universal support for the Higher Education Endowment Fund, what do you think Labor's response was? Labor was typically churlish. The spokesman on education was out there saying, 'We could have done that.' Wrong. Memo to Labor: Labor operates budget deficits. You cannot create an endowment fund out of a budget deficit. Then the member for Perth was out there saying -  -  - As I was saying, Mr Speaker, Labor ought to wake up to the fact that you cannot create a $5 billion endowment fund out of a budget deficit. Then the member for Perth was out there saying, 'The federal government has just discovered that universities need capital - they have never invested in universities before.' Wrong. The member for Perth needs to do his homework. Since 1996 this government has invested almost a billion dollars in capital works alone for our universities. In fact, last week I announced a further $62 million for capital for our universities. This is on top of the $32 million for capital I announced in January, this is on top of the $1.7 billion that the Treasurer announced in the higher education package on budget night; this is on top of the $5 billion endowment fund.The member for Blair will be interested to know that Queensland universities benefited from the $62 million announcement. In particular, we are assisting the University of Southern Queensland to build an education building at the Springfield campus, a health building at the University of the Sunshine Coast and a science building at Griffith University. In New South Wales we are supporting Charles Sturt University with a clinical science teaching facility and the University of Western Sydney with a nursing hub; in Western Australia, a science and engineering building for Murdoch University; in South Australia, at the University of Adelaide, a new building for engineering, computing and mathematical sciences; and, in the Northern Territory, allied health infrastructure for Charles Darwin University. Thirty-four capital works projects have been supported by the Australian government this year alone. I tender the list of those 34 projects that are receiving funding.This is what a decade of strong economic management can deliver: it can deliver a billion dollars to universities for capital infrastructure alone and it can deliver a $5 billion endowment fund. Once you have paid off Labor's $96 billion debt and once you operate in budget surpluses, you can provide for the future and invest in our universities.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hindmarsh for his question. I do not believe there is any secret about that. I believe there is a $52 million information campaign to promote awareness of energy efficiency. - The honourable member would be aware that the government is committed to early action on climate change, and the two most promising avenues for early action are energy efficiency and forestry. We are leading the world in both areas with the Global Initiative on Forests and Climate, and, as the incoming Prime Minister of the United Kingdom observed, Australia is leading the world in energy efficiency. We are the first country to phase in a ban on inefficient lighting.Energy efficiency, however, is a complicated business. There is no one silver technological bullet: the most important thing is to raise awareness. We have a range of programs through the Greenhouse Office - through Greenhouse Friendly, Greenhouse Challenge and so forth. Enormous savings can be achieved at the household level. A key to that is promoting greater awareness of energy efficiency opportunities, and the government is committed to that. If the opposition wants to dissociate itself from energy efficiency, it is free to do so, and it will just underline how out of touch and in the past its climate change policy is.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Grey both for the question and for his impressive and balanced contribution to what has been a very difficult debate inside the coalition parties. I also want to thank other members of both the coalition parties for their contributions. It has been a difficult debate. This side of politics represents all of the great wheat-growing districts of Australia. This side of politics has the interests of the wheat growers of Australia as a prime concern. This side of politics, in formulating the decision that I am about to announce, has taken carefully into account the opinions expressed by Australian wheat growers.I can inform the House that growers will be given by the government until 1 March 2008 as the time within which to establish a new entity to manage the single desk completely separate from AWB Ltd. This may be a completely new entity or a demerged AWB International and it will take over management of the single desk. Very strong majority support was expressed during the consultations led by the respected businessman Mr Ralph with Australian wheat growers that they favoured the retention of the single desk. A figure was cited by him of 70 per cent of the people he spoke to, although only a small minority of that 70 per cent favoured the single desk remaining in the hands of AWB. That is a conclusion that the government completely shares and endorses.Because of the time needed, AWBI will manage and market the 2007-08 wheat harvest but, as a consequence, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry will, subject to parliament passing the relevant legislation - it will be presented shortly - have his power to direct the Wheat Export Authority to either approve or reject a bulk export application extended until 30 June 2008 - that is, the so-called veto power. This will allow time after 1 March next year for the necessary legislation to put in place the new system to come into operation. The veto power in the hands of the minister will continue to be exercised in the public interest and in a way that treats any application for a licence on its merits. The export of wheat in bags and containers will no longer require consent from the Wheat Export Authority. However, the quality of each shipment will need to be certified in order to protect the international reputation of Australian wheat.If growers are able to establish their own entity by 1 March 2008, legislation will be introduced to confer a single desk status on that entity, and in that event the Wheat Export Authority will be given additional auditing and reporting powers to increase its ability to ensure transparency and compliance with international and domestic law by the single desk operator. The Wheat Export Authority's increased powers will include the power to issue an export permit to an organisation other than the single desk holder, but only in exceptional circumstances. Those exceptional cases would include where the single desk operator has been precluded from a market for legal reasons - and that occurred in the case of the AWB's attempted shipment of wheat to Iraq some 18 months ago - where the single desk operator has failed to develop specialty markets, such as closed loop supply chains, and to facilitate the development of a market that the national pool operator has been given the opportunity to develop but has demonstrably failed to do so.If growers are not able to establish the new entity by 1 March next year, the government will propose other marketing arrangements for wheat exports. Let me make this clear to the House. The options available would include further deregulation of the wheat export market. The government believes that the new arrangements will maximise the returns to growers -  - It is not a bad point of order from a former Keating government minister! I make the point in reply to the member for Denison that within a matter of a few weeks of when we introduce the legislation to extend the minister's veto power there will be ample opportunity for the House to fully debate the issue. I want to conclude my answer by saying that the new arrangements will maximise the returns to growers whilst securing our overseas wheat markets against strong international competition. I have often made the comment in the past, and it remains my very strong view, that a retention of the status quo with AWB, given the circumstances revealed in the Cole inquiry, would not have been acceptable to the government, would not have been acceptable to me and would not have been acceptable to the Deputy Prime Minister and Leader of the National Party. Can I also say that, if this country is at some time in the future to move away from a single desk operation, it will need in order to justify that decision to get something decent in return from the corrupted international wheat markets that have worked so heavily against the interests of Australia.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Fraser for his question. I think all members would be well aware that there has been significant commentary and debate about this particular issue for quite a number of months, much of it quite erroneous commentary from the Labor Party. Whilst given the opportunity to comment on the decision the government has taken -  - In making a decision about the future arrangements for the Australian wheat industry, we have taken a decision in the interests of the most important people in this debate, and that is the Australian wheat growers. This is their product that they produce. This is a multibillion dollar industry. They have a significant position in the world wheat market and it is in their interests that we have taken these decisions.The Prime Minister has just announced a set of arrangements that will be put in place to best serve Australian wheat growers and the Australian economy well into the future. We are putting in place arrangements that have been asked for by the industry. We have consulted widely. I do not know of another issue that our government have dealt with where we have consulted as widely or as extensively with industry - with all the players and the stakeholders in the industry - and done it very transparently and out in the open, I might add. After that level of consultation and discussion with industry stakeholders, growers and farm leaders, we have come to this conclusion. It is now up to the industry to establish the entity they want to manage the marketing of the pool in the future. We will support them in establishing that. I will make the point that there has been an enormous amount of discussion and commentary across the nation on this issue. We have now put forward a plan that we believe will have the majority support of growers, a plan that is designed in their best interests.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Stirling for his question. I can inform him that tax policy is absolutely critical for Australia's economic performance. It is tax policy that will either enable business to be profitable and reinvest and create jobs or will hamper business from doing that. It is tax policy which will either raise the necessary services for health and education or will fail to do that. That is why this government has reformed Australia's taxation system, getting rid of wholesale sales tax, bank account debits tax, financial institutions duty, stamp duty on shares, stamp duties on marketable securities and bed taxes; cutting company tax; cutting capital gains tax; cutting every set of income tax rates; and lifting thresholds. All of those things have been absolutely critical for Australia's economic performance over the last 10 years or so. I must say it is why I am surprised that apparently the opposition is not going to have a tax policy at the next election. A tax policy is not an optional extra in a political campaign. It is fundamental. It is the basis of how you pay for all of your services. - It is like a cricket team without a wicketkeeper. It is not like a sunroof on your Commodore: it does not come as one of the options. It is like the steering wheel. It is like the engine. A political party without a tax policy is like a soloist turning up to go on It Takes Two on a Tuesday night. It cannot be done. It is lonely. It is missing something. I was asked whether I am aware of other tax policies. Well, one thing you can say about Mark Latham is that he took a tax policy to the last election: Labor's tax and better family payment plan, from Mark Latham, Simon Crean and Wayne Swan. I had to get this out and dust it down, and reading it reminded me of the good times. It took me right back to the last election campaign, when Labor had a tax policy. Their tax policy, you will recall, was to abolish the $600 per child per annum payment for every child. I had forgotten the lengths that they went to, including producing weekly tables showing how people would be better off, with the weekly tables leaving out the annual $600 payment. They said that, because it was annual, it did not go in the weekly tables. When you took it out, the abolition of that $600 payment did not show as a comparison between the coalition and the Labor Party. You had to get up to page 30 or something in order to find out that they had actually omitted to put that payment in their weekly tables, and that is why I say that you need to read the fine print in relation to the Labor Party and its tax policy. Who will ever forget when Mark Latham went to the then shadow minister for family and community services on the night before the policy release? I will read from one of my favourite works of literature - The Latham Diaries:The night before the policy release, I asked Swan how we deal with the $600 annual payment. He replied: 'Just say that it's not real money, that it's eaten away ... and the indexation swindle'As far as I am aware, that is the only standing Labor tax policy. It has not been withdrawn, and it will not be superseded. If you wonder to yourself why Labor will not be taking a tax policy to the next election, it is because that shoddy piece of work was the policy they took to the last election. If you had had the humiliation that the member for Lilley had in relation to that policy you would not want to take a tax policy to the next election either. I say to the people of Australia: the fine print of Labor's last policy was to take money away from families. The fact that they will not come up with a tax policy means that they are at it again. You cannot trust them. They will not be doing what is in the interests of the Australian people.</DOC>

 - What I have ruled in and what I have stated is in the answer I gave. We are saying to the Australian wheat industry that they will have until 1 March next year to put together a grower controlled organisation, completely separate and divorced from AWB Ltd, which, if it is put together and meets the criterion of being completely divorced and separate from AWB Ltd, can be either a new organisation or a demerged AWB International. If that occurs by 1 March next year the government will clothe, subject to legislation being passed through the parliament, that body with single desk status. The government will also give to the Wheat Export Authority increased powers of auditing in order to achieve greater transparency and the power to issue licences for export outside the pool in exceptional circumstances - and I stress 'in exceptional cases or circumstances'. I indicated in my previous answer what some of those are.As to what might happen if the body is not put together by 1 March, I made that very clear in my answer and I will repeat it for the benefit of the Leader of the Opposition and those opposite. If the industry does not achieve the new entity, either through the demerger route or through another route, by 1 March next year the government reserves the right to propose alternative arrangements, including further deregulation to deal with the wheat industry. I could not be plainer, and I think that is an outcome that the industry will welcome.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Moreton for his question. He invites me to outline to the House the benefits that economic reform has brought to this country. That, of course, invites me to quickly traverse the experience of this nation over the last 11 years. Rather than going through each individual year and dealing with the reforms of a 12-month period over that time, I say to the honourable member that the net result of the economic reform of this government has been an enormous human dividend. I have frequently said to this House that good economic policy is no end in its own right; it is only a great thing if it produces a human dividend. We now have an unemployment rate which is the lowest it has been for 32 years. We have reached an almost full-employment economy, something which none of us dreamt possible even six or seven years ago and certainly not 11 years ago. That is the greatest human dividend of all. The Westpac-Melbourne Institute consumer confidence index said it all last week when it stated that consumer confidence was at a 32-year high. These are the views of Australians who are experiencing these economic conditions.Let me say to the member for Moreton and to the House that we are not where we are with this situation by luck; we are not where we are with this situation just because of the resources boom; we are not where we are as a result of this government just sitting in the cabinet room doing nothing. We are where we are because of a series of hard-fought reforms over the last 11 years and we are where we are with no thanks at all to those who sit opposite because on every occasion the Australian Labor Party has opposed the attempts of this government to get the Australian economy into the shape it is in today.The Australian Labor Party would seek to take political advantage of the current state of the Australian economy, yet at every turn the Leader of the Opposition and his colleagues have endeavoured to stop economic reform. They left us with a deficit of $10½ billion, they left us with a national debt of $96 billion, and having left us with those two appalling legacies they then tried to stop every attempt to get the budget back into balance. It is one thing to leave your successors with a budget deficit; it is altogether a worse thing to then try to stop them getting the budget back into surplus.The Australian Labor Party opposed paying off the $96 billion of debt. They opposed introducing the new taxation system. They opposed reform of the scandals on the Australian waterfront in 1998. On no fewer than 40 occasions, they opposed getting rid of the job-destroying unfair dismissal laws. It was only after the 2004 election, when the coalition secured a majority of one in the Senate, that we were finally able to bring a measure of justice to Australia's small business sector. One of the reasons the level of unemployment has fallen to a 32-year low is that the small businesses of this country are now encouraged by the new climate, without the threat of unfair dismissal laws, to take the risk of employing more staff. They threatened Armageddon when we introduced changes to the industrial relations system, but we are reminded by the ABS statistics, released last week, that total earnings rose by 4.9 per cent between March last year, when the changes were introduced, and February of this year and that, in particular, total female earnings increased by six per cent over that period. The member for Moreton asks: what would be the consequences of reversing these reforms? The consequences would be deadly to the Australian economy.If the Labor Party win the next election and reverse our workplace relations reforms, which they are committed to do, that would represent the first occasion in a generation on which economic reform of a major kind in this country has been reversed. I can put it no better than did Heather Ridout of the Australian Industry Group on Friday of last week. When speaking of the Labor Party's industrial relations policy, she made the very valid point:The almost exclusive focus on Australian workplace agreements is ignoring the breadth of concerns business has with Labor's industrial relations policies which, in their current form, carry substantial economic risk.It may be fashionable at the moment and the Labor Party may think it is on a winner to thumb its nose at the concerns of the business community of Australia, but I remind the Leader of the Opposition and I remind the member for Lilley that it is business risk-takers in this country who make a contribution to our economic prosperity. Business does not operate in a vacuum. Business is not impervious to the economic climate set by the government. If the government introduces policies which are antagonistic to strong forward investment by business, that will have consequences for the growth of business in this country and will lead to a reversal of the greatest human dividend of the policies of the last 11 years - that is, the 32-year low in unemployment.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Maranoa for his question and recognise his close involvement with local government and local authorities over many years, particularly in his electorate of Maranoa in Queensland. As a result of the coalition government's good economic management and the retirement of $96 billion of Labor debt that we inherited in 1996, the government has been in a position to increasingly assist local authorities across Australia with a lot of the cost pressures that they have been left with, particularly those downloaded onto them by state governments abrogating their responsibilities to local communities.In 2007-08 we will provide local government with an estimated $1.7 billion in financial assistance grants - an increase of 3.9 per cent in the amount provided last year, or an extra $65.2 million for local government across Australia. This assistance helps local government, particularly smaller regional councils, to build and maintain local roads and to provide library services, community health care, local water infrastructure and the like - the fundamental services that local government is there to provide to local communities. Mr Speaker, over and above that, as you would recognise, over the years we have also introduced the Roads to Recovery program, which since 2001 has provided about $307 million a year to local governments across Australia to assist them with the challenge of maintaining local road infrastructure - historically something state governments have done and have been responsible for, but they have departed from the field in that regard.We have other specific regional programs of about $112 million, including Regional Partnerships programs to assist local authorities to provide services to their communities and the strategic regional roads program. We are funding projects that should be funded by state governments. There is a good reason for this: we can afford to do it. We see the need and we do it because state governments are leaving the field; they are abrogating their responsibilities.The other program that local government relies upon heavily is the local roads black spot program. The program has been in existence since 1996, since our government was first elected. We funded that again this year to the tune of $45 million. We will increase the funding in AusLink 2 to $60 million a year for the local roads black spot program that is predominantly applied for by local authorities. That is a broad sweep of the assistance that we provide to local authorities. We believe in the importance of that level of government which is the closest to the people and which understands the people and the aspirations of local communities.The member for Maranoa asked about attitudes of other levels of government to local government. We certainly know what it is in Queensland. The Beattie Labor government is completely ignoring any democratic process. It is going to impose forced amalgamations on  local authorities throughout Queensland without any consultation with local authorities and the people in those local communities. Mr Beattie is not varying his course on this. He is ignoring advice from the Leader of the Opposition, who has asked him to reconsider his position on this, but is actually listening to foreign billionaires. I read in the media today that in the house in Queensland Mr Beattie read from a letter sent to him by Virgin boss Richard Branson supporting his council merger proposal. The letter states:This I'm sure is being applauded by the vast majority of Queenslanders, and as a frequent Queenslander myself, well done on this initiative.Mr Beattie will ignore all the people in regional Queensland and ignore the Leader of the Opposition, but he will listen to a foreign billionaire about what he should do with local communities in Queensland. This coalition government will stand up for the interests of local communities. We will continue to fund their aspirations to build and strengthen their economic and social infrastructure. We will do what we say we will do, unlike the Labor Party, who say one thing and do another. There is a great challenge for the Leader of the Opposition to see whether he can wheel Mr Beattie on this one.</DOC>

 - The relevant piece of legislation is called the Workplace Relations Act. Sometimes the expression 'Work Choices' is used. What matters is inside; what matters is the substance. You may, for example, call yourself a fiscal conservative, but you may not in reality be a fiscal conservative. You may say that you believe in careful public finance. One of the things I was taught by my parents as a child was always to look behind the cover, never take too much notice of the cover.I see this book called 'I am a fiscal conservative' and I start reading it: 'I am a fiscal conservative because my party left a $96 billion national debt. I am a fiscal conservative because my colleagues and I opposed every attempt by the next government to get rid of that debt. I am a fiscal conservative because I opposed taxation reform. I am a fiscal conservative because I opposed industrial relations reform.' You can call it workplace relations reform; you can call it Work Choices; you can call it IR, but we all know what he opposed. We all know that if the Leader of the Opposition becomes Prime Minister he will re-establish union control over every workplace in this country. We all know that, if he becomes Prime Minister, he will bring back the burden of unfair dismissal laws. Whether you call it Work Choices or whether you call it -  - it will be union domination. There won't be any choice. You will simply be burdened again with the dominance of collective agreements. Individual contracts will be gone; AWAs will be gone; unfair dismissal laws will be back; and by reversing this monumental reform a future Labor government would put at risk the great economic prosperity that this country now rightly enjoys.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Ryan. I can tell him, and through him the people of Ryan, that it is only when you have a healthy business sector in this country that you are able to create jobs. Jobs are created by profitable businesses supplying goods and services that people want to buy. We would not have been able to see the creation in Australia of two million jobs over the last 10 years if it were not for a profitable business sector. I pay tribute to the small business men and women of Australia who have been part of that wonderful story over the last 10 years of job creation.As we know, the Australian economy grew through the Asian financial crisis, through the tech boom and bubble, through the threat of SARS, through September 11, through war and terrorist attacks. And notwithstanding even a one-in-100-year drought, the Australian economy has continued to grow.It is important that people understand the contribution that business makes to Australia. That understanding is not just a question of gimmicks. You do not get that understanding just with some gimmicky announcement - some PR research advertising a focus group initiative. It is done by doing hard work, taking hard decisions, standing up here and fighting for things that are important in the Australian economy.It is now four months since the Leader of the Opposition promised to establish a council of business advisers. This council was to be chaired by Sir Rod Eddington and, according to his announcement on 1 February, the council was not going to be a rubber stamp; it was going to advise Labor on business. I think I can successfully report that since 1 February to this day, Sir Rod is yet to be joined by any members on this council. It would not be that hard for Sir Rod to chair a meeting of this council because no-one else comes. There is only member: one constitutes a quorum and one constitutes a unanimous majority.I am aware of those members who have been approached by the Labor Party and refused to join the council, but I will be keeping a very close eye on further invitations. But people will think it is passing strange that Sir Rod was going to chair a committee which has no members, and to which the Leader of the Opposition has managed to attract absolutely nobody in the last four months. I must say that the promise that this council would not just be a rubber stamp proved to be extraordinarily hollow, because when it came to the first critical test - the industrial relations policy - not only was Sir Rod not consulted but he was described as 'just another voice' by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. And no doubt in due course, if anybody else does join the council, they will just be 'other voices' in relation to that.We can contrast Labor's business council, which has no members, with Labor's support for and inextricable involvement with the trade union movement. I will be corrected if I am wrong, but I think I can say that every single Labor Party member of this House is a trade unionist. I think I can say that every single Labor member is a member of a trade union. If those that would like to out themselves as not being trade union members would like to raise their hands now, I will conveniently read into Hansard those that are not members of a trade union. 
Government members - Oh! - The member for Hunter is not a member of a trade union. I don't think there is any other member of the Labor Party that is not a member of a trade union. I just have to get this clear in my mind: Labor has one member -  - I have been asked about the importance of business, and the importance of business to national policy. I am making the point that, while there is only one businessperson that has been appointed to advise the Labor Party, there is only one Labor Party member that is not a member of a trade union, apparently. -  - She is a member! I thought it was unanimous! At the next election - get a load of this! - the Labor Party plans to bring into the parliament Greg Combet, Bill Shorten and Doug Cameron to join ex-ACTU bosses Martin Ferguson, Simon Crean and Jennie George. Richard Marles from the ACTU is coming on -  - Richard Marles - that is his title; he is an official of the ACTU. In fact we would hope very strongly that a better member than Richard Marles is elected in Corio. And I know Mr Gavan O'Connor is with us in relation to that particular idea. If you want to know where Labor stands on business, just contrast the lack of any businessperson joining their council with the 100 per cent coverage by the trade union movement of the members of the parliamentary Labor Party. Labor does not seem to have any trouble getting trade unionists into this parliament - none whatsoever - but it does seem to have a great deal of trouble getting businesspeople onto their council of business advisers. That tells you where the Labor Party stands. The Labor Party does not understand business. The Labor Party does not have strong relations with business, and if the Labor Party gets elected it will not be in the interests of business but in the interests of the trade union movement that it will govern.</DOC>

 - Let me answer the question by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition by recalling the thunderous denunciation that came from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition when the Iemma government in New South Wales ran a campaign, in the lead-up to the New South Wales election, about the new state plan. -  - It came on at every over break of the cricket on Channel 9 - the ultimate obscenity as far as I am concerned! - and was filled with these absolutely ludicrous ads from the New South Wales government that were pure puffery. They provided no information, and it was ultimately revealed that the cost of the advertising campaign exceeded the cost of the plan. - I remember how much that was denounced by the Leader of the Opposition when he joined Morris Iemma for the last campaign rally in Western Sydney and said what a great Premier Morris Iemma would make! You are total hypocrites on this subject. But let me just remind those who sit opposite, who say that it is a multimillion dollar PR campaign -  - I will come to the question - calm down; don't get too excited! - of cost in a moment. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition referred to this as a multimillion dollar PR campaign. Let me read the substance of one of the advertisements. This is what it says: Australia's workplace relations system has a set of rules and obligations that all employers are required, by law, to comply with. That is a pure statement of fact. It goes on to say: No-one can be forced to sign an agreement. a pure statement of fact - And any agreement signed by an employee aged under 18 must also be signed by a parent or guardian.That is a pure statement of fact. It goes on:Other obligations include: ·           Minimum wages ·           Working hours ·           Four weeks paid annual leave.I thought that the minimum wages was the one that was omitted. That was the 11th tablet that came down from the mount. It continues: ·           Ten days paid sick leave. · 
          One year unpaid maternity or paternity leave.There is no PR in that; they are just pure statements of fact. Then it goes onto say:The Workplace Authority will check agreements against a Fairness Test to make sure you get a fair deal.Another statement of fact.If an agreement doesn't pass the Fairness Test, it will need to be changed so that it is fair and the employer will have to make up any back pay.That is a terrible thing to tell people about, isn't it? It says:For more details, use the Workplace Infoline or the web site.The deputy asked whether I can confirm evidence in the Senate. I will have a look at the evidence. Many times bitten, many times shy. The opposition are past masters at saying, 'Will you confirm such-and-such, which was said by somebody on such-and-such an occasion?' I will have a look at what was said in the Senate and if I can issue any confirmation I will.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and I appreciate his interest. I will be visiting the United States from tomorrow at the invitation of Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, and the visit -  - We will come back to the Labor Party in a second. I will be visiting the United States at the invitation of the Secretary of State, Condoleezza Rice. It will be an opportunity to discuss issues such as the fight against terrorism in Afghanistan and in Iraq, regional security issues, including the North Korean issue, the issue of climate change - going beyond the failed Kyoto protocol - and, naturally enough, we will talk about the upcoming APEC leaders meeting. It is important to ensure that countries in the region have a coordinated approach to that meeting. This visit underscores the depth and the importance of the relationship between Australia and the United States in our economic ties, our cooperation on regional, military and counterterrorism issues, and so the list goes on.I noted last month that the Leader of the Opposition made his one trip overseas as Leader of the Opposition. Honourable members mock that I am meeting with Condoleezza Rice, but it was good enough for the Leader of the Opposition to travel 40,000 kilometres to Washington and to New York and to come back again. We all know he met with Rupert Murdoch, which was entirely appropriate, but what interested me about this trip, his only trip overseas as the opposition leader, was that he did not meet a single political leader, Democrat or Republican - not one. He met officials, of course, as you would. He loves the expression: 'I am the alternative Prime Minister. As the alternative Prime Minister' - and he purses his lips at that - 'I am now travelling to the United States of America.' We all prick up our ears: how terribly exciting that is going to be. While he is over there he does not meet with the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense or the National Security Adviser - he meets none of those people. He does not meet any of the congressional leaders, he does not bother to meet Democratic Party candidates for the presidency such as Hillary Clinton and he does not meet any of the Republican candidates for the presidency. It is an extraordinary thing that the Leader of the Opposition would travel 40,000 kilometres, meet Rupert Murdoch - which is of course entirely appropriate, as I said before - but not have time to see any political leaders in the United States of America. That trip was not a good investment of taxpayers' money.This amounts to a demonstration of a point: Labor wants to downgrade the relationship with the United States. It is pretty obvious. You would not travel halfway around the world, as an opposition leader, meet no political leaders and travel all the way back again if you wanted to upgrade the relationship with the United States of America. I think not. The opposition spokesman on foreign affairs - honourable members may be interested to know who that is: it is the member for Barton - did an interview, which was quite a surprise, with the Sunday Age. He said:Australia cannot risk alienating China as there is no guarantee the United States will remain the dominant power in Asia ...If that is not an illustration of my point that Labor wants to downgrade the relationship with the United States, I do not know what is.The fact is that this government has been able to achieve not only a very strong relationship with the United States but a strong relationship with China, with Japan, with Indonesia and with India. We have been able to build strong relationships with all those countries without offsetting one of those relationships against another. I know the member for Barton is no great expert on these issues, but he has let the cat out of the bag: Labor wants to rejiggle those relationships -  - and have an opposition leader who travels 40,000 kilometres and does not meet a single political leader. I rest my case.Leave granted.</DOC>

 - Through you, Mr Speaker, let me inform the honourable member that I am perfectly happy to concede, to admit and to plead guilty and say that, having decided on the change and having announced it on the Friday, we had made arrangements to put some advertisements in the papers over the weekend. But bear this in mind: the change was to have effect from Sunday night. Didn't we have an obligation to inform the public of the change? Those who sit opposite are being completely opportunistic about this issue. If we had made the announcement, which had effect from midnight on the following Sunday, having made it on Friday, without taking out any advertisements to inform the public of what was involved, those opposite would have come in here demanding to know why we had created confusion. -  - They would have been demanding that - and you know that. The honourable member thinks he has got some question time blister on me by asking this absolutely Exocet like question. Of course we took out advertisements, of course we let the Australian public know what change we were making and of course that was the right thing to do.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Bowman for his question. I can tell him and the House that Australia has a very good record in health and medical research. The six Nobel prize winners that we have in this area attest to that. Thanks to the Howard government, by 2009, National Health and Medical Research Council grants will total some $700 million a year. That is a five-fold increase on the situation that the government inherited back in 1996. There is more good news from the Howard government. In the recent budget the government committed an extra $436 million for health and medical research infrastructure, including $100 million to relocate most of Western Australia's medical research institutes at the Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital and the St John of God Hospital. I know the member for Bowman is very interested in the allocation of $100 million to the Princess Alexandra Hospital and the University of Queensland to build a medium-scale biologicals-manufacturing plant in this country to enable us to better take advantage of our health and medical research.You can only spend this money if you have a strong economy. I make this point: if you are going to wreck the economy, because you hand over its management to the ACTU, you will also wreck health policy and prevent health spending. The Leader of the Opposition knows that he will not have this kind of money to spend on health, because he is already softening us up for big cuts in health spending. I refer, again, to his long and rambling interview with Jon Faine last month. This was the interview that he had to do because the ABC was accusing him of running away from hard questioning. This was the interview, you might remember, where he said, 'I'm only driving a Ford Territory because the government won't let me drive a Prius,' which turned out to be a total fib. In that interview, the Leader of the Opposition said:Well, when you look at the amount of money [that] is wasted in duplication overlap in the health and hospital system _ there is great scope to extract significant savings.That is what he said. I ask him, quite reasonably, on behalf of the Australian people: where are these savings coming from? Are they going to come from the $8 billion that the government spends on hospitals? Let's face it: he was very good at cutting funding to public hospitals in the days when he was an old-fashioned Christian socialist back in Queensland. Is it going to come from the $3 billion the government spends on the private health insurance rebate, which he voted against in this parliament, before he had his politically convenient conversion to an economic conservative? Or is it that he is going to cut the Medicare safety net, which helped 1½ million Australians last year, given that his ambitious deputy was so keen to cut it completely before the last election? He says there is great scope to extract significant savings in health spending. He is not just a commentator; he is not just the associate professor of Mandarin at some university - he is the man who is arrogant enough to think that he will be Prime Minister by Christmas, and he ought to tell us exactly what these savings will be and where they will come from.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for McPherson for her question and note that she works incredibly hard in her electorate to help keep economic prosperity in place. In 1996, the unemployment rate in her electorate was 10 per cent. Today it is four per cent. That has come about because of the hard economic decisions made by this government and opposed by the Labor Party, which have helped to keep economic prosperity in place.For young Australians, wages are up in real terms. There are more jobs than ever available for young Australians. In fact, if you look at it today, you will see that only one in 27 teenagers in Australia is now unemployed and looking for full-time work - a 3.7 per cent unemployment rate. Under the Howard government, youth wages have increased in real terms by almost one per cent a year, every year. Under the Labor Party, real wages went backwards for young people by 0.3 per cent every year. So wages for young Australians are growing three times faster under the Howard government. They have more jobs than ever. As the OECD found, when we got rid of those unfair dismissal laws, small business in particular had the courage to take a punt on employing someone who had never had a job - and that is good for young Australians. The Labor Party wants to reintroduce those unfair and discriminatory unfair dismissal laws to small business, and that will inevitably lead to fewer jobs for young Australians and fewer jobs for women.I am asked what the great threat is. Unquestionably, the greatest threat is the Labor Party. The Labor Party's industrial relations plan has been written, authorised and paid for by the trade union bosses who are now going to come into the parliament in waves like a tsunami at the next election. Isn't it interesting that all of the trade union bosses have found themselves a safe Labor seat and these so-called high-profile candidates have been put into marginal seats or safe Liberal seats. It is very interesting, isn't it? -  - Of course, the union bosses have always been about taking care of themselves. - When it comes to the threat to the economy, there is no greater threat than the Labor Party with its industrial relations regime. I picked up the Adelaide Advertiser this morning -  -  - I got through my Weeties - and one of its articles said: 'Retail sector fears Labor's AWA rollback'. I thought to myself: what does this mean? It went on to say:State Retailers Association chief executive John Brownsea said _ Businesses put a lot of time and money into establishing AWAs so to have them scrapped would be costly.The article continues:Information and Communication Technology Council of SA chairman Dean Littlefield said many of the state's 1200 IT companies were small and needed flexibility in their employment contracts to remain profitable.In the article, he is quoted as saying:Unless flexibility is included in any approach to IR laws for small to medium businesses then there's going to be real concerns that we will be priced out of the market.They will be priced out of the market by the Labor Party's industrial relations plan. The medical industry said in the foreseeable future AWAs could be a 'useful way of attracting people to the industry' and easing the doctor shortage. That is from the AMA. In relation to the hairdressing industry, Hair Machine managing director Vincent Renaldo said the Labor Party policy 'would take away the choices of small businesses employing small numbers of staff and make employers uneasy about hiring' - like hiring young Australians who have never had a job and hiring women who have been out of the workforce. That is what the Labor Party wants to destroy. The restaurant and catering industry said that it will have a 'huge impact on 35 to 40 per cent of restaurants which use AWAs'. The Labor Party policy will mean 'lost money and productivity'. The road transport industry said: 'Many companies across the road transport industry use AWAs. Abolishing AWAs could have a big impact on the industry.'The Labor Party is a major threat to the Australian economy. The Labor Party is a major threat to jobs. The Labor party is happy to see people on lower wages. The Labor Party is happy to see people unemployed. And the Labor Party wants to see more strike action because that is what the union bosses want. That is bad for Australian workers and that is bad for the Australian economy.</DOC>

 - I will check what I said, but I will tell you what I do remember. I do remember an advertisement that appeared in the Australian on, would you believe, Monday, 26 September 1985. I have a long memory about these things. It appeared under the heading: 'To end an unfair and antiquated tax system, we had to take some tough decisions'. This was a newspaper advertisement selling the virtues of the soon to be doomed option C, where the Keating government proposed the introduction of a 12½ per cent consumption tax. I also remember that the people who sank tax reform in 1985 were the leaders of the Australian Council of Trade Unions. It was the objection of the ACTU - the member for Hotham remembers this, and the member for Batman has the decency to grin because he knows what I am saying. - Can I also say that when you read this, it reduces the information campaign that we have launched in relation to the IR changes to a bland statement of the obvious and of reality. I remember this ad very well. It was perfectly okay for the Keating government to spruik the virtues of taxation reform with an expensive advertising campaign almost 22 years ago. The other thing that I remember -  The member for Melbourne then left the chamber.  - In 1985, can I just remind the House, it was the leaders of the trade union movement that sank tax reform. If my memory serves me correctly, the strongest support that the then Treasurer got from any significant political figure -  - If my memory serves me correctly, I think the then Deputy Leader of the Opposition and opposition spokesman on Treasury matters, the member for Bennelong, gave the then Treasurer more support for the cause of taxation reform than he received from his own Prime Minister or from the Australian Council of Trade Unions. On that note, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper.

 - No, I cannot confirm any of those matters because the Future Fund is an independent statutory corporation which makes these decisions itself and is not subject to government direction. The government was neither consulted nor could it intervene in relation to any of those matters. And can I, on the way through, make this point: the Labor Party will either respect the independence of the Future Fund or it will not and, if the Labor Party wants to reserve unto itself the right to interfere with the Future Fund, we will let the people of Australia know about it. We will let the people of Australia know that the Labor Party has designs on something which was set up for the future of this country and not for the cheap political opportunism of this Australian Labor Party. I have every reason to believe that the Future Fund acted with propriety, and if the Labor Party thinks that it has not then the Labor Party should come out and say that the contract should be annulled.As I understand it, the other bidder - and I am only going on what I have read in the paper - was the National Australia Bank. One could say that the National Australia Bank has been the subject of its own inquiries, has it not? Were there not currency traders at the National Australia Bank who have been the subject of charges? - Saying it is analogous? What, that somebody has been convicted of a crime whilst working for the National Australia Bank? No, I would not say that that was analogous at all, but I will say this for the National Australia Bank: it dealt with those matters, as it should have. I have seen in relation to the National Australia Bank that it has been the subject of various inquiries and, after those inquiries, it has fixed itself up. Does it have an unblemished record? No, the National Australia Bank does not have an unblemished record. It would be very, very dangerous to say that no financial institution which has ever been the subject of litigation could be trusted in relation to the financial affairs of individuals or companies or government, because I do not think you would find a financial institution anywhere in the world that has not been the subject of litigation - certainly the National Australia Bank would not be in that category. As far as the government is concerned, the Future Fund conducted an open and honest tender. It has made its decision accordingly. The government does not believe that it should intervene, and if the Labor Party does, let it come to the dispatch box and say so.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Wakefield for that question. The member for Wakefield has been an articulate proponent of the interests of families in his electorate since he came to this place some 2½ years ago. In reply to that question, the very essence of a strong economy leading to a prosperous society is the flexibility of that economy. If we look at the Australian economy today, if we look at the fact that real wages are 20 per cent higher than they were 11 years ago, if we look at the fact that we now have the lowest level of industrial dispute since 1913, the year before World War I broke out, if we observe the historically low levels of interest rates in recent years, if we observe the fact that Australia has a 32-year low in unemployment, we will see these are the great human dividends of economic reforms that have been carried out - especially over the last 10 years. I can say unequivocally to the member for Wakefield that the reforms of the last 10 years that have made the Australian economy more flexible have indeed underpinned the current prosperity of the Australian economy.One of those reforms, of course, was the reform of our industrial relations system. Those reforms have seen, over the last year or more, an additional 270,000 jobs. They have seen, as I said a moment ago, industrial disputes fall to their lowest level since 1918. They have seen continued rises in real wages and, importantly, the reforms of the past year plus earlier industrial relations reforms, including those of 1996 and the courageous reforms of the Australian waterfront in 1998, have produced a situation in which this country can now enjoy the benefits of a resources boom without the old centralised wage-fixing system flowing through the economy with disastrous consequences for those firms that are not in a position to afford the wage levels paid in areas like the mining industry.It is instructive to read what the Governor of the Reserve Bank had to say in February this year. He said:We are not getting today what we might once have gotten had we had a shock like this - the late 1970s resource boom or earlier occasions. On those occasions, the strong sectors would get a big pay rise and, through the centralised wage setting system, that would flow through to everybody else, through the Arbitration Commission. That does not happen any more.Famously, that led to my predecessor as Prime Minister saying that George Campbell had 100,000 dead men hanging around his neck. George Campbell unfortunately has become the 101st dead man because he has been replaced by Doug Cameron. He in fact is the only trade union official who is leaving the parliament on the Labor side. It makes interesting reading. We had confirmation yesterday that 100 per cent of Labor members of parliament are union members. This is despite the fact that only 15 per cent of the private sector workforce are members of a union. Almost 70 per cent of the ALP frontbench are former union officials, three out of every four Labor senators are former union officials, the unions have already donated over $50 million to the Australian Labor Party since 1996, and more union bosses are set to enter the federal parliament at the next election through safe Labor seats or Senate spots.Let me give you some of the names. We have Greg Combet, and he is taking the seat of Charlton. He is the secretary of the ACTU. Bill Shorten is taking the seat of Maribyrnong and he is the National Secretary of the AWU. Doug Cameron is taking George Campbell's Senate seat and he is the National Secretary of the AMWU. The member for Lilley can stand as much as he likes, but nothing can alter the fact that I am reminding the Australian public -  - of the way in which the union bosses are taking over the parliamentary Labor Party in this place. We have Don Farrell - you have not heard of him, but he is coming. He is the National President of the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association and he is coming into a Senate spot in South Australia. We have Richard Marles, the Assistant Secretary of the ACTU, who is coming in in Corio - and doesn't Gavan know that he is coming in in Corio - and we have Kevin Harkins. He is the Assistant Secretary of the Electrical Trades Union and he is coming in in Franklin.Additionally, there are an army of other union bosses running in coalition held marginal seats. Note that the trade union bosses elite all have very safe seats. They look after their own, don't they? You do not have Greg Combet running in a marginal seat. You do not have Richard Marles running in a marginal seat. They knock off sitting members and the elite, the creme de la creme, of the ACTU bosses are coming into this place via very safe seats. Of course, they are joining the member for Batman, the member for Hotham, the member for Throsby and other office holders of the ACTU who already sit here.It is no wonder that one of the central commitments of the Leader of the Opposition is to overturn the historic reforms to Australia's industrial relations system. What he will do if he becomes Prime Minister is roll back for the first time a major economic reform. It will be the first time in a generation that a major economic reform is being rolled back. But it is hardly surprising, because in the 11 years that the Labor Party have been in opposition they have behaved as irresponsibly as they intend to behave if they become the government of this country after the next election. They opposed getting the budget back into surplus, they opposed paying off $96 billion of government debt, they opposed taxation reform, they opposed waterfront reform and they opposed the second round of industrial relations reform; yet they would have the Australian public believe that their economic credentials are the same as the coalition's. If the Leader of the Opposition wants to be taken seriously as a fiscal conservative, he has to explain to the Australian people why, since he entered the parliament in 1998 - and I remind him that the very first significant vote he cast after entering the parliament in 1998 was against taxation reform, on 10 December 1998 - he and his colleagues have consistently voted against all of the reforms that have given us the economic prosperity we now enjoy. - </DOC>

 - That shows a fundamental misunderstanding of the act, because the appointment of a contractor to act as custodian is not a part of the investment mandate - nor, under an investment mandate, could you stipulate who was to get a contract in relation to custodian services. It is very interesting, isn't it, that the member for Melbourne asked this question. His implication seems to be that the government should intervene in relation to who is appointed as the custodian for the Future Fund. The member for Lilley is good at getting to his feet, but when he gets to his feet he generally does not face this way; he generally faces the other way. But members of the parliament might be very interested to know what the member for Lilley had to say on the subject. He was asked this question yesterday: 'Would Labor consider putting a caveat over the Future Fund legislation to ensure' - and I think this is what you are suggesting should be done - 'that in the future it is managed locally?' Mr Swan replied:It's very important that the Future Fund doesn't become an object of pork barrel by this Government - the reason it should not become an object of pork barrel by this government is that it is an object of pork barrel by the Labor Party, but we will move on from that - very, very important. So Labor has argued consistently that the Future Fund ought to be independent.Now if it takes those decisions independently it's entirely a matter for them.Oh! - I am asked this question: why don't I exercise a nonexistent power under section 18 to direct who the Future Fund appoints as its custodian? I point out that neither is this an investment mandate nor does the government have a capacity to intervene in the Future Fund. I produce in this parliament as exhibit A the member for Lilley. Exhibit A, the member for Lilley, said:... Labor has argued consistently that the Future Fund ought to be independent.Now if it takes those decisions independently it's entirely a matter for them.'Entirely a matter for them'! That is what Labor were saying yesterday - 'entirely a matter for the Future Fund'. But today the member for Melbourne would have you believe that the government ought to intervene and it ought to direct who the Future Fund appoints as its custodian. Too clever by half. Get your story straight. If the Labor Party believe that the government should intervene and direct the Future Fund on who it appoints as its custodian, or its banker, or its chief executive, for that matter, let them stand here at the dispatch box - let them say it. But don't go around the business community saying that you believe in an independent Future Fund and then sneak up here to the dispatch box trying to lead to an impression that you have a contrary view. This is the modern Labor Party all over: they will walk both sides of the street but they will never have the courage of their convictions. You can have it one way, you can have it the other way, but you cannot have it both ways.</DOC>

 - Over the last decade Commonwealth tax to GDP has fallen from 22.8 per cent to 20.7 per cent. In that time the government has cut income tax in 2003, in 2004 -  - there goes the sound-effects man again; he is wearing a pink tie today, too, whereas the member for Lilley has a red tie - in 2005, in 2006 and in 2007. And there will be a second instalment in 2008. Let me remind the House - and I think this is instructive - that on 1 July 2000 the proportion of taxpayers who had a marginal tax rate of 30 per cent or less was 30 per cent. Today the proportion of taxpayers who have a marginal tax rate of 30 or less is 80 per cent. Let me say that again: in 2000 the proportion of taxpayers who had a tax rate of 30 per cent or less was 30 per cent; today it is 80 per cent. People will remember the Labor Party's income tax scales, which had you paying the top marginal tax rate on your first dollar over $50,000. Tax reform commenced in 2000 with the cutting of income tax and the introduction of GST to replace wholesale sales tax, financial institutions duty, bank account debits tax, stamp duty on marketable securities, stamp duty on shares, bed taxes and a host of other taxes, some of which unfortunately the Labor states have still not abolished. I do not think there would be anybody today in Australia who would argue that the GST should be repealed and wholesale sales tax should be reintroduced. It would be like saying: get rid of the modern motorcar and let's go back to the horse-drawn cab. I do not think anybody would say that.But the trick of politics is not to be able to see what was right in hindsight; the trick of politics is to be able to see what is right prospectively. That is why it is worth going back and looking at what people said in 1999, when the government made this historic reform. This is what the Leader of the Opposition said, and I am going to read it to the House because it reflects on his ability - his foresight - in relation to economic policy. This is what he said in this place in 1999 when he was opposing the historic tax reform to abolish wholesale sales tax and replace it with GST and to cut income tax:When the history of this parliament, this nation and this century is written, 30 June 1999 will be recorded as a day of fundamental injustice - an injustice which is real, an injustice which is not simply conjured up by the fleeting rhetoric of politicians. It will be recorded as the day when the social compact that has governed this nation for the last 100 years was torn up.That is what he said in his opposition to GST:When the history of this parliament, this nation and this century is written, 30 June 1999 will be recorded as a day of fundamental injustice ...I will chance my arm on this. In the history books that are written and that will go into Australian schools over the next generation, I think 1901 will be there: Federation. I think 1788 might be there. I think 1939 to 1945 might be there, and I think the 1914-1918 war might be there. I think the September 11 attacks might be there, but I will warrant - and I am taking a big punt - that in the chronology of Australia's history 30 June 1999 will not be there as the day of fundamental injustice.Can't you just see it? 25 April, Anzac Day; 30 September, grand final day; 11 November, the sacking of the Whitlam government -  - 30 June 1999, 'Injustice Day'! 'Injustice Day', the day that the government reformed taxation! It is all very easy to sit back here in 2007 and say 'I am an economic conservative'. It is very easy to say that now, but when the hard work was being done reforming this economy in 1999, he was not just off the pace; he was off the planet. He was off the planet with this kind of rhetoric.The important thing in relation to economic policy is this: it is not what you see with hindsight but what you see in the future.</DOC>

 - No, I cannot confirm any of those matters, because the government does not manage the contracts. Nor does it manage the tenders, and nor does it do due diligence in relation to contracts of the Future Fund. - The Future Fund is an independent statutory corporation which is managed by a board of guardians, and the government can no more intervene in its contracts than it could intervene in other statutory corporations. The guardians of the Future Fund have conducted a tender process; they believe that they have appointed the best value for money and the best service in relation to that. I understand what the member for Melbourne is doing: the member for Melbourne is trying to impugn the reputation of the guardians of the Future Fund. Well, good luck to him! But if his point is that any bank or financial institution which has been subject to litigation is unsuitable to conduct business then there will not be a bank in the world that could conduct business.Certainly all of the Australian banks, and the National Australia Bank is one example, have been subject to litigation. It has had employees that have been subject to prosecution, but it has never lost its licence. As far as I am aware the National Trust Bank has never lost its licence; it has never been prohibited from conducting business. While it has a valid licence in relation to financial and banking procedures then obviously it is satisfying the regulatory requirements. While the board of guardians are managing the Future Fund and doing it in a transparent way they are obviously discharging the law.If the Australian Labor Party says that the government should intervene, let it come to the dispatch box and say so. Let the Australian Labor Party come to the dispatch box, after saying yesterday that it would not interfere in relation to the Future Fund. Let it come to the dispatch box and say it would. If it is not prepared to do that, we can only conclude that this is petty politics which does not have any substantive policy behind it.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hinkler for his question - and for the assistance given by members opposite! I recognise the great job the member for Hinkler does in his area, particularly with the regional shire councils that he supports. What is the government doing to support local communities? We are strengthening the Australian economy and therefore strengthening local economies and local communities in a number of different ways. Obviously, the overall economic reform program that we have implemented across Australia has benefited not only major urban and metropolitan areas but also regional communities across Australia.Unemployment is at a 32-year low, not just in the cities but in many of the regions across Australia, which have benefited from historic low levels of unemployment. Historic low levels of industrial disputation across Australia benefit many businesses in regional Australia. Running budget surpluses and keeping downward pressure on interest rates assists people living in regional and rural communities.Yesterday, I mentioned a number of specific programs that we run - Roads to Recovery, National Road Safety Black Spot Program - which help local government authorities in regional communities. Importantly, since 2003 we have been running the Regional Partnerships program, which has significantly strengthened the social and economic fabric of our communities in regional Australia. Since that time, 2003, the government has assisted local governments and local communities - like those in the member for Hinkler's area - to fund more than 1,266 projects. More important is the value of those projects and the contribution that has come out of those local communities. Our contribution to those 1,266 projects has been $278 million, which has leveraged $972 million in cash and in-kind contributions from local communities and local authorities. We welcome that. We congratulate those communities. It is something we should celebrate in Australia - local communities helping themselves improve the circumstances of the people who live in those areas.In many parts, this is being led by local government, the form of government closest to the people of Australia. Local government work with their constituents and communities every day of the week. We have made those investments with local government through Regional Partnerships. Roughly every $50,000 of taxpayers' money that has been invested in those projects has generated on average three jobs. The 32-year low level of unemployment which we are enjoying in Australia is contributing significantly to the reform process that we have introduced in so many different ways and regional Australia is able to invest in much needed projects which generate employment opportunities. We are standing with our regional communities and with the local authorities that represent their interests.The member for Hinkler asked, 'What are state governments doing?' We know what the Queensland government is doing. It is trying to rip the heart out of regional Queensland with their forced amalgamation process. They are doing it in a very shameless and arrogant way. Mr Beattie continues to say, 'This is in the interests of all Queenslanders.' The Leader of the Opposition has appealed to him, saying that he does not think this is a good idea, but Premier Beattie is not listening to the Leader of the Opposition. He claims to be listening to foreign billionaires. Yesterday, I mentioned that he claimed the support of Richard Branson of Virgin Airlines. He quoted from a letter that Richard Branson had sent him in the Queensland parliament. When you get hold of the letter and read a little bit more, you see that it says exactly the opposite. Richard Branson actually opposes the forced amalgamation of local government in Queensland. In Richard Branson's letter to the 'Dear Premier', he says:I am totally opposed to Noosa Shire being amalgamated with any neighbouring shires.But Mr Beattie is claiming - erroneously - to the parliament in Queensland and to all Queenslanders that he has the support of Mr Branson. Mr Beattie is ignoring all the regional communities in Queensland that are opposed to this happening and he is ignoring the Leader of the Opposition. It just shows you the lengths the Labor Party will go to - they say one thing and do another. We know that the Leader of the Opposition has been out there trying to convince the Premier of Queensland that this is a bad idea. We also know that, when the Leader of the Opposition was chief of staff to former Labor Premier Goss, a few things happened in regional Queensland under his hand. He cut 600 jobs out of the department of primary industries, shut down four regional DPI offices, shut down 46 country court houses, closed 13 regional railway lines, shut down country schools and cut 403 teaching positions.The people of Australia should know not to listen to what the Leader of the Opposition has to say to Premier Beattie. He supports what Premier Beattie is doing because Premier Beattie is finishing off the job that the Leader of the Opposition started when he was working for the Goss Labor government in Queensland.</DOC>

 - I certainly would have made a statement to that effect then, yes - I would have. That is not in any way inconsistent with the argument we are now putting that, if those things are traded away, there should be fair compensation in return. - I do not know what all the fuss is about. - There is of course a difference between me and the Leader of the Opposition. The things which I say I now stand for have been matched by the attitudes I have taken both in government and in opposition. The Leader of the Opposition's problem in the great debate about economic credibility is the words of the old saying, 'Don't listen to what I say; have a look at what I do.'In the time that he has been in parliament, this person who aspires to be Prime Minister of this country has voted with his colleagues in the Labor Party against every major economic reform that this government has put up. I have a division list here. Within weeks of the member for Griffith being sworn in after the 1998 election - indeed, on 10 December 1998 - I find the name 'Mr Rudd' amongst the 67 noes who voted against the new taxation system. Here is the division list. There is a mountain of division lists that will be produced in this place that will attest to not the economic conservatism but, rather, the economic-wrecking instincts of the Leader of the Opposition. He voted against taxation reform, he voted against industrial relations reform, he voted with his colleagues to stop the budget being put into surplus -  
 -  - he voted against the sale of Telstra, which helped to fund the elimination of our $96 billion national debt left by courtesy of his colleagues. His frontbench colleague says, 'Oh, we believe in a $5 billion higher education fund.' The only problem is that, if the Leader of the Opposition had his way, there would be no surplus out of which that $5 billion fund could be established.The truth is that every single opportunity the Leader of the Opposition and his colleagues have had in this place over the last 11 years to put to rights the wrongs that they left us in 1996 has been passed up. Now he is asking the Australian people to forget about the last 11 years - 'Don't look at the fact that I oppose tax reform, I oppose paying off our debt, I oppose getting the budget back into surplus, I oppose industrial relations reform, I oppose the sale of Telstra. Don't look at any of that; forget all about that. Airbrush that out of my record and out of Australian political history. Just believe me: I am reformed and I believe in responsible economic management.'I say to the Leader of the Opposition through you, Mr Speaker, that, in the great debate about economic credibility, the Australian people will be reminded with increasing frequency, with increasing scrutiny and in an increasingly meticulous way of the failure of the Leader of the Opposition in all the years he has been in this place since 1998 to demonstrate that he has the credentials to call himself economically responsible.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Solomon for his question and his genuine interest in Australia's Indigenous population. - The member opposite is correct: we all have a genuine interest in Australia's Indigenous population. I believe that 40 years ago the aspiration of the Australian people that was reflected in the overwhelming yes vote was to see more opportunities and a better future for Australia's Indigenous population. There have been many positives. Today we have an Australian Indigenous surgeon. I am sure that 40 years ago many people would have thought that was unachievable.Since 1986 there has been a reduction in the unemployment rate for our Indigenous population from 35 per cent to 16 per cent. In 1972 to 1974, the appalling reality was that the infant mortality rate in Queensland and the Northern Territory for our Indigenous population was 78 out of every 1,000 births. Between 2003 and 2005 it was 11 in Queensland and 16 in the Northern Territory - still far too high of course, but a far cry from where it was. Between 1973 and 2002, the prenatal mortality rate decreased by 55 per cent in Queensland, the Northern Territory and South Australia. The causal mortality rates decreased by 16 per cent on all causal mortality between 1991 and 2003. The school retention rate through to year 12 has gone from 30 per cent to 40 per cent.All of these things are positive, but I am sure that no-one in this House and no Australian believes that the aspirations of the Australian population in 1967 have been realised. We could stand here on the eve of the 40th anniversary and perhaps decree that we would somehow set an artificial target about increasing Indigenous life expectancy or further reducing mortality rates. Those things would be admirable, but would they be achievable and would we just be setting up a false horizon unless we actually deliver the things that are necessary? We all recall the promise that no child would be living in poverty by 1990 - well meant but empty rhetoric. There is no point in empty rhetoric when it comes to the Indigenous population of this country. They have had too much empty rhetoric for far too long. The Howard government did not set a target of five per cent for unemployment. We had that as an aspiration and we have achieved it and exceeded it. We set about achieving things and realising real goals.I was disappointed only last week to see what can happen when you set goals. The Queensland government signed a local Indigenous partnership agreement - an agreement between the people of Mornington Island and the Queensland government. In it they had an aspiration of having 75 per cent of children attending school. That meant that they felt that 25 per cent do not count - that is what it is saying to that community. The reality is that we should have an aspiration of 100 per cent of students attending school. We have to have that as an aspiration and then we have to deliver what it takes to make that happen.The Howard government delivered $1.6 billion in the last budget to give a real go for real housing improvements in remote Australia - $1.6 billion to reduce overcrowding, to improve health circumstances and social living conditions and to give people the parameters they need. These are very practical measures.The reality is that many of the things we have been talking about are now starting to come to fruition. Noel Pearson delivered a speech to his own community up in Hope Vale recently, which I had the great privilege to hear. I suggest to every member of parliament that they read it; it is one of the great speeches of our time. To confront your own people and say that you will no longer tolerate child neglect, that you will no longer accept alcohol abuse, drug abuse or gambling abuse, and to say that your own people, your own family, are a sad reflection upon the people who came before them - those were the sentiments that he expressed - shows enormous leadership. But the people of Hope Vale have now taken up the cudgels, and what they are demanding is a massive change in welfare reform, housing reform and land reform.The sad reality is that a former minister for Indigenous affairs, Robert Tickner, slammed the Queensland government back in June 1991, when he said:The legislation in Queensland as it stands will not help Aborigines when it talks about land tenure.Sixteen years later, those same people are saying to me, 'Please give us land tenure change so that we can have the right to own our own homes, so that we can aspire.' That is what the Howard government is trying to deliver.We have just signed a landmark agreement in the Northern Territory with Chief Minister Clare Martin, worth over $150 million, to deliver some of these things. I congratulate the Western Australian government, whose minister for Indigenous affairs is wanting to deliver a better future and is agreeing with the Commonwealth government's programs.I come back to aspirations. Unfortunately, in the last two months in Kalumburu in the East Kimberleys, in a community of about 450 people - about 190 adults - some 11 men have been charged with child sex offences, including the mayor or chairman, the deputy chair and other people of great authority - 11 out of 190-odd adults. I ask all of us in this place: what chance have those children got of ever having an education when they are subjected to that sort of behaviour in a community? There was no police station in that community; there is today. As a result of our summit on sexual violence, we have now dedicated the money for a police station in Kalumburu. We have three more police stations going into remote Western Australia. But what should happen is not what happened in Mutitjulu when the Commonwealth government spent $1.9 million and the Northern Territory government did not man the police station. What a hoax and a fraud upon the people of Mutitjulu, and the children and the women who have to put up with those conditions.The Tiwi Islands people have now signed a historic agreement to go to 99-year leases. They will have a new future for their people. The people of Galiwinku want to do the same. The people of Wadeye now have embraced change. This is because the Howard government will sit, listen and work with Indigenous Australians. We will not set artificial targets but we will deliver for Indigenous Australians, and we will reach the aspirations that we all so desperately looked for in 1967.</DOC>

 - The Deputy Leader of the Opposition will understand that without looking at the agreement she holds aloft, I am not going to confirm or deny anything that might be in it. From here, even the sharpest eyesight would not be able to read everything in that document, and she knows that.She invites me to say something about penalty rates, overtime and loadings for shiftwork or weekends. It is true that I have argued in the past - and I do not deny it - that these should be matters of negotiation. I have never denied that. I have argued that in the past. But can I also tell you about somebody else who has argued it in the past. Let me read something to you. - I quote:I've negotiated numerous agreements where we'd negotiate, say, an all-up payment, an all-up rate in lieu of, you know, penalty rates for working shiftwork or weekends.In other words, 'We've negotiated them away in return for something that's fair.' That was said by none other than Greg Combet, the current Secretary of the ACTU. I know that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has a brief on this, and I know that she did a deal with the unions that completely excluded the interests of many of the wealth creators of this country. As a result, we now have the Labor Party committed to a return of union domination of the industrial relations system. As Heather Ridout of the Australian Industry Group said, the debate about AWAs, important though it may be, has obscured the fact that the real poison in Labor's industrial relations policy is the return of the dominance of collective bargaining. And what Labor will bring back is a situation where, wanted or not, a union having award coverage over a particular workplace will be able to inject itself into a negotiation at that workplace, to the detriment of the interests of the workers and the employer.I am proud of the industrial relations reforms that this government has made. I am proud of the Reith reforms. I am proud of the fact that the destructive and uncompetitive behaviour of the MUA -  - on the Australian waterfront was broken in 1998, and I make no apology for breaking the power of those unions that were destroying the international competitiveness of this economy. We moved from an hourly crane rate of 17 to crane rates of 27, and Labor would reverse that.What is really at stake in this industrial relations debate is the determination of Labor to go back in time. What is at stake here is the refusal of the current Leader of the Opposition to show the courage that Tony Blair showed to the British trade union movement when he became the leader of the British Labour Party. He said: 'You cannot go back. The changes of the Thatcher government are here to stay because they are good for Great Britain.'Let me say this: the changes we have made ought to stay because they are good for Australia's future. I say to those who sit opposite: if you want to deliver a mortal blow to the Australian economy then you should persist with your policy of turning back industrial relations reform and, if you are elected as the government of this country and you turn back those industrial relations reforms, history in the future will record that you have done an enormous disservice to the working men and women of this country.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Greenway for that question. I note that in 1996 the unemployment rate in Greenway was 8.8 per cent; today it is 4.2 per cent. It was 8.8 per cent unemployment in Greenway at a time when the Labor Party were running the industrial relations system hand in glove with the trade union bosses - the same trade union bosses and the same industrial relations system that the Labor Party want to take us back to should they be elected to government.Under the reforms made by the Howard government in the last 14 months alone, 326,000 new jobs have been created, 45 per cent of those jobs going to women and 85 per cent of those jobs being full time. The female participation rate in Australia is near an all-time high of 57.7 per cent compared with the 53.7 per cent when we came to government in 1996, and the wages gap between men and women has narrowed under the Howard government. In 1996 women were earning 87 per cent of male earnings and today it is 89.4 per cent, despite the fact that there has been a significant increase in the number of women going into the lower paid industries such as retail and hospitality compared with male dominated industries such as mining and construction, where there are higher wages. In addition, the government has provided over $28 billion in family-friendly initiatives, such as the baby bonus, the family tax benefit and the childcare tax rebate, which help to provide flexibility and give women options when they want to return to the workforce.That has not come about by accident. It has come about because of the economic reform undertaken by this government - and opposed all the way by the Labor Party. The Labor Party opposed us on the first wave of industrial relations reform in 1996, which created Australian workplace agreements. If you believe the Labor Party, AWAs have been around for only 15 months, yet they have been around since 1996. In a modern workplace, people want the flexibility provided by Australian workplace agreements. The old industrial relations system set up under Labor - managed by the Labor Party for the union bosses - was so inflexible that it drove a lot of women to become casual workers, and it drove a lot of men to become independent contractors because the mainstream industrial relations system could not accommodate the needs and aspirations of those people. So we changed the system. We put in place a flexible mainstream system that brought people who wanted flexibility into the mainstream industrial relations system, and that delivered flexibility.So when you go to Port Macquarie and meet women who have been employed for 13 years as casuals and who for the first time get a contract that they can go and borrow money against because the AWA is flexible enough to give them the mainstream contract, you say, 'Isn't that good news for families? Isn't that good news for women?' That is the flexibility in the mainstream system that gives women the opportunity to get a job. It helps them to shape, in negotiation with employers, family-flexible hours. Do you know what else? It is delivering higher wages, fewer strikes and more jobs. That is what our system does. That is what economic reform does. Opposed all the way by the Labor Party, our workplace reforms have delivered the flexibility that is empowering women in the workforce in a way that we have never seen before in Australia's history.</DOC>

There is a guarantee which I have given in the past and which I am very happy to repeat - that is, interest rates will always be lower under the coalition than they would be under Labor. The other guarantee I give is that if the Labor Party wins the next election and repeals our industrial relations laws unemployment will rise significantly.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Barker for his question. Representing an export electorate, he would be deeply conscious of the importance of good trade to our national economy. As he mentioned, our exports reached $210 billion in 2006. That is more than double the level of exports from Australia when we came to office. Australia's 42,000 exporters, supported by this government, have done a fantastic job in taking Australian manufacturing, mining and agricultural products to the world. But there is no doubt at all that their capacity to boost our exports has been significantly boosted by the reform to our waterfronts. The fact that this government was prepared to take on our ports, which were so often gridlocked, and actually get them working has made a real difference to Australia's export capability. As the Prime Minister said a little while ago, when we came to office our five major ports managed a pathetic 16 or 17 container movements an hour. Labor and the unions told us that that was as good as it can possibly be, that it could not get any better than that.We set about reforming the waterfront and now we regularly achieve 27 crane movements an hour, and we are well and truly up with world's best performance. That has made a real difference. This government has been prepared to take on the necessary reform and deliver results to achieve real benefits for our economy. Labor of course opposed all of those reforms. They were out there protesting, setting up pickets and getting actors and performers to demonstrate that this was the end of civilisation, that it was a threat to workers' rights. One of the people who was most active in organising these pickets was in fact Robert Coombs, the former branch secretary of the MUA in Sydney. Mr Coombs has moved on and is now part of the latest class of union hacks to be ushered into the New South Wales parliament. At the beginning of this month, he made his inaugural speech to parliament. He chose as his topic the extraordinary change that has come over the waterfront in Australia - this is from the man who organised the pickets against waterfront reform. In his maiden speech, he said:Australian ports are recognised as amongst the most productive and efficient in the world - The member for Swansea further said:Our stevedoring industry is delivering crane rates and other productivities equal or better than world's best practice, and this is testament to the innovation of management and the maturity of its workforce.So the man who organised the pickets and resisted all of the reform is trying to take credit for the improvements that have occurred in the workforce as a result of this government's determination to reform it.Unfortunately not everybody in the maritime workers union is similarly convinced. In fact, after the ALP national conference, the MUA put out a press release in which they claimed to have secured the support of the Leader of the Opposition and the Labor Party to go back to the old ways, to commit to cabotage and ensure that Australian jobs in shipping and offshore industry are preserved. - The member for Batman is nodding his head. He was very quick to go to the press to say, 'The MUA has got it wrong.' The old union boss was telling the new union bosses that that is not the way it is. I thought that the best thing to do to find out about this was to go to the ALP website and look for a report on the ALP conference. When I looked at the website, I found that it said:The Platform as adopted at 44th ALP National Conference (April 27-29-2007) will be posted shortly.I do not know whether the honourable member for Batman or the MUA has got it right as to the policy and what the Leader of the Opposition agreed to in relation to waterfront reform. But I am suspicious that the deal with the MUA will be another return to the old ways. The Leader of the Opposition is fond of saying that the resources boom will come to an end. Well, it will come to an end if Labor are elected and they return the old-style union dominated policies to our waterfront. If we cannot get exports across the ports, yes, the boom will end and so will the boom for our economy, and it will be as a result of mismanagement, not as a result of world events and the performance of Australian exporters.</DOC>

 - No such decision has been made by me or, to my knowledge, by the government. But I do reserve the right to engage in a public information campaign in relation to these matters. I do reserve that right. I know the Leader of the Opposition and his colleagues have been talking a lot about government advertising. I think it is legitimate to inform the Australian public of changes to the law. I defend the IR campaign. It is not a political campaign. I defend the superannuation campaign. And I defend the campaign in relation to private health insurance. All of those campaigns are in relation to changes to the law and I think the Australian public are entitled to know what those changes are.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Pearce for her question, and I acknowledge her work as the co-chair of the Parliamentary Diabetes Support Group. Diabetes is a very serious and growing problem in this country, as it is in most developed countries. I regret to inform the House that more than a million Australians have diabetes; 90 per cent of them have type 2, which is lifestyle related. It is often undiagnosed until it becomes evident in serious ill health. -  - Mr Speaker, what is going on over the other side? We have a bunch of cuckoos opposite -  - Type 2 diabetes is a very serious issue. It is lifestyle related. I am pleased to say that the government has introduced in the budget a new program to tackle it. The government has been steadily improving its support for people with diabetes. We put insulin pump consumables on the National Diabetes Services Scheme a couple of years ago. We put Lantus and Levemir on the PBS late last year. In the recent budget we announced a new prevention program involving a test administered by GPs, a diabetes risk assessment consultation and the potential for referral to a subsidised lifestyle modification program. This will not make diabetes go away, but it is certainly another step in the government's campaign against it. It is estimated to cost $103 million over the forward estimates period. I simply make the point: the government can only afford to invest this additional money in the health of all Australians because we have a good economy. If you wreck the economy, you wreck health policy as well. What you cannot do is trust members opposite to have the money to continue to support a good policy in this country.</DOC>

 - That is in no way inconsistent with the answer I have given. While we are in righteous indignation about government advertising, may I draw the attention of all members of the House to page 7 of the Australian newspaper today. - I was very careful in the answer I gave. Everything that I have said was absolutely true. Let me tell the House -  -  - Let me inform the House that, under the heading 'Clean coal for the future', a full-page ad has been taken out by the Queensland government. Given the announcement that was made by the Leader of the Opposition three days ago about the policy of a future Labor government, I look forward to his public denunciation of this advertisement of what the Queensland Premier has done. This cannot by any semblance of the imagination be justified as anything other than a blatant political advertisement. All the Queensland government are doing is announcing the expenditure of money. They are not explaining a new law. They are not telling the citizens of Queensland what their obligations are under this new law. It reads:In an historic agreement the Queensland Government and the coal industry have announced a massive investment to ensure the future of our State's vital coal industry, and the jobs it creates.That is just pure political propaganda. Yet we have a deafening silence from the man who sits opposite. I look forward to the Leader of the Opposition attacking the Queensland Premier for wasting the money of the taxpayers of Queensland. This is a blatant example of the double standards of the Australian Labor Party on this issue.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Braddon for his question and acknowledge his championing of all things agriculture. I have visited his electorate. I know how highly regarded he is by primary producers. He is an indefatigable champion on their part. The recent budget provided $2.4 billion in new funding for Australian agriculture. This funding built on the government's strong record of policies and programs that help our farmers and rural industries manage the many complex issues they confront on a daily basis. In addition to providing funding for many successful quarantine, natural resource and food industry programs already in place, an additional $50 million was provided for the first ever Environmental Stewardship Program, which will establish contracts of up to 15 years with farmers and other landholders to preserve and restore high-value environmental assets.The member for Braddon asked whether I was aware of alternative policies. As members of the government and indeed the farming community well know, the Labor Party is bereft of ideas, let alone policies different from the government's when it comes to agriculture. You have to dig very deep to even find any reference, passing as it might be, to primary production. But I did find an interesting doorstop transcript on the ALP website. I went looking for it; it does not come out and hit you between the eyes. It was a doorstop interview, dated 15 May 2007, by the shadow minister, whose name I will reveal for the first time in this place and, I suspect, in rural Australia - Senator Kerry O'Brien. I read the transcript -  -  - Not the ABC's The 7.30 Report; it is the politician Kerry O'Brien, who is in parliament. I read the doorstop interview. I was quite impressed, I have to confess, not by its content but by its fluency and its conciseness. But there was something else about it that rang a bell with me. It was eerily familiar. By the way, it is dated 15 May and it deals with the budget. It is the budget response given a week later. Leaving that aside, I return to the media statement that the same shadow minister issued on 9 May with regard to the budget. Remarkably, I find that the doorstop is almost identical to the media interview. In fact, the media statement is 329 words, and 300 of them are replicated exactly in the doorstop.I know the experience of a doorstop is a very intimidating one. National correspondents representing the best and brightest of journalism are gathered around you, close up and personal, firing questions from all angles. You commit a few phrases to memory but you cannot commit whole sentences, whole paragraphs or whole pages to memory. I have highlighted the documents that I have here in colour code for the convenience of opposition members. Here is the media statement of 9 May - I feel like I am on Media Watch - and here is the doorstop interview. You can see that it is reproduced almost in whole.The farmers of Australia want more than phantom doorstops. They want more than a shadow minister who plagiarises himself. They want considered policy, and they are not getting it from the Labor Party now, and nor will they get it in the future. I table the media statement and the subsequent doorstop.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. I acknowledge that Sunday is the 40th anniversary of the historic referendum. It was a historic day. I can certainly remember handing out how-to-vote 'yes' cards on this particular issue with the former Lord Mayor of Sydney, Doug Sutherland, who had been the Labor Party candidate in the seat of Parkes. I think we worked together at the Campsie Public School. It was a rather unusual experience to be working together on that issue. So, certainly, there was a great mood of bipartisanship.In relation to the issues identified by Jackie Huggins, a woman for whom I have a profound regard, I think the most appropriate thing is for both the Leader of the Opposition and me to put forward in good faith our own views. I do believe very strongly that this nation has a long way to go, and I share the views of the Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, the member for Longman, when he said yesterday that, rather than setting particular targets, our own generic target should be to completely close the gap in life expectancy between Indigenous and other Australians.We have made progress, but that progress has not been enough. I particularly applaud the efforts that are being made by the minister to improve Aboriginal housing in the Northern Territory. I am as distressed as he clearly is by the refusal of local communities to recognise that, if there is to be progress in areas like that, there needs to be an assumption of greater personal responsibility. My views on these matters are often very similar to those expressed by Noel Pearson. He has spoken very regularly of the need for the Indigenous people of Australia to break welfare dependency and to assume greater personal responsibility.There are some areas in relation to the symbolism of reconciliation where my views and those of the Australian Labor Party are different, and I am quite open about that. There is no point in engaging in any false positions. To the extent that our views do coincide, we should put them forward with vigour and without rancour; but, where they disagree, we should be frank about that disagreement. I had different views from the Labor Party about aspects of the Bringing them home report. I do not retract those views. I do not expect the Labor Party to retract its views. I have a different attitude from the Labor Party in relation to a formal apology. My view has not changed in relation to that, and it will not change. I do not expect the Labor Party's to change. I think we should put those things on the table. I think we are united in our desire to see the Indigenous people of this country become in every way part of our mainstream Australian society while continuing to recognise their special place as the first Australians and continuing to recognise their right to treasure their own particular culture. But I have always held the view that the best way to help the Indigenous people of this nation is to give them the greatest possible access to the bounty and good fortune of this nation, and that cannot happen unless they are absorbed into our mainstream.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Boothby. He represents an electoral division in the state of South Australia which has a very big stake in the success of the $10 billion National Water Initiative that I announced on 25 January this year.I must say that I am puzzled at the attitude being taken by the Victorian government. It is at odds with the view expressed to me on at least two occasions by the Victorian Premier when I have personally discussed this matter with him and when he has given me every encouragement to believe that it would only be a matter of time before Victoria joined the national water plan.This plan has been endorsed by New South Wales, by Queensland, by South Australia and by the Australian Capital Territory. The Premier of Victoria wrote to me on 22 May expressing his view that the scope of powers envisaged under the draft bill are 'beyond the terms of any discussions to date'. With respect to the Premier - and I say this courteously and politely because this is a matter where we should deal with each other both with courtesy and in good faith - that statement by him is wrong. The referral of powers that we have sought is completely consistent with the referral of powers set out in the communique which came from the water summit of 23 February 2007. That communique - and this is the communique which was supported by New South Wales, South Australia, Queensland and the ACT - made it quite clear that the Australian government would assume responsibility for a number of functions, including water planning, water rights and water pricing. Without a unified approach to matters such as water pricing and trading practice, the management of water resources will not be consistent and markets will be distorted.I believe very strongly, as I am sure do most members of this House, that it is overwhelmingly in Australia's interests that the Commonwealth assumes control of the Murray-Darling Basin system along the lines that I have outlined. The only government that is standing out is the Victorian government. We have not asked for more in the draft legislation than we asked for on 23 February. It is not correct of the Victorian Premier to argue otherwise. In the letter he wrote to me he did not provide me with any real detail as to where he felt the draft legislation went beyond the request or the remit canvassed in the communique of 23 February. So I frankly confess to utter puzzlement as to what the Victorian Premier is getting at. We need Victoria; Victoria's irrigators will suffer and the irrigators of other parts of Australia will suffer if this plan does not go ahead.Let me say that I have every confidence in the way the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources has been handling this matter on behalf of the Commonwealth, and he will be meeting his counterparts, I gather, in the next few days to further canvass these issues. But, the Premier having written to me, I have written back to him today responding essentially along the lines of this response. But I have indicated that if he is willing to provide me with more detail of his concerns I invite him to come and see me in Canberra next week so that we can personally discuss the issue.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Moncrieff for his question and for his work on the finance and treasury committee, where he takes a very keen and very good interest in all of these matters. Can I inform him, and through him the House, that an Australian on average wages, $46,240, in 2007-08 will pay tax of $8,371. If this government had indexed thresholds from 1996, that person on $46,240 would be paying $10,238 in tax. The point I make about this is that if this government had indexed tax thresholds over the 11 years since 1996, a person on average wages would be paying $1,867 more than they will be paying in 2007-08 - in other words, over and above indexation there has been a tax cut of 18.2 per cent for a person on average wages. I am going to say that again: over and above indexation there has been a tax cut of $1,867, or 18.2 per cent, for a person on average wages of $46,240.So you will hear from time to time - and I heard this false claim being made as recently as yesterday from the member for Melbourne - that all the government does is hand back bracket creep. If all the government did was hand back bracket creep then a person on average wages would be paying an additional 18 per cent in tax. No, this government has done much, much more than hand back bracket creep over the last 11 years; this government has handed back bracket creep and provided real tax cuts in addition. This is because the government fundamentally reformed the tax system in 2000 and has now cut tax in 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007.We are now in the countdown to 'Fundamental Injustice Day'. As I informed the House yesterday, 'Fundamental Injustice Day' is 30 June. It was proclaimed 'Fundamental Injustice Day' by the member for Griffith - the Leader of the Opposition - who, in opposing tax reform in this House, said:When the history of this parliament, this nation and this century is written - It is almost Churchillian, isn't it! It is stentorian!When the history of this parliament, this nation and this century is written, 30 June 1999 will be recorded as a day of fundamental injustice - an injustice which is real, an injustice which is not simply conjured up by the fleeting rhetoric of politicians. It will be recorded as the day when the social compact that has governed this nation for the last 100 years was torn up.'Fundamental Injustice Day', so proclaimed by the Leader of the Opposition, 30 June 1999, was the day when this government swept away the wholesale sales tax, financial institutions duty, bank account debits tax, stamp duty on shares, stamp duty on marketable securities, bed taxes and cut income tax. This day of absolute fundamental injustice has apparently gone down in history as such a terrible day that, if he gets elected, the Leader of the Opposition proposes to do what about it? 
Government members - Nothing! - Nothing. It was a day so bad that it would be remembered in the history of the 20th century and yet, if he is elected, he intends to do all of nothing about it.Members of the House will recall that the Luddites were the 19th-century mobs that opposed economic reform and smashed textile machines. Let me come to this century. People will remember that the economic 'Ruddites' were the people who opposed tax reform, the balancing of the budget, the paying off of debt, independent monetary policy, industrial relations reform and union control being broken on the waterfront. You do not become an economic conservative with a good advertising agency. The Leader of the Opposition is no economic conservative; he is an economic 'Ruddite' who has opposed all of the reforms that got us to where we now are and he has no credibility in directing economic policy for the future.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Barker for that question. I am delighted to inform him that we have had some recent evidence of the benefits of flexibility in our workplace relations system. According to the Adelaide Advertiser of today's date, the City of Port Adelaide Enfield, which is one of the largest councils in the state of South Australia, has negotiated a non-union collective agreement directly with its workforce. This is not an AWA, it is not a common law contract; it is a collective non-union agreement. It is a very interesting collective non-union agreement. It provides for an annual pay rise of four per cent; it is for a period of five years; the staff voted 169 to 93 in favour of the agreement; and 84 per cent of people voted. Interestingly enough, the agreement was opposed by the Australian Services Union, which is the union that has award coverage. They started off on the negotiations but towards the middle they decided to pull out. It is very interesting to read the description given to the attitude of the union by one of the spokespeople for the workforce, Rebekah Yates. This is what she had to say:'Those guys have a different backing. Their backing is from a national point of view that they're against WorkChoices,' representative Rebekah Yates said.'It became apparent that they were not interested in anything else.'So what you have is a situation where an agreement manifestly for the benefit of the workforce, providing in each of the five years for a four per cent increase, was voted for overwhelmingly by the workforce and opposed by the union. Why was it opposed by the union? Because it is not in the interests of the union movement to support these kinds of agreements. It is not in the interests of the union movement of Australia because these agreements can actually be concluded without the participation of a trade union under the current law. The point I want to make is that, if the Labor Party's current policy is introduced - if Labor were to win the election and introduce its policy - this kind of agreement would not be possible. - The member for Lalor, right on cue, says that that is not right -  - But it is right. - The union was originally involved in the negotiations and, under the Labor Party's policy, Fair Work Australia would be able to require the employer to negotiate in 'good faith' with the union. - If there was a disagreement between the union - and the member for Hotham knows; he is nodding his head. He knows that I am right. - If there was involvement by the union, that would be enough for Fair Work Australia to say, 'Righto employer, you've got to bargain in good faith with the union,' and if there is disagreement they would compulsorily arbitrate the so-called dispute and the individual workers would miss out. This is the sort of flexibility -  - This is not an AWA, it is not a common law contract; this is a collective, non-union agreement, and they are the sorts of agreements that are allowed under our policy. They are the sorts of agreements that would be killed stone dead under the policy of the Australian Labor Party.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for McPherson for her question. In 1997 the coalition government put in place a workplace regulator with real teeth - the Office of Workplace Services. The Office of Workplace Services has recovered nearly $50 million for underpaid employees since 1997. Since March last year, the OWS has recovered $11.4 million on behalf of over 7,400 underpaid employees. It has also taken legal action - I think you people should be listening to this -  -  - It has also taken legal action against more than 40 companies. The OWS, which will soon become the Workplace Ombudsman with additional powers, has investigated and prosecuted big and small companies who have treated their employees badly.This government is committed to proper and thorough investigation by a well-resourced regulator when allegations of improper activity are made. This is in stark contrast to the Labor Party and the trade union movement, who are prepared to trample over the top of people who may be acting in good faith but, at the same time, are running businesses to help to employ other Australians. For example, only yesterday the Leader of the Opposition and Deputy Leader of the Opposition, together with a cheer squad in the union movement, reacted to a media report about a small business - the Lilac City Motor Inn - in the New South Wales drought affected town of Goulburn. I will not pass judgements on the employment agreements offered specifically to their workers until I have the full facts provided to me by the Office of Workplace Services, but what I can say is that there is a human cost to this story.The motor inn was bought by Don and Joanne Doolan two years ago when it had only six employees. Today it has 13 employees. Don and Joanne Doolan have two small children. In those two years, the Doolans have worked very hard to build the business up and involve themselves in the Goulburn community, particularly - as the member for Hume would know - during a very difficult time for a severely drought affected town. After the Labor Party and the unions whipped up outrage about the motor inn yesterday, I am advised that this resulted in customers ringing the business to say that they would never stay there again. -  - In addition, as a result of the publicity whipped up, the Doolans have received hate emails and phone calls from across Australia and even overseas. Whenever serious allegations are raised, we will properly investigate them, but we are mindful of the fact that when allegations are made, you have to check the facts. If the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition had yesterday made a phone call to this business -  - then they would have found out that this business -  - is trying to employ -  -  - When a small business is trying to employ people and create wealth, it has responsibilities to its own staff and it has responsibilities to the broader community. When the Labor Party and the trade union movement try to make a political point next time, they should bear in mind that businesses like this help to prop up the Australian economy. -  - </DOC>

 - Not that I am aware of. I might add - because the Labor Party has not asked me any questions about this this week - that we make no apologies for letting the workers and employers know where to go -  -  - when they have been treated -  - Some employers need to know and some employees need to know. We make no apologies for properly informing the Australian people of the laws in relation to workplace relations. We make no apology either for properly informing people of where to go, what number to ring and to what website to go to find out if they are being underpaid by their employer.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Kooyong for his question. I can inform him that this government formed, of course, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, that this government has increased funding for the corporate watchdog by 69 per cent above CPI from 1996 and that ASIC's budget has grown from $128 million to $291 million. In that period it has been extremely successful in bringing to account those who have transgressed corporate laws: for example, its taskforce on HIH has to date seen eight defendants convicted and sentenced on 31 charges - very extensive and very fast - and it has really been able to work with maximum priority.But I am concerned that there apparently is a proposal to gut the corporate watchdog. The Australian Labor Party has said that it has a plan to take $129 million out of the corporate watchdog over the next four years should it be elected. That message is pretty clear, I think. The Labor Party is saying to people who want to transgress corporate laws that it will be a lot easier if Labor gets elected - that the Labor Party will be taking away $129 million. Why would you want to do that? If you believed in upholding corporate laws and enforcement and in protecting the public, why would you propose to cut funding to the corporate regulator? The reality is that if you take $129 million out of ASIC some of the investigations will have to be wound back. The Labor Party might tell us whether it wants to wind back HIH. James Hardie is another special investigation which ASIC is currently undertaking. There are other investigations in relation to pyramid schemes. But if you want to take $129 million out of the corporate regulator you are giving a green light for more people to breach corporate laws.I would have hoped that corporate regulation and corporate law enforcement in this country would be bipartisan. We have worked very hard to send that message to the corporate community. I think law-abiding Australians who want to be protected from corporate spivs will find it very hard to understand why the Australian Labor Party wants to wind back corporate law investment, investigations, prosecutions and enforcement. The only thing I can do is appeal to the backbench members of the Labor Party, who undoubtedly have not been consulted about this matter and probably do not even know about it, to rein in those people who want to gut ASIC and to make it clear that they will not stand for winding back corporate law enforcement. While this policy remains on the books, the Labor Party will never be able to talk about law enforcement because, as I keep on saying in this parliament, it is deeds, not words. If you wanted to talk about corporate law enforcement, you would not be trying to gut the corporate cop.</DOC>

 - We had a significant increase in traffic to the website and in phone calls to the info line after the ads appeared. People are asking a vast range of questions, including questions about the state industrial relations systems and requesting information about state laws. Of course, the federal Workplace Infoline is going to take those questions on notice and come back to individuals with information that may answer their questions. I think that is an entirely appropriate way to respond. You know what? We do not want people to make up the answers. -  - I really do not think the Labor Party should laugh. The Labor Party makes up allegations and the Labor Party seeks to make up answers. What we have found is that people are now ringing the Workplace Infoline and they are getting answers to the questions that they are genuinely concerned about. What we have also found out is that, when there is a dropout rate, it tends to be political questions that are being asked rather than factual questions. That would come as no surprise to anyone.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Riverina for her question. Of course, as a great supporter of regional aviation in Australia, and particularly following some of the events in 2001 and beyond, the member for Riverina understands the significant role that regional aviation plays in servicing regional centres across Australia. Access to affordable aviation travel is critical to the strength of the Australian economy, whether it be in regional Australia or in the major metropolitan areas. Businesses in capital cities depend on aviation links. Regional Australians benefit from good aviation services. Where so many Australians suffer from the tyranny of distance, good, affordable aviation services are crucial.Since 2001, Australia's aviation industry has staged a remarkable recovery. Of course, if you go back beyond that, it was put under pressure as part of the Asian economic recession in the late nineties, then we had the impact of SARS, 9/11 and the unfortunate collapse of Ansett. It has really put a lot of pressure on many parts of the aviation sector. But Australian airlines are now carrying more passengers than at any time in our history. Currently the Australian aviation industry is carrying 44 million passengers a year. That is 10 million more Australians flying than in 2000. Regional aviation itself is growing strongly, carrying 5.2 million passengers in 2006. The overall sector currently employs over 52,000 people and is worth about $6 billion to the Australian economy.The member for Riverina asked: are there any threats to the aviation industry? I read about some this week, not directly from the Australian Labor Party but from some like-minded people at the Australia Institute. The Australia Institute have put out a document calling for a new $30-per-person tax for passengers travelling on domestic flights. Think about someone who can now afford to fly from Sydney to Wagga Wagga in the member's electorate; it might be a $120 fare. The Australia Institute think that they should be paying $150. So working families who are able to go on holiday because of downward pressure on aviation costs are going to have that opportunity taken away if the Australia Institute get their way. They said in their release after announcing this tax:... Australians cannot expect to fly more than they currently do today.Because of climate change, they are proposing that this should be a tax directed at greenhouse gas emissions from the aviation sector. Admittedly the aviation sector have a role to play in contributing to reducing greenhouse gas emissions in Australia, and they accept that. The government has already introduced measures to reduce that. They are practical measures that do not apply costs to ordinary Australian consumers and ordinary Australian families. We have introduced new air traffic control measures that improve sequencing of aircraft and the operation of flexitracks of aircraft. Already there are about nine tonnes per day of CO emissions being saved in and around Sydney airport alone without resorting to taxes on consumers.The point I am trying to make is that we have heard the Labor Party say that they want to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 60 per cent by 2050 without doing any substantive economic analysis of the impact of that decision on the everyday lives of Australians. The Australia Institute is a think tank that the Labor Party often relies on for a bit of advice. There is a bit of a connection given that the boss of the ACTU, Sharan Burrows, is actually a director of the Australia Institute and was part of the decision to announce this. We all remember that the Australia Institute said when we introduced the GST that people would die because of it. We all remember when this country was gripped by severe drought last year that the Australia Institute said, 'Those farmers have no right to be on the land. They should get off it. They do not have a right to be farming it.' And today they are saying that we should impose a tax of $30 a ticket on Australian travellers in the aviation industry. So the question should be asked of the Australian Labor Party, and particularly the Leader of the Opposition: are they going to rule out a $30 tax on airline travellers in Australia as part of their party's policy in addressing greenhouse gas emissions? The Labor Party have outsourced their industrial relations policy to the ACTU and their economic policy to the Democrats - although, they have outsourced their land transport policy to the coalition, thanks to the member for Batman. I ask the Leader of the Opposition: is he going to outsource their aviation policy to the Australia Institute and put a $30 ticket tax on the travelling public in Australia?</DOC>

 - I will make a couple of comments. The first is that, as I have said repeatedly, if further finetuning of this legislation is needed it will be undertaken, but I do not envisage that there will be any further major changes. We think the change that will be introduced next Monday is a very good one. The change will guarantee that, if people trade off their penalty rates and overtime loadings, they will get fair compensation in return. I would have thought that was a very fair proposition because it was never intended when we introduced this legislation that it would become the norm for that to occur. Let me make clear the purpose of this fairness test. As I imagine most people know, although maybe not everybody does, if you are an award reliant employee and you do not enter into an AWA where issues like penalty rates are required to be dealt with specifically, you must be paid what is in the award because that is the law. It is the l-a-w, if I could coin a phrase.I will turn to the other part of the honourable member's question. I do not pretend to remember everything that everybody says in this place, but I think you will find that he rather truncated and distorted what the Treasurer said. He is prone to doing that when he quotes people and I think he was being tricky with the truth when he asked that question.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kingston for his question. I can confirm that this government does not just talk about Medicare; we invest the money needed to make a good system even better. As the Treasurer announced on budget night, in the coming year the Howard government will spend $51.8 billion on health and ageing. That is 22 per cent of the federal budget. It is a record and it is up from about 15 per cent back in 1995. - What am I counting? I am counting Health and Ageing portfolio spending. I am counting DVA spending on health and ageing. - I am counting Medicare Australia spending on health and ageing. I am counting the money that this government is legitimately investing in health. We are investing this money in health because we care about people's health, we care about Medicare and we have some policies, unlike the person who is busily interjecting away on the other side of this parliament.Some of the budget highlights include $291 million to give people with a chronic disease access to longer consultations with specialist physicians. Another highlight is $378 million to give people with a chronic disease and poor oral health access to up to $2,000 worth of Medicare funded dental treatment on referral from their GP. I want to make it very clear that this government can only afford to spend this kind of money, the extra $4.6 billion that we have invested in health and ageing in this budget, because of a strong economy. If you wreck the economy, you wreck health spending too. The Leader of the Opposition knows that he is going to have to cut health spending if he ever becomes the Prime Minister of this country. He knows that. He admitted as much in his notorious Jon Faine interview last month when he said:Well, when you look at the amount of money which is wasted in duplication overlap in the health and hospital system ... I believe there is great scope to extract significant savings.This is not just some obscure backbencher. This is not some professor at a university. This is the alternative Prime Minister of this country. This is the person who is arrogant enough to think that he is going to be Prime Minister by Christmas - and he says that there is great scope to extract significant savings.Health is very important to the people of this country and the Leader of the Opposition needs to explain himself. In fact, I think he should have a press conference. I think a press conference today would be an excellent idea. Questions on health might not be the first questions he is asked, but they certainly should be some of the questions he is asked. He cannot make these kinds of statements without explaining exactly how much he thinks is going to be saved and exactly where he thinks these savings might be made. If, as I suspect, he just got it completely wrong on John Faine - he was completely flustered - he should have the guts to say that he got it wrong. When the member for Barton got it wrong in the Sunday Age, he had the decency and the honesty to say -  -  - I hear some hyenas in the House. - This Leader of the Opposition needs to explain himself. He cannot make those sorts of statements about something as important as health and think that he can get away with not explaining them. As I said, a good place to start would be a press conference this very afternoon.</DOC>

 - I did not see that detailed report - I am happy to have a look at it - as I was focused on other media reports this morning, but I am familiar with one workplace relations advertising campaign that is under way. It comes from a media release, dated 25 March this year, from the Victorian Minister for Industrial Relations, Mr Hulls. He has said that he has prepared television, radio and press advertisements which will run over the coming months against the federal government's workplace relations laws. I have been waiting since 25 March for the Labor Party to express its outrage about abuse of taxpayers' funds in Victoria, where the Victorian industrial relations minister -  - The Victorian industrial relations minister is so outraged about federal laws - which are based on a power referred from the state government of Victoria to the federal government - that he has used Victorian taxpayers' money to prepare television, radio and press advertisements that are going to be running against federal workplace laws over the coming months. To assist the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, I am happy to table that press release and I would like to hear her response.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Indi for her question. If a worker is covered by an award and employed under a common law contract, they must be paid all the entitlements under that award. If hours are worked which would have entitled the worker to penalty rates under that award, the worker must be paid those penalty rates. This has been the case in Australia for more than 90 years.The Office of Workplace Services can and does investigate these matters and take action on behalf of workers to recover any underpayment. In some cases the Office of Workplace Services may take the employer to court to recover underpayments and the employer may be ordered by that court to pay fines. The entitlements of workers have strong protections under the workplace relations laws. I urge any member of this House or of the general public who is aware of any underpayment of entitlements to contact the Workplace Infoline on 1300 363264.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question and the opportunity to clear up a misconception on her part. The government is not proposing to build a dam on the Tweed or the Clarence. The National Water Commission, at my request, commissioned SMEC, the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation, to do a desktop study -  -  - on a range of options for water storages on northern New South Wales rivers, as has been discussed for decades, going right back to Dr Bradfield and before. They have narrowed it down to half a dozen more promising options, which are set out in the report with the hydrological data so that they can be the basis of further discussion. I have not received an invitation to visit the charming town that the honourable member referred me to but I have had a discussion very recently with the chief executive of Tweed Shire and we have discussed an appropriate time when I can get together with him and the other shires and councils in northern New South Wales.The water security of northern New South Wales and south-east Queensland is in crisis at the moment. And you only have to look at what Peter Beattie is doing to see what a crisis it is in. We have to start thinking about water like Australians. We have to recognise that water does not recognise lines on a map. We have to think about our water security as Australians, and we have to have every option on the table. If what the honourable member for Richmond is saying is that not a drop of water should ever pass the border -  - then she perfectly personifies the antiquated, selfish attitudes to water that have delivered our water management into the state it is today. -  - That is why the National Plan for Water Security is so vital to the water future of Australia, and that is why all Australians, and in particular the Premier of Victoria, need to commit to the National Plan for Water Security - because it does what Australians have known we need to do for more than a century: treat our interstate waters as Australian waters managed by the Australian government in the national interest.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Macquarie for his question. He is a man who is totally committed to families and family values and has been for over 11 years in this place. The budget delivered a real bonanza for Australian families in the form of the childcare tax rebate being brought forward; the childcare benefit being increased; and tax cuts for every Australian, as real money in people's pockets. It is a real bonanza for Australian families. We will be able to say, as a result of this budget, that the family tax benefit, which was standing at $14 billion in 1996-97 when the Howard-Costello government was elected, is today $28 billion of direct assistance to Australian families. That actually equates to $8,300 for the average family. Then on top of that the average family gets another $2,000 in assistance with the childcare benefit. That is about $10,000 of direct assistance to help the families of Macquarie and the families in all of the electorates around this great country.The only threat to these great circumstances that Australian families now find themselves in - of having their childcare fees going down, their tax going down and jobs going up - is the election of a Labor government. I say that because there is only one tax policy of the Labor Party currently available, and that is the one they took to the last election - the one for which the member for Lilley was the architect. His name is there on the bottom, as shown by the Treasurer. The man who would be the Treasurer of this country had a policy, which is still existing Labor policy because there is nothing to replace it, that had families in Australia on $10,000, $20,000, $25,000, $30,000, $35,000, $75,000, $80,000, $85,000, $90,000 and $100,000 - on each of those tax scales - worse off under a Labor tax policy. That was when the Australian government was in surplus. This was not back when a Labor government was in and they were trying to find the pennies; this was when a coalition had delivered surplus after surplus. A Labor opposition was going to the Australian public with a policy whose architect is the want-to-be Treasurer, the member for Lilley, who wanted to make all of those families in those tax scales worse off. There has never been a greater threat to the prosperity of Australian families than the election of a Labor government.That is also backed up by the member for Melbourne who, since 1994, has told this place that he takes no pride whatsoever in this country having one of the lowest tax rates in the OECD. He actually wants to see a death duty brought back. That is what he has said in this place. He said that when he was on the government benches. God help us all if he gets the chance to be the architect of another tax policy along with the member for Lilley! That is the real threat that Australian families face - not just to their jobs but to the real income that helps them to provide the future their children deserve.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Tangney for his question. In Tangney, as a result of the Howard government's budget this year, 5,121 people will receive up to $3,000 in co-contribution payments, paid directly into their superannuation accounts. That is a return of up to $3,000 because of the good economic times that we are in at the moment which have been brought about by tough decisions by this government. We are contributing up to $3,000 for their $1,000 contribution. That is a great outcome, particularly for low-income Australians. In the honourable member's electorate, just over 5,000 people will see $3,000 go into their super account to compound and, by the time they get to retirement, it will make a big difference to them in retirement. The co-contribution scheme introduced by this government, opposed by Labor at the time of its introduction, is a great way of helping middle- and low-income Australians put more money into their superannuation funds.There is a lot of press around at this point in time about the returns from superannuation funds, with returns of up to 17 per cent on people's investments in their superannuation funds. Do you know why that is? It is because the economy is in good shape. When people look at their superannuation statements - and they will be getting them between now and 30 June - they will see their balances rising because companies are earning profits, employing people and making good returns on their investments. That will make a big difference to people in retirement.But there is a great threat to people's retirement savings in this country. There is a great threat to the people who, when they look at their balances at the moment, see their balances going up. They know, as we do, that that threat is the Australian Labor Party. The Australian Labor Party are the greatest threat to the Australian economy and Australian business, and, if they are elected at the next election, that will be a bad outcome for people who are looking at accumulating wealth into retirement. It will be a bad outcome for young families who want more money in their pocket each fortnight, which is what this government has been able to provide. This government, through managing the Australian economy well, will help people save for their retirements and enjoy a much better lifestyle than Labor could ever promise.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Cowper for his question. There is a procedure that should be followed, and that procedure is that, before conclusions are reached and serious allegations made, concerns about alleged mistreatment of workers by businesses should be referred to the Office of Workplace Services - soon to be known as the Workplace Ombudsman - so that those allegations can be investigated. I can certainly confirm that this procedure has been followed in relation to a company called WorkDirections and, hopefully, the investigation by the office will determine whether any mistakes of a dishonest or honest kind have been made. I notice that, in relation to that company, the Leader of the Opposition last Thursday sought to provide an explanation, although that explanation has in recent days been significantly disputed by the previous owner of one of the businesses taken over. These matters will be dealt with in the course of the investigation. Although any conflict between what the Leader of the Opposition said last Thursday and the reality is a matter he has to deal with, I do not seek to add anything other than to make the observation that this issue should be dealt with by the Office of Workplace Services.Can I say that the treatment of this case is in very stark contrast to the treatment of other allegations that have arisen over recent months. I think the most notorious example of a different treatment occurred last week in relation to the Lilac City Motor Inn, owned by two struggling and courageous people, a small business man and woman, Mr and Mrs Doolan. In that case a newspaper reported a story making allegations about the AWA at the Lilac City Motor Inn in Goulburn. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition conducted a doorstop interview and then rang into the John Laws program and said, 'John, I was ringing about this situation with the Lilac City Motor Inn and the Australian workplace agreement.' Then, over the weekend, we were treated to a denial of the undeniable, with the claim being made by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that she never attacked the Lilac City Motor Inn. The truth is that she did. The Leader of the Opposition does not escape censure on this matter. The Leader of the Opposition also conducted a doorstop, and he said:I read the report in the Telegraph about the AWA which is being introduced by the HMAA and I think that example, in itself, points to the continuing problems of Mr Howard's unfair industrial relations laws.Through you, Mr Speaker, I make the observation to the Leader of the Opposition that there was no allowance made here for an honest mistake. There was no allowance made here for the fact that there might be a decent explanation for this. We can get an idea of the reaction of the owners of the motel. Bear  in mind that this is a couple who started the business only a couple of years ago. They started a small business in a drought affected city and, as a result of the publicity given, fanned and exaggerated by both the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, they have received emails from as far away as Norway. One of the owners of the motel, Don Doolan, said on the Friday night Channel 9 news when he was confronted with the claim by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that she was not personally attacking him:By her - meaning the Deputy Leader of the Opposition - saying she wasn't personally attacking me, well, what was she doing? She's using my motel as an example to get political leverage.Given those words, I say to both the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that there has been a lot of anguish around the kitchen table in the Doolan household over the last few days. This is a couple who started with nothing, who have toiled to build up a small business. They have won the esteem and the affection of their employees and they should not be subject to disgraceful attacks by the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. We have heard a lot over the past few days about a lot of things, but this issue has nothing to do with modern marriages and it has nothing whatever to do with conflict of interest; it has everything to do with the hypocrisy and the double standards of the Australian Labor Party.</DOC>

 - I say in reply to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that I have grown accustomed to checking the facts of anything put to me by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, and in this case I will do the same thing. I would invite the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to extend her concern about those mothers to the mothers who are involved in running small businesses like motels. The opposition might also extend it to any mothers who might have been caught up in the attack that was made on 9 October last year on Martin Donnelly Electrical Services, a local small business electrical outfit in Queanbeyan, when the Leader of the Opposition and her predecessor as spokesman on industrial relations matters conducted a press conference at the site of the new Prime Minister and Cabinet office building, at which they alleged that the workers were being forced onto AWAs which slashed wages. They did not ask any questions. They did not go to the Office of Workplace Services. They did not allow for some kind of honest mistake. The then Leader of the Opposition and the member for Perth asked questions on this matter in question time. In particular, the member for Perth alleged that the AWAs removed a range of allowances for overtime and bonuses and all sorts of other things. On that occasion I said I would examine the matter and on the following day I was able to report to the House that every single allegation made by the member for Perth was completely false - every single allegation, not even an honest mistake. Every single allegation was completely false. I borrow a phrase used by the Treasurer on many occasions. On this issue I say to the Australian Labor Party: thy name is hypocrisy.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Moncrieff for his question. Again, I pay tribute to the work that he does on the coalition finance and treasury committee. He would be aware that the OECD has released its Economic Outlook, providing an assessment of all its member countries, including Australia, over the weekend. The OECD forecasts that growth will pick up in Australia, particularly as climatic conditions emerge from the drought - we hope - and we see the agricultural sector, which has been detracting so much from growth in Australia recently, come back to production again. In addition, the OECD noted that the recent budget included personal income tax cuts, substantial investment in education and increases in childcare subsidies, which the OECD said will enhance the economy's supply potential in the longer term.Certainly, the budget was directed towards improving the supply capacity of the Australian economy in the longer term. One of the things we are finding now, with unemployment at lows which we have not seen for 32 years, is that, rather than having a shortage of jobs for workers, we now have a shortage of workers for jobs. As far as problems go, that is a good problem, but in order to do something about it, we have to increase supply measures.Our most recent tax cuts have dramatically cut tax for people in the range of middle incomes. For example, three years ago if you were on an income of $30,000 you paid tax of $5,172. On 1 July you will pay tax of $2,850 - a cut in tax of 45 per cent on that same wage over a period of three years. Who will that attract back into the workforce? It will be people who are earning in the range of $30,000 - a lot of part-time workers. They might be married women who have a couple of children at home and want to do a day, two days or three days a week. They are typically the people who are earning around $30,000 and the tax on an income of $30,000 over the last three budgets will have been reduced by 45 per cent. That is what good tax policy does. We will be very interested to see if the Labor Party has a tax policy at the next election because there seems to be a marked reticence from the Labor Party these days on tax matters.Tax is just one of the areas where this government has improved work incentives. It has been a coordinated, concerted effort of balancing the budget, repaying debt, having an independent monetary policy, introducing the GST, cutting company tax, cutting capital gains tax, reforming the waterfront and improving industrial relations. All of those measures have put more people in work than ever before in Australia. It has been a good period also to be in the job recruitment business, under all of these reforms. It has been a very good period to be in the job recruitment business. We wish well to those companies that have prospered under coalition economic management. In fact, if it were not for this government, there would not even be a Job Network. It was this government which introduced the Job Network. If it had been for the Labor Party, there would be no Job Network; it would all still be run by the CES. The Labor Party opposed that reform. The Labor Party have opposed all of the substantive reforms, including the establishment of the Job Network, including - </DOC>

 - I do agree with the Audit Office's conclusions because it found that ministers accepted 99 per cent of departmental recommendations and varied the decision in only one per cent of cases - in other words, the minister changed 120 out of 6,818 recommendations. - The ANAO found that overall for these programs the political party holding an electorate did not have a statistically significant independent impact on either average grant size or the success rate of applications in electorates. Indeed, the Local Answers program funding actually favoured ALP electorates. - So I am very happy to accept the conclusions of the report and I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hasluck, a Western Australian member who knows the importance of peace on the building sites of Perth, as other members know the importance of peace on the building sites of other major capitals. I can tell the House that there has been a dramatic reduction in industrial disputes in building and construction. The September quarter of 2006 showed that 1.6 working days were lost per 1,000 employees, compared to the June quarter of 1996 where a staggering 534 working days were lost per 1,000 employees. This change is a direct result of two things: the general industrial relations law changes the government has made and the specific changes which led to the introduction of the Australian Building and Construction Commission, which flowed from the first royal commission conducted by the Hon. Terry Cole QC.On Tuesday, 15 May, the Master Builders Association suggested that the removal of the building commission - bear in mind, the dismantling of this commission is declared ALP policy and if the Labor Party is elected it will take away this watchdog, which has brought peace, prosperity, hope and optimism to the building and construction industry all around Australia - if those laws were repealed, would potentially result in higher building costs all around Australia. Today the Financial Review reports:Australia's biggest builder, led by Leighton Holdings chief executive Wal King, have warned Labor leader Kevin Rudd that the ALP's industrial relations policies would be 'very risky and damaging' to the $50 billion construction industry.To get an idea of who is licking their lips at the prospect of a Labor victory, I need go no further than my copy of the Weekend Australian where you see a photograph of Kevin Reynolds on a sparkling Perth morning having his breakfast reading his Australian - I think the West Australian is banned by the Labor Party over there, given current disputes between the state government and the editor of that newspaper - as he looks over all that he hopes one day in future to survey. As the paper says:He can look across the Swan River to the cranes that pepper Perth's exploding CBD, knowing that should Labor win the next federal electorate, his nemesis - the only authority in 20 years to rein in his hardline and volatile union - will be destroyed.In other words, Kevin Reynolds is counting the days to the arrival of that great moment when, according to Greg Combet, the unions will run Australia all over again. Greg Combet gave us a glimpse - perhaps an understated glimpse but a glimpse nonetheless - of the world that would be inherited by people like Kevin Reynolds. - Let us understand that the princes who would hold the power if Labor were to win at the end of the year would not be people like Mr and Mrs Doolan of the Lilac City Motor Inn in drought ravaged Goulburn, two struggling small business operators; it would be the likes of Kevin Reynolds. Kevin Reynolds does not muck about. He is very blunt, he is very open, he is very transparent and he cannot wait until Rudd gets there. He is desperate for a change of government and on Saturday he had this to say: 'I live for the day when (the ABCC staff) are all working at Hungry Jack's or Fast Eddy's or Kentucky Fried Chicken.' McDonald told The Australian recently.That is Reynolds's mate. He continued:'That is what's waiting for them. They're all ex-policemen and they can go and do whatever ex-coppers do. I'd suggest that John Lloyd and his mates - and Lloyd runs the ABCC - will be unemployed before I will be'.That is the mentality - the payback mentality; the mentality that says when Labor wins, the union bosses run the country again. Greg Combet gave us a glimpse, and people like Kevin Reynolds are starting to fill in the blank spaces. What Kevin Reynolds was saying to the construction industry on Saturday, as he looked at the vista from his luxury apartment overlooking the Swan River in Perth, as he took in the vista of all that once more he will survey, in plain language, was: 'I can't wait for Labor to be in power again, and once again the unions will be running Australia.'</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Wakefield for his question. I can tell him that not only has the government reduced tax - and I gave an example a moment ago to the House of somebody on $30,000 who, over three years, has had a reduction in their tax bill of 45 per cent - but the government, in addition to that, has introduced family tax benefits. So if you happen to be a family with children, you have not only got the benefit of tax cuts but you have got the benefit of family tax payments as well.Let me give the House another example. A family on average weekly ordinary-time earnings, with the second partner working part time for one-third of that amount, in 1996-97 would have had a disposable income of $52,052, in today's dollars. As a result of both tax cuts and family tax benefits, that family will have a real disposable income of $67,151, an increase of 29 per cent in real disposable income. That is your classic family in Australia: one partner, usually the father, is on average weekly ordinary-time earnings; mum has gone back into the workforce for a couple of days a week and is on one-third of average weekly ordinary-time earnings; they have two children, because they have not yet taken up the invitation to have one for the country; and their real disposable income in 2007-08 dollars has increased from $52,052 to $67,151 - a 29 per cent increase in real disposable income.As we all know, on 30 June this year, we will be celebrating 'fundamental injustice day' - the day which the Leader of the Opposition proclaimed as the day which will be written as the fundamental day of injustice of the 20th century, when this government reformed the tax system. As we move down - and I am going to move down to 'fundamental injustice day' over the next 33 days - we are going to look at how 'fundamental injustice day' has affected Australian families. Well, there is a classic Australian family that, in 2007-08 dollars, will have had an increase in their real disposable income of 29 per cent.I am asked: are there any other policies? It seems to be an open question as to whether the Labor Party can find anything wrong with the tax system, because if they can, they are not saying it, and they are certainly not putting forward a policy for the next election to address it. If Labor will not put their policy out before the election, we are entitled to conclude that it is no vote winner. In fact, if they will not put their policy out before the election, we are entitled to conclude that it can only be moving one way - and that is to the detriment of Australian families.We have evidence of this, because the Labor Party has form. The last tax policy that it put out, for the last election, was going to make families worse off. It was going to make them worse off by taking away the $600 per annum per child family payment.I have previously read to the House one of Australia's great literary works on this subject, The Latham Diaries, which explains who the author was of taking away the $600 payment and what the rationale was. I was a little surprised to read in the Australian on Saturday that The Latham Diaries are contested on this point. I was a little surprised to read the member for Lilley saying of the tax policy in the 2004 election:We did a fantastic job ... The problem was the design flaw that was inserted at the insistence of our previous leader.It did not have anything to do with the member for Lilley! Here he is, dumping on one of Australia's stay-at-home fathers, suggesting that it was all the work of Mark Latham and it had nothing to do with him. He even got up in parliament last Thursday after I raised this in the House - and, by the way, I again tender the names on the front of the tax and better family payment plan: Latham, Crean and Swan - and claimed that he had never said that this was not a real payment.So I went back through my file of cuttings and I found in the Australian on 9 September 2004 a clipping titled '$600 will disappear, ALP insists'. It states:... Mr Swan said the $600-a-child payment was a 'fool's gold'.It's not real - it disappears.Oh really? He never claimed it was not real! This is a quote in the Australian on 9 September 2004. - Not only did he try and mislead all Australians by taking away a payment and then saying it was not real, now he tries to mislead this House -  - by saying that he never said it. There it is in the Australian of 9 September 2004; it is in black and white:It's not real - it disappears.You will not get away, the member for Swan, by trying to blame Mark Latham. The member for Lilley then left the chamber. 
 -  - No, that was real, that little incident there. He was the author of that policy. He is now trying to deny it. He tried to mislead the Australian public. He tried to mislead this House. He cannot blame Mr Latham. It was all his own work. It was a bad decision. It was a decision that would have made Australian families worse off. It is no surprise that he is walking away from that tax policy because the people of Australia know that Labor's last tax policy would have left them worse off when it is the coalition that is looking after the families of Australia.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hume for his question and recognise his very strong representation not just of those struggling farming families in his electorate of Hume who have sought assistance from the government during this severe drought but all farming families across Australia. It is timely that we remember that the drought still exists and there are still many people, both from farming families on the land and working families in our regional communities, who are suffering from the worst drought that this country has ever seen.Since 2002-03, we have been very open-handed with our assistance on behalf of the taxpayers of Australia. With the prosperity that this country is enjoying we have been able to ensure that we have given rural communities across Australia the sort of assistance they have needed during the severity of this drought. There has been about $1.6 billion worth of assistance since 2002-03. Despite some recent welcome rains in some parts of Australia, which certainly lifted spirits and lifted opportunities, we need to recognise that this drought still exists and is still having a profound impact on communities across many parts of regional Australia.We should recognise that as a government we have helped not only the farming families and operations in those rural areas but also the businesses that operate in those rural communities. We took a decision in November of last year to extend support to small businesses which could demonstrate that they depend on the farm sector for their existence. We saw it as being a very important measure to assist those businesses that were almost entirely reliant on the farm sector for their business.We should also remember other businesses in regional communities that rely very heavily on the economic strength of their local communities in terms of their viability and their ability to ensure the sustainability of the jobs that they provide in their community. It is very important that politicians, as part of their leadership positions, understand just how hard some of these people in small businesses across regional Australia are battling in drought affected local economies to continue to provide those jobs. The member for Hume, who represents the regional centre of Goulburn, would well recognise how hard those businesses are battling away in the face of a very severe drought and the circumstances of a lack of water in the city of Goulburn, and how hard that plays on the minds of those people in that community.When thinking about businesses battling in communities suffering from drought, I was drawn to an article in the Australian newspaper last week. It was headed 'Hotelier's hell after Gillard's attack' and, of course, it is about the Doolans, who run a motel in Goulburn and are trying to sustain jobs in that small business in the community. They were very unfairly attacked by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and have been severely vilified in trying to manage their business and trying to grow the level of employment in their small business in a community that is severely affected by drought. That was very evident from the comments in that article from Nerida Corby, who works for the Doolans. She said:'I am happy to be working here, they are great, they are very nice people. They are just a young family trying to run a business.'They are just a young family trying to run a business and employ people and maintain job opportunities for young people in that community. Ms Corby also said - and this is her most important comment:'If they don't get the business we don't get the jobs.'And they need those jobs, because jobs are scarce in regional communities that are suffering from drought. Whilst the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and the Labor Party are in the mood to forgive and forget, first off they should apologise to the small businesses they have unfairly vilified in this debate, who are just trying to generate and provide jobs for young people in those regional communities that are suffering from drought.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Ryan for the question, and I note that the unemployment rate in the Ryan electorate is 1.8 per cent. The Australian government will today introduce reforms to the Workplace Relations Act that will provide a stronger safety net for over 7½ million Australian workers on collective agreements and Australian workplace agreements. The new fairness test will be applied to workers with a base salary of less than $75,000, and therefore it is going to cover more than 90 per cent of workers. The fairness test will ensure that workers who trade off benefits like penalty rates, allowances and loadings will receive fair compensation. The starting point for fair compensation is more money. If non-monetary compensation is agreed between the employer and the employees, it must be of equivalent monetary value or of significant value to the employee. So it is a high hurdle.The fairness test is very similar to the old no disadvantage test. However, it is technically different in one significant way: under our laws, annual leave and sick leave are not tradable, as they were under the old laws. This fairness test put in place a higher level of protection for workers than the common law agreements which the Labor Party believe are the cornerstone of their industrial relations policy. Under the fairness test, Australian workplace agreements will be individually and independently assessed for fairness to ensure that people are properly compensated for losing penalty rates, leave loadings and so on. Under the Labor Party's common law contracts, it is left to the employers to undertake the test. When employers undertake such tests, such benchmarks, of course they make mistakes. It is far less likely that you are going to have those sorts of mistakes under an Australian workplace agreement, because we have put in place the mechanism that ensures that the Workplace Authority will test every agreement.We do not know how the Labor Party are going to vote on this bill. The Labor Party are awaiting the instructions of the trade union bosses. On 2 May this year, on The 7.30 Report, Greg Combet said:That is within John Howard's power now. If he is concerned about people losing take-home pay and their penalty rates and their public holiday pay and the like, he controls both houses of Parliament. He could fix that now.So Greg Combet, who has been notably absent in the last few days, has already instructed the Labor Party to support the fairness test. This fairness test increases and improves the safety net for Australian workers. I would expect that the Labor Party would support that. But, given their history on this, they are hypocrites. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition pretends she did not criticise the Lilac City Motor Inn when she was on the John Laws program. In fact, she rang John Laws to expressly criticise that hardworking family business. The Labor Party are hypocrites when it comes to industrial relations, because all of their policy, all of their work and all of their deeds are written by the trade union bosses.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Fisher for his question. I can report to him that, with a national unemployment rate of 4.4 per cent, there have been resultant shortages, particularly of temporary skilled workers, in some industries. That is why the 457 temporary skilled visa program is important. This program provides for skills assessment requirements. It also provides for a minimum salary requirement of $41,850, or the relevant industrial standard, whichever is the higher. In today's Australian I read that there was support by one of the leading Job Network providers in Australia for this program. This leading Job Network provider was quoted in today's Australian as saying:What Australian employers are telling us, particularly out of the coal industry, is they are screaming for skilled people - highly skilled people - and the coal industry in Germany is winding down.So there are many people in Germany who are very skilled, who use the same kind of equipment that the Australian coal industry uses, who are out of work or about to be out of work and 'there is demand here that cannot be met, despite repeated advertising.' This leading Job Network provider went on to say:So we're trying to meet a need and our conditions are that people are paid well.She is right. People on 457 visas are paid well. Indeed, the average annual salary paid to 457 visa holders last year was $70,000. In the mining sector - and reference was made to the coal industry - the average salary last year was $87,000. I ask: who are some of the biggest users of 457 visa programs in Australia? Indeed, the state Labor governments in Queensland and Western Australia have recently entered into 457 labour agreements to sponsor workers in industry sectors which are experiencing workforce shortages. But the greatest user of 457 visas in Australia is none other than the state Department of Health in the Labor state of New South Wales. This is an important visa program for Australia. The government has committed an additional $85.3 million over the next four years to maintain the integrity of this temporary skilled migration program. Employer compliance will be targeted under this program to ensure that if any employers misuse the program then they will be investigated and indeed will face significant additional new penalties.We in government are committed to maintaining a migration program that meets the needs and the interests of the Australian economy. That is, in effect, what the director of this Job Network agency was saying. This is someone, who is very close to the Leader of the Opposition, saying that 457 visas are very important for the future of the Australian economy and, as a consequence of that, also to the jobs of many Australians. It is a great pity that, hypocritically, we have the Australian Labor Party running around seeking to undermine this program.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dobell for his question. Isn't it interesting that the Labor Party never mention bulk-billing anymore. They never mention it anymore because overall bulk-billing figures are at all-time record highs. I know that the member for Dobell will be pleased to know that the GP bulk-billing rate in his electorate has gone up by 19 percentage points since 2003, in part, because there are now 10 more doctors on a full-time equivalent basis than there were in 1996. When bulk-billing figures come out these days, Labor ignore them and instead talk about gap payments. I suppose that is fair enough, because no-one likes high out-of-pocket medical expenses. It is just that this government has a policy to deal with them. It is called the extended Medicare safety net, which Labor want to abolish. We have more hypocrisy, more double standards from the Labor Party. They complain about something and want to abolish the very program that is designed to do something about it. Last year the extended Medicare safety net stood to benefit about 1½ million Australians. Last year Medicare spent $258 million on higher rebates to people who had high health costs. In Dobell, for instance, almost 11,000 people were eligible for higher Medicare payments, thanks to the safety net.In Gellibrand, the seat of the shadow health minister, almost 8,000 people qualified last year for higher medical benefits, thanks to the safety net. In Griffith, the seat of the Leader of the Opposition, more than 15,000 people qualified for higher medical benefits under the safety net. All of those people will have higher Medicare benefits ripped off them if Labor ever gets into government. I want to know why the member for Gellibrand thinks that people in her electorate should lose nearly $2 million in higher Medicare benefits. I want to know why the Leader of the Opposition thinks that people in his electorate should lose nearly $3 million in higher Medicare benefits. I think at least in his case there is an explanation - it is because the Leader of the Opposition is probably one of the few people in this House, certainly there is no-one on this side, who thinks that Medicare spending should be cut. He thinks that Medicare spending should be cut, as he has said before. He will be reminded of this quote day in, day out until he explains himself. He told Jon Faine: ... Well when you look at the amount of money which is wasted in duplication overlap in the health and hospital system ... I believe there is great scope to extract significant savings.He needs to explain himself. When I asked him to explain himself last Thursday, he had a press conference. Good on him for having a press conference. I think he should have another press conference this afternoon. I suspect that questions on health this afternoon would be a welcome distraction from some of the other things he has on his mind.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. Since this government came to power we have focused very much on families and older Australians, who have contributed to the wellbeing and the financial strength of this country. Even though many are now in their retirement years, they still deserve to share in the wealth and the bounty that this country continues to enjoy under a Howard-Costello government. It was one of the earliest commitments that the Treasurer made, back in 1996 I think it was, when he linked the pension to 25 per cent of MATWE, male average total weekly earnings. In practical terms what that now means is that, as a result of that decision, a single aged pensioner today has $66.20 per fortnight more in their pension pay packet than they would have had otherwise had the Labor Party policy continued. For a pensioner couple it is $111.40. That is a tremendous bonus for those families and those couples in their older years. From 20 September this year they can expect a further down payment on what the Commonwealth government has been able to achieve through good economic management. As a result of the halving of the pension taper rates, from 20 September this year a single retiree homeowner could have an additional $177,000 of assets before losing the age pension. - A very good reform, as the Treasurer points out. A couple could have $294,000 of additional assets. These are very practical measures which help our older Australians. Let us just have a look at how much they could earn today before they pay tax. As a result of the senior Australians tax offset these Australians pay no tax up to an annual income for a single person of $25,867 and $43,360 for a pensioner couple. That is as a result of the initiatives of the Howard government and good economic management. That is not unlike the average Australian family. The average Australian family with two children pays no net tax today before $50,800 of income. That is an unbelievable achievement when you consider that, just a short 11 years ago, for every dollar earned over $50,000 they were paying 48½c in the dollar.I am asked if there are any risks to this and if this is under threat. The reality is that you cannot provide the bounty of this nation to our older Australians if you run deficits. The opposition ran deficits on nine out of the 13 occasions they had the opportunity to sit here on the Treasury benches. They continued to run up debt. They did not reward older Australians in this country for the contribution they had made in tougher times to this nation's wellbeing.I guess you do not think too much about older Australians on those incomes if you really genuinely believe that someone on over $200,000 is a struggler, as the Courier Mail reported on 30 April. The article says:Households earning more than $200,000 a year have been identified as Kevin Rudd's 'strugglers' and will carry him to electoral victory.I say to the Leader of the Opposition: what about the pensioners? What about the self-funded retirees? What about the bonus the Howard government has just been able to deliver them so they can also benefit from these measures? I remind the member for Melbourne and all of our senior Australians, as we have not had a clarification at this point, of what he said in this place when last in government:We should have an inheritance tax or some tax of that nature. - Yes, he was big on that. He continued:We are one of the few major countries that does not have some form of taxation for these circumstances - get this - where tax is the most equitable, the most efficient to collect and the least painful for individual taxpayer.That is what you are going to get from a finance minister in a Labor Rudd government. Those are the sorts of beliefs that they hold dearly, not the struggling pensioners who are being rewarded by the good economic management of the Howard-Costello government.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for asking me a question about climate change. I think that it is rather good that he should ask a question about climate change this week, because I can inform the Leader of the Opposition that I expect to receive this week a report of the taskforce -  - He has been engaging in chatting across the table. Heads come up. No longer are we furiously scribbling notes!Brendan O'Connor interjecting -  - He will do anything to keep the deputy leader under wraps today, anything to keep the deputy leader out of the firing line. He has turned his back now.  We will receive the report on climate change this week. Unlike the Labor Party the government does not intend to set targets when we do not know the implications. - Unlike the Labor Party - those who sit opposite - we have no intention of embracing a target when we do not know the economic consequences of it. We have no intention of embracing a target that is going to do damage to the business community. We have no intention of embracing a target that is going to do damage to the great coal industry of Australia. I can imagine the impact that the devastation of the coal industry would have on hundreds of thousands of small businesses, including many thousands of motels dotted around the country, that would be adversely affected. I can assure the Leader of the Opposition that when we receive this report it will be made available to the Australian public and it will represent this government approaching the issue of climate change in a methodical and systematic fashion. - I think what will become apparent when this report comes out is that the decisions that will need to be taken on climate change will represent the most significant and difficult economic decisions that this country will take in 10 or 20 years, because although climate change is seen generally as an environmental issue, its true character is economic. - Oh, we have now got the professor! - The whole basis was our commitment to climate change. I simply say again that this report will make it very clear that decisions to be taken on climate change issues will represent the most significant economic decisions this country will take in a decade. It follows from that that it will be -  - It will be very clear when this report comes out that these decisions will be amongst the most significant that will need to be taken by this country economically over the next decade. Although climate change is seen generally as an environmental issue, the character of those decisions will be overwhelmingly economic. It is therefore essential that those decisions be taken by people who have a long-term commitment to the continuing strength and competitiveness of the Australian economy, by a group of people who have a long-term commitment to a flexible industrial relations system, by people who have a long-term commitment to the important role of small business in the Australia community, by a group of people who believe that one of the best things you can do in life is to -  - I conclude my answer by saying that, if the economic decisions on climate change are not right - </DOC>

 - The facts are that the ACCC does very closely monitor petrol prices; it monitors about 55 per cent of sites, which number some thousands. The view of Mr Harris, who is the federal president of the automotive chambers - that is, the combination of the RACV, the RACQ, the NRMA and the like - is that the price being charged at the bowser in Australia accurately reflects the Singapore price. There has been an increase in the Singapore price for a variety of reasons, including some breakdown in refining capacity. It is not possible to divorce the price of petrol in Australia either from the price of crude oil or from the Singapore price. If the views of the chief of the motorist organisations is to be believed, the price at the bowser painfully reflects the very high world price of refined petroleum - and, in those circumstances, the Leader of the Opposition should understand the reality. I know why he asked the question like this but it does not absolve him from a responsibility to pay some regard to the facts of the situation.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hasluck for his question. In answering it I note that, in March 1996, unemployment in the federal division of Hasluck was 7.4 per cent; it is now 3.5 per cent. That is a product of the job-creating policies of the government over the last 11 years. I have some very good news for the member for Hasluck and for people who are interested in skills generation in this country. Last October the government announced the Skills for the Future policy package, which included, amongst other things, a new work skills voucher for unskilled Australians. These vouchers are for up to $3,000 worth of training for an individual. This is, crucially, for more mature-age people who have not completed year 12 or the equivalent qualification or certificate II or higher level qualifications. The original decision was to allocate 10,000 vouchers to cover the period from 1 January 2007 to 30 June 2007. We thought at the time that the allocation of 10,000 vouchers for the first six months would be adequate. But such has been the popularity of this proposal, such has been the popularity of the scheme, that, to date, in less than six months - indeed, in just under five months - a total of 14,216 vouchers have been issued. That indicates that this program has been an outstanding success. As a result of the success of this program, the government has decided to uncap the number of vouchers for the remainder of this year.Importantly, of the 14,216 vouchers issued to date, more than 6,000 have gone to unemployed Australians. This helps to strengthen their capacity to get work. When you bear in mind that the level of unemployment in Australia is at a 32-year low and that long-term unemployment - that is, people who have been out of work for more than a year - is at its lowest level since that series began to be compiled, and has fallen by 22½ per cent in the last 12 months, these vouchers represent a very practical contribution towards helping those in the workforce and those wanting to get into the workforce to improve their skills so that they can either get a better job or increase their chances of obtaining a job. This is the kind of practical measure that the nation needs in order to upgrade its skills. It is a recognition that there are still far too many people, particularly middle-aged men, in the workforce who lack skills but who do not lack the motivation to improve themselves. The popularity of these vouchers indicates a sense of hope and optimism amongst those in the workforce and also a sense of hope and optimism amongst that dwindling number of Australians who remain unemployed.</DOC>

 - I refer, in answer to that question, with even more specificity to a statement made by the chief executive of the Australian Automobile Association, Mr Harris. He was interviewed on ABC radio on Thursday 24 May, 2007. He was asked about the powers of the ACCC. In answer to a question from Ross Solly about the powers being used by the ACCC:Are they using them enough?he said, amongst other things:... more so than they used to.He went on to say:Graeme Samuel - that is, the chairman of the ACCC:... has made a few public statements in recent times that have had the desired effect. I would have to say, though, that our monitoring of fuel prices at the present time has seen nothing that is out of the ordinary as far as the cycles are concerned. That is not to say that petrol is not expensive. It is expensive. I am not saying it is cheap. The cycles that are going on at the moment are reflective of Singapore prices, they are reflective of the exchange rate prices, and we are not seeing expansion of margins that would suggest that there is any gouging going on.This is the spokesman for Australian motorists. Normally, these spokesmen tend to give you the worst possible side of the argument. They tend to exaggerate claims. They tend not to understate the concerns of motorists, because it is their job to speak for Australian motorists. I have noted what the Leader of the Opposition has said, and I would say to him that that is not the view of Mr Harris. He is about as credible a representative of the Australian motorist as we could find. Nobody likes high prices - in Queensland or in New South Wales or Victoria or in Western Australia. I have not heard any policy from the opposition that would make petrol prices cheaper. All I have heard is some cheap populism on the subject.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Bass for his question. I think it is well known in Australia today that the government's tax reforms have been of particular benefit to middle-income earners. When the government was elected, about 30 per cent of Australians had a marginal tax rate of 30c or less. Today, about 80 per cent of Australians have a marginal tax rate of 30c or less. Perhaps what is not so well known is that the government's tax and family payments have also been of particular benefit to low-income earners. Let me give an example. A sole parent family with no additional income, compared to where it was in 1996, has increased its disposable income by 29.8 per cent in 2007-08 dollars. A sole parent family with two kids back in 1996, in constant dollars, would have been taking home a disposable income of $20,518 and today takes home $26,631. That is a sole parent family with two kids, with no additional income and totally reliant, therefore, on the pension and family payments. That has been of enormous benefit for low-income families.I am asked whether there are any other alternatives to this. Labor has now announced that they are not going to have any more tax policies, and it is pretty easy to see why. Labor last had a tax policy in 2004, the 'ease the squeeze' tax policy, signed off by Mark Latham, Simon Crean and Wayne Swan, two of whom are still in this parliament - and two out of three ain't bad when it comes to tax policies. What did Labor propose doing then with a sole parent family with two children and no additional income? As their own annual tables at the end of their tax policy show, Labor's proposal was to make a sole parent family with two children $624 a year worse off. It was Labor policy to make a sole parent family worse off. Why was that? It was because Labor had an obsession with abolishing the family tax payment, the $600 per child per annum. When you took that $600 away, the poorest of families were worse off under Labor tax policy.The member for Lilley does not like to hear it, but the decision to take away the $600 payment per child per family was his and his alone. As the Australian reported on 9 September 2004, Mr Swan said that it was 'fool's gold'. He said:'It's not real - it disappears.'When it disappeared, it made you $600 worse off. That is what happened when it disappeared. When it appeared, it made you considerably better off - in fact, under this government, 29 per cent better off. No wonder the Labor Party does not want to come clean on its tax policy for the next election. Look what it tried to do in the last election campaign: make the poor worse off. The important thing in politics is policy. You can scoot by with your focus groups and your advertising agents for only so long. The people of Australia want to know about policy. They know that the policy of the Labor Party is not to make low-income earners better off but to make them worse off.</DOC>

 - I do not think the exceptional circumstances support, in the eyes of some, could ever be enough. The Leader of the Opposition asks me what can be done to make it more generous. You could increase the amount of income support, you could increase the generosity of the circumstances in which interest rate subsidies are made available and you could expand the range of businesses that receive support. Of course there are ways in which it could be made more generous. The question you have to ask yourself is whether, in current circumstances, there is a case for a further liberalisation.There was a very significant liberalisation undertaken by the government, I think earlier this year, following a liberalisation that took place last year. We extended the assistance to small businesses in affected areas. We had significantly liberalised the non-farm income and assets tests. One of my colleagues reminds me that the total amount under exceptional circumstances has now gone well over $1 billion - it is almost $2 billion - so it is very generous. I would be the last person to pretend that you cannot make it even more generous. It is a question of what is fair and balanced in current circumstances.I might also remind the Leader of the Opposition that one of the things that have really helped farmers through the ravages of the current drought has been the introduction of the farm management deposit certificates. This was a scheme that was authored by the former Deputy Prime Minister and member for Gwydir when he was a senior member of the government. Essentially, this has enabled Australian farmers to put money into these deposits in good years and to take them out in bad years, with a greatly preferred tax treatment. I have been told by many farmers that the use of these deposits has been their saviour and that is the thing that has helped them through the drought.I think the exceptional circumstances support is very generous, but it can always be more generous. It is a question of balance. I would remind the Leader of the Opposition that last Friday, when I was in Bathurst, I announced a further payment of $8 million to be made before 30 June to the Country Women's Association - a wonderful organisation - to provide coalface assistance to farmers and much-needed small items. Overall this works in a very effective manner. I would say to the Leader of the Opposition that I think exceptional circumstances are now working very well. They are quite generous. If he says to me, 'Can they be made more generous?' obviously the answer to that is, 'Yes.' Should they be made more generous? It is a question of balance, having in mind our responsibilities to other people within the Australian community. I think we have the balance right, but I am a person who always keeps these things under review.</DOC>

 - In thanking the member for La Trobe for his question, I remind the House that in March 1996 unemployment in the federal division of La Trobe was 6.2 per cent. It is now a very pleasing 3.4 per cent. The member asks me about any further analysis of the job market in Australia. I can inform the House that in the last couple of days the accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers released the inaugural edition of its new publication called the Private business barometer. It is an analysis into the health of private businesses that are defined as having a turnover of between $10 million and $100 million a year. It is a very useful addition to the volume of literature on the economic performance of small to medium sized businesses in this country.The key findings of this document are very interesting and they are relevant to the question asked by the member for La Trobe. The first of the key findings is general in its application. It says that mid-sized private businesses overall reported strong growth over the past 12 months, with an 11.2 per cent average increase in profits and a 14.9 per cent average growth in sales. It goes on to say: 'This is expected to surge over the coming 12 months, with a targeted average sales growth of 17.7 per cent fuelling a targeted average increase in profits of 16.6 per cent.' It says that, while the three-year outlook is not quite as bullish, it remains solid, with a 14.4 per cent increase in sales expected to drive an 11.8 per cent rise in profit. It makes the very strong and obvious point that these businesses are optimistic, they are enjoying the economic conditions of the day and they remain very positive about the future. Very interestingly, the key findings also include the following:About half (48.6 percent) of businesses responded positively when asked if the Federal Government's industrial relations reforms would prompt them to hire additional workers ...Let me repeat that: almost half said that the federal government's industrial relations reforms would prompt them to hire additional workers. They went on to say that one of the problems was a shortage of qualified people - and I refer the member back to the answer I gave to the member for Hasluck when speaking about skills vouchers being one of the ways that we are addressing that issue.This document adds to the volume of analysis and literature which says very strongly that our workplace relations reforms have lowered unemployment and boosted the enthusiasm of small to medium sized businesses to hire more workers, and any reversal of our industrial relations reforms would stop, stone dead, the progress towards lower unemployment in this country.Any hope that the business community might have had that there would be some softening of the Labor Party's industrial relations policy, some drawing back from the manic determination of the Labor Party if it wins government to bring back the unfair dismissal laws, was destroyed on the Lateline program last night when, on two or three occasions, with great gusto, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition said that, if Labor won government, she was going to repeal the industrial relations changes of the coalition 'lock, stock and barrel'. Notice how much more strident she is, notice that all the olive branches, all the willingness to have transitional arrangements for AWAs, all the indications that 'we were going to talk to business, we were going to be a bit more warm and cuddly to the business community' are gone. We know, and she has acknowledged it, that Labor's policy, which is anti-business and anti jobs growth, would be particularly severe on small business. Labor's policy is designed by the unions for the unions and not for the good of Australian business or for the Australian economy.The Deputy Leader of the Opposition has already warned business to stay out of the public debate. She has threatened business with injury if it dares to criticise Labor's policy. We have seen that punitive attitude at work in relation to Mr and Mrs Doolan, the proprietors of that motel in Goulburn. They are the sort of people who will suffer, and suffer very severely, from the policies of the Labor Party if they are implemented. Of course, Dean Mighell, from the Electrical Trades Union, said the thing that he liked about Labor's industrial relations policy was how it was 'going to be fun', if Labor won, enforcing the new industrial relations policy against the interests of business around Australia.I say in conclusion to the member for La Trobe that the latest evidence in this Private business barometer by PricewaterhouseCoopers is that almost 50 per cent of small to medium sized businesses in Australia see the government's industrial relations policy - a policy that will be repealed lock, stock and barrel if Labor wins - as being very much an incentive to hire more people. That has got to be good news for the unemployed; it has got to be good news for small business; and equally it has got to be bad news for the unemployed and bad news for small business if Labor's job-destroying policy is ever given a chance of being introduced.</DOC>

 - The Deputy Leader of the Opposition is verballing the Treasurer. I know that I speak for every member of the government in saying to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and, more importantly, the Australian people that the fairness test which has been introduced by the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, having been denounced for the last three weeks, is now going to be supported by the opposition. We have had three weeks of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition saying it was a fake fairness test. Last night she said, 'Oh, there might be one person or half a person who gets some benefit out of it,' but they go along to the caucus meeting today and say, 'Oh no, we're going to support it.' Well, that is good. I am glad they are going to support it. I am glad they recognise that the fairness test will provide a better guarantee -  - in relation to people trading off their penalty rates than operates under the preferred option of the Australian Labor Party. We all know that, under the preferred contractual arrangement of the Australian Labor Party, people's penalty rates and holiday payments can in fact be traded off for very modest amounts. I have even heard of figures under 50c being an adequate trade-off. But under our policy, there will be an independent assessment of whether there has been fair compensation. So let me say on behalf of everybody in the government that, if the government is returned, there will be no watering down of the fairness test.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hinkler for his question. As the chair of the transport committee for a number of years, he has produced a number of reports that have sought increases in government investment in both road and rail infrastructure across Australia. As a response to those we have delivered in spades in recent years, this government, through AusLink 1 and 2, has committed $38 billion to land transport infrastructure in Australia, with the first stage of that, $2.4 billion, going into rail infrastructure in Australia. I think every Australian understands the history of rail in Australia. The networks have been generated and managed by state governments - some better than others, but mostly not very well. We have had to negotiate, for example, in New South Wales to take over a lease on the main interstate freight line, and also the Hunter Valley coal line, so that we could actually have certainty in investing in those pieces of infrastructure. For example, we are investing $389 million into the Hunter Valley coal line to make it more efficient, to get more coal to the port. Unfortunately, the New South Wales government is not matching that investment at the port to get the coal off the dock and onto the ships. But at least we have fixed up one part of it -  - Who owns the port? The New South Wales government and one of the authorities. The member for Hunter interjects. He knows the answer. We are investing in rail infrastructure. But when it comes to Queensland, we cannot, because there is a monopoly in Queensland. The Queensland government and Queensland Rail run a monopoly in Queensland on rail operations. So if the coal mining companies in Queensland want to shift their coal to port, they do not have any choice - they have to do it with Queensland Rail.We have seen reports in the last couple of days of the frustrations of industry with regard to idle coal wagons that are being parked in side tracks and the lack of capacity in getting their coal to the ports. It is going to cost millions of dollars and many jobs, and they are expressing great concern about it. But the Queensland government are still not doing anything about investing in the rail system in Queensland. They will not allow competition into it and they will not improve it by investing in new rolling stock and infrastructure to try to help service the coal industry to get that coal out. You have a look and you wonder why.I know that the member for Hinkler, representing the city of Gladstone, would like to see more coal going through the port of Gladstone, a very important city on the central coast of Queensland. But the Beattie Labor government will not do it. We have a look and wonder why. I am sure that behind this is the long reach of the arm of the union movement in Queensland Rail and a few of those entities in Queensland. You wonder: why would they have such significant control over the government in Queensland? We all know that, to be a member of the Labor Party, you have to be a member of a union first. We did a bit of research to see what union Premier Beattie belonged to. The first response we got was that he was actually the Queensland secretary of the rail, tram and bus conductors union. He is not conducting the rail operations in Queensland very well at the moment. But we found out, when we googled another site, that he was actually the secretary of the station masters union in Queensland. The point being that Premier Beattie surely ought to be able to get the rail system to deliver coal to the ports much more efficiently than he is.The Leader of the Opposition, another Queenslander, has been saying a lot about the end of the mining boom. He is forecasting the end of the mining boom. But we know why he knows there is going to be an end to the mining boom: because if he gets into office, if he gets into this seat over here, the unions will be back in control - they will roll back industrial relations, they will take control of the industrial relations system in Australia. That is what will end the mining boom.The Leader of the Opposition was asked a few weeks ago on Insiders which union he belonged to. He sort of hesitated for a moment when Barry Cassidy asked the question. He said, 'Oh, it's probably the Public Sector Union.' If you have a look at the Leader of the Opposition's background you will see that he was actually a member of the Queensland Public Sector Union, but also of the BLF - the old BLF, which has morphed into the CFMEU. We read on Saturday what Kevin Reynolds and the CFMEU want - and they know, and they have publicly stated, that a Rudd-led Labor government will deliver it to them.</DOC>

 - I don't claim to be an expert on this subject, and I don't mind admitting that. And I don't mind saying to the honourable member for New England that I will seek some advice on the content of his question from those who know a bit more about it than I do. But I will indicate this: 'equivalence' sounds to me like one of those words that has to have a common-sense definition. I am not going to make the mistake of giving some kind of on-the-run guarantee. I think it is reasonable that people who live in the more remote parts of the country should have a reasonably equivalent service to those who live in the more densely populated areas - that is a very understandable desire of people who live in regional Australia. That is why in a lot of areas, not only with mobile phone services but also with broadband, the government is going to great lengths to make certain that people in the remote areas of Australia are given a fair crack of the whip. As to the more precise elements of the honourable member's question, I unashamedly say that I will get some advice and I will provide it to him as quickly as I can.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hughes for her question and note that the unemployment rate in Hughes is now 3.1 per cent, an all-time low. The coalition government has introduced a stronger safety net that will protect over 7½ million Australian workers. The fairness test ensures that these employees will receive fair compensation if they trade away penalty rates or other benefits that come with the award. This means that the workers of Australia can be paid more and not less. It means that the criticisms of the fairness test over the last few weeks by people like John Della Bosca, Sharan Burrow and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition were completely unfounded. In fact, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and the Labor Party are so opposed to the fairness test that they are going to vote for it. They are so opposed to the fairness test, they are going to vote for it. This continues the Labor Party hypocrisy on economic policy.Of course they claim to be fiscal conservatives now - fiscal conservatives, yet they voted against tax reform. They claim today to be fiscal conservatives, yet they voted against getting the budget into surplus. They claim to be fiscal conservatives and yet they have stood in the way of industrial relations reform. They have claimed to be fiscal conservatives, and they opposed the Future Fund. They claim to be fiscal conservatives, and they oppose privatisation. And now they are so opposed to the fairness test that they are going to vote for it.The fundamental issue about the fairness test is that it ensures that Australian workplace agreements and collective agreements signed under our laws will have a third party check. An independent third party will ensure that AWAs and collective agreements in fact pay the full award entitlements. So under our laws there is a third party check for AWAs and collective agreements. Under the Labor Party's laws - under the Labor Party's common law contracts - there is no third party check. It relies on the goodwill of the employer to properly compensate the employee for taking away penalty rates or other entitlements.I thought to myself: 'There is an element of hypocrisy about the Labor Party's comments on individual contracts.' You would have thought that the Labor Party would have been so outraged about individual contracts which compensate by paying only 45c an hour that they would have hammered those contracts from one end of the country to the other. Last Wednesday it did not hold the Deputy Leader of the Opposition back from criticising the Doolans and the Lilac City Motor Inn. She went after a small business that employs 13 people. But the next day we find out about a business underpaying 58 people, and not a word from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. No-one could put it to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition better than, believe it or not, Tony Jones on Lateline last night. He was a little confused, and so am I. In a question to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition in relation to WorkDirections, he said:If you come across another case yourself where a contract had bought out overtime penalties and other entitlements for 45 cents an hour, you'd have made that public happily, wouldn't you?JULIA GILLARD: Tony, I have never criticised an employer for making an honest error ...TONY JONES: Were those contracts fair in your opinion, to buy out all those entitlements for 45 cents an hour? Was that fair?JULIA GILLARD - She goes on with babble, babble. Question 3:TONY JONES: But was the original contract - it's a simple question. Was the original contract buying out all those entitlements for 45 cents an hour, was that fair?JULIA GILLARD - Babble, babble. Question 4:TONY JONES: So the original contracts weren't fair in that case? Is that what you're acknowledging? I'm confused.Tony Jones was confused. We are confused as well, Mr Speaker. Question 5:TONY JONES: Were the original contracts fair or not fair?JULIA GILLARD: Tony, I've answered that for you.Question 6:TONY JONES: No you haven't, well you haven't.JULIA GILLARD: Well, I think I have ...Question 7:TONY JONES: Did they comply with the award?JULIA GILLARD: Well, clearly here, some back payments have been made, because there were arrangements which when they came to light and were looked at ... an honest error ...TONY JONES: So they weren't fair?JULIA GILLARD: They weren't complying with the award ...TONY JONES: But you said if they don't comply with the award they're not fair. Is that right?JULIA GILLARD: Oh no. Yes Tony ...'Oh, no. Yes, Tony'! -  - Do you want to know why the Labor Party are so prepared to criticise Australian workplace agreements that have a third party check to ensure that fairness is in place but they are not prepared to criticise individual contracts where there is no third party check? You need look no further than the Labor Party and the ACTU ads - 'The new IR law is a shooting gallery' - where it says that employers are shooting workers on individual contracts. The Labor Party are so opposed to our laws that provide third party protection, but their mates in the ACTU are running ads about individual contracts that for 45c an hour take away the entitlements of the workers. Look at what the Labor Party do, not what they say. When it comes to hypocrisy, they get an A-plus!</DOC>

 - I remind the House that the budget brought down by the Treasurer several weeks ago included $741 million of new measures to address climate change. On the subject of climate change, this week - for those who are genuinely interested in the climate change debate - this nation will receive the most comprehensive and authentic report on the issue of emissions trading and, unlike the Australian Labor Party, we will not be relying on foreign reports in order to frame our climate change policy. - We do not borrow European solutions. Those who sit opposite find something amusing about my reference to foreign reports. Let me remind them and let me remind those in the Australian public who are interested in this issue that the following figures highlight the folly of any side of politics in this country relying on a Eurocentric version of climate change in order to frame policy. According to an analysis of all of the exports of the OECD, those exports comprise about 62 per cent -  - What these figures show is that, for the total OECD area - that is, all the developed nations of the world - manufacturing exports comprised 62 per cent of total exports and resource exports comprised only eight per cent. The corresponding figures for Australia are manufacturing exports -  - Let me repeat that, for the total OECD area, manufacturing exports comprised 62 per cent of total exports, resource exports comprised only eight per cent and the corresponding figures for Australia were, for manufacturing exports, 16 per cent and, for resource exports, 37 per cent. - Let me continue talking about climate change, which I thought was one of the -  - stellar policies of the opposition. The point of those figures is that, whereas the total OECD area - and this is fundamental to how you handle emissions trading in this country - has exports from the resource sector comprising only eight per cent, for Australia it is 37 per cent. It is therefore supreme folly for either side of politics to embrace a policy which is derived from an essentially Eurocentric view of the world. When the report, which I commissioned in December of last year, is released - it will be handed to me on Thursday - I will have in my possession the most comprehensive analysis ever carried out in Australia on the central issue to the whole climate change debate. What this government intends to do is to know the consequences of targets before we set them. - We do not intend to embrace the Labor Party's approach - that is, to set a target without knowing what it means and then scramble around to get some advice about the consequence of that target. We do not intend to put the cart before the horse.The member for Grayndler then left the chamber. - One aspect of dealing with climate change -  - is the behaviour of individuals, households and business enterprises and the way in which they can take practical steps to reduce and offset greenhouse gas emissions and, surely, I would say useful information that helps them do so could also make a contribution. When the Leader of the Opposition first asked me a question -  - about this issue on 23 May -  - I said that the government reserves the right to engage in a public information campaign on climate change and associated matters. I said that on 23 May, and I have constantly referred to that answer in subsequent answers. That remains the position. I would say to the Leader of the Opposition - through you, Sir - that if particular material is produced on such an important topic I would expect it would be practical, informative and helpful to the wider community. It remains the case that no material has yet been approved for distribution.</DOC>

 - There is no doubt the member for Moreton's electorate benefits from economic reform. That is why in 1996 the unemployment rate in his electorate was 6.4 per cent but today it is 3.8 per cent, and in Queensland, obviously, it is around 3.5 per cent, which is a remarkable low in unemployment. Our flexible and modern workplace relations system has helped to create more than two million jobs in Australia since 1996. More than 320,000 of those jobs have been created in the last 13 months; 85 per cent of those jobs are full time and real wage growth has been around 20 per cent since we came to government in 1996.There is no doubt that one of the areas where we have seen a significant increase in jobs is small business. Small business, without the removal of the Labor Party's job-destroying unfair dismissal laws, was scared to employ people who had been out of the workplace for a very long period of time. Those most disadvantaged were women and young people who did not have a recent employment history. So when we removed the job-destroying unfair dismissal laws, small business had the confidence to take a risk and employ people who had no immediate employment history.It is also the case that the Labor Party's policies represent a threat to the economy. They represent a threat to the economy because the Labor Party seems to be quite hypocritical about what it says and what it does. The Labor Party's industrial relations policy guaranteed 24 months for a parent to take parental leave and yet the member for Rankin let the cat out of the bag when he said, 'In fact, it's 12 months and if an employer says no, well bad luck.' That is not a guarantee.This illustrates a pattern of behaviour: what the Labor Party say in their policy and then the backflips they undertake afterwards. Of course, the first reversal in industrial relations was when the Labor Party said they would have a one-stop shop. Then they forgot that they needed judicial powers and it became a two-stop shop. Now we have found that it has to have a building industry commission, so it is a three-stop shop. They forgot the minimum wage - reversal No. 2. They had 10 minimum standards but they forgot the minimum wage. Then when it came to bargaining fees - this is a cracker - the Deputy Leader of the Opposition said this on Neil Mitchell's program. Neil Mitchell said:... bargaining fees are banned at the moment ... under your system they wouldn't be banned, they'd be there for negotiation. Is that a fair comment?And Gillard said yes. Well, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has now put out a press release saying that the Labor Party are going to support us banning bargaining fees - despite their policy having a different view. So they are all over the shop even on AWAs when it came to one day. We had on the front page of the Sydney Morning Herald  'Rudd ready to backflip on AWAs' and on the same day on the front page of the Financial Review 'Rudd holds hard line on IR reforms' - the same day but two different views. So we think that the general public is confused about the Labor Party's industrial relations agenda. We are confused about the Labor Party's industrial relations agenda. But you know who else is confused about the Labor Party's industrial relations agenda? Our old friend Kevin Reynolds. We saw Kevin on the front of the Australian on Saturday having a ham and cheese croissant and a cafe latte, looking over the Swan River, longing for the day when the Leader of the Opposition becomes Prime Minister and he can go into every workplace and every construction site in Western Australia and let the bosses know that he is their new friend. I have read the transcript of Kevin Reynolds on The World Today, and he says this:... the way Julia Gillard is backpedalling on a whole number of issues we'll have to wait and see what the final outcome of the Labor Party's industrial relations policy will be.So Kevin Reynolds says Julia Gillard is back-pedalling on a whole number of issues. All the commentary from the newspapers, from radio interviews and from television says the Labor Party policy is confused - and yet they think they are ready to govern the country. Well, you cannot govern the country if you cannot get economic policy right. Good economic policy comes about because of hard decisions that are made not in the interests of the union bosses but in the interests of the workers of Australia.</DOC>

 - What I think is too clever by half in this debate is to set a target without knowing the economic consequences of it. That is what the Leader of the Opposition has done. -  - I can only repeat -  - that something is approved -  - when it receives the imprimatur of the minister. As a former public servant, the Leader of the Opposition ought to know that, no matter how powerful the public servant might think he or she is, until something is approved by a minister it does not happen. It remains the case that no material has been approved. -  The member for Melbourne then left the chamber.

 - I thank the member for Solomon for his question, and I love the way he constantly fights for the people of his electorate to give them the health services they deserve. I can inform him that, since 2001, the Howard government has committed over $160 million to improving cancer services for people in country areas. So far, Toowoomba, Traralgon, Bendigo and Ballarat have new radiation oncology services and Geelong and Perth have expanded radiation oncology services, thanks to the policies of the Howard government.I very much regret to inform the House that the development of radiation oncology services in Darwin, and also Lismore, shows the procrastination and the bureaucratic ineptitude which is all too typical of the state and territory Labor governments. The Northern Territory Labor government first promised to build a radiation oncology unit during the 2001 election campaign. That was a broken promise. They repeated that promise during the 2004 election campaign. That promise has only finally been delivered thanks to the very hard work of the member for Solomon and no less than $30 million from the Howard government. Sometimes you have to feel sorry for the member for Solomon. He has to do the work of the government in the Territory and the work of the Territory government in Darwin. He does not just have to deliver on our promises; he also has to make the promises of the Territory government come true.The member for Page also has a very difficult job. In June 2004, the Howard government offered the New South Wales Labor government $8 million towards a radiation oncology unit at Lismore Base Hospital - a great promise to help the people of northern New South Wales. The New South Wales government promised faithfully, solemnly and in writing that construction would commence by the middle of this year. I regret to say that, because of the absolutely astonishing neglect by the New South Wales government, the earliest that Lismore can have this vital service is 2010. And that is only because of the Commonwealth government's 'use it or lose it' ultimatum and because of constant pressure by the member for Page on this incompetent state Labor government.There is a very clear message in this: if you cannot trust state Labor to deliver decent health services, you certainly cannot trust federal Labor, especially given that the Leader of the Opposition has form when it comes to health. He closed 2,200 public hospital beds in Queensland. He cannot decide whether he is an old-fashioned Christian socialist or a fiscal conservative. But I tell you what: the people of Queensland know what this guy is. That is why their name for him was Dr Death. Dr Death was what they called him. I wonder whether, in the absence of his henchmen, he will have the guts to stand up here and complain about his much loved nickname.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Corangamite for his question. He represents one of the electorates which contribute very significantly to Australia's rural exports, which were worth $26 billion last year. Yesterday the National Farmers Federation released a trade policy brief in which they committed themselves to an ambitious outcome in the Doha Round of trade talks. They are working constructively with the government to develop a response to the various policy issues and to look at ways in which we can drive an ambitious agenda forward to a successful outcome. The NFF shares our view that a good outcome from the Doha Round of talks can deliver very substantial benefits to Australian farmers. They have outlined the potential for increases in income of up to eight per cent for Australian farmers if in fact we are able to break down some of those barriers which prevent the access of our products to the best markets of the world. They also know that Australian farmers would be amongst the losers if indeed this round were not to come to a successful conclusion.Clearly the rules based trade system has been of benefit to Australian agriculture, and indeed Australian industry, over the years. The WTO, in a recent report on Australia's trade policies and practices over the last four or five years, spoke very highly of the way in which Australia has responded to the trade challenges of the era. They particularly complimented Australia on our workplace reforms. They say in the report:Unemployment has reached its lowest level in 30 years, in great part due to reforms that have rendered the labour market more flexible.They go on to comment on the rise in productivity and improved competitiveness of Australia's goods and services in world markets. The report states:Reform has also made the economy more flexible and resilient to external shocks, like the Asian financial crisis in the late 1990s and, more recently, the drought in 2006.So the reform of the Australian economy has been good news also for our exports, which of course have more than doubled in the term of this government. The agricultural sector has made a very substantial contribution to that performance.The honourable member also asked about alternative policies. In that regard I was interested to read in the last edition of the Land newspaper comments attributed to Leader of the Opposition. He claimed to have been up and down more wheatfields than he cares to remember. I would have thought a handful of visits to wheatfields in a lifetime would hardly be more than one would care to remember if you had any sympathy for the rural community whatsoever. This is a man who has hardly befriended the wheat industry over the years. As the minister for health said, he has quite a bit of form on dealing with farmers in his previous role as chief adviser to Premier Goss. That was an infamous period for the farmers of Queensland. Amongst other things, the Goss government closed 13 rail branch lines which were essentially associated with taking the farmers' wheat to the port for export. The Goss Labor government, under the advice of the current Leader of the Opposition, closed 13 of these lines. They slashed hundreds of staff from the Department of Primary Industries and Fisheries. They were never to be seen whenever there was a need to provide support for farmers. What is particularly hypocritical in light of the Leader of the Opposition's question today is that they were nowhere to be seen when drought assistance needed to be provided to Queensland farmers. Labor has an appalling record of providing support to the agricultural sector in tough times and a very poor record of supporting them in their trading needs and helping them to find the best markets in the world. You could not expect any change if ever they were to come to office at the federal level.</DOC>

 - No TV advertising campaign has commenced, so the answer in relation to that is no taxpayers' money. Any testing or other work that might have been done preparatory to the approval of a campaign could have involved expenditure. I cannot tell the Leader of the Opposition off the top of my head what the cost of that would have been. I have been maintaining persistently - and I will repeat it again - since the Leader of the Opposition first asked me a question on 23 May that no campaign has been approved for distribution or commencement - none whatsoever. Any work that might have been done in relation to testing or market research would clearly have involved some expense. I cannot say how much that would be without getting separate advice, but I can indicate to the House, as the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources -  The member for Denison then left the chamber. 
 - The Minister for the Environment and Water Resources indicated last week that money had been provided in the budget for a public information campaign. I indicated last week that we reserve the right to conduct such a campaign. We do reserve the right to conduct such a campaign, but no final decision has been made on that campaign or the content of it. Until it is signed off on by a minister or ministers or a group of ministers involving me, it remains the case that no material has been approved for distribution to the public. That has been my position all along. Of course there has been some expense involved in testing. Of course there has. Of that there is no doubt, but how much that is I will try to find out and let the Leader of the Opposition know.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kalgoorlie for his question. All Australians want to see the gap in educational outcomes between Indigenous and non-Indigenous students closed. All Australians know that education is the key to greater opportunities for Indigenous Australians and for economic independence. There have been some improvements in education and training outcomes - for example, over the last 10 years the attendance rate of Indigenous students at school has increased by some 50 per cent. There have been increases in the number of Indigenous students in training, in trades and in higher education. But we all acknowledge that more must be done, and in this year's budget the Australian government focused on programs that are proving to work, that are showing that that educational divide can be closed. In particular, there will now be 1,000 scholarships for Indigenous students who have been identified as young leaders within their community and who will have the opportunity to further their education in regional and metropolitan areas. There is an additional $4,000 that will be paid to Indigenous students wanting to undertake higher education. There are improvements to Abstudy, and there is a $65 million investment in boarding schools in rural and remote Australia that accommodate Indigenous students. All told, this year we will invest some $600 million in Indigenous-specific education programs.We of course welcome any constructive or genuine contribution to this policy debate. So when Labor produced a document this week called New Directions I thought that there would be some new policy ideas, some well thought out policies and some fresh thinking - after all, that is how they marketed it. But there was something eerily familiar about New Directions: Indigenous Children, so I did a little research and of course I found Australian Directions in Indigenous Education. This was a document that was prepared, published and endorsed by federal, state and territory education ministers last July. This policy document is already in place.What the Labor Party have done with New Directions: Indigenous Children is just take Australian Directions in Indigenous Education and put a Labor wrap on it. This is not the first time that they have done it - just put a new wrap on it and change a couple of words. Let me take you to -  -  - Australian Directions calls for and has endorsed personalised learning plans for every Indigenous student. New Directions calls for individualised learning plans for every Indigenous student. - Australian Directions has already endorsed the national literacy benchmarks for personalised learning plans. - New Directions has called for national literacy and numeracy testing for individualised learning plans. Australian Directions has endorsed universal access for early childhood education for Indigenous Australians. New Directions calls for a universal right to access early childhood education. What we see here is Labor taking other people's policies, wrapping the ALP banner around them and calling it fresh thinking. Remember the early childhood policy taken straight from the COAG papers? Remember Labor's national curriculum taken straight from the government's policy? Remember the new retention rate policy announced in the budget in reply taken straight from noodle nation? Even the name of their so-called education policy - the education revolution - was taken straight from Mark Latham. The Labor Party are policy frauds. There is no fresh thinking and, what is worse, there is no conviction behind their thinking.</DOC>

In relation to nuclear power, let me say that the government does reserve the right, if appropriate, to engage in a public information campaign. We do reserve that right.

 - I thank the member for Boothby for his question. My attention has been drawn to an article in yesterday's Financial Times written by Mr Larry Summers, a former Secretary of the Treasury in the Clinton administration and somebody whom I could rightly describe as both a rolled-gold Democrat and a true fiscal conservative. Larry Summers is certainly entitled to that description. He begins his article by noting:If global warming is the ultimate inconvenient truth, the most important inconvenient truth about global warming policy _ is what happens in the developing world.This highlights a point that Australia has been making regularly, both domestically and internationally. Developing countries will account for 75 per cent of the increase in global CO emissions between 2004 and 2030. Mr Summers goes on to argue that the Kyoto approach - and I quote directly from what he said:_ could prove to be like the League of Nations approach to preserving peace: idealistic and visionary yet impractical, ultimately ineffective and perhaps even counterproductive because of the valuable political capital it consumes.Another esteemed columnist for the same newspaper, Martin Wolf, has previously noted:Kyoto is a gesture, not a policy.Both Larry Summers, who could loosely be described as being on the progressive side of politics, to use the American nomenclature, and Martin Wolf, who could be described as being a little closer to the neoconservative side of politics, once again using the American nomenclature, have reached the conclusion that Kyoto, which is the centrepiece of the opposition's policy on global warming, is not the solution.What this article by Larry Summers calls for is practical steps - and that of course echoes the practical steps of the AP6 initiative; Australia's clean coal partnership with China; our global forests initiative, engaging the developing world on deforestation, which accounts for 20 per cent of global emissions; and finally the practical steps which Australia is taking to engage all of the APEC countries in the climate change issue at the meeting of APEC in September this year. That has been the character and tone of discussions I have had recently on this issue with both President Bush and the Japanese Prime Minister, Shinzo Abe. In his speech last week, the Japanese Prime Minister had this to say:We must create a new framework which moves beyond the Kyoto protocol, in which the entire world will participate in emissions reduction. It is indispensable to establish a new framework in which both industrialised and developing countries address this issue together.What I think we are seeing with these remarks and the attitude of other countries outside Europe is a new pragmatic way forward on climate change - one that understands the very deep flaws in the Kyoto protocol, one that recognises that the Eurocentric system of targets will not deliver the desired outcome and one that looks towards a new climate change framework that is more comprehensive and flexible.I think this country has a dual responsibility on climate change. We must play our part in reducing emissions over time and contribute to the global solution, and we have to take practical steps to position our own economy for a lower-emissions future. On the latter, as the House knows, I will be receiving tomorrow the report of the Emissions Trading Taskforce, which I commissioned late last year. If we do move towards an emissions trading system, that will of necessity involve a long-term target of some kind. But it must be a target of which we know the consequences. It should not, in the words of Michael Chaney, the President of the Business Council of Australia, embrace a target plucked out of the air. In the words of Larry Summers, we need a global framework that goes beyond Kyoto - and Larry Summers comes to this debate with absolutely impeccable credentials as a former Treasury Secretary in the Clinton administration and somebody who is very much a rolled-gold Democrat and a true fiscal conservative.</DOC>

 - The answer to the first question is yes, it is true that that number of countries have ratified it. The answer to the second question is that Australia is one of a small number of countries that haven't, and the reason we haven't ratified -  -  - It is not a question of how many countries that you accompany in a position; it is whether the position is in our national interests. The Leader of the Opposition quotes China as having ratified the protocol. It is easy for a country like China to ratify the protocol because China does not assume the obligations under the protocol that a country such as Australia would. If we had ratified the protocol, we would have been assuming obligations that would have been damaging to our economy; costly to jobs, especially in the resources industry; and not in Australia's long-term interests. The Leader of the Opposition should be reminded that decisions in relation to these matters are not determined by the number of countries that share your view but by whether you believe the position you have taken is in your country's interests. It was plainly not in the interests of Australia to ratify the protocol and that is why the government took that decision.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Stirling for his question. The Australian economy is carefully poised at the moment. We have been growing strongly with good, strong employment growth. Nearly 310,000 jobs have been created over the year to April and our unemployment rate has fallen to 4.4 per cent, the lowest rate in 32 years. Our participation rates are at near record highs. Despite all of this, wages growth, which has increased in real terms, has not experienced the level of a break-out which would threaten inflation and monetary policy, and indeed did threaten inflation and monetary policy during other periods of considerable economic growth in this country.A flexible industrial relations policy is absolutely critical to maintaining the performance of job creation with real wages growth without wages becoming a problem and threatening inflation. From an economic point of view, nothing could be more dangerous than a return to pattern bargaining. Pattern bargaining was widely practised in this country before the introduction of the government's industrial relations reform which removed protection for pattern bargaining as part of industrial action and empowered courts to give injunctions to stop it.What stops pattern bargaining in this economy is the government's industrial relations legislation. If there is a change of government and the Labor Party rips that legislation up lock, stock and barrel, as the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has promised, pattern bargaining would again be legal and would again be practised. We have had come recently to light a speech by Dean Mighell from the Electrical Trades Union complaining about this government's policy which stops pattern bargaining and boasting, when he thought he was off the record, of how he has used pattern bargaining to extract millions of dollars through strikes and bans.Dean Mighell is not the first trade union leader to have done this or indeed the first trade union leader to have boasted about this. Unfortunately for Dean, his comments have become public. As a consequence of that, the Leader of the Opposition has confected surprise that Dean could have had these views, surprise that Dean could have been so looking forward to the election of a Labor government, and he says he is going to drum Dean out of the Labor Party. But what he is not going to do of course is drum the policy out of the Labor Party which would permit the return of pattern bargaining.Dean Mighell was of course a speaker at the ALP national conference where the Leader of the Opposition apparently took no objection to him or his putrid comments, if I may say so, in relation to the Prime Minister. Dean Mighell is from the ETU, which is a division of the Communications, Electrical and Plumbing Union of Australia, and that union over the last 10 years has donated $3.8 million to the Australian Labor Party. So if the money is to be handed back, we have got to have an assurance that the whole $3.8 million of donations from that union are handed back.Let me make this point: in addition to the donations that the Communications, Electrical and Plumbing Union of Australia has made to the ALP, that union is actually an affiliated union to the Victorian ALP. As the Victorian ALP records on its website:... state branches of the unions affiliated to state branches of the ALP ... give financial support to the ALP, and have voting rights at State Conference, where they nominate 50% of delegates.So if Dean Mighell is to be drummed out of the ALP, Dean Mighell's union should also be disaffiliated from the ALP because that union, in conjunction with other unions, happens to hold 50 per cent of the votes at state conference. This will be a great test for the Leader of the Opposition. New Labour in Britain was prepared to reduce the power of the trade unions. If Dean Mighell is such a putrid character, will he be demanding the disaffiliation of Dean Mighell's union? Because, if he does not, Dean Mighell does not have to be a member of the ALP; he can direct the ETU delegates down on the state floor of the conference where, together with other unions, they have 50 per cent of the votes. All of the ex-union officials that are now on the front bench of the Labor Party know precisely how it works.In addition to that, the Leader of the Opposition should give great thought to the ETU candidates that are running on behalf of Labor at the next federal election because Dean Mighell has publicly boasted that one of his shop stewards, Mike Symons, is the Labor candidate for Deakin - supported and funded by Dean Mighell and the ETU as a candidate - a candidate running lock, stock and barrel ALP industrial relations policy in the seat of Deakin. Why would Mike Symons, Dean Mighell and the ETU be running so hard in the seat of Deakin? Because they know that the only things that stand between pattern bargaining in the workplace coming back are this government and this government's industrial relations legislation. They know the quickest and the easiest way to bring back pattern bargaining is to get rid of the member for Deakin, get a change of government and get a pack of union patsies back amending the industrial relations legislation of Australia.To say that the Leader of the Opposition is somehow surprised about Dean Mighell would be the greatest confected piece of political theatre that we have seen for a long time. The ALP was formed by the unions. The ALP has 50 per cent union control. Every single member of the Labor Party sitting opposite is a union member. Every ACTU secretary can look forward to a superannuation package in this parliament. The Leader of the Opposition leads a party formed by the unions for the unions, and the unions want that party back because they know it will be a patsy for the union movement, the Dean Mighells and the ETUs of this country.</DOC>

 - In relation to the communications strategy or whatever you want to call it, I remind the Leader of the Opposition that on 28 April this year, which was the weekend of the national conference of the ALP, I released a statement on uranium mining and nuclear energy. On page 2 of that statement, I indicated that there would be communications strategies so that all Australians and other stakeholders can clearly understand what needs to be done and why. So there has never been any intention by this government to deny the possibility or the need for a communications strategy. I have not seen the evidence given. I am not making any commitments about timing. I am interested in what the official had to say, but let me simply say to the Leader of the Opposition: we have indicated a disposition to have such a strategy. We think it is necessary. We make no apology for it, and watch this space for further information.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Bonner for his question and recognise his interest in ensuring that an appropriate level of investment takes place in critical infrastructure in Australia, particularly for our all-important export industries and that includes in his electorate of Bonner in Brisbane. It has been identified that the national freight task in Australia is going to double by the year 2020 and that the nation needs to begin planning, preparing and investing to accommodate that freight task if we are to achieve the levels of growth that we have had in Australia in recent years. In the budget a couple of weeks ago, the Treasurer announced a further $22.3 billion for land transport infrastructure investment in Australia between 2009 and 2014. It takes our total investment in AusLink or our land transport infrastructure investment package to $38 billion. The level of investment that the Commonwealth government is making into infrastructure, both road and rail and in particular focusing on our export corridors, is unprecedented in Australia's history.Unfortunately, the state Labor governments in Australia are not matching this. They are trying to reap the benefits of the export boom in Australia at the moment - not just in the mining section but in other sectors as well - and they want to take the benefits of the export growth, but they do not want to reinvest in the infrastructure. If Australians really want to see what a future federal Labor government might do, they have only to look at the state Labor government in Queensland.Again, I draw the House's attention to media reports today about delays in getting coal exports out of Dalrymple Bay in Central Queensland. Unfortunately, we are starting to see comments about this by some of our very good customers. One in particular in today's media was from a highly valued customer of coal and iron ore out of Australia, the South Korean steel producer POSCO. A representative from POSCO, Mr YT Kwon, said from Seoul yesterday that he was concerned the delays in getting coal out of Dalrymple Bay in Queensland were mostly due to Queensland Rail and its overly bureaucratic approach to a crisis that now threatens the jobs across the Bowen Basin coal district in the centre of the state. He said:Frankly, Queensland is the very worst of our suppliers [throughout the world] right now.That is a sad situation. We pride ourselves on the coal industry, particularly in Queensland and in New South Wales, and on our ability to supply our good customers. POSCO, in Korea, is one of our very best customers and has been for many years.I had the opportunity of speaking at the Minerals Council of Australia conference this morning. Before I spoke, Mr Peter Coates, the chairman of the Minerals Council, gave a presentation on the current state of play as far as infrastructure was concerned. The comparison between Dalrymple Bay in Queensland and Port Waratah in Newcastle is interesting. The capacity of the port at Port Waratah in Newcastle is 102 million tonnes a year, yet the capacity of the rail line servicing Port Waratah is 112 million tonnes a year. Why is that so? It is because the Commonwealth government, through the ARTC, has taken over the running of that coal line. We are in the process of investing $360 million, and already we have increased the capacity so that the capacity of the rail line servicing the port is outstripping the port.What is the situation at Dalrymple Bay in Queensland? The capacity of the port at Dalrymple Bay in Queensland is 60 million tonnes a year. In August last year the combined logistics operation - that is, the rail and the track operation, which is all Queensland Rail; nobody else can compete on rail in Queensland - served up 59 million tonnes of coal to the port. So the capacity of the rail logistics operation servicing the port was below the capacity of the port, but in May this year that dropped to 49 million tonnes. The port can manage 60 million tonnes but the rail operation, run by the Queensland government, can get only 49 million tonnes up to it.This is clearly a case of a lack of planning of investment by the Queensland Labor government in Queensland infrastructure that is vital to exports not just out of Queensland but also out of Australia. This is impacting on the national interest. That is what goes on in Queensland. This is the state where the Leader of the Opposition claimed he cut his teeth as an economic manager. This is how it is run in Queensland. When the Leader of the Opposition was involved with the last Labor government in Queensland, under his leadership of the bureaucracy in Queensland, they closed 13 regional railway lines and three rail workshops and 457 jobs were lost. The Goss Labor government shut down small country schools and cut 403 teaching positions and they cut 600 jobs out of the department of primary industries and shut down four regional DPI offices. These were all decisions taken by the Goss Labor government in Queensland, where the Leader of the Opposition said he cut his teeth as an economic manager. This is the experience that the Leader of the Opposition claims to have that qualifies him to be the Prime Minister of Australia. The people of Australia should seriously question that.</DOC>

 - One industry in Australia that is strong at the moment is the mining industry, and one commodity that is particularly strong as part of the mining industry is coal. Coal prices have increased very considerably in Australia, but notwithstanding increased demand and increased prices we are having the difficulty of getting volumes of exports up. This is going to the heart of Australia's national income and to the heart of our trade performance.The particular port in Australia that is our largest coal exporting port is Dalrymple Bay in Queensland. The bottleneck at this port is costing mining companies $1 billion a year, threatening hundreds of jobs and risking exports as more than 50 ships sit off Dalrymple Bay waiting to be loaded. - The member for Hunter interjects with childish interjections. Does he show any concern about the fact that one of Australia's most important export industries, where we could be earning national income, could now be suffering a loss of $1 billion? How often are we asked in this parliament by some member of the opposition to comment on Australia's export performance? How important is it? It is of absolute importance. Here we are, at a time when the world wants this resource and when prices have never been higher, and we cannot export it because of sheer incompetence in the management at Dalrymple Bay.Lest anybody think that I have recently become interested in this let me remind the House that I first raised this matter in the House in February 2005. In 2005 there were 40 ships waiting off the coast of Dalrymple Bay. Now we are in 2007 and there are 50 ships. Think of all of the lost income that has transpired since then. All of the other countries around the world that have coal resources are increasing their capacity to get those markets but in Australia we cannot increase our capacity because we cannot fix the rail line down to the port.Who owns that rail line? It is the Queensland government. You cannot blame a private operator. I think the Queensland government is now the only state owned rail in relation to freight and exports in Australia. They deliberately kept control of this rail line so that there would be no competition, so that they could extract a monopoly rent and so that they could pay a dividend. The one thing they forgot to actually do was to invest in the capacity so that we could get exports to the port and out to the rest of the world.I heard the Premier of Queensland, who is apparently not responsible for anything, on the radio today. There seems to be no area of policy in Queensland for which he takes responsibility, and he was saying that this is all the fault of the expansion of the Chinese market; no-one at the federal level, no-one amongst the coal companies and no-one at the state level correctly anticipated the expansion of the Chinese market. Two years ago I was raising that matter here in this parliament because two years ago there had already been a two-year delay in relation to increasing infrastructure. Here we are now, four years later, with nothing done, with no competition, with no investment, with underresourced infrastructure, with Australia's exports, as a result, bleeding and the Queensland Premier says, 'This is because no-one anticipated the increase in China.' There have been over four years to do something about this problem.This is solely and totally the responsibility of a state Labor government. When you are looking at the performance of Labor and wondering whether or not they could manage a national economy, ask yourself this question: which state government would you hold up as the exemplar of economic policy in this country? Would it be Queensland, where they cannot get the rail system right? Would it be New South Wales, known for their expertise in motor vehicle tunnels, or Victoria, where the passenger trains stop but they do not quite stop at the platform? Think about it. The Labor Party cannot run any one state and yet if they get elected at the next election they will be running every state and the national economy. This is not good enough for Australia's export reputation. The Commonwealth have offered to take control of export ports, which are critical for the national economy. The Queensland government and every other state Labor government have refused to do it. They are solely responsible for this problem and they need to fix it fast.</DOC>

 - I cannot tell the House what discussions may have taken place between other people. Let me say this: I am not aware that any formal legal advice has been sought. That is the advice I have. There is no dark secret about this. We support opening Australia up to the possibility of a nuclear industry. We do not have any current proposals for the simple reason that nuclear power is something that will come when there is an economic opportunity for it. When it does come, it will be subject to the normal processes and constraints.But obviously, as Prime Minister, I would be interested in the constitutional position and I do not run away from that. I actually believe that this country has to embrace the option of nuclear power because, unlike the member for Kingsford Smith, I happen to believe that nuclear power is a clean, green alternative to fossil fuels. In those circumstances, if there has been informal advice sought, I have no problem with that. I am certainly interested in what the position is and I am not pretending that I would not be interested in what the result of that inquiry for informal advice might be. But as for whether we are giving it any consideration and whether we have any proposals in contemplation, no.If you put aside the little word games that are being engaged in, it stands to reason that, if you have a policy which leaves open the opportunity of nuclear power and you are a Commonwealth government, of course you would want to know at some stage whether the Commonwealth could legislate to make it possible for nuclear power to come about. It is a bit ridiculous to have a policy and not have the conviction to want to know what is needed to implement that policy. I happen to believe that the states are wrong on nuclear power; I think the Labor Party is wrong on nuclear power - and it follows from that that I would be most interested to know what the legal power of the Commonwealth actually is.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Deakin for his question and recognise that in 1996, when he was elected, the unemployment rate in his electorate was 6.1 per cent; today it is 4.7 per cent, which is fantastic news. That does not happen by accident. It happens because we are prepared to put in place reforms of the Australian economy that help to build prosperity, including workplace reform and accepting the recommendations of the Cole royal commission into the building industry in 2003, which presented a compelling and unassailable need for change. That is why we set up an independent regulator with real teeth, the Australian Building and Construction Commission.Since we set up the ABCC, the watchdog, the number of strikes in the building industry has fallen to record lows. In fact, of every 1,000 working days, the number of days lost to strikes has fallen from 37 days to two days every three months. That makes a real difference because every day lost in the building industry costs the industry $200,000, and on major construction projects that is a very significant sum. Yet the Labor Party wants to abolish the watchdog. The Labor Party is so enamoured of the great work of this watchdog, its reduction in the number of strikes, that the Labor Party wants to abolish this watchdog. If it is working so well, why doesn't the Labor Party want to keep it?Well, I too came across the words of Dean Mighell, the boss of the Electrical Trades Union in Victoria. I thought I would get a clearer picture of why the Labor Party wants to abolish the watchdog when I read the transcript of what he said in the Dallas Brooks Hall in 2006. This is what Dean Mighell said: 'The Australian Building and Construction Commission, their budget this year is $32.9 million and they have 155 employees and probably one of the - expletive - is in this room now monitoring this agreement.' He goes on to say: 'The greedy - expletive - and you have to have a look at what they offer at the end of the day is - expletive - and - expletive - agreements - expletive - me. What ability do we have to take protected industrial action anymore? The answer is - expletive - all.'Of course, Dean Mighell is Labor Party royalty. He has Labor Party candidates running in seats such as Franklin, Bowman and Deakin. The ETU is still affiliated with the Labor Party. Of course, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition gave an address to the ETU conference on 1 May. She did not worry about anything that was said about Dean Mighell before that - just went along and they had a happy greeting. So I was wondering: what is Dean Mighell going to wake up to tomorrow morning; what is going to be the headline? And I thought to myself, as I was listening to the Leader of the Opposition on Sky News, 'Dean Mighell is going to wake up to an interesting headline: 'Union boss quits Labor'.' That is the headline Dean Mighell is going to see tomorrow morning. It is interesting because Dean Mighell resigned from the Labor Party three years ago! It is like Groundhog Day. Dean Mighell is going to wake up tomorrow morning, the clock radio will click over as it did for Bill Murray. Sonny and Cher will come on with I Got You, Babe and the radio will say:Okay, campers _ don't forget your booties because it's COOOLD out there _ -  - The Labor Party has form. That is why -  - what the Leader of the Opposition said today is a political trick. It is a political trick because - do you know what? - Dean Mighell resigned from the Labor Party. He resigned because he was upset with the leader of the Labor Party last time and today he resigns again. These people have form. It is hypocrisy. And do you know why Dean Mighell is not upset about leaving the Labor Party? Because the Labor Party policy is still the same. It is still the same. As Dean Mighell said on Sky News only today, 'I'm not totally fussed about the Labor Party's policy, quite honestly.' Well, at least he was being honest. He is not a hypocrite. Do you know why? Because he is not playing the political game that the Leader of the Opposition is playing. Dean Mighell resigned from the Labor Party before, but his union members remain. He is still affiliated, paying affiliation money to the Labor Party. You always have to look at what the Labor Party does, not what it says.</DOC>

What I said was that we will move towards an emissions trading system that will of necessity involve a long-term target of some kind. I did not indicate that the report was going to name a target. As to the business roundtable, of course it contains representatives of a number of reputable Australian and foreign companies.

 - I thank the member for La Trobe for his question. There is no doubt that the workplace relations reforms introduced by this government over the last 11 years have helped to build a stronger economy. More recently, abolishing the application of unfair dismissal laws on small business, improving flexibility in the workplace, ensuring for example that we have a strong and independent regulator of the construction industry and ensuring that we have the Fair Pay Commission to make decisions independently about the minimum wage all form part of the fabric that helps to build a strong and prosperous economy with an unemployment rate of only 4.4 per cent. The Labor Party's policies will destroy that. The Labor Party's industrial relations policy, which was written by two people - the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and Greg Combet -  - I did forget Dean Mighell. I am giving him the benefit of the doubt. He had the input into the building commission, he had the input into patent bargaining, and I suspect he had the input into right of entry, which we will get to on another day and talk about it there. That is why people should not be fooled by every interview with the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition about their industrial relations policy, because it changes all the time. The truth of the matter is that 100 per cent of the members of parliament from the Labor Party are members of the trade union movement, yet only 15 per cent of the private sector workers in Australia are members of the trade union movement. Seventy per cent of the Labor Party frontbench are former union officials. The unions have donated over $50 million to the Labor Party over the last few years, and there is no doubt that, as part of the $100 million war chest assembled by the Labor Party in the lead-up to the election, it will help to get further union officials into the Labor Party ranks. Greg Combet is running in Charlton, Bill Shorten is running in Maribyrnong, Doug Cameron is running for the Senate, Don Farrell is running for the Senate, Richard Marles is running for the Senate and Kevin Harkins is running in Franklin. They all happen to be safe Labor seats where those union officials are running. I want to quote the Leader of the Opposition in an address to the National Press Club in April this year. Not only did he endorse all those union bosses coming into the Labor Party; he said:... get them in and get them in early.Of course Greg Combet could not hold back. Greg Combet said:I recall we used to run the country and it would not be a bad thing if we did again.Dean Mighell said things down at the hall that the Leader of the Opposition and, quite frankly, everyone else found quite offensive. But the Leader of the Opposition said on TV that he demanded his resignation. He was so outraged about the words of Dean Mighell that he demanded his resignation. Of course, like a whole lot of roosters in the rooster pen, all the roosters came out on this - the member for Lilley, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition; they all came out. I just say to them that I am reminded of the comment from Sharan Burrow in a Lateline interview, funnily enough, with Maxine McKew - hardly a penetrating interview - and from Greg Combet, who happened to pass comment on the same Lateline program. I thought to myself, 'Was Dean Mighell sacked because of his language?' Greg Combet in that program said, 'Don't be conned for a minute by any of John Howard's - expletive.' Well, Greg Combet has not been sacked yet. He is still there. Obviously it was not the language. Do you know what it might be about? I think it might be about the outrage the Australian people felt at the behaviour and insensitivity of Dean Mighell. That is what people were outraged about.I was reminded of Sharan Burrow's comment - and I want to know if the Leader of the Opposition supports this comment from Sharan Burrow. She said:I need a mum or a dad of someone who has been seriously injured or killed. That would be fantastic.That is what Sharan Burrow said. 'It would be fantastic to find someone who was the victim of a workplace death. That would help the union movement in their campaign against the Howard government.' The Labor Party should be judged on what they do, not what they say. When it comes to double standards, look at what they have got on the record. I table that.</DOC>

 - Let me just say what a great advocate for better health services the member for Wakefield is. The GP after hours clinic at Gawler is at least in part due to his advocacy. And, thanks in part to these kinds of new measures, the GP bulk billing rate in his electorate has gone up by nine percentage points since 2003. Not for nothing is the Howard government known throughout this land as the best friend that Medicare has ever had, and the reason for that is that the Howard government do not rest on their laurels. We never rest on our laurels. In the budget a fortnight ago, we committed another $291 million to give people with chronic disease better access to specialist services and to give people with chronic disease better access to Medicare. For dentistry there was $378 million and there was more than $120 million for Indigenous health programs. Just this morning, the government announced an extension of GP procedural training grants to regional cities such as Queanbeyan and Townsville. In part that is because of the ferocious advocacy of those great, hardworking local members, the member for Eden-Monaro and the member for Herbert, who want to make sure that GP services continue to be available in their public hospitals.Meanwhile, the Australian Labor Party have no policy on health except to cut funding and to rip the guts out of the fee-for-service principle on which Medicare is always based. At the AMA conference last weekend, the member for Gellibrand was asked about cashing out Medicare rebates into some kind of pooled fund. This is what she said in response - listen to this: 'So we have no plans for the pooling of those payments and we ... but we are always going to.' This is the kind of gobbledygook that we have come to expect from someone who, tragically, is the alternative health minister of this country. She went on to say, 'We have to look at ways that we can modernise Medicare,' and we all know what Labor means when they talk about modernising something. They want to modernise Medicare out of existence. Labor has form. I suspect that the Leader of the Opposition wants to modernise Medicare like he modernised Queensland Health. He modernised Queensland Health by cutting 2,200 public hospital beds, he modernised Queensland Health by closing six operating theatres, he blew out dental waiting lists to three years and he sacked the chief nursing officer for Queensland. Not for nothing was this guy known as Dr Death when he was the director-general of the Christian socialist government of Queensland. From what we have seen from him lately, I think he is suffering from a chronic condition himself. It is called TDD: truth deficit disorder. That is what we have seen from the Leader of the Opposition over the last few days. Let me say of the Leader of the Opposition, if he is untrustworthy with the truth, you certainly cannot trust him with Medicare.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Maranoa for his question. The government continues to take very seriously the threat of terrorism - which is a threat to Australians abroad, in particular, but also a threat to Australia's interests. This is a global struggle which requires global cooperation with the major countries of the region and beyond. We have no illusions about it being a long-term struggle and a very difficult struggle. In South-East Asia, the Indonesians, the Filipinos, the Malaysians and the Singaporeans have had considerable success and they have been substantially assisted by Australia. I congratulate those countries. They have also been substantially assisted by the United States of America. When I was in America last week and early this week I continued dialogue with the Americans, in particular with the Secretary of State, but also in Honolulu with the Pacific Command there, on the issue of counterterrorism and continued to urge active United States involvement in South-East Asia in addressing the issue of terrorism, which they have been doing.We have always made the point that countering terrorism requires strong international cooperation. It also requires using a variety of different tools. Clearly, in certain circumstances military action is, unfortunately, necessary. Certainly in many circumstances, police and intelligence action is necessary. We also believe it is necessary to engage the hearts and minds of people, especially in countries which are vulnerable to raising terrorists and where communities support terrorist activity.Yesterday I hosted the Regional Interfaith Dialogue, which involved 14 countries, the ASEAN countries, Australia, New Zealand, Fiji, Papua New Guinea and East Timor. At this meeting we brought together the religious leaders - the 'faith leaders', as they are nowadays described - of countries right around the region. These people are able to go back to their homes and explain the message of moderation, explain the message of tolerance and explain the great virtue of resolving differences, including religious differences, through discussion and dialogue, not through resorting to militant action. The Regional Interfaith Dialogue has over the years proved to be a very effective tool to counter terrorism in South-East Asia. I should not overclaim here, but it has definitely made a contribution to reducing support in South-East Asia for extremism. The interfaith dialogue was established by the Indonesian Foreign Minister, Hassan Wirajuda, and me back in 2004. The first meeting was in Yogyakarta.The point I make is this: a government of this country which is effective in pursuing a counterterrorism strategy is able to do a number of things at once through its relations with countries in the region. It is able to build, for example, an interfaith dialogue. It is able to build, if you like, 'soft power' to address these issues throughout the region. Secondly, a government with good relations around the region and with the United States is able to harness resources into South-East Asia which otherwise would not be available. That is why I think it is disappointing that the Labor Party wants to downgrade the relationship with the United States -  - when the United States is so important to counter terrorism throughout the region. I can only say that I was delighted to spend a few days last week with Secretary Rice and some time in Honolulu discussing many issues, including the issue of counterterrorism. Opposition members damn themselves by their interjections, which simply prove the point that they do not think those sorts of personal relationships are an important part of diplomacy. Well, they would not be, if you wanted to downgrade your relations with friends like the United States.</DOC>

 - I will not enter the debate about the views that Mr Summers took as Harvard President in relation to the role of women in the academy. That was not what I was referring to, and the member for Kingsford Smith knows it. What I was referring to was the fact that Mr Summers was the Treasury Secretary in the Clinton administration, a very highly respected Treasury Secretary -  - He had been the deputy to Bob Rubin when he was Treasury Secretary. He was a supporter of the Democratic side of politics. He certainly had a very good record as a fiscal conservative because during the period that the Clinton government was in office the American budget deficit was lower than it is now. He was generally regarded as highly competent in the job that he did. I don't think time permits us to debate everything related to his views when he was at Harvard, but he certainly has very good credentials as far as the economy is concerned and as far as being very much on what I might call the progressive side of politics is concerned.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Solomon for his question. There is no better example of the contrast between candidates on this side of the House and those opposite than the member for Solomon. He is a person who, before entering this parliament, worked in the superannuation industry for over a decade. He helped prepare Australians for their retirement. He helped devise strategies to help them put money away for their retirement. - Compare the member for Solomon with all the union hacks opposite. There is nobody with small business experience, nobody with a capacity to put money aside. - There is nobody with a capacity to employ Australians -  - or to put their house at risk. They have nothing but a union movement background. We know that in this country at the moment superannuation funds are returning good double-digit returns to their investors. People who look at their superannuation statements are now seeing the benefits of a good economy. When we as a government talk about having managed the economy well over the past 11 years -  - we know that one of the benefits that flows from good management of the economy is people's return on their superannuation. People want to amass wealth in their superannuation so that they can support themselves in retirement. One thing will put that at threat, and that is the mismanagement of the Australian economy. Let me make this prediction today: if the Labor Party and the union movement are back in charge of the Australian economy the returns to superannuation funds will again diminish. They diminished when Labor were last in power. If the unions are raping and pillaging business in this country, the companies cannot provide proper returns to their investors.The member for Gorton then left the chamber. - That is goodbye to the CFMEU rep here today, but there are plenty of other union representatives in the parliament to fill his place, aren't there? The point I make is that, if the economy is run poorly, if the economy is run into the ground again by Labor, it will not just mean for families that they have hundreds of dollars more to pay for their mortgage each month. It will not just mean they pay more by way of taxes as the economy needs to be propped up by extra revenues, which is what happened when Labor were last in power. What a Labor and union government mean in this country is a diminishing return on people's investment in superannuation. The Labor Party is a great threat to people's superannuation in this country.</DOC>

 - I do not have the exact figures at my disposal, but it is true that housing affordability has declined. I am perfectly aware of that and I do not dispute it. It is a cause of concern to me and to the government. I would offer the view that it would have declined even more sharply if interest rates were 17 per cent. On the subject of housing affordability, let me say to the member for Sydney that yesterday when the HIA released its housing affordability statistics a number of things were said. The Managing Director of the Housing Industry Association, Dr Silberberg, said that the figures released yesterday show all the signs of structural supply constraints. An article in the Herald Sun of 30 May reports that the Victorian executive director of the Housing Industry Association, Ms Caroline Lawrey, welcomed an improvement in home affordability in Melbourne and made the following comments - and I quote from the article:Ms Lawrey said the slight quarterly improvement was thanks to Melbourne's land supply, as well as recently steady interest rates, and a cut in stamp duty for Victoria's first-time buyers.She went on to say - and I think this goes to the core of the issue, if the member for Sydney is really interested in the affordability of housing for young Australians:There really needs to be more collaboration between all levels of government, not only to keep interest rates stable, but also to reduce red tape and other fees and charges first-time buyers face.I could go on by pointing out to the House that the Third Annual Demographia International Housing Affordability Survey released in January 2007 said that the experience in Australia shows as follows:Land prices have skyrocketed, while the price of building houses has risen only modestly in real terms.Let me say that again:Land prices have skyrocketed, while the price of building houses has risen only modestly in real terms.It continues:From 1993 to 2006, 88 percent of the combined cost of new houses and land has been attributable to inflation of land prices and only 12 percent to inflation in house building costs.Once again I remind the member for Sydney of an exchange between the member for Rankin and the former Governor of the Reserve Bank in the House of Representatives economics committee on 18 August. Dr Emerson said:I guess that is the question: are they - mortgage interest payments - high by historical standards?And this is what Macfarlane had to say:They are. That is caused more than 100 per cent by the fact that house prices have gone up, not because of interest rates going up. Interest rates are lower than they were 10 years ago and are obviously lower than they were 15 years ago.Dr EMERSON - But affordability is no different?Mr Macfarlane - The story is all about house prices. The story is not about interest rates.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Corangamite not only for his question but for his wonderful leadership in the development of the Australian Technical College, Geelong. This college is built on the grounds of the Gordon Institute of TAFE and is being run in partnership between the Gordon TAFE and local industry. It was a wonderful experience, at the recent formal opening of this Geelong college, to see the great pride, self-belief and enthusiasm of the students, parents and grandparents - great pride, self-belief and enthusiasm which has gone missing over the last 20 to 30 years as we have closed old-style technical schools and replaced them with one-size-fits-all secondary schools with a bias towards and emphasis on getting kids ready for university.Might I note the member for Corio also understands this. It would be remiss of me not to thank the member for Corio for his significant help in the creation of the Geelong technical college. While I am at it, I should also thank the member for Oxley. This does not happen too often on this side of the House, but could I also thank the member for Oxley for his strong support for an Australian technical college in the south of Brisbane. I appreciated the letter and I must say that in the recent budget the government acted on his plea. Clearly, both members opposite do not share the 'university or bust' mindset of their parliamentary leader.With the introduction of Australian technical colleges, once again young people born with strong technical, vocational or creative skills can access specialised training in year 11 and year 12. Those going to the technical schools, which we have created, end school with a year 12 certificate, one-third of the way through an apprenticeship, two years experience in the workplace and two years of their schooling in a school environment which places a high value on the technical and vocational skills they were born with. Not only that, but in the short 30 months it has taken us to build 20 colleges - there are eight others in the pipeline - we have seen state Labor governments, in most states, follow our lead. This was our intention all along - to show leadership in technical education. We now have several state governments mimicking our initiatives with a commitment to a further 25 old-style technical schools. In fact, the only positive ad that Morris Iemma had in his last election campaign was a rebranded version of our 2004 campaign ads committing to many technical schools. This means that within the next two years we will have more than 50 new Australian technical colleges, state and federal, on over 70 campuses across the country. We will be providing technical and vocational education to years 11 and 12 for nearly 16,000 to 20,000 young Australians.This is a real technical education revolution. The opposition leader's proposal to stick an oven or a lathe in a classroom at the back of the secondary school is no revolution.</DOC>

 - I will check the figures. There is no doubt that our greenhouse gas emissions have risen. It is wrong of the Leader of the Opposition to assert that we have not acted over the last 11 years. Let me take the House through what this government has done. Our programs and policies have directly supported or generated investments, for example, in renewables in excess of $3.5 billion. In 1999 the Renewable Remote Power Generation Program was established. A further $123 million was announced on 14 August last year, bringing total funding for the program to $328 million. In 1999 the government introduced the Photovoltaic Rebate Program. On 8 May 2007 a further $150 million was announced to extend the program as part of the recent budget, bringing the total funding to $202 million.In the 2004 energy white paper, the government announced that $75 million had been provided for the Solar Cities trials. Adelaide was announced as the first solar city in August 2006; then Townsville, on 26 September 2006; Blacktown, on 13 November 2006; and Alice Springs, on 16 April 2007. On 25 October 2006, $75 million was allocated to a large-scale solar concentrator in north-west Victoria under the $500 million low emissions technology development initiative. On 1 November 2006, $14.5 million was allocated to solar energy projects under the Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate.The Australian government have provided industry grants of over $28 million for geothermal energy projects and recently announced the Geothermal Industry Development Framework. These grants include the following. In 2007 we gave $5 million to Petratherm Ltd to further develop its groundbreaking approach of using geothermal energy at its Paralana site in the Flinders Ranges. In 2006 the government awarded $1.2 million to Proactive Energy Developments Ltd for a project that aims to develop an innovative regenerator for the production of low-cost, zero-emission electricity from geothermal reserves. Also in 2006 we gave $2.4 million to Geothermal Resources Ltd for a project in South Australia to map granites to assess geothermal energy potential.In 2005 the government gave $3.9 million to Scope Energy Ltd for a proof of concept project on the Limestone Coast which will lead to a 50 MW geothermal power plant. Again in 2005 the government awarded $5 million to Geodynamics Ltd. In 2002, $6.8 million was awarded to Geodynamics Ltd to develop a deep underground heat exchanger to harness hot dry rock geothermal energy. In 2000 the government granted $790,000 for the exploration of hot dry rock resources in the Hunter Valley. In 2007, $205,000 was awarded for the development of a COAG geothermal energy technology roadmap. These figures totally repudiate the oft-repeated claim of the opposition leader that this government has done nothing about these matters over the last 10 years.There is one thing, let me say, that this government has not done over the last 10 years, is not now doing and will not do in the future, and that is what the shadow minister for the environment has done - commit himself and thereby his party to a 20 per cent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by the year 2020. On 8 March 2005 this is what the shadow minister had to say. He was urging the government to do certain things and he said it should implement a national target and plan to reduce greenhouse emissions by at least 60 per cent of 1990 levels by 2050, with a 20 per cent target by 2020 to show real progress. Does the member for Kingsford Smith -  - I was asked a question! - What the member for Kingsford Smith was doing in that interview was saying that it would be a good idea if we set ourselves a target of 20 per cent reduction by 2020. I wonder if the member for Kingsford Smith has any idea of what that would do to the Australian economy. I wonder if the member for Kingsford Smith has any idea of what that would mean. He cannot deny it. He tried to deny it on the Laurie Oakes program on 1 April this year and he dug himself in even deeper when, amongst other things, he said:Now, what the figure is, you know, different reports say but it's somewhere in the 20-25-30 percent figure.For a reduction of that magnitude by 2020 - that is, in 13 years time - he is arguing that it should be a 20 per cent reduction to show real progress. I do not think the member for Kingsford Smith has the faintest idea of the damage that would do to the Australian economy.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Bonner for his question. I am pleased to inform the House that today's trade figures show that the trade deficit continues to narrow despite two things running in the opposite direction: namely, the appreciation of the Australian dollar and the dramatic effect of the drought on rural exports. The trade deficit in the 12 months to April 2007 was $2.2 billion lower than the deficit for the 12 months to April 2006. The value of exports rose by 3.2 per cent over the year to April 2007. This is despite a fall in rural export volumes by 5.7 per cent in the December quarter, driven by a 31.4 per cent fall in cereal grain exports. Australia's trade deficit has continually improved over the past two years. The trade deficit declined from $22.6 billion in 2004-05 to $14.5 billion in 2005-06. While there are two months of trade balance figures to come for the current financial year, the trade deficit for the first 10 months of 2006-07 is less than half, indeed only 43 per cent of the trade deficit that was recorded in 2004-05.The trade deficit narrowed significantly from $1.6 billion in March to $962 million in April, partly driven by a recovery in mining exports following cyclone disrupted production in Western Australia last month. Imports also eased in April following very strong imports activity over the past year. In the period ahead, exports are expected to pick up, supported by the recent period of record business investment. I can tell the House that private new capital expenditure statistics released today show that private new capital spending was a record $19.5 billion in the March quarter 2007. This compares with just $8 billion in the March quarter in 1996. Private businesses have invested more than $110 billion in the future of the Australian economy over the past year and a half alone.Can I finish on this note: strong private new capital expenditure is not limited to the mining sector. With other industries accounting for $14.2 billion, or 73 per cent, of private business investment in the March quarter, those figures indicate very strongly that the Australian economy is performing in a powerful way right across the spectrum. There is the argument that it will all fall over when the mining boom ends. Of course that presupposes that the mining boom will end. We can be certain it will end if AWAs are destroyed. I think those figures indicate that it is a broadly based economic strength that we are dealing with at the present time and not one narrowly based on an admittedly stellar performing mining sector.</DOC>

 - I do not carry that figure around in my head. I do not think the Leader of the Opposition does either. I do not think anybody carries it around in their head. Can I make the point that all of the experts that I talk to on this subject say that any action taken now in relation to greenhouse gas emissions will take years into the future to produce a reduction in the growth of greenhouse gas emissions. I think it would logically follow that action taken over the last 10 years would not begin to show up for some years into the future. If the Leader of the Opposition has some magical alternative to that piece of reasoning, I would be interested to hear it.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Dobell for his question. The Australian Bureau of Statistics today released their Private new capital expenditure and expected expenditure publication. What it showed was that private capital expenditure rose 9.1 per cent in the quarter and is now 4.7 per cent higher over the year. What this is telling us is that capital expenditure in the Australian economy is very, very strong and is continuing to go in, and will drive future growth in the Australian economy. The Construction work done series showed that we are now at the highest level of construction work done since the series began in 1986. Engineering construction, in particular, which rose 10.9 per cent over the year, is now at the record high of $44.3 billion. Building work, which rose 7.5 per cent over the year, is now at $61.1 billion - the highest since that series began in September of 1976.This strength in business investment, of course, is being matched by Commonwealth new investment in infrastructure. The Commonwealth has announced that it will build on its AusLink 1 program with $15.8 billion of investment, with a new AusLink 2 program of $22.3 billion of investment from 2009 for a five-year period. The Commonwealth also has, of course, its $10 billion plan in relation to water security, and in this year's budget I announced the establishment of the Higher Education Endowment Fund, a fund which will grow in perpetuity to fund Australia's first-class infrastructure in our universities. So what we are seeing in the Australian economy at the moment is a surge in investment which is building future capacity. That is good because most of the unused capacity in the Australian economy has been soaked up in recent years, with unemployment falling to 32-year lows.It is very, very important when you come to invest in new plant and equipment or you come to invest in engineering construction or you come to invest in building and structures that you know, when you get on with your building or construction work, that you will be able to do that without fear of disruption, black ban or any other kind of threat to such investment. That is why the ABCC, the Australian Building and Construction Commission, has been so important for giving confidence to Australian builders. That standing commission has done more than any other institution to wipe out the tactics of fear and blackmail on commercial building sites and it has given investors a lot of confidence to go out and engage in all of this new investment.I know the Australian Labor Party opposed the establishment of the ABCC right up until yesterday, when it announced a reprieve. The ABCC is still under threat of execution but there has been a stay of execution until 2010. So the Labor Party's view apparently now is that it will be needed but it will not be needed for very long, because it will be executed in 2010. For the life of me, I cannot understand the logic of this position. If the ABCC is necessary, why wouldn't you leave it in place for good? Why wouldn't you have the ABCC there to clean up the kind of thuggery on commercial construction sites which is exemplified by Dean Mighell of the ETU? It has been very interesting listening to the pathetic attempts from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and others on radio in Melbourne to try and explain why poor old Dean got expelled from the Labor Party yesterday. They cannot say that threatening builders led to his expulsion, because the moment you said that threatening builders led to an expulsion you would have a mass exodus from the ALP. You would have to expel all of them. So, apparently, Dean got expelled for bad language. That was Dean's offence: bad language got him expelled from the Labor Party. - Which Kevin's bad language? - I thought you were talking about the bad language of another Kevin for a moment. He was apparently expelled for bad language. Dean should have been expelled, there is no doubt about that, and Dean should have been expelled for his tactics of intimidation on building sites. That is what Dean Mighell is responsible for and he is not the only one. The CFMEU have made this a habit on commercial building sites and, if the Australian Labor Party wanted to do something about stopping intimidation on building sites throughout the whole of Australia, they would take a stand against intimidation, they would make it clear and they would expel all of those union leaders that have engaged in it.</DOC>

 - In typical fashion, the Leader of the Opposition has misquoted what I said, but let me move on from that. Let me return for a moment to the previous question the Leader of the Opposition asked, which was the basis of the question he has just asked, where he invited me to tell him and the House what impact the multiple measures I had outlined have had on greenhouse gas emissions in Australia. I indicated to him then that any measures that have been taken over the past few years are unlikely to show up in relation to greenhouse gas emissions for some years, just as measures taken now are unlikely to have an impact for some years into the future. I invited him, if he had some evidence to the contrary, to give it to me. Given the way in which the Leader of the Opposition has championed the Kyoto protocol and has criticised this government for not signing the Kyoto protocol, I think it is very interesting to have a look at the way in which countries that have ratified the protocol have performed in relation to the target.Let us have a look at some of these countries. Canada was required to have a reduction of six per cent and the actual change in emissions between 1990 and 2004 has been 62.2 per cent - and the new Canadian government said when it came to office that that target was absolutely unachievable. Spain was required to reduce by eight per cent; it has gone over by 47.9 per cent. Ireland was required to reduce by eight per cent; it has gone over by 22.7 per cent. Japan was required to reduce by six per cent; it has gone over by 5.8 per cent. Portugal was given a target of 127 per cent and is 20 per cent over. Italy was given 93.5 per cent and is 20 per cent over. Norway was given 101 per cent and is 22 per cent over. Denmark was given 79 per cent and is 25 per cent over. And Austria was given 87 per cent and is 28 per cent over.By contrast, this country is on track to meet its greenhouse gas emission targets that were set by Kyoto. All of the lectures, all of the sermons, all of the criticism falls away when you look at what has been achieved. This country is doing far better than many of those who ratified the protocol. This country is doing better than many of those who lecture about it. This country is doing a lot better than the Leader of the Opposition ever dares to give it credit for.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Gilmore for her question. The member for Gilmore probably, like the rest of us, read with astonishment in the Australian this morning the article about shipowners having to take the MUA, the Maritime Union of Australia, to court for the right to unload their vessel in Port Kembla. The member for Gilmore has always been a strong supporter of the reforms that our government has introduced as far as workplace relations are concerned - in particular, the reforms that were introduced onto the waterfront that have delivered some of the greatest productivity gains to our economy of all the reforms that have been introduced in the last 11 years.We have a situation in Port Kembla where a vessel, the Capo Noli, is stranded and unable to unload its cargo. Interestingly, its cargo is building materials - much needed building materials for the domestic economy and the building industry in Australia. Yesterday we had the member for Sydney and the Labor Party move an MPI about the affordability of housing in Australia, and here they are with their union mates putting up the costs of building materials in New South Wales by holding up this vessel and causing demurrage costs, which ultimately will be passed onto the consumer - the young couple who want to build a house in New South Wales.It should be exposed for what it is: the ALP talks about boosting productivity and being economically conservative, yet it is supporting an organisation, a militant union, that is adding to the cost of housing in New South Wales by running a picket line against a vessel that has been given a legal permit to carry product around the Australian coastline. The ship was given permission to take an Australian cargo because there was no suitable Australian vessel available at the time, and it is in Port Kembla being held up.We have the hypocrisy of the Labor Party moving an MPI yesterday about housing affordability, yet they are decreasing productivity; they are adding to the cost of housing. We all know, as a result of some of the public comments of their union allies in the last week, what is likely to happen under a Labor government if it were ever to get into power in Australia. First, it was Greg Combet, when he said that the unions used to run Australia and it would be a good thing if it was like that again. We had it last weekend from Kevin Reynolds, who has been salivating about getting rid of the ABCC and what that will do - of course, we saw a backflip of three years on the ABCC straight after they ran the MPI on housing affordability yesterday. Yesterday, Dean Mighell was asked to leave the Labor Party for using bad language instead of holding a gun to the heads of bosses in negotiations over their situation in the workplace, and now Paddy Crumlin in the MUA is holding up much needed building materials for the housing market in New South Wales to keep the cost of housing down.There is no doubt that, under a Labor government with the reins being pulled by the union movement in Australia, we would see productivity fall, costs rise, jobs lost and our standard of living decline. Australia simply cannot afford to put our prosperity at risk by electing a Labor government that would be controlled by the union movement in Australia.</DOC>

 - Well, I could ask a rhetorical question: I thought we weren't meant to be doing these opinion polls. I can tell you that I do not know - I will find out - whether any government funded opinion polls produced those results or not. I am very happy to find out and to let the honourable member know. I am perfectly happy to do that. It does not alter the fact that you want a 20 per cent cut in emissions by the year 2020. Those are the figures that are relevant. I do not think the member for Kingsford Smith really knows what he committed his party to when he made that promise. I think the member for Kingsford Smith, instead of examining the entrails of any opinion poll, ought to go away and do his homework and work out what the implications would be for Australian industry, Australian consumers, Australian motorists and a whole lot of other groups in our community of cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 20 per cent in 13 years on 1990 levels. I wonder: does he really know what the implication of that is? Does he really know what he has committed his party to by making that statement?</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Deakin for his question and also for his excellent work in helping to prepare the fairness test for introduction - it was passed by the House of Representatives yesterday. There is no doubt that the Australian Building and Construction Commission has made a substantial contribution to the nation's economy. Strike levels in the building industry have fallen to record lows. Before we set up the industry watchdog it cost 30 per cent more to put up a building in Melbourne than it cost in Sydney. That is because of the risk and the militancy associated with people from the ETU and others in Melbourne in particular. What we do know is that the CFMEU, which is the construction union which the Labor Party have as an affiliate, is front and centre of Labor Party policy in relation to the building and construction industry. The CFMEU funds the Labor Party. The CFMEU runs their campaigns. The CFMEU helps to support the candidates. As the Treasurer said, Kevin Reynolds is waiting for the big day when he can go into every building site.This is recognised by the Master Builders Association of Western Australia. They have said that now when you are preparing to tender for a construction contract you have to build a 'risk of Rudd' premium into that contract because the risk of the Labor Party's industrial relations laws is so significant and could increase costs. They went on to talk about how the Labor Party have form when it comes to pretending to make changes to the building industry watchdog. Yesterday, if you believed the media and the spin of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, you would have thought that they were backing away from their policy to abolish the construction industry watchdog. You would have thought that a stay of execution from 2007 to 2010 may have been a backing away from their policy. The Labor Party have form on this. You have to look at what the Labor Party do, not what they say.In Western Australia when the Labor Party came into government they abolished the building industry watchdog. They did it quite cleverly - they took away funding and basically kept the inspectors in a room and never let them outside the door. Bob Carr, when he came into government in New South Wales, did exactly the same thing with the building industry watchdog. He gutted the watchdog. All was at the behest of the construction unions.So how convenient it was for me to come across an article from the Australian where the true colours of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition were reflected - suffering that moment of hubris after the delivery of the industrial relations policy. It was reported in the Australian on 2 May 2007:Wilhelm Harnisch, chief executive of Master Builders Australia, said the Deputy Opposition Leader had told him that the powers of the Australian Building and Construction Commission were so draconian that it needed to be scrapped. She said she wanted to strip out so called interrogation powers of the ABCC, which she saw as akin to interrogating terrorists ...This is the body that she now pledges to keep until 2010. Only a month ago the Deputy Leader of the Opposition was saying that it had such outrageous powers that it was akin to interrogating terrorists and now she is trying to pretend that she is so enamoured with this body that she is going to keep it for awhile. The article goes on to say:Ms Gillard allegedly made the comments at a special briefing to Mr Harnisch and three other business leaders during the ALP's national conference on Saturday, soon after releasing detail of Labor's industrial relations policy.The truth of the matter is this: you have to look at what the Labor Party do, not what they say. They are trying to engage in political trickery. They are trying to get away with spin not substance. The Labor Party believe in killing the construction watchdog. They believe in replacing it with people like Kevin Reynolds, Dean Mighell and others who are going to have the power and influence to deliver the outcomes they want and not the outcomes that work in the best interests of the construction industry or, more importantly, in the best interests of Australia's construction workers.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Blair for his question. As members of the House would know, the unemployment rate in Australia is now at a 32-year low of 4.4 per cent. Over the year to April, 310,000 jobs were created. This job creation has occurred at a time when real wages have been increasing. Real wages have increased by 19.8 per cent over the term of the coalition government. You could not have a situation where you had such strong job creation and real wage growth if you did not have a flexible industrial relations system which could handle it.One of the great threats to the prosperity and the continuing growth of the Australian economy would be any return to pattern bargaining as advocated by the ETU's Dean Mighell and the Labor affiliated union of the Communications, Electrical and Plumbing Union of Australia. The Leader of the Opposition at this stage will engage in prolonged conversation with his frontbench in an attempt to try and ignore Dean Mighell and the problems that he has with the Communications, Electrical and Plumbing Union of Australia. He will try and keep his back turned and he will try and talk for as long as he possibly can so that he can engage in confected humour and laughter rather than engage, as he should be engaging, with the problems of Dean Mighell and the Labor affiliated Communications, Electrical and Plumbing Union of Australia.Yesterday the Leader of the Opposition said that he was going to pay back the $3.8 million that that union has given to the Australian Labor Party. Imagine what the ETU is going to do when it receives the $3.8 million back from the ALP. What do you think the ETU is going to do with it? The ETU will go round and run the Labor campaigns for all of its candidates in all of the seats. I think they have got one in Dobell, have they not? They have got a unionist who is coming up from Melbourne in Dobell. They have got an ETU in the electorate of Deakin. They have got Kevin Harkins, the ETU candidate in Franklin. I do not know if the current member for Franklin is here, but, if he is not, maybe we should just quote some of the things he has had to say about the endorsed Labor candidate for Franklin, Kevin Harkins. This is what Harry Quick, the member for Franklin, says about Kevin Harkins:Kevin Harkins is a foul-mouthed bullying trade union person of the worst ilk.It sounds like he comes right out of the ETU stables. The Leader of the Opposition will say that he will expel Dean Mighell for bad language, but will he disendorse Kevin Harkins who is 'a foul-mouthed bullying trade union person of the worst ilk'? Will he do that? The other thing that Harry Quick says about Kevin Harkins is that he is 'a Victorian interloper, a union official who has come down to run the Electrical Trades Union in Tasmania'. Dean Mighell, who allegedly now has nothing to do with the Labor Party because he has been expelled, has sent one of his henchmen down to Tasmania who is the endorsed candidate for the federal Labor seat of Franklin.I was very interested to read in the Herald Sun today - bear in mind that the Leader of the Opposition does not think much of Dean Mighell; he is going to give the $3.8 million back - that Dean Mighell and his union are affiliated to the Victorian ALP. Dean can send delegates directly onto the floor of the ALP conference and Dean pays affiliation fees direct to the Victorian ALP. The Leader of the Opposition would say: 'Oh, we are not going to have anything to do with Dean. He is a man who uses bad language.' The Herald Sun today reports ALP Victorian Secretary Stephen Newnham. I welcome the fact the whip is trying to block the camera up. Mr Speaker, could the sight-screen move to the right, please? -  - Oh, Mr Speaker! -  - Yeah, I know, I know - it won't go too well if he's delivering the punch lines, I can tell you that! I had one sight-screen for my offie and one for my leg-break, Mr Speaker! The Victorian Secretary of the ALP, Stephen Newnham, said that:... ETU money would not be used for the federal election campaign.But Mr Newnham confirmed the state branch would keep accepting ETU funds. - Oh! - Oh, Mr Speaker! Very tricky, this Leader of the Opposition, isn't he? He goes out there and he says he is going to pay all of the money back - the $3.8 million - which we will believe when we see. It gets paid back so that the ETU can run the campaigns directly for their candidates. And the Victorian ALP keeps taking the ETU money. If this Leader of the Opposition wants to distance himself from Dean Mighell and the ETU, he will direct Stephen Newnham not to take the money from the ETU, not to take the affiliation fees; he will put his money where his principle ought to be.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Canning for his question and note that the unemployment rate in 1996 in Canning was 9.1 per cent and today it is 4.5 per cent - good news. Good news for workers.This government has enshrined in law the right of all employees to be represented by a union. And we have also enshrined in law the right of someone to choose not to be a member of a union. And 80 per cent of Australia's workforce has chosen not to join the trade union movement. Nobody can be bullied or forced into joining a union. This is a fundamental policy difference between the coalition government and the Labor Party, which assumes that one day it will get into government.Labor allows the unions to use coercion for one simple reason: it is because the union bosses run the Labor Party. And of course what we saw yesterday in relation to Dean Mighell was an act of political trickery from the Leader of the Opposition. The Leader of the Opposition said that he had effectively sacked Dean Mighell from the Australian Labor Party. And yet Dean Mighell's ETU remains affiliated to the Labor Party. The unions control 50 per cent of the votes on the floor of the conference of the Labor Party in Victoria. The ETU is a substantial part of that, and Dean Mighell remains the head of the ETU.The Leader of the Opposition said yesterday that he was going to return the campaign funding received from the ETU back to the ETU because it was tainted money. And yet the Leader of the Opposition is happy to have ETU candidates run in key seats and he is also happy to have the ETU continue to fund the Labor Party infrastructure through its affiliation.I wondered if it could get worse in relation to Dean Mighell. And I thought to myself when I read the paper this morning that the actions of Greg Combet, the endorsed Labor Party candidate for Charlton, were appalling. He in fact was at that disgusting meeting held at the Dallas Brooks Hall on 15 November 2006. Greg Combet was there. He was in the audience when Dean Mighell suggested that the workers and the employees of the Australian Building and Construction Commission could not be left with people's children - an outrageous claim. And Greg Combet, by his silence at that meeting, did not condemn the actions of Dean Mighell. But, just in case he missed it, the Deputy Head of the ABCC wrote to Greg Combet, as the head of the ACTU, and demanded that Greg Combet apologise to the hardworking public servants of the ABCC who had been accused of potential paedophilia. And do you know what Greg Combet did? Nothing. Nothing. Greg Combet stands condemned by his silence. Greg Combet is someone who does not walk away from a media interview, and yet this morning on ABC radio Greg Combet sent out a spokesman with tricky language to claim that he was not there when the comments were made.Let me tell you that, no matter what the member for Grayndler might pretend to do, Greg Combet stands condemned for his inaction and his silence. If there is any doubt about the relationship between Dean Mighell and Greg Combet, look no further than the ETU newsletter and a photo captioned, 'A contracting mass meeting to remember'. Everyone will remember that meeting on 15 November, because this is a photo of Dean Mighell and Greg Combet standing side by side at that meeting. If you were to believe Greg Combet's spokesman this morning, he was not there. -  - This is photoshopped, is it? Greg Combet has been photoshopped in? No. The truth is that Greg Combet was there and he did nothing about it. Never a truer word was said than what Dean Mighell said yesterday on the ABC after he was allegedly sacked. He said: 'I don't think it makes any difference whether I am in or out of the Labor Party.' Damn right!</DOC>

 - The fairness test legislation passed by the House of Representatives yesterday ensures that employees will receive fair compensation for trading off penalty rates, public holiday pay and other conditions. This compensation will most often be paid as a higher rate of pay. The fairness test will apply to all collective agreements and Australian workplace agreements that pay less than $75,000 per year. The fairness test will not apply to individual common-law contracts - and these are the Labor Party's proposed replacement for nearly one million Australian workplace agreements. So this government now has a fairness test for individual agreements, and the Labor Party will not have a fairness test for its individual common-law contracts.We also have an independent umpire, the Workplace Authority, that ensures workers get a fair deal. The Labor Party relies on the employer alone to ensure workers get a fair deal. But what the last week has revealed is that the Leader of the Opposition thinks it is acceptable to trade away all award entitlements for 45c an hour. The government has waited for the past week for the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to say that 45c an hour is not fair. But what we have heard are words about conflict of interest and domestic arrangements that have nothing to do with the issue of policy. These are the facts. Since last Thursday's revelations about the WorkDirections employment contracts, the Leader of the Opposition has said that WorkDirections underpaid their staff because of award classifications inherited from the previous owner. They have based this defence on a statement by the company, which makes the same claim. They have said the company made an honest mistake. We do not dispute that and, appropriately, this matter is being investigated by the Office of Workplace Services. But the Leader of the Opposition has sought to misrepresent this important policy debate by claiming that everything has been an honest mistake. This is simply not true. The fact is - and it still stands - that there is a separate issue of policy here, and that is that WorkDirections reportedly offered agreements to its staff which contained 45c extra for trading off all award entitlements.The Herald Sun revealed last Friday a signed copy of a letter which contains these contracts. Remember that the Labor Party's defence is that the wrong award classifications were used, not that these 45c contracts were fair. These are two separate issues. The Leader of the Opposition has deliberately - and quite cunningly, I believe - moved the debate away from the fairness of these contracts and towards the inheriting of award classifications and other domestic arrangements. The Leader of the Opposition has engaged in a week of distraction to avoid answering whether or not he thinks the 45c contracts that were offered were fair.I raise this issue because a report in today's Australian presents details of the tactics employed, which are very similar to the tactics employed by Hawker Britton. I table that document. The Leader of the Opposition has tried to make this a debate about other issues when in fact, from a policy perspective, the Leader of the Opposition, in his industrial relations policy, wants to tear up one million Australian workplace agreements and replace them with individual common-law contracts. It is a political trick. The Leader of the Opposition did not offer the owners of the Lilac City Motor Inn the services of Hawker Britton. It is Labor Party policy to push workers onto individual common-law contracts, and the Leader of the Opposition has some explaining to do about whether 45c an hour is fair compensation. - </DOC>

 - The answer to the first part of the question is yes. The answer to the second part of the question is probably yes. But I would imagine that -  - while some of those governors may be committed to the principle of a target -  - they may not be committed to a particular target. Let me in total good faith, through you, Mr Speaker, engage the member for Kingsford Smith in this issue. You can believe that, as part of the architecture of dealing with climate change, you should commit to a target before you have actually decided what that target is and quite sensibly decide that, before you commit to a specific target, you find out what it means. That essentially is the difference between this side of the of House and the other side of the House. We both accept the need for a target but, unlike those who sit opposite, those on this side of the House say that you have got to work out what a specific target means before you commit.I can say this in relation to Senator McCain and many of the other people that you have referred to. -  - I can say this about them. I do not believe that any of those Republican governors or Republican figures have been so foolish as to commit themselves to a 20 per cent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by the year 2020, because I think they have some regard to the economic consequences of that target. While the member for Kingsford Smith is talking about Senator McCain, I direct his attention to Senator McCain's view on the American commitment in Iraq.</DOC>

 - I can assure the honourable member for Hinkler that I am aware of reports of considerable constraints in the handling capabilities which are limiting Australia's capacity to export coal around the world. In fact, the Prime Minister mentioned earlier in question time that the April balance of trade figures have just been released and they reflect a very significant improvement. We are very pleased that there has been this substantial reduction in our trade deficit for the month of April. But, in spite of the general improvement, there was one commodity where there was yet another decline - that is, the export of coal. It is shameful that a this time when the world is crying out for our coal reserves, when prices are high and when there are enormous opportunities around the world that our coal exports actually fell by three per cent last month. The reason for this fall was the constraints within the delivery system at the ports, but particularly on the rail lines.The Australian, in an editorial, drew attention to this problem early in the week when it made it clear that the problem is that the state owned railways, which are supposed to deliver the cargo, are not up to it. Just five months into the year it already appears that the volume of coal shipped by Queensland Rail in 2007 will be 15 per cent less than the figure decided last November, at a time when we are wanting to export more coal. The following day, the Australian identified one of the problems when it pointed to the hundreds of wagons previously used to export coal that are lying idle around Queensland. It published a photograph of 200 wagons which are lying on a branch line near Murgon in my own electorate. I can vouch for the fact that those wagons are there. But what the Australian did not actually say was that these wagons are actually located on an abandoned branch line which has not taken a train for probably a decade. Its only link to the main rail system is another branch line that has been mothballed by the Queensland government. It carries no trains at all. So here we have hundreds of coal wagons that could potentially be used to ship coal, which would cost perhaps $1 billion to replace, lying -  - We have hundreds of coal wagons on an abandoned spur line, connected to the rail system by a mothballed railway line. This is an asset that could be doing something worth while to help improve the performance of Queensland's rail lines. These lines were once the pride of Australia's national rail system. Queensland was the first to introduce multiheaded trains and electrified bulk cargo, and it did an enormous amount to open up Central Queensland and the coalmines to the export markets of the world. But, in reality, under Labor this system has been allowed to just drift away. When Premier Beattie was confronted with the fact that his performance - the failure of Queensland Rail to do its job - was costing this nation perhaps $1 billion a year in lost revenue, he blamed the coal companies. It was all their fault: the coal companies are greedy, because they want to export more; they want to earn more export dollars. Here is Premier Beattie taking $1 billion a year in royalties from coal exports from Australia, yet he cannot keep the trains running. They are trains that could be delivering cash into the indebted Queensland government coffers but are stopped because the Labor government cannot keep the system operating, enabling our coal exports to achieve their potential. This illustrates and proves yet again: if you give something to Labor in good working order, it will not be long before it is broken.</DOC>

The Treasurer, of course, can speak for himself, and very well, in relation to those matters. While people are being reminded of matters could I remind the member for Lalor of the remarks of the member for Rankin on this subject. The member for Rankin wrote a very good article on this subject in which he pointed out that, in effect, those who sought to pretend that the price of petrol in Australia was determined by other than world market forces were deluding themselves.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Bass for his question. He asked me to inform the parliament, which I happily do, of how many jobs have been created in Australia over the last year. I can inform the member for Bass that, since May 2006, no fewer than 309,900 jobs have been created in Australia. I am also pleased to tell him that no fewer than 359,000 jobs, of which 94 per cent have been full time, have been created since the major amendments to the government's workplace legislation which came into operation on 27 March last year.The member for Bass also asks me why there has been such spectacular growth in jobs. There has been spectacular growth in jobs in this country because we now have a government and a labour market that are employment friendly. We have a labour market that actually encourages people to take on more staff. We have a labour market which particularly encourages small business to take on more staff. In relation to a threat of higher unemployment, the greatest threat of higher unemployment contained in Labor's policy is the promise to bring back the dreaded unfair dismissal laws. Those unfair dismissal laws, for more than a decade, discouraged small business in Australia from taking on people. Everyone knows that what used to happen was that frivolous claims were made; small business was encouraged to pay $30,000 or $40,000 'go away money' to somebody who had made a frivolous claim. They paid the money and then got back to their business, but they got back to their business vowing never again to take a risk about employing more staff than they thought they might need.That atmosphere has changed completely, and I would have thought that the Labor Party would try to be friendly to small business, that they would stand up to the union bosses and say, 'Look, we'll have to go along with certain things, but don't you people understand that bringing back the unfair dismissal laws is going to stifle job growth in the small business sector?' But they did not have the courage to do that. This is not just a piece of mere fantasy on my part. The Sensis business index of small and medium enterprises released on 6 May has very positive results on SME employment. The key message from that report is that, of those small businesses that have reported changes in their business arrangements following the introduction of workplace relations changes, no fewer than one in five - that is, 20 per cent of the 1.9 million small businesses in Australia - have reported taking on new workers as a result of the changes that we have made and that Labor opposes. No less than 20 per cent of the total of small and medium businesses in Australia are saying, 'We are employing more people because of the Howard government's workplace changes.' All of that will come to a shuddering halt if the Labor Party wins the next election and is able to introduce its policies.So I say to the member for Bass: yes, we do have a 33-year low in unemployment - a fact that union bosses might want to keep not only from Australians but from the world, but we might deal with that in another context - and one of the major reasons that unemployment is so low in Australia at the moment is that small business once again has the climate and the courage to take on more staff. That is a great thing for the workers of Australia and it is a great thing for small business. It will be a terrible thing if Labor gets the opportunity to bring all that to a halt.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for McMillan for his question. I can inform the House that since the House rose, the week before last, we have had two very good pieces of economic news. The first was that unemployment has fallen to 4.2 per cent in Australia, the lowest rate since November 1974, and the second was that the national accounts showed that economic growth had accelerated and grown 1.6 per cent in the March quarter to be 3.8 per cent higher than a year ago. I am sure all members of the House will welcome that news. Even ex-members of the House welcomed that news. I saw Labor hero Paul Keating come out on Lateline. I knew the accounts must have been good because Paul Keating came out of retirement to claim credit for them! After 11 years, it was all his good work. He not only had some advice for the government; he had some -  - He had lots of advice, as the member for Blaxland reminds me. He had some advice for the Labor Party. I have made the point over and over again in this House that you do not become an economic conservative just because a focus group tells you that is what the public wants to hear and that you do not become an economic conservative just because you cut an advertisement to that effect. Politics is about substance; it is not about focus group and poll driven advertising agencies. That is the way I make the point. I must say Mr Keating made the point in a far more colourful way. He said:The Labor Party is not going to profit from having these proven unsuccessful people around who are frightened of their own shadow and won't get out of bed in the morning unless they've had a focus group report to tell them which side of bed to get out.Of course, we know he was speaking about none other than the member for Lilley, who, Mr Keating says, cannot get out of bed in the morning until the focus group says the left or the right. Half the time, he tries to get out on both sides of the bed in the morning. With an economy which has grown at 1.6 per cent in the March quarter, with unemployment low at 4.2 per cent, you cannot afford to make errors and mistakes. This is now a supercharged economy. It is like a Formula One racing car. It is highly calibrated. If a driver in this highly calibrated Formula One racing car takes a bend at six inches or six centimetres too wide, he is going to have a crash. This is not the time to be experimenting with the L-plate drivers of the Australian Labor Party. This is a time when you need experience. This is not a time to go back to union control in the labour market because all of that could unsettle this economy. Now more than ever, in a highly calibrated economy, you need strong economic management - the economic management of the coalition.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Moreton for his question. He asks me whether I am aware of criticism of Australia's labour market policies in international fora. The answer is yes, I am, but more seriously than that, I am aware of the fact that a person holding a very prominent public position in Australia - namely, the presidency of the Australian Council of Trade Unions - has broken one of the unwritten laws of Australian political combat; that is, that no matter how strongly you feel about something, you do not blacken the name of your own country overseas to score a domestic political point. That is what Sharan Burrow does. However I might disagree with Sharan Burrow, it is all right for her to try to argue the case against us here in Australia, but to go overseas and blacken the name of her own country in order to score a domestic political point is, in my view, breaking an unwritten law of Australian political combat. Not only did she blacken the name of Australia, but also she encouraged the blackening of Australia's name. On 5 June, the Australian said Ms Burrow was:... lobbying furiously by telephone from Melbourne to Geneva over the past week to have Australia included on the ILO's list of 25 at Colombia's expense.They murder trade unionists in Colombia. Colombia is a foul, authoritarian country. For the President of the ACTU to be part of a process that replaces a country with an appalling human rights record and - no matter what she might think of me or our government, or any prominent official - to use an international forum to blacken the name of her own country is to break one of the unwritten laws of Australian political combat.Not only was the ACTU engaged in that exercise; it was also engaged in the exercise of trying to suppress knowledge of how successful this country has been in reducing unemployment. I would have thought that if there was one thing that the ILO would be interested in, it would be how low unemployment is in Australia. I would have thought that the one great human dividend of labour market policy would be to give a job to as many people who wanted one as was humanly possible. I would have thought that that exceeded anything else - that it was more important than any ideology and that how many people you had in work was more important than whether it was this or that ideology. But it is not when it comes to the ACTU and its mates in the Australian Labor Party.What they were doing was trying to suppress data about our unemployment level. The employer delegate reported that the union representatives actually tried to prevent data on unemployment being made known to the ILO. There is a very telling article by Peter Anderson in the Australian newspaper this morning, in which he reports having been at a meeting where the union delegates tried to stop news of the low unemployment being admitted into the debate before the committee. Mr Anderson states that he went back to his hotel room and said: 'Thank heavens for CNN. I flick on CNN and I see that Australia has a 33-year low in unemployment.' So - no thanks to the ACTU, no thanks to Sharan Burrow and no thanks to their friends in the Australian Labor Party - it has taken the reach of CNN to bring home to international people just how successful this country has been in reducing unemployment.I simply say that it is one thing to attack me; it is one thing to attack the government. By all means, have open season on us here in Australia. But, when you go overseas, do not blacken the name of your own country in order to score a domestic political point.</DOC>

We all know that on a scale of 10, when it comes to hatred of AWAs, the member for Lalor is at about 10½ or 11. And every time there is a tiny little bit of light, a tiny opening of the door on some possible, little, teeny-weeny bit of preservation of AWAs, she comes in and says: 'No. Lock, stock and barrel, they're going.'

 - I thank the honourable member for Bonner for his question. I think I can say without a shadow of doubt that he is the greatest member for Bonner that this House has ever seen. It is probably known in this House that the Commonwealth in its most recent budget balanced the budget, cut tax and further reduced debt. In fact, the Commonwealth is now building a net asset position. Now that we have had all of the states except for New South Wales deliver their budgets, we can say that collectively the Labor states have left their budgets in deficit, have increased tax and are building up debt - the very reverse of what the Commonwealth is doing. For example, Queensland will increase its vehicle registration duties from 1 January 2008; Western Australia announced increases in water, electricity, public transport and motor vehicle registration costs; South Australia announced increases in compulsory third party premiums, motor vehicle registrations and water; and Victoria announced increased taxes on poker machines and that it would abolish its petrol subsidy by 0.429c a litre. - I want members of the House - and the member for Ballarat, who is interjecting, in particular - to focus on this. A moment ago Labor was complaining about the price of petrol. I point out to the Labor Party that the Victorian Labor government withdrew a petrol subsidy in its recent budget. And the Tasmanian government did the same thing. It withdrew a subsidy of 1.95c per litre on petrol and 1.99c per litre on diesel. So it would be very interesting to know whether the Labor Party has criticised any of the state governments that have recently withdrawn petrol subsidies and put prices up as a consequence. If any of them have, they can speak now or forever hold their peace. They have held their peace. In addition to that -  - Yes. -  - No, you do not get a second chance at that one. A lot of marriages would fail if you had two chances to speak! Not only has Labor increased all those taxes but the Labor states are not balancing their budgets as a whole. They are budgeting for deficits of 0.3 per cent of GDP and - get a load of this - as a whole, building up debt over the next three years by $58 billion. Over the next forward estimates, the Commonwealth will save $50 billion and the states will borrow $58 billion. This is the difference between Liberal federal government and state Labor government. With state Labor government, you get increased taxes, budget deficits and a build-up of debt. With the coalition federal government, you get tax cuts, balanced budgets and a reduction of debt. If you want the Labor way to spread from the states to the Commonwealth, you have a great opportunity. You have Mr Rudd and his focus group driven advisers and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition or you could have real economic management in the coalition government.</DOC>

 - Let me take the deputy leader very quietly through this. I ask her to listen very quietly. Let me just point out to her that it does not prove anything of the kind. What our policy demonstrates is that people can have choice. The difference between us and the Labor Party is that, if the Labor Party wins the election, collective agreements will rule the day. They will completely remove the option of AWAs. What we are witnessing -  - is the member for Lalor, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, grabbing hold of the unexpected opportunity of speaking for the Labor Party - and she has taken every question and directed all of them to me. What she is really doing is saying to the world -  - that, as far as she is concerned, there will be absolutely no backsliding on AWAs. Gary Gray - you all know who Gary Gray is; certainly the former Prime Minister does - may be going around the mining companies in Western Australia -  - People like Gary Gray and others may be going around saying, 'There is a way through on this, comrade,' but while the leader is away in Brisbane the acting leader is taking every opportunity to nail her colours to the anti-AWA mast. She speaks for the Australian Labor Party, she speaks for Greg Combet and she speaks for Sharan Burrow. Every question she asks is a further illustration of her visceral hatred of AWAs. I would invite the Acting Leader of the Opposition to explain to those hundreds of thousands of Australians who are far better off under AWAs -  - I resume the invitation I extended to the Acting Leader of the Opposition. Instead of reinforcing her visceral dislike of AWAs, perhaps she ought to go to Western Australia and to other parts of this country and explain to people who are thousands of dollars a year better off under AWAs why she wants to destroy their living standards. Perhaps she could explain to the many tens of thousands -  - I invite the Acting Leader of the Opposition and I also invite the shadow Treasurer to explain to people who are on AWAs why their freedom of choice should be destroyed under a Labor government.</DOC>

 - I am pleased that the member for Hotham is looking forward to it. I thank the member for Maranoa for his question. He would be aware that since the coalition government has been in office unemployment in the electorate of Maranoa has fallen from 6.3 per cent to 3.4 per cent. It is actually lower than the national average of 4.2 per cent, so in the electorate of Maranoa they are leading the way. It is as a result of coalition government policies that that has indeed taken place. The overall national level of unemployment at 4.2 per cent is a 33-year low within the Australian economy and something that should be celebrated by all Australians, particularly all those Australians that have got jobs now who did not have them back then. They are the people that have been forgotten by the President of the ACTU, Sharan Burrow, in trying to conceal these fantastic statistics about the Australian economy.On Sunday I was in the electorate of Maranoa with the member when we announced one of the projects that will continue to strengthen and grow employment opportunities in central-western Queensland. We were at Longreach at the airport where the Qantas Founders Museum has just taken delivery of the 707 that is an historic aircraft in Australian aviation history. At the same time we announced a grant of $6.6 million to the Longreach Shire Council for the upgrade of the airport so that tourism can be further developed off the back of great opportunities like the Qantas Founders Museum - the Longreach Shire Council that today still exists but which Premier Beattie wants to do away with. We will continue to support local government in Queensland as they make their way forward, developing job-creating opportunities in the future, even if the Queensland Labor government wants to make them extinct. I give full credit to the Mayor of Longreach, Pat Tanks, for the way he is leading his council in the fight against forced amalgamations in Queensland and we will continue to support them.That is just one of the ways we have been trying to assist the development of employment opportunities in regional Australia, in supporting programs like the Sustainable Regions Program. We believe we can continue to drive unemployment down in Australia. We believe we can continue to put the downward pressure on unemployment to find more jobs and make a more flexible labour market.We know there is one side of politics that does not believe that. I was interested to read a transcript of the Leader of the Opposition on the John Laws program on 26 April. Mind you, it was a transcript that is not available on his website; we had to go looking a little bit further - it has been airbrushed off the website. He was talking about unemployment levels and the fact that if Chinese demand slowed he said it would lead to more normal levels of economic activity. He went on to say, 'And if that happens you start to return to more normal levels of economic activity, more normal levels of employment and unemployment - well, normal in the sense that it will be higher levels of unemployment and lower levels of employment.' This is the Leader of the Opposition on air with John Laws talking about what he thinks are more normal levels of unemployment and more normal levels of employment. Now we know that the Australian Labor Party led by the member for Griffith believes that more normal levels of unemployment are probably going to go back up to 11 per cent where they used to be. Is that their description of more normal levels of unemployment? It is not ours. We want to normalise levels of unemployment at 4.2 per cent or lower. That is what the coalition government believes in. We do not believe in seeing unemployment going higher; we want to continue to work in the Australian economy to force unemployment down. We know that the Leader of the Opposition is comfortable and happy to see unemployment normalised at a higher level.</DOC>

 - Firstly, I begin by thanking the member for New England but saying how disappointed I am that he has been playing political games on this issue. This is an issue of great importance to those Australians, those farmers, who are affected by it. I take the opportunity to thank the member for Gwydir for the assistance that he has provided to those farmers and the direction that he has offered to the government. There was no contradictory statement issued last week. What there was was a clever, tricky political situation conjured up by the honourable member. - It is an unfortunate development because -  - the government have offered considerable assistance to these farmers who are in need and we have been working with the irrigators to make sure that we provide for an equitable outcome. Capital gains tax does not apply to an asset such as a statutory licence where the licence was issued before 20 September 1985. Even where a pre-CGT licence is replaced by another statutory licence, that replacement licence is not subject to CGT when it is eventually disposed of. In the case of the Namoi Valley irrigators, many groundwater licence holders have received replacement licences. Where the licence holder receives cash as well, the cash is not subject to CGT because it relates to the disposal of a pre-CGT licence. The result of my announcement of 8 June 2007 is that the acquisition date of the original licence is rolled over to the replacement licence and so any gain on the replacement licence will be disregarded.Coming to licence holders who acquired their original licence after the CGT date in 1985, a rollover occurs when they are provided with a replacement groundwater licence. This means that the disposal of the original licence is disregarded for CGT purposes and it is only when the replacement licence is disposed of that CGT may be payable. Importantly, the CGT rules apply by taking the acquisition date and the cost of the original licence into account when the replacement licence is disposed of.If cash is also offered to the licence holder in conjunction with the replacement licence, the announcement I made on 8 June 2007 indicates the replacement of the original licence with the new licence will still be eligible for rollover. The cash, however, will be subject to CGT in the year it is offered. The amount of the cash capital gain is determined after prorating the cash to the value of the replacement licence. The cash capital gain may be eligible for the CGT 50 per cent discount provided the original licence had been held for at least 12 months prior to its replacement.This is a technical issue. The member asked for a technical response. I am happy to provide him with any further response that he may require. But I do say to all those irrigators who are nervous about the loss of their water rights that they can be assured that the Howard government are providing them with assistance. We offered $25 million more to those farmers. People should not be playing political games with these issues; they should be looking to the leadership being provided by the former Deputy Prime Minister, the member for Gwydir, who has brought very ably the interests of those irrigators to my attention and the attention of the Prime Minister and the cabinet. I can provide them with an assurance that we will continue to provide them with the best outcome possible.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Boothby for his question and for his interest. The defence minister and I were in Tokyo last week for two-plus-two -  - that is, the foreign and defence ministers on both sides - talks with the Japanese government. This is a round of discussions which followed the conclusion of the Joint Declaration on Security Cooperation between Japan and Australia by our Prime Minister and Prime Minister Abe of Japan. That was signed in March. These are the only talks of this kind that Australia has with any country, with the exception of the United States and the United Kingdom. As far as Japan is concerned, it only has two-plus-two talks with the United States and Australia. It is an opportunity for us to work through with the leadership of Japan not only issues such as North Korea, counterterrorism and counterproliferation but also, and very importantly for Australia, the South Pacific and developments in South-East Asia.Fifty years ago, Black Jack McEwen, the leader of the then Country Party, now the National Party, negotiated the historic commerce agreement. Fifty years later Prime Minister Howard and Prime Minister Abe have concluded a security cooperation declaration demonstrating a substantial step forward, yet again, in one of the most important of all bilateral relationships. It does demonstrate a point that we have made in all our years in government, and that is that one of the keys to Australian diplomacy in promoting our national interest - that is what we do on this side of the House - is to build strong bilateral relationships with key countries: the United States, Indonesia, China, Japan and India. That is, if I may say so, one of the core strategies of an Australian foreign policy.The honourable member asks whether this approach is threatened in any way. The opposition's approach is somewhat different. I noted in the Australian Financial Review this weekend an interview by Geoffrey Barker with the member for Barton about foreign policy. I wondered at first why the member for Barton would be interviewed but I discovered on reading the article that he is the spokesman for foreign affairs. The member for Barton said that he would take a completely different approach. He said he opposed the coalition's embrace of predominantly bilateral foreign relations in favour of a shift to what he described as a 'liberal multilateralist agenda'. All of these great things that we have been doing bilaterally with the key countries in the region apparently -  - are of little importance compared to the so-called 'liberal multilateralist agenda'. The opposition wants to downgrade the American alliance - apparently these key bilateral relationships are not so important anymore - and instead wants to play some sort of parlour game with a hotchpotch of like-minded international activists.This kind of hazy lazy commitment to liberal multilateralism is of course very popular with the Labor Party. But on this side of the House we are guided by a different principle; we are guided by the principle of promoting Australia's national interest. Actually, on this side of the House we are on Australia's side; and on that side of the House you are liberal multilateralists, apparently. That is yet another reason why staying with the stability and certainty of the coalition government is the wise thing to do.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Blair for the question and note that, in 1996, the unemployment rate in Blair was 9.4 per cent; today it is 5 per cent - nearly halved. That is a great outcome for the people of Blair. This government has enshrined in law the right of employees to be represented by a trade union, and of course during employment negotiations they can be represented by anyone that they want. - Importantly, we have also enshrined in law the right for someone to choose not to be a member of the union, so nobody can be bullied or forced into joining a union under our workplace relations laws. The member for Parramatta then left the chamber.  - This is a fundamental difference between the Labor Party and us. We believe -  The member for Gorton then left the chamber. 
 - This is a fundamental difference between the coalition and the Labor Party. It is enshrined in the Labor Party's industrial relations policy that every employer has to give a prospective employee an invitation to join the trade union movement when they apply for a job. That is Labor Party policy. It is written and enshrined in their policy that they issue an information statement to any new employee to give them an invitation to join the trade union movement. On the weekend, the Leader of the Opposition said that union bosses are just another voice. He declared on Sunday - it was classic Kev - that union bosses could 'jump in the lake' if they had a problem with what he had to say. You can imagine Kevin Reynolds and Joe McDonald shaking in their jackboots as Kevin Rudd says to them -  - As the Leader of the Opposition says, 'I'm going to force you to jump in the lake if you don't agree with what I have to say.' They would be shaking in their boots. You would even have Joe McDonald's braces pop up - 'No ticket, no start' and away they go.You would have thought that, at the same time as the Leader of the Opposition saying he was not going to be controlled by the union bosses, he would have stood up for one of his senators that was being knifed in the Senate. I picked up the Australian and the Age and they were a great read. In the Age Senator Linda Kirk, who has only been a Labor Senator for South Australia for a short period of time, said:The trade union vote is such that they can get up their own ..._            _            _If you don't have a good trade union base, it is impossible to get into a winnable position, even with branch support - in the Labor Party. Senator Kirk was disendorsed by the Labor Party because Joe de Bruyn did not like what she had to say. She says in the Australian today:Joe de Bruyn said that if I did not vote against the stem-cell legislation I could not expect support from the union for preselection.He singled me out ... I wasn't prepared to toe the union line._            _            _Yes, I have lived by the union and died by the union.I went back to the Leader of the Opposition's interview on the Sunday program when he was asked about a shoppies union official, Mr Farrell, who was coming into replace Senator Kirk. He said:He's a very effective, very effective person who will actually bring a lot of experience and a lot of balance also in to the ranks of the Parliamentary Labor Party ...Balance! Another union official coming into the Labor Party in the Senate to deliver balance! I thought to myself, 'Hang on, how many senators from South Australia representing the Labor Party are former trade union officials?' Sixty per cent. This takes it up to 80 per cent. If that is balance in the way the Leader of the Opposition says he wants balance, there is no room for any dissenting voice from the trade union bosses when it comes to Labor Party preselection. We should not forget, and the Australian people will not forget. Every member of the parliamentary Labor Party is a member of the trade union movement and now they are getting rid of people of conscience and replacing them with more union bosses so that they can toe the union line.</DOC>

 - I can confirm that the figure I have given - and the precise figure is $5,186.78 - includes all of the additional costs of the function. The food and beverage served at the function was purchased separately for the function; existing stock was not used. There was an audiovisual cost for the function, and this was billed directly to the Liberal Party. The situation is that all of the additional costs -  - Obviously any additional staff required are included in the cost, and that is a figure of $829.57. Clearly the existing staff would have been on duty and paid anyway, so that is not part of it. I know that the Labor Party find the amount involved rather low, but perhaps their lifestyle is a little more extravagant than mine.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Wakefield for his question. I appreciate just how concerned he is about this issue and I am grateful for the representations he has made to me on this topic. Macular degeneration is the principal cause of blindness in this country. It affects about 130,000 Australians and every year about 17,000 new patients are diagnosed with what is called wet age-related macular degeneration. But now there is hope for these people. A new drug, Lucentis, can arrest and, in some cases, even reverse the progress of this disease in about 80 per cent of patients. Last week the government announced that Lucentis would be listed on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme from 1 August. This will cost $630 million over the forward estimates period, but it is worth it because it enables these people to continue to lead fully active lives and to remain fully involved members of the community - people like Bill Milton, of Two Wells in the electorate of Wakefield, who has already explained to his local member just how beneficial this drug has been to him. Of course, being an outstanding local member, the member for Wakefield has passed that on to me.I would like to thank the officials of the Therapeutic Goods Administration and of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee for the expeditious way in which this matter has been handled. But I do say to everyone who has welcomed this listing that the government can only afford to put new drugs like this on the PBS because we have a strong economy. The listing of drugs like Lucentis is the social dividend of a strong economy. I say this in conclusion: if you cannot trust people to run the economy, you certainly cannot trust them to run a health system either.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Gilmore for her particular interest in this subject. She has previously had members of Anglicare try to establish a specific facility in Nowra. Through her, I thank them for the efforts they have made. She, along with most members of this House, would probably be aware that the current disability agreement between the Commonwealth, the states and the territories expires on 30 June - just on three weeks from today. She would be interested to know that the Commonwealth currently spends about $12.8 billion every year on disability services. That includes the disability support pension and other payments, support to carers through the carer allowance and carer payment, respite, and also through specific initiatives such as for the younger people in nursing homes, trying to get young people out of inappropriate care - that is, aged-care facilities - and putting them into places where they can have a better quality of life.I had a normal meeting with all of the other ministerial colleagues in Brisbane on 3 April. At that meeting I confirmed that the Commonwealth was very keen to enter into another Commonwealth state disability agreement for another five-year period. We offered the same amount, plus $400 million worth of indexation at that time. There were four parameters that we put around that new agreement. They were ensuring (1) that Indigenous Australians had access to disability services, (2) that the unmet need for supported accommodation was acknowledged and that there was a plan going forward to address it, (3) that we would have external validation of services - and I ask the House: would anyone realistically accept today, in aged care or child care, there not being external validation of those services? Yet today most state run supported accommodation for our most vulnerable in society does not have any form of external validation and we in the Commonwealth believe that that is an absolute necessity. And (4) we also require real transparency and real accountability by the states.Having put that offer on the table on 3 April I then made a separate offer, which the cabinet had authorised me to take forward, and that was that each state and territory collectively or individually come forward to the Commonwealth with a plan to meet the unmet need for supported quality accommodation places and that the Commonwealth would match it dollar for dollar. In other words, every dollar the state puts in the Commonwealth will match dollar for dollar.What happened at that meeting was quite disgraceful. All Labor state and territory ministers briefly stopped the meeting, adjourned outside, caucused, came back in, read from a written statement and declared the meeting closed without further discussion. I subsequently wrote to state and territory ministers again outlining the Commonwealth's generous offer of a dollar for dollar proposal to meet unmet needs. I gave them until 8 June. On 7 June I received a complete offer from the ACT, and I thank them for that. The Commonwealth is now considering that offer. I then received a letter, jointly signed by all other state and territory ministers, giving a commitment that they would consider it by 30 June and that they expect to be able to provide details of their capacity to respond. That is the most bureaucratic mumbo-jumbo, gobbledygook, you will ever get. There was no commitment of one dollar, no commitment of one place for additional supported accommodation for our most vulnerable in society. That is simply not good enough.If you think that this is just the Commonwealth government, let me read to you from a letter I received on 22 January from Minister Della Bosca, then representing all state and territory disability ministers. He states:We are asking the Commonwealth to match our investment in Australian families. We are of the view that a multi-lateral, matched funding strategy similar to that of the Young People in Residential Aged Care and Older Carers Respite initiatives will make a real difference.That is exactly what the Commonwealth put on the table, and as of today not one state and only one territory - the ACT - has responded. This is not good enough for the disabled, who are the most vulnerable in our society. The Howard government will stand by these people.  We ask those opposite to call on their state colleagues to start doing something positive about meeting the unmet needs of our disabilities groups in Australia.</DOC>

 - It was not a fundraiser - and you know that. Let me very simply tell you why: the amount of up to $8,000 was a fee charged to business observers for attending the federal council of the Liberal Party, which I am told is approximately the same as the top charge made for the Labor Party federal conference. -  - Of course you did not. This demonstrates that the basis of your claim is completely wrong. - I have indicated that the costs are $5,186.78 - that is, food $2,128.50, beverages $1,476.52, casual staff $829.57 and hire charges $752.19, making a total of $5,186.78.

 - I thank the member for Braddon for his question and for his very strong support for the 10,500 small businesses that he has in his electorate. Those small businesses understand and appreciate the value that the Howard government has delivered - a strong economy, low interest rates and a flexible workplace. That has been reflected in the latest Sensis business index, which has small business increasing their support for the Howard government by 14 per cent. That is the second highest level ever. The only level that was ever higher was when the Howard government was elected. It is no wonder that small business appreciate this. In fact, they nominated that it has been stable economic management that they have most appreciated. Obviously the opposition is not interested at all in small business. - They certainly are not. - Not only did this survey indicate the very strong level of support for the Howard government - which of course has led to increased confidence by small business people to employ more people, enabling them to grow their businesses and give jobs to more people - but also it indicated a very real concern by small business about the Rudd alternative, which they know is simply doing the union bidding. They are right in their concerns. They know that the Rudd alternative -  - I was actually speaking about the Rudd alternative, Mr Speaker. - Small business is very concerned not just about the Leader of the Opposition but about the entire policy of the opposition because it knows that every single one of those sitting opposite will do the bidding of the unions before they will ever consider the needs and aspirations of small business people. Small business understands that the opposition's alternative is to reinstate unfair dismissal and to get rid of AWAs. Small business does not want the clock wound back to the 1970s alternative. It understands that the Howard government has delivered and will continue to deliver in future.</DOC>

 - Let me say to the Leader of the Opposition that we would be delighted to have an inquiry into matters affecting older Australians. I can assure the Leader of the Opposition that the government would be very happy to see a Senate inquiry. It is, of course, for both of us to leave it to our peers in another place to decide these matters, but we certainly have no objection.It would allow, for example, the government and other sections of the community to review many of the measures that have been introduced by this government to assist older Australians. It would allow us to remind the opposition and the general public that, from 1 July this year, the most spectacular and beneficial change to superannuation in Australia ever will occur, to the benefit of Australians over the age of 60 - which many would not regard as particularly old, so let us say Australians of mature middle years - but that is only the half of it.In September of this year, there will be an effective halving of the assets test on the aged pension. You will remember that the assets test was brought in for the first time in 1983 by the Hawke government, and effectively this is the first major revision and major expansion of the eligibility criteria applying to the assets test. We could remind the opposition that it was this government that legislated to ensure that the pension was maintained at 25 per cent of male total average weekly earnings as well as indexed to inflation.We could talk about the introduction of the senior Australians tax offset; the pension bonus scheme; the utilities allowance; the bonus payments to older Australians and carers in recent budgets, including in this year's budget; and the relaxation of the assets test for the age pension by increasing the maximum amount of private land attached to the principal place of residence that is exempt from the assets test. We could also remind the opposition that it opposed the introduction of the Medicare safety net, which is of enormous benefit to older Australians. I remind the Leader of the Opposition that 80 per cent of all medical and pharmaceutical costs are run up by older Australians.Can I just say to the Leader of the Opposition that, since March 1996, single and partnered pensions have increased by over 49 per cent, which is an increase of 19 per cent in real terms. Let me also remind him that 85 per cent of people over age pension age qualify for an Australian government concession card - that is, the Commonwealth seniors health card, the pensioner concession card or the health card.I could go on, but let me say that the government will welcome this inquiry. It believes that it has consistently, over the last 11 years, introduced measures to ease the cost pressures on older Australians. I do not pretend for a moment that everything that could be done has been done, but I do believe that older Australians, in recognition that older generations have contributed enormously to the legacy which is the modern Australia, deserve our concern, our compassion and our respect. The government has done its best over the last 11 years to demonstrate that concern, compassion and respect. We are not ashamed of what we have done. We have not been perfect and there is more to be done, but let me say to older Australians that the stability, the low inflation, the good economic times, the alterations, the dividend imputation credits and all the other things that have been brought in as part of tax reform have all worked to the great benefit of older Australians and we will be very happy to talk about our record before the Senate inquiry.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for La Trobe for his question. Let me note, in thanking the member for La Trobe, that in March 1996 unemployment in La Trobe was 6.2 per cent. I am now happy to report it is only 3.4 per cent. One of the reasons unemployment in La Trobe is lower is that this government has reformed Australia's industrial relations system. One of the reasons unemployment in La Trobe would go up if a Labor government were elected at the end of this year is that the Labor Party, under pressure from the union movement, would destroy the industrial relations reforms of the last 11 years.What is really at stake when you talk about industrial relations in this country is the maintenance of a 33-year low in unemployment. If you go through the last 11 years and look at the three episodes of industrial relations reform - in 1996, in 1998 with the waterfront and again in 2006 - all of those reforms contributed enormously to reducing Australia's unemployment level. We now have the lowest unemployment rate in 33 years. We have seen real wages rise by 20.8 per cent since 1996, compared to a reduction of 1.8 per cent when the unions last ran Australia under the Hawke and Keating Labor governments.Incredibly enough, despite this record, and despite the fact that we now have fewer strikes in Australia than at any time since 1913 - despite all those facts - the union movement is insisting that if Labor wins the next election then the industrial relations reforms that have contributed so much to reducing unemployment must be reversed. I cannot think of anything more calculated to damage the confidence of the small business sector of Australia, which employs so many people, than the determination of the Labor Party, at the behest of the union movement, to abolish the unfair dismissal changes that we brought in 15 months ago. Those unfair dismissal changes have literally emboldened small business to take on more staff. There can be no other explanation for the extraordinary statistic that tells us that, in the last year, the number of long-term unemployed in this country has fallen by 23 per cent, and the number of long-term unemployed - let me tell the Leader of the Opposition - is now at its lowest level since the statistic first began to be compiled more than 20 years ago. This is a result of small business knowing that it is free from the trauma of dealing with unreasonable, unfair dismissal laws.But the union movement wants to change all of that. A document has come into my possession, which is euphemistically entitled Federal election 2007: union political strategy manual 6 steps. That is the description of it. The real description is: this is the dirty tricks manual which is designed -  - Oh, the sound effects man - he knows all about dirty tracks manuals produced by the union movement. He is right on cue - a former president of the ACTU. I wonder how many more of them we are going to hear from today. Mr Speaker, if you think I exaggerate and if you think I am being unfair to the trade union movement of Australia by calling this a dirty tracks manual, let me refer to page 46. This is a manual which is given to union activists who are going out and ringing up fellow unionists and knocking on their doors. Can you image the poor unionist in Western Australia who has got Kevin Reynolds knocking on his door - or Joe McDonald knocking or bashing the door down? Can you imagine how that person might feel? But if you think I am exaggerating any of this, on page 46 the instruction is given as to how to talk to your fellow unionists. After advising the union member - that is, the person doing the talking - to totally misrepresent the intent and the operation of the government's law, there is a request at the bottom of this instruction that says - and listen very carefully to this:Don't Read Out (Minimum wage, 4 weeks annual leave ... 10 Sick/carer's leave; 38 hour week; Unpaid parental leave)In other words, what this manual does is to exhort the union canvassers to lie about the government's policy. It warns the unions: 'Don't tell the truth about our policy, don't tell the unionist that you are actually entitled to a guaranteed minimum wage, don't talk about a 38-hour week, don't talk about four weeks annual leave, don't talk about sick leave or carers leave and don't talk about parental leave, because the poor unionist might actually think that's not a bad deal, so the last thing you want to do is to tell the truth about the government's policy.'This document is a dirty tricks manual, and it is calculated, through techniques of misrepresentation, push polling and the like, to achieve one purpose, and that is to install the Leader of the Opposition as Prime Minister. The union movement is not interested in workers; it is interested in power for union bosses, and this document, this manual, is all about achieving that objective, and the puppet along the way is going to be the Leader of the Opposition.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Stirling. I can inform him that, although the Westpac index showed a modest fall in consumer sentiment in June, that was from the highest level ever recorded. The consumer sentiment index is still 17 per cent higher than at the same time last year, which is good news for consumers. In addition, the Sensis consumer sentiment report for the month of June showed that consumer confidence was at a net balance of 59 points - almost 20 points higher than at the same time last year. So consumers are confident, employment is strong, the economy is growing and more Australians are in work than ever before. But all of that could be at risk if we have a puppet government elected to do the bidding of the ACTU, by changing industrial relations in this country, setting off unsustainable wage demands and reintroducing unfair dismissal laws. This is a very real threat to the Australian economy. The Australian economy is finely tuned, finally calibrated - and, if the ACTU gets itself back in the driving seat of this formula 1 car, it will be heading to a crash as sure as night follows day.I have come into possession of the ACTU's manual on how it intends to get itself back in the driving seat of the Australian economy by installing a puppet Labor leadership on its behalf. As the Prime Minister said, this is an ACTU manual on how to engage in dirty tricks - a manual which has been endorsed by none other than the Leader of the Opposition. Get a load of this. The ACTU says that union leaders have to make phone calls as follows:In the first call, the aim is to educate, inform and derive a profile of the member which can be used to tailor future calls. The follow-up call will use this information to raise issues that we know will concern the member.I bet you know how to concern the member when you make the follow-up call! The manual then encourages Labor apparatchiks and unionists to penetrate and use community groups for this campaign. The ACTU recommends entering homes with churches and faith groups so that they can use those groups for the industrial campaign. I would warn Australians of this: the next time you hear your doorbell ring on a Saturday morning, do not answer the door, because it could well be elder Dean Mighell of the church of latter day unionists who has come around to tell you about your rights at work.But it is not only about church groups and community groups; get a load of this: Sharan Burrow was on radio 3AW this morning saying, 'We're going to work in sporting areas and volunteer organisations like Meals on Wheels.' So the ACTU is now going to penetrate Meals on Wheels so that it can get inside people's houses and advise them on how to vote. So you will hear the doorbell ring and then: 'Sharan Burrow, Meals on Wheels, here. I'd just like to come in and talk to you about the ACTU campaign.' That the ACTU would try to penetrate these groups to get inside people's homes to run its agenda shows not only complete and utter disrespect for churches and community groups but also a threatening attitude to Australians in their homes.A former Prime Minister claimed on Lateline not so long ago that he had to get the ACTU in a headlock. With modern Labor, it is the ACTU that has the headlock - it has a headlock on Kevin Rudd, the Leader of the Opposition. He is the frontman that is being put up by people who are much more aggressive and much more threatening than him because they want a patsy in the Lodge to run their agenda. The decent people of Australia do not deserve to be treated like this and they do not deserve this deceitful campaign from the ACTU.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hasluck for his question. It is not surprising that he should demonstrate an interest in these matters. Not only does he have a very distinguished background in small business and an understanding of the sorts of economic policies that are needed for small business to flourish in Australia, but also he represents an electorate where the level of unemployment in March 1996 was 7.4 per cent and is now only 3.5 per cent. It is precisely an electorate like this - electorates like Hasluck, Stirling and other electorates in Western Australia - where the economic policies of this government have delivered such outstanding benefits over the last few years. The member for Hasluck asked me about the level of industrial disputes. I can inform him -  - The March quarter industrial dispute figures were released last week by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, and they show the lowest level of industrial disputes ever recorded in Australia. I had previously been saying that they were the lowest since the year before the Great War broke out. They are in fact the lowest level ever recorded in Australia. That should be something of universal pride and universal satisfaction around the country. The figure is 0.8 working days lost per thousand employees. These figures have been kept since before World War I. In the March quarter, the construction industry recorded only 1.5 working days lost per thousand employees, and that compares with 32.8 per thousand employees. That is going from an unacceptably high level in that industry to virtually zero. Nobody can argue the veracity of these figures. Nobody on the other side can suggest that these figures are wrong. Is anybody on the other side saying that this is a bad development? Is anybody pretending that this is something they do not want?In the face of the sounds of silence from other side, I might ask a rhetorical question: why on earth do you have a policy that would bring all of this to an end? That is essentially what the Labor Party are on about. These figures are further proof that the government's workplace reforms have helped to keep the economy strong, and there is an enormous risk if the instructions contained in the dirty tricks manual - to which I have referred and the Treasurer has referred - are successful. Let there be no doubt: the goal of the ACTU is to restore the power of union bosses in this country. It is not to get a lower level of industrial disputes, because you cannot really get any lower than the figures I have mentioned. It is not to get a lower level of unemployment, because when Labor were last in office, unemployment was double what it is now. It is not to get higher real wage growth, because under us real wages have gone up by 20 per cent. The last time the unions ran the country, in the Hawke-Keating years, real wages actually went backwards. What the union movement wants is what Greg Combet candidly admitted when he addressed that rally in Adelaide. He said, 'There was a time when the unions ran Australia, and it would be a good idea if those days were returned.'They are using the present Leader of the Opposition. He is the proxy for the trade union movement. He is the patsy, the proxy, the delegate, the surrogate, of the union movement in order to achieve these objectives. But every aspect of Labor Party industrial relations policy is dictated by the union movement. The language is even the same. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition has described the treatment of people under the building industry commission as akin to the treatment of terrorists. I thought that was original language, but I find in fact, when I have a look at the dirty tricks manual, that that is language that is employed in the dirty tricks manual. You go through that document again and again and you find a similarity of language. What this document reveals is the ruthless determination of the union bosses of this country to use deceit, dishonesty and misrepresentation to achieve their objective, and that is to run Australia again, through the courtesy of the puppet Leader of the Opposition.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Riverina for her question. The member for Riverina would be aware that the government, over the 10-year period from 2004 to 2014, will invest $38 billion in Australia's land transport programs - $38 billion into the road and rail networks across Australia - including some significant projects in the member for Riverina's electorate, particularly on that critical arterial link between Melbourne and Sydney, the Hume Highway, a very important piece of infrastructure.That could all be put at risk if there were to be a Labor government elected in this country this year. You may ask why, Mr Speaker. First of all, the poor economic management background of a Labor government would indicate that there would not be $38 billion left available. They would go and spend it elsewhere. But, more importantly, the representatives of the union movement would come back into control of those construction sites. Mr Speaker, you would be well aware that there has been a Royal Commission into the Building and Construction Industry in Australia, and that royal commission indicated that there was a cost element of 20 per cent for the intimidation and involvement of the union movement in construction across Australia - so, of every dollar that the Labor Party would spend on construction, only 80c would end up on the roads, because the rest would be frittered away with the intimidation by the union movement.Mr Speaker, you may ask, 'How is that so?' Before the royal commission into the construction industry was held, we were participating, with the New South Wales government, in projects on the Pacific Highway on the North Coast of New South Wales. There happened to be a company from my electorate that won a contract on a project called Tandy's Lane, on the Pacific Highway, that involved duplicating 5.5 kilometres of the highway north of Ballina. Hackett Laboratory Services won a tender for soil and concrete and environmental testing of that site. The company paid award wages and superannuation to its employees. The CFMEU entered the workplace and demanded that it sign a union based enterprise bargaining agreement that it could not afford, demanded that it become a closed shop - no ticket, no start - and demanded that it switch its superannuation payments across to the union super fund.Prior to the building and construction industry royal commission of inquiry and the changes in that industry, that is what used to happen. When that company refused to accede to the demands of the CFMEU, the union took industrial action and pressured the prime contractor to throw that contractor off the site. The CFMEU almost sent that small business broke because of the way that they wanted to intimidate and control that workplace. That is what the union movement wants. That is why they are running this campaign, that is why they are putting together this strategy: so that they can continue to enter the workplace - in the way they always used to in this country under Labor governments - intimidate bosses, cost jobs, put the cost of jobs up and put the cost of contracts up. That is the strategy.On page 8 of this strategy manual from the ACTU it says, 'Members who are still undecided at the time of the election will need to be visited at home.' We know what that means, because they visited the workplace of this small business on a construction site and nearly put them out of business. They will come knocking on the door of those members, and they will not be there to ask, 'How are the kids and the grandkids?' They will be there to demand their vote and to run their strategy. Make no mistake, Mr Speaker, this campaign is about getting the unions back in control of Australia, getting them back in every workplace in Australia. The unions will be in charge of this country, not an ALP government led by the member for Griffith.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Bonner. I can say without a shadow of a doubt that he is the best member of parliament that Bonner has ever had. - One of the highest priorities of this government has been helping families, because we believe that there is no more important institution in Australian society than the family, which is the natural unit for raising children and preparing them for life and building our future as a society and a country. That is why this government has been cutting income taxes and increasing family benefits. In 2007-08, a single income family with two children on average weekly ordinary time earnings will have a disposable income in real terms 34.6 per cent higher than they had in 1996. A big part of that has been tax cuts. The government has cut all tax rates and raised the thresholds at which they apply.A very strange document was given out in a clandestine way yesterday. It was a document prepared by the member for Lilley, which he apparently distributed to his MPs but did not put on the website and did not put out publicly. I had to purloin a very badly photocopied copy - and I would ask members of the media, if they have a better copy, whether they could give it to me in due course. It was not put out publicly. Normally, when you put out an expose on the government you put it out for the world to see, because it is supposed to be an expose. I have never in my life before heard of a secret expose - but then we have never had someone like the member for Lilley before, have we?One of the alleged myths - according to this secret expose - that I am going on about is my claim that Labor does not have a tax policy. The secret expose says that Labor does have a tax policy: 'In May 2005, Labor outlined its alternative tax plan.' Have a think about that date of May 2005. I had to think about that myself. What happened in May 2005? I can tell you this: the member for Brand was the Leader of the Opposition. This is a pre-Ruddite tax policy. Apparently, it still stands, because it is a myth to claim that Labor does not have a tax policy when it has a tax policy and it was released in May 2005. One of the things that is apparently in this policy is that the 30c rate should cut in from $26,400. In fact, it cuts in from $30,000, so if this policy stands that would be putting tax up for people earning between $26,000 and $30,000. If this policy still stands, the threshold for the 42c rate should be raised to $67,000. There is no 42c rate. The 42c rate has been abolished. There is a 40c rate. If this policy stands, the 47c rate should go up to $100,000. There is no 47c rate. There is a 45c rate, and it cuts in not at $100,000 but at $150,000 and soon will cut in at $180,000. This is apparently the tax policy that still stands. The only way in which it could be interpreted is that the Labor Party will raise rates and lower thresholds.No wonder the heads are down on the back bench, because this document has been circulated in all seriousness to members of the ALP. You might get away with this stuff at a local branch meeting. But in the court of public opinion, where taxes count and mean something, you cannot go on with this rubbish; you have to actually have an economic policy. I quote:When the history of this parliament, this nation and this century is written, 30 June 1999 will be recorded as a day of fundamental injustice - an injustice which is real, an injustice which is not simply conjured up by the fleeting rhetoric of politicians. It will be recorded as the day when the social compact that has governed this nation for the last 100 years was torn up.Who said those words? - No, it was not Churchill. - No, it was not Roosevelt. - No, it was not Kennedy. - It was not the Dalai Lama. This was said in the parliament - that this was not 'fleeting rhetoric', that this was 'a day of fundamental injustice'. Who said those words? None other than the Leader of the Opposition, the economic conservative. The 'day of fundamental injustice' was when we swept away wholesale sales tax, financial institutions duty, bank account debits tax, stamp duties on share transactions, when we cut income tax rates, when we increased thresholds - that was 'a day of fundamental injustice'. Now he says it is a myth to claim that Labor has no tax policy because the tax policy is the Beazley tax policy of 2005. When you are getting ready, seriously, to engage in a policy discussion, the Australian people are entitled to look at it and know what it means, but this is not an opposition that is anywhere near that point.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Blair for his question and note that the unemployment rate in Blair is down to five per cent. I can inform the House that under our workplace relations system employees of state Labor governments, such as nurses and teachers, remain employees of the state, and nobody is forcing them to change from the state system to the federal system. That makes a lie of the claims by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and the union bosses that somehow we have a secret plan. There are a lot of secret plans. I am aware of the dirty tricks book. Mine is a little bit more fun than everyone else's. I have been having a good look at it. In one of the sections of the dirty tricks book, when it comes to training union delegates it says, 'Some organisations such as the Rail, Tram and Bus Union in New South Wales, which has 13,000 bus drivers, are bringing their delegates in for a one-day course run by the ACTU on doorknocking.' No wonder there are 1,500 bus services cancelled a week in New South Wales. All the bus drivers are out training how to doorknock for the Labor Party.I thought: what would they take when they are doorknocking? So I come to page 40 of the dirty tricks manual. Get a load of this. Anyone who has ever doorknocked will find this interesting. 'The suggested checklist for doorknocking kits: a nametag for volunteers, script, voter enrolment forms, citizenship forms, clipboards, pens, Your Rights at Work pamphlets, Your Rights at Work network information, local maps, public toilet listing, evaluation forms, contact details, contact details of the other coordinators.'These poor buggers are going and knocking on the door. Obviously they left the knuckledusters and the hammer and sickle out of the backpack. Who would be capable of this? Kevin Reynolds from the CFMEU comes doorknocking. You can imagine: he goes into the nursing home and doorknocks on grandma's door. Imagine seeing Kevin Reynolds there with his Che Guevara T-shirt or Joe McDonald from the CFMEU taking care of people in the hospital with his 'no ticket no start' braces and his backpack with a hammer and sickle. And of course, as the Treasurer outlined, there is Dean Mighell, elder Mighell from the ETU in Melbourne. You can imagine him delivering Meals on Wheels. You can imagine the script as he is delivering Meals on Wheels: 'Here, love, my name is expletive Dean. I am from the expletive ETU. Here is your expletive steak and three vegies, and if you do not vote for Kevin expletive Rudd I am not going to give you your expletive meal.' - The expletive Leader of the Opposition. That is what the Dean Mighell tagline is. Mr Speaker, we could laugh about it if it were not so serious. It is a fact that this is the Labor Party root and branch. This is what they are about. They are about the interests of the union bosses - they are not about the workers of Australia.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Lindsay for her question and I make the point that, while members opposite are trawling through the Kirribilli House trash cans, this government is getting on with the job of delivering better services to the people of Australia. Let me make this point: you cannot enjoy the benefits of economic reform without the reform. We do not have 3.8 per cent economic growth and 4.2 per cent unemployment by accident. We have those great results in part because of the workplace relations policies of the Howard government. I say to the little conclave opposite: by all means change back to the policies of the former government, but you cannot have those policies without also having those consequences, which were declining real wages and one million people unemployed.We have heard today about the ACTU's dirty tricks manual. On Radio National this morning the boss of the nurses union was asked: 'Will your membership be recruited as part of that marginal seat campaigning?' Jill Iliffe said, 'I would imagine so.' So not only do you have the midnight knock from Kevin Reynolds and Joe McDonald but now you have the politicisation of every hospital. In fact, the ACTU's dirty tricks manual cited as a case study what was done at Nepean Hospital in the electorate of Lindsay, and the New South Wales Nurses Association spent $1.2 million trying to secure the re-election of the Iemma government. So if the ACTU has its way, every hospital will not be a care centre; it will be a centre for political activism. Patients will get indoctrination with their medication. Patients will be offered brainwashing with standard health care at the bedside. No wonder the elective surgery lists are blowing out so badly in New South Wales hospitals; it is because the nurses are all at ACTU indoctrination lessons.Also on Radio National this morning, the leader of the nurses union was asked about claims that the government has some secret plan to force nurses onto AWAs. She was asked: 'Has that spectre been raised as far as your union knows?' Jill Iliffe said, 'Yes, it has. And it has been mentioned, certainly by state premiers, that that has been mooted by the federal government.' I have a question for Jill Iliffe, who I assume is a truthful person: which premier said it to her? Because no premier has been told that. I make three points. First of all, premiers should not lie about government policy. Second, union officials should not retell lies that have been told to them by premiers. And, third and most fundamentally, ACTU Labor should not try to politicise our hospitals and the nursing profession. Hospitals are too important to the people of this country to be contaminated by party political point-scoring. Nursing is an honourable profession and the nurses of Australia should not allow themselves to be duped in a grubby political campaign which is ultimately being orchestrated by the ACTU for the benefit of the pathetic puppet sitting in the seat opposite.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kingston for his question. I know that the unemployment rate in Kingston in 1996 was 11.6 per cent. It has come down to 6.8 per cent. It is still too high, but it has come down by nearly five percentage points, and I think that is good for the people of Kingston.I am aware of this extensive, comprehensive, dirty tricks manual. I am also aware that the Leader of the Opposition, in the Australian on 10 February this year said: ·               The parliamentary party determines the alternative policy for the next election, not the ACTU.The Deputy Leader of the Opposition said, on 22 April:The ACTU doesn't tell Labor what to do ... this is not about the ACTU and what they want.I thought very carefully about those words, 'The ACTU doesn't tell Labor what to do.' I had a look at a few of the speeches of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and I compared them to what is in the ACTU's dirty tricks manual, and it was very interesting. Example No. 1 comes from the dirty tricks manual, 28 April:An AWA can be a condition of the job or the condition of a promotion.Gillard:You sign or you don't get the job. You sign or you don't get the promotion.Example No. 2, from the ACTU manual -  
Opposition members - Ha, ha! - Don't laugh too hard. ACTU manual example No. 2:If you work in a company with fewer than 100 employees, you can be sacked and your employer doesn't have to give you a reason.The Deputy Leader of the Opposition said on 2TM:They go to work, particularly in businesses of less than 100 people, not knowing if they are going to be dismissed that day because they can be dismissed for any reason.Example No. 3:These laws affect workers' take-home pay. They affect their conditions and job security.Gillard -  - Sorry; the Deputy Leader of the Opposition said:Laws have cut the take-home pay, conditions and job security of working Australians.Example No. 4 - the ACTU political manual says:The resource boom has been driving our economy.The Deputy Leader of the Opposition says:What's driving economic growth in this country is the resources boom.Example No. 5 is about the ABCC, the watchdog that has helped to deliver the lowest ever level of industrial disputation on construction sites. The ACTU manual says:The ABCC is treating the union representatives as worse than terrorists.The Deputy Leader of the Opposition says:The ABCC is interrogating people as if they were terrorists.This document and the words of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition have an uncanny similarity. It was Paul Keating, wasn't it, who said that the Labor Party does not get out of bed unless a focus group tells them which side to get out of? This is the Labor Party way. The trade union movement's manual says it all. Every word uttered by a whole lot of members - which we will remind members of over the next few weeks - comes out of this manual. Do you know what? When it comes down to it, the Leader of the Opposition is a patsy for the union bosses. He is wholly beholden to the union bosses. The union bosses are only interested in their power. They have no interest in the workers of Australia.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Canning for his question. I know that he is concerned about the issue of terrorism. I am delighted to tell the House that the Indonesian authorities captured the Jemaah Islamiah leader Abu Dujana and others over the weekend. It is a great achievement by the Indonesian authorities. I think they are doing an outstanding job in combating terrorism. They deserve to be congratulated on their success, their energy and their hard work. In a country which suffered from 88 deaths in the Bali bombing, and whose embassy has subsequently been attacked by terrorists, they deserve to be properly acknowledged. We work very closely with the Indonesian authorities in the area of counterterrorism. The Australian Federal Police, our diplomats and our intelligence agencies have a very good relationship with them and this is, I know, very much appreciated by the Indonesians. In March the Indonesian police seized a significant cache of Jemaah Islamiah weapons and explosives from a house in Jogjakarta. They then detained a number of suspects. The Indonesians have successfully prosecuted over 180 individuals for terrorism related offences. The partnerships Australia has developed with countries like Indonesia, in particular, and the Philippines in the area of counterterrorism are proving to be very successful.There is another approach. There is the Labor Party approach - they say they would continue the fight against terrorism. There is no question about their being opposed to terrorism, and no doubt they would use the Liberal multilateralist model to do so. I noticed on 4 May a press release from the Opposition spokesman on foreign affairs. He said that the international crisis group report into Jemaah Islamiah demonstrated 'a pressing need for Australia to refocus our security resources in our region' - as if we were not focusing enormous resources in our region. That same opposition, though, pledged through its finance spokesman to cut resources to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, resources that help fight terrorism and help provide consular assistance to Australians. So we have the Leader of the Opposition, when he was the opposition spokesman, saying that the government does not do enough in the area of counterterrorism, but in a press release issued on 2 March we have the opposition spokesman on finance saying that he had a whole list of cuts that Labor would make.It is worth while for people to look at these cuts because one of the cuts was to wind back, by $31.3 million, budget increases in 2006-07 that were provided to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. The bulk of that money is being spent on improved efforts by DFAT in the area of counterterrorism and a stronger consular and crisis response. So Labor say, 'We're going to be liberal multilateralists,' and presumably contracting this sort of work out now to the United Nations so that they can save the money that we put into bilateral efforts through the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.This government has fought terrorism, and fought it hard. We have shown a great determination to confront terrorism. In South-East Asia in particular, in our immediate neighbourhood, which the Labor Party says is our priority - of course our neighbourhood is our priority - we are seeing very successful results, including from the investment of the Australian government. What Labor wants to do is to cut funding to that area, reduce those resources and contract out counterterrorism to liberal multilateralism. Mr Speaker, I ask you!</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Ryan for his question. He has a great capacity to represent well the people in his electorate who are on middle and lower incomes, as well as higher income earners. In fact, in the 2005-06 financial year, 8,189 people in the Ryan electorate received up to $3,000 as their co-contribution payment from the Howard government for their contribution of up to a $1,000 after-tax payment into their superannuation fund.That builds on the policy of the Howard government which meant that, for 972,000 Australians who made a contribution into their superannuation fund in the financial year 2005-06, and because of the good economic management that we have enjoyed over the last 11 years, they will receive up to $3,000 into their superannuation. For low- and middle-income earners, in particular for those who are on incomes under $28,000 a year, that will have an incredibly compounding benefit into retirement.For this government, when we talk about good, sound economic management over the last 11 years, we are talking about delivering better retirement incomes for older Australians. We are talking about delivering better retirement outcomes for younger Australians. We have created a system that could very easily be undone by the Australian Labor Party if they were elected at the end of this year and allowed the union movement to run this country again. If the union movement were in charge of this country again, if they run the businesses of this country into the ground again, if they increase unemployment, if they put upward pressure on inflation, that will mean bad outcomes not just for Australian families but for Australian retirees as well.This government has worked hard to manage the Australian economy well so that we can support older Australians into their retirement. We do not want that hard work undone if the union movement get back in control of this country. They would be bad for business and that is bad for returns to people's superannuation funds.I say to all Australians that, as we approach 30 June and you are looking at your superannuation statements, and you are thinking about your financial position, know this: if the union movement gets back in control of this country, of this economy, and runs the economy down again, the returns to people's superannuation funds will be equally diminished.</DOC>

 - I am aware of criticisms that have been made, especially by the Leader of the Opposition since he assumed that position, to the effect that this government has not ensured that the prosperity that this nation has undeniably enjoyed over the last decade has been fairly spread throughout the community. He has even employed that strange word 'brutopia' to describe the policy approach that this government has taken. In Labor's Family Watch Task Force report, which was released on 7 May 2007, this is what the Labor Party had to say, and this is what should be examined against the reality:... the interaction between welfare and the family payments systems is punishing - punishing, would you believe  - middle and low income earners ...It went on to say:The Howard Government has delivered ad-hoc tax and family payment adjustments without addressing crippling effective tax rates for low and middle income families. - It goes on:Far from being 'relaxed and comfortable' after a decade of the Howard Government, Australian families are increasingly anxious about their household finances.The whole basis of the Leader of the Opposition's attack on this government is that Australia has become a rich man's paradise and that the poor men and women of this country have suffered adversely over the last 10 years.The figures released by the ABS yesterday are a stunning repudiation of everything that the Leader of the Opposition has said on this subject. The figures released yesterday provide conclusive proof that the government changes to the tax and income support arrangements are highly progressive, and they are targeted to low-income earners. The figures show that only the top 40 per cent of households pay net tax after cash and in-kind benefits have been taken into account. That is the direct opposite of brutopia. That is a direct repudiation of everything that the Leader of the Opposition and those around him have said. The ABS reports the following conclusions in relation to household incomes in 2003-04: low-income households receive more social benefits in cash and social transfers in kind and pay less taxes than high-income households. It goes on to say that the lowest income household received 44.5 per cent of social benefits in cash, whereas the top 20 per cent of income earners received only 1.7 per cent of social assistance benefits. The payment of taxes - it goes on - on income, and to a lesser extent taxes on production, increases with income. Households in the lowest income groups paid 1.3 per cent of total taxes on income, while households in the highest income groups pay 58.2 per cent.These are not my figures; they are not the Liberal Party's figures; they are the figures of the independent Bureau of Statistics. These figures are a comprehensive vindication of the fairness of the tax and welfare policies of the government over the last 11 years. They demonstrate that this has been a fair government, that this is a government that has looked after the battlers of this country, that this is a government that has seen to it that the great wealth of Australia over the last decade has been evenly distributed - indeed, it has been more than evenly distributed; it has been disproportionately distributed to assist those in the lower income brackets. When you add these figures to the facts that we now have a 33-year low in unemployment, we now have real wages rising at more than 20 per cent over the last 13 years, we have the lowest level of industrial disputes ever, we have paid off a $96 billion debt, we have an economy that is the envy of most of the industrialised world, it represents a picture which is a total repudiation of everything that the Leader of the Opposition has stood for since he assumed that position.</DOC>

The people attending these events were attending as my guests, and I believe it was appropriate that there be a reimbursement for the additional costs over and above the normal costs associated with the operation of the premises.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Moreton for his question. I can inform him that yesterday the Australian Bureau of Statistics released its five-yearly report entitled Government benefits, taxes and household income. Here it is. It is a very interesting snapshot of what the position of households was in 1998-99 compared to what it was in 2003-04. When you read this report you find that after households receive their benefits, principally family tax benefits, only 40 per cent of households pay net tax - that is, they get more back in family tax benefits than they actually pay in tax. When you look across all of the households in Australia, the average total government benefits allocated exceed the taxes they pay by about $15 a week - that is, on average an Australian household does not pay net tax. This is because corporate taxes are allocated to some degree back to family benefits. These findings show that the benefits are greatest to the lowest income earners, who are measured in this case by quintiles - that is, by 20 per cent levels. The interesting thing about this study, which was done between 1998 and 2003, is that it still does not include additional benefits which this government introduced as part of the 2004-05 budget. This is before the increased benefits for families in the 2004-05 budget, including the $600 annual payment per child, which really does exist and which is real money.The other thing that I would like to draw the House's attention to is that because this independent study by the Australian Bureau of Statistics goes from 1998 to 2003, a five-year snapshot, it really does measure Australia - and here is the point - before the 'day of fundamental injustice' and after the 'day of fundamental injustice', because 'fundamental injustice day' was 30 June 1999. Members of this House will remember one of the great speeches that have ever been made in this chamber - on 'fundamental injustice day', 30 June 1999 - when one of the members of this House predicted:It will be recorded as the day when the social compact that has governed this nation for the last 100 years was torn up.Let me record what happened in the five years after 'fundamental injustice day'. Get a load of this! What this shows is that the bottom quintile - that is, the 20 per cent who are on the lowest incomes in Australia - increased their share of final income from 12.7 per cent to 13.2 per cent, that the next quintile increased their share of income from 15 per cent to 15.1 per cent and that the next quintile increased their share of income from 17.8 per cent to 18.1 per cent. Bear in mind that this was a growing pie. When you look at the distribution of that growing pie, the three bottom quintiles - that is, the bottom 60 per cent by income - actually increased their share. That is, as a proportion of growing national income, the 60 per cent of lowest income earners in Australia actually increased their share. That was between 1998 and 2003, and the report still does not take into account the changes which this government put in place in 2004.One would have to remark that the 'fundamental day of injustice' did not turn out too bad after all! The day which was going to be recorded as the 'day when the social compact was broken' actually turned out to be the day when the poor in this country got a much better stake in the country as a result of a government that was determined to undertake reform. I have not heard the author of the 'fundamental day of injustice' speech give an explanation. Has he given an explanation? Is the explanation that he was wrong? Is the explanation that despite his projections things worked out much better and he would like to congratulate the government on doing so, or is his explanation that he just did not understand, that he did not know about economic policy and that he had not done the work to find out? That is my suspicion. My suspicion is that he does not understand the economy, that he has not done the work and that he cannot be trusted with economic policy in this country.</DOC>

 - In reply to the member for Macquarie, I can inform the House that, because of the successful economic policies of this government, real wages for Australians have continued to rise. I am very pleased to confirm to the House that real wages have risen by 20.8 per cent since 1996; whereas they fell by 1.8 per cent in the 13 years that preceded the election of this government. In other words, for 13 years under Labor prime ministers and Labor treasurers, real wages were suppressed in this country. Not only were they suppressed but those prime ministers and treasurers actually boasted to the Australian parliament and to the Australian people about how successful they had been in suppressing real wages. If you think that I am in some way exaggerating the figure of 20.8 per cent, let me remind you that it comes from the Statistician. It does not come from me or the Liberal Party; it comes from the independent Commonwealth Statistician.I noticed in the media this morning that I have an unlikely ally in the case for higher real wages under the Howard government. That unlikely ally is somebody who hopes to become a member of this parliament after the next election, and there is a fair prospect that he will, because he has secured Labor preselection in a very safe Labor seat in the Hunter Valley area. I am talking about Greg Combet. Greg Combet, addressing a union to mark his pending retirement as Secretary of the ACTU, listed his achievements. One of the achievements he listed was a very big increase in real wages over the last 10 years. I thought to myself: 'Why would Greg Combet be wanting to support John Howard and Peter Costello? Why would Greg Combet be saying to the world that real wages had gone up?' I was thinking to myself, 'Has he had a latter-day burst of charity towards some good economic managers, or was he having a swipe at some of his predecessors?' I think maybe it was a bit of a go at the member for Batman, because he presided over the ACTU during periods of low wages growth; maybe it was a go at Bill Kelty. I seem to remember that Bill Kelty and Greg Combet had slightly different reactions to that ABC program about the 1998 waterfront dispute. A government member - Who was the hero? - The hero of that was, of course, Greg Combet. And there was the person who thought he had been made to look a bit of a village idiot in that program. He did not like his appearance. We all have problems when our appearances are depicted, and we should not be too sensitive about that. But I thought it was a very interesting revelation: here was Greg Combet, right on song, saying, 'Yes, real wages have risen over the last 10 years.' In fact, if you look at the last 10 years, they have been very good years for the Australian people. They have been good years for the battlers, they have been good years for low-income earners, but they have been increasingly bad years for union bosses because most of the predictions of union bosses have not come to fruition, and that of course is why the union bosses are so keen to reverse the drift of power away from them and to return the government of this country to those whom they believe it should belong - that is, themselves.When I am asked this question about real wages growth, I am reminded about the importance of productivity. I listened to an interview on AM this morning where the Leader of the Opposition struggled rather pitifully to get on top of the concepts of productivity. Let me tell the Leader of the Opposition that productivity, loosely defined, is output per worker. He did not seem to understand that. He did not seem to know that, in the last national accounts, increases in productivity had been recorded. All he could do was to recite a bit of a mantra about how there was a productivity rise in the 1990s, that there was a long-term productivity trend of 2.3 per cent, that it had fallen away, and that we were all ruined if we did not elect a Labor government. I wondered where I had heard that before. I picked up my now well-thumbed copy of the dirty tricks manual issued by the ACTU, and I looked under 'productivity'. These words came echoing back to me; this is what it had to say:The statistics reveal productivity growth has fallen. Prior to the 1983 accord, productivity was 2.3 per cent. The Labor enterprise bargaining reform facilitated a productivity peak at an annual rate of 3.2 per cent, in contrast to the first Labor cycle. Since Howard's first workplace reform, productivity has fallen back to 2.3 per cent.That is exactly what the Leader of the Opposition was arguing this morning. When he was asked by the interviewer whether he had read the national accounts, he did not answer the question and, when he was asked whether he understood them, he did not answer the question. - Any fair-minded person listening to that interview -  The member for Lilley then left the chamber. 
 - would conclude that the Leader of the Opposition does not know the first thing about productivity. He has made productivity the centrepiece of his economic attack on the government, but today we have revealed statistics that have destroyed his attack on the social policies of the government, and this morning, out of his own mouth, he destroyed his own attack on the economic policies of the government.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Deakin for his question. Many factors can influence productivity in an economy. One, of course, is capital investment. Where you have capital deepening, although it may detract from productivity as it is going on, if it leads to increased capacity and boosts production, after a period of time that can lead to greater output per person. Another thing that can influence productivity, obviously, is the skill of labour. That is why this government is making a huge investment in the education system, particularly the post-secondary education system, because -  - It does have long lead times, yes. If you take children who are, say, starting secondary school and you give them a better education and a better post-secondary education, you will, hopefully, get a pay-off in 10 years in relation to productivity.But there are also some things that can lead to better output per person in the more immediate term. Of course, one of those is a better industrial relations system. If you allow people to so change their patterns of work and to have incentive for higher output, you are going to get better output per person and better output for each individual enterprise. I do not think there is any doubt that a decentralised system of industrial relations will promote productivity. I do not think there would be any credible observer - not the IMF, not the OECD, not the Treasury - that would argue against a decentralised industrial relations system. The only institution I am aware of in this country that argues against it is the trade union movement - because the trade union movement wants to control workplaces. And, of course, its political puppet, the ALP, is forced to go along with the ACTU.Earlier today the Reserve Bank Governor made a speech, and I want to read to the House what he said in relation to the current economic position. He said:Compared with what we expected a year ago, then, growth has turned out to be stronger, employment higher, but underlying inflation a little lower, and wages growth has been steady in the face of unanticipated labour market strength.This is quite a favourable set of outcomes, and should prompt us to ask how it all fits together.So how does this fit together? He went on to say:But my guess at present is that at least some of the explanation for these better-than-expected outcomes probably has to do with changed behaviour in the labour market.Despite, on most counts, the tightest labour market conditions for a generation, growth in most measures of labour costs has remained well disciplined for the past two years or more, after a mild acceleration earlier.Wages are rising quickly in some areas, but quite slowly in others. That is, relative wages are changing, adjusting to the forces at work on the economy, but without, so far at least, a serious inflation of the whole economy - wide cost structure.This looks like a text-book case of adjustment.That is what the Governor of the Reserve Bank said today - 'a text-book case of adjustment'.I have been making the point for a long time that, if your terms of trade are strong and some of your industries are doing well, you can afford increased wages and increased costs in those industries. But what you cannot afford to do is take settlements out of profitable industries and pattern bargain them or piggyback them across to other areas of the economy. That will result in general inflation. That is what has always happened in Australia in the past, and that is why a terms of trade improvement has invariably led to recession, inflation and its consequences in this country.What has kept us going now is that we have a better system of industrial relations. I have compared the economy to a Formula One racing car. You have a growing economy. You have got 4.2 per cent unemployment. You have got in some cases full employment and labour shortage. But you can keep inflation moderate on a good industrial relations system. But if you want to put in the driver's seat of that Formula One somebody who does not know how to handle it, somebody who brings back in an industrial relations system, it could threaten the whole delicate balance.If you had wanted to know about a fearful example of what could be in store for Australia, you should have listened to the Leader of the Opposition on AM. It was painful. It was clear he does not know what productivity is, it was clear he does not know what creates it and it was clear that once you ask him a question off the ACTU script he is on his own. He is somebody on his own, but this time driving the Formula One motor car; he is somebody on his own, but this time running the Australian economy - a fearful event, almost embarrassing for those of us who were listening to it this morning.If you do not want to listen to me and you do not want to listen to the Reserve Bank governor and you do not want to listen to the IMF and you do not want to listen to the OECD, could I plead with you: do not listen to the ACTU. Why not listen to Paul Keating, Labor hero, who takes responsibility for everything that is good in the Australian economy? He said on Lateline:... the Labor Party [has] come back with something that will take them further back than the legislation I put in place in '93.They do not have a policy. -  - They are listening; they are just pretending not to listen. They are engaged in deep conversation which, as those of you who are in question time will notice, will end the moment I stop talking. It is an elaborate charade from somebody who does not want to listen to the economic facts. It is all about the Australian people. You wonder why he does not understand productivity; it is because he does not listen to me at question time. Here I am; I am giving free tutorials, and all he does is engage in an elaborate charade. I will tender for him the speech of the Governor of the Reserve Bank and ask him to read it, and I will tender for him the interview with Paul Keating, Labor hero, the person who did everything good - according to him - in the Australian economy. I will make this point: Labor does not just want to go back to 1993 and it does not just want to go back 14 years; it wants to go back beyond to the prehistoric era of industrial relations, which will do nothing for the Australian economy.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hughes for her question. Of course, given the proximity of her electorate to Sydney Airport she takes a great deal of interest in aviation security matters. Our government is very serious about security both inside Australia and outside Australia as far as Australian citizens are concerned, and particularly around the aviation industry in this country. Between the government and the private sector in the aviation industry there have been billions of dollars spent on aviation security around the country since the terrorist attacks of 9-11 in 2001. In fact, the government has spent over $1.2 billion on aviation security across Australia as a result of those terrorist attacks in ensuring that the travelling public in Australia is secure.A security breach at Sydney airport came to my attention yesterday, when there was a media story about it. I thought I should find out about it, so I contacted the airport operators, SACL, and asked for some information about this so-called breach. It turned out that there was not a security breach, but there seems to have been a deliberate misuse of an ASIC - that is, the Aviation Security Identification Card that is issued to people that work on airport sites across Australia so they can gain access. They have been properly screened by security agencies. It seemed that there had been a misuse of an ASIC to gain entry to the airport yesterday with media personnel.You might ask who they were and why would they do that. It seems that the cardholder was none other than one Sam Crosby, an official of the TWU. Although he was not employed on the airport site, he had access as a senior officer of the Transport Workers Union so as to be able to see his members. But not only is Sam Crosby a senior official of the TWU; he just happens to be the president of Australian Young Labor. Here we have the president of Young Labor in Australia, a senior official of the TWU, misusing his ASIC to take the media onto the airport in Sydney to try and create a scare among the community about security at the airport. I asked SACL about the incident and how it occurred. They have closed-circuit television and a record of the security gates that were used. According to their statement:Sam Crosby, an official with the Transport Workers Union, holds an ASIC and as such has the ability to sponsor applications for Airport Visitor Cards.On Tuesday 5 June, at 12.16pm an Airport Visitor Card was issued to Zoe Arnold, the TWU's Media Officer, on the sponsorship of Sam Crosby.At 1.22pm Airport Visitor Cards were issued to Justin Vallejo and Tobias Zerna, staff members of the Daily Telegraph, on the sponsorship of Sam Crosby. In all Sam Crosby sponsored three people for Visitor Cards. It was stated that the purpose of obtaining the Airport Visitor Cards was to attend a union meeting.At 1.28pm Sam Crosby used his ASIC four times to gain access through Gate 25. An electronic swipe (using an ASIC) is required at Gate 25 and an identification and bag check takes place at that location.There was no breach of security; there was a misuse of his ASIC. They arrived at 1.28. The group left the airport at 1.46, so they were on the site having the union meeting for an entirety of 18 minutes. They would have gone around and seen many members of the TWU in that time!We all know what this is about. This was just a blatant stunt out of the ACTU's manual for political stunts, which we have seen this week. It was stunt used by the president of Young Labor in Australia to try and undermine the security circumstances in our aviation industry across this country. He is a very senior position holder in the Australian Labor Party. There was no breach of security at Sydney airport. There was a misuse of an ASIC. Sydney airport has advised me that they have referred the matter to the Australian Federal Police for investigation. I have asked that the Office of Transport Security provide advice to me as to whether Mr Crosby is still a suitable person to hold an ASIC to enter airport operations like those at Sydney airport. After this exercise, the Leader of the Opposition might think again before getting a photograph of himself and the leader of Young Labor put on the front page of a website. The Leader of the Opposition has said, 'If the Labor Party is going to win and set the right direction for the nation it will require a 100 per cent effort from everyone at every level of the party to get involved.' Sam Crosby has done that. He took his stunt straight out of the ACTU's stunt manual in the lead-up to the election. I say again that there was no security breach at Sydney airport, but that there was a misuse of a privilege that a member of the TWU and the ALP had been granted by Sydney airport.</DOC>

Perhaps I can best answer it by reading a media statement released today by the Australian Electoral Commission. - Oh, I see: we do not have an independent Electoral Commission anymore! This is what the statement says:The AEC announced today it is examining if any potential disclosure obligation exists under the Commonwealth Electoral Act in relation to a function hosted by the Prime Minister at Kirribilli House.The AEC has noted suggestions that the Government may have attempted to 'silence' or constrain the AEC responses to the media on this issue.'The AEC takes its integrity and independence very seriously and I want to make it quite clear that no attempt was made by the Government or anybody else to influence the AEC in its response to this issue,' Electoral Commissioner, Mr Ian Campbell said.'Contrary to some media reports, the AEC Director of Funding and Disclosure, Mr Kevin Bodel was not asked by the AEC or the Government to 'shut up' regarding these matters.'The release goes on to say:The AEC also confirmed today that it will examine a complaint by the federal Special Minister of State regarding the use of electoral roll information in connection with the ACTU and whether this may or may not be in accord with the Commonwealth Electoral Act.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Mallee for the question, because I know that issues in relation to the handling of personal information of individuals are of great concern to members of the House generally. From time to time I even hear comments on the importance of privacy issues from some members opposite. The act is quite clear. It provides important protection for everybody in the Australian community. The act imposes certain obligations on organisations when they collect or use personal information. There are certain National Privacy Principles in the act which set out the obligations of non-government organisations. The very first principle is that an organisation must not collect personal information unless the information is necessary for one or more of its functions or activities. Of equal importance is the principle that an organisation must take reasonable steps to ensure that the individual is aware of the purposes for which the information is collected. In other words, if an organisation collects information that is not directly relevant to its activities, it could be in breach of those principles.I know from the noise being made that some members appear not to treat this issue as seriously as some of their colleagues who have pressed these matters on other occasions. But let me just say that there is some very important case law on these principles which ought to be of concern to everybody in this House. It involves, in particular, a union associated with the ACTU. I draw the House's attention to a case involving the Channel 7 network and the Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance and another. That body is a union affiliated with the ACTU. In that case, the alliance engaged a call centre to poll employees of the Channel 7 network before a scheduled vote on an agreement. The call centre was acting as an agent of the alliance when it undertook that polling, with scripted questions, and collected a variety of personal information from staff of the Channel 7 network that it contacted. Mr Justice Gyles of the Federal Court held that the collected information, no matter how useful or desirable to the union - that is, the alliance - was 'hardly necessary for any of its functions'. This meant that this body was clearly in direct breach of the National Privacy Principles. His Honour also found that the call centre did not let people who were polled know the purposes for which the information was being collected.I think this is a case of the utmost importance to us all. If an organisation is going to seek information from you or any of your constituents or any body of which you are a member or with which you are associated, even if it is the ACTU or its friendly local union representative, you are entitled to know why and you should make sure that it is necessary for the function of the organisation. If people believe their personal details have been misused, as they clearly were in this case, by an organisation to which they belong or with which they are in any way associated then they should lodge their complaint with the Privacy Commissioner so that these issues can be dealt with.</DOC>

 - I am very happy to answer the question. I do not regard Kirribilli House as my house and I do not regard the Lodge as my house. I recognise that I am greatly privileged to occupy both of those residences at the present time because I happen to be Prime Minister of this country. I know that my predecessors - or most of them - would have adopted the same attitude.But seeing that the Leader of the Opposition has persisted with this falsehood that the function held last Friday week was a fundraiser for the Liberal Party - which it was not - perhaps I might draw the attention of the Leader of the Opposition to a memorable paragraph in a book entitled The Fixer: the untold story of Graham Richardson, written by Marian Wilkinson, who is hardly a journalistic promoter of John Howard, to put it mildly. I think she almost competes with David Marr - no, not quite - as somebody who is fairly uncharitable to the current Prime Minister.This particular book describes, on pages 262 and 263, an event that took place at Kirribilli House in the winter of 1987. As I remember, in the winter of 1987 Bob Hawke was the Prime Minister and I was the Leader of the Opposition. So I remember the winter of 1987 extremely well. It was a winter of some discontent for the Liberal Party of Australia and, in political terms, a winter of some comfort for the Australian Labor Party. The book spoke of a gathering at Kirribilli House in these terms:The guest list for the night, if not secret, was certainly handled discreetly. The invitees were coming to Kirribilli House for what was, in reality, an exclusive fund-raising dinner.Let me read on, because I can assure you that it gets infinitely better than that, Mr Speaker. It goes on to say:Among the millionaires -  -  - We don't like 1987, do we! Even though they won that year, they do not like the uncomfortable reminder of their own hypocrisy. The book goes on:Among the millionaires and multi-millionaires on the guest list was also Graham Richardson. He was there, quite simply, to put the hard word on the guests for their money after the delicious food, expensive wine and expansive speeches. He hoped that each of the men might be good for anywhere between $30 000 and $100 000 - and this was in 1987; if it were constant dollars, it would be a lot more - comfortably lining Labor's war chest for the election. The cheques would be collected after the election - this way the donations could be written off to the party's administrative fund or its corporate entities. The confidentiality of the donors and the size of their contribution could be protected.When the Leader of the Opposition asks about fundraising at Kirribilli House, that is what he ought to be talking about - not an entirely legitimate event that I held there last Friday week. I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper.</DOC>

 - In answer to the question from the Leader of the Opposition I can assure him that the technology proposed and announced today is nothing as described by the Leader of the Opposition. The OECD report to which the Leader of the Opposition has referred concludes that WiMAX is a particularly suitable platform for regional broadband access. The report says:WiMAX equipment could play a key role in providing long-range fixed-wireless connectivity in rural and remote areas as well as mobile connectivity over shorter distances.The OECD report, contrary to the impression given by the Leader of the Opposition, is extremely favourable to WiMAX and it is about time that the Leader of the Opposition stopped being so selective and unrepresentative in the way in which he quotes from official documents.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Macquarie. As it happens, I will be able to inform him in the course of this answer of some of the benefits that will accrue to his electorate from the announcement I made together with the Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts in Goulburn earlier today. As a result of the government's policies, in two years time 99 per cent of the Australian population will have access to very fast broadband, and we will not need to raid the future savings of Australian soldiers and police in order to achieve that outcome.We are going to invest $958 million to ensure that 99 per cent of the population will have that access to very fast broadband by June 2009. A state-of-the-art broadband network will be rolled out across the country, delivering speeds of 12 megabits per second to 99 per cent of the Australian population at metropolitan comparable prices. Indeed, 75 per cent of the population will have speeds of 20 megabits per second. The government has awarded the $958 million Broadband Connect competitive grant to OPEL, which is a joint venture between Optus and Elders. The joint venture itself will contribute $917 million to this rollout, making this a total $1.875 billion investment in very fast, affordable broadband. It will be made up, essentially, of two components: firstly, the enabling of 426 ADSL2+ exchanges in outer metropolitan and regional areas, giving access to very fast and affordable broadband for an additional three million -  - Let me repeat that for the benefit of the member for Ballarat: very fast and affordable broadband for an additional three million premises this year. Secondly, there will be a deployment of 1,360 WiMAX wireless base stations across the country, bringing very fast and affordable broadband to 99 per cent of the population by June 2009. Contrary to the sneering remarks of the Leader of the Opposition, WiMAX wireless is a 4G technology designed specifically for broadband, delivering speeds of 12 megabits per second. WiMAX is a scaleable technology, meaning that its speeds will increase into the future as the base stations are upgraded. Also for the benefit of the Leader of the Opposition, I point out that ADSL2+ can deliver speeds of up to 20 megabits per second over copper wire, and the intention is for the additional 426 very fast ADSL2+ broadband exchanges to be switched on this year, with the process beginning immediately.All of this will be achieved without touching the $2 billion regional communications fund, which the opposition is going to steal in order to fund a fibre optic network that ought be provided by commercial operators who are going to earn a great deal of money out of the provision of that network. In relation to that network, we are establishing a competitive bid process. The group that will make the decision and confer with industry and the government will include representatives from my department, the Secretary to the Treasury, the Secretary to the Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, the ACCC and private businesses representatives. There will be no cost to the taxpayer. We will provide this, or the market will provide it, at no cost to the taxpayer. The Leader of the Opposition will take $2 billion away from the bush and $2.7 billion out of the superannuation provisions for Australia's soldiers and Federal Police in order to pay for something that ought to be paid for by the private sector. The man who knows nothing about productivity also knows nothing about competition in communications. Why on earth would anybody provide $4.7 billion to subsidise the creation of something that ought to be produced by the private sector, because the private sector will make a great deal of money out of the provision of that service?</DOC>

 - The answer is that the government is not just acting now. I would point out to the Leader of the Opposition -  -  - It is untrue, as the Leader of the Opposition alleges, to suggest that the government is only now doing something about this issue. I remind the Leader of the Opposition that as a result of government programs over the last three years some 1.3 million additional premises have obtained access to broadband. That is, 1.3 million premises have obtained access to broadband as a result of government programs over the last three years. Although this is an unsatisfactory figure, approximately 50 per cent of Australians can currently access broadband at 12 megabits per second. I would also point out to the Leader of the Opposition that the Competitive Grants Program, the result of which was announced by me and my colleagues this morning, was foreshadowed some time ago and work on that commenced after the completion of the sale of Telstra.The Leader of the Opposition invites me to say something about the availability of services in certain parts of Australia. I am very happy to say that in the electorate of Macquarie, so ably represented by the Chief Government Whip, seven exchanges will be upgraded to very fast ADSL2+ broadband and 15 new wireless broadband sites will be built in the region. The very fast updates will occur in Bathurst, Blackheath, Hazelbrook, Katoomba - two sites - Lawson and Wentworth Falls. As to the wireless broadband sites - that is, 12 megabits per second -  - Mr Speaker -  - The interjecting member merely underlines how even-handed the government is. As to wireless broadband - WiMAX -  - there will be two sites at Bathurst, one at Blayney, one at Essington, one at Hampton, one at Lawson, one at Lithgow, one at Mount Marsden, one at Mount Ryan, one at Mount Victoria, one at Oberon, one at Palmers Oakley, one at Portland and one at Newnes. This is just a small illustration of the spread of this facility. I can assure the House that when the details of the switch-on of the ADSL2+ are revealed, the House will see that the government is totally even-handed and that this is not in any way restricted disproportionately to government-held seats.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Riverina for her question. I recognise her ongoing commitment to making sure that there is significant investment in modern communications technology throughout regional Australia, particularly in the electorate of Riverina. The announcement that I had the pleasure of taking part in with the Prime Minister and the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts this morning will certainly do that. We have been through a competitive process both in terms of value and technology so that we are able to ensure that the best available technology is rolled out across regional Australia and that the maximum number of people in regional Australia have access to broadband services. The announcement this morning of $1.8 billion invested in regional Australia is enormously significant, given that roughly 50 per cent of that investment is being contributed by the Commonwealth government and the other is being matched by private sector providers to build the network across regional Australia. That means 99 per cent of people in Australia will have the ability to access broadband internet connections. It is something that all Australians obviously want. The other one per cent will also be covered through our existing Australian Broadband Guarantee program. So right across the Australian community there is an opportunity to achieve 100 per cent broadband coverage.The OPEL network will include a mix of cutting-edge technology - WiMAX wireless, broadband and fibre-optic cable - to deliver a minimum of 12 megabits per second by June 2009. This proposal is wireless, it is fibre optic, as well as being a massive rollout of ADSL2 technology. Under this proposal, 426 exchanges that have the capability of being wound up in terms of capacity by putting ADSL2 DSLAMs in them are going to get them. They have not had them done under the current provider. They will automatically get cranked up. This technology is just the beginning. The network is specifically designed in its scalability, with speeds of up to 70 megabits a second available as technology evolves. This point has been seized upon by the NFF in welcoming and commending this announcement by the government. I quote from the NFF's release:The choice of WiMAX wire technology supplementing the additional ADSL 2+ technology to deliver services from the exchange to the farm is vitally important, but also provides the opportunity for scaleable high speed broadband into the future.These people represent a lot of the businesses in regional and rural and remote Australia, and they support this announcement by the government. They support the decision we have taken to ensure that an open access regime is available right across regional Australia in terms of the competitive pressures that we want to bring to the marketplace. This will certainly do it. Importantly, it secures still the $2 billion perpetual Communications Fund that underpins the ability to fund new technology into regional Australia as and when it comes online in the future. Next year we expect $400 million to be available out of that fund to spend on new technology in rural and regional Australia. Just remember - this is the $2 billion fund that the Australian Labor Party wants to steal and spend on its proposal. Labor proposes to spend $4.7 billion on broadband, which it claims will reach 98 per cent of the population. However, most commentators say it will reach only 75 per cent of the population. Labor proposes to spend $4.7 billion on broadband - $2 billion of that stolen from the bush and the other $2 billion stolen from future ex-service men and women and their pension fund, their superannuation fund for the future. Under Labor's proposal broadband would reach only 75 per cent of the people across Australia. But the worst point - and I know the member for Riverina will be very interested in this - is that it is proposing to reach only 75 per cent of Australians by 2013. Labor's completion date is 2013. We have announced today a completion date of mid-2009, reaching 99 per cent of the population. - That is the difference between the government's proposal and the Australian Labor Party's proposal. Under Labor's 'fraudband' proposal, where they are going to steal $2 billion from the bush, they are not going to achieve 98 per cent coverage -  - They are only going to achieve 75 per cent coverage. Their fraudband proposal is only going to be completed in 2013. We are going to have ours done in 2009.</DOC>

 - The announcement that I made today -  - The announcement that I made today, as the Leader of the Opposition knows, was very much about providing services in rural and regional Australia, and it is a matter of electoral reality -  - that the great majority of seats in rural and regional Australia are held by the coalition. That is just a matter of electoral arithmetic. If it were a policy that we were applying overwhelmingly to the inner metropolitan area, then the great majority of the beneficiaries would be Labor seats. I cannot help it that at present the great majority of seats in rural and regional Australia are held by -  - Liberal and National Party members. It may have something to do with the fact that they provide a better service to their constituents.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Blair for his question. Unlike most Australian employers, the Australian government has never funded the superannuation entitlements of the public sector. Since Federation, the Commonwealth has employed public servants and just figured that it could pay their superannuation entitlements out of recurrent revenue of future generations. That unfunded superannuation liability currently stands at around $100 billion. Although the Commonwealth has closed most of its defined benefit schemes, such as the CSS and the PSS, its military schemes are still open, and that superannuation liability, currently at around $100 billion, is expected to grow to $148 billion by 2020.That was the situation of every previous Australian government, of whatever political complexion, until this government decided to fund the superannuation liability of the Australian public sector. This government decided to put aside and provision, for future generations, the funds to cover that liability and, by doing so, to free future generations of inherited liabilities from the past. That was the establishment of the Future Fund, not only so that our defence personnel could be guaranteed that their superannuation would be paid, but so that future generations would have that liability lifted from their backs. The government now has, as against the current liability of $103 billion, about $51 billion in assets in the Future Fund. As the IMF said:Australia's Future Fund ... looks like a good model for other countries: certainly there are few, if any, industrial countries as well prepared for the ... costs of an aging population as Australia.The OECD said this in 2006:The Future Fund is explicitly quarantined from other possible medium-term objectives. This is laudable ...If the Labor Party gets elected at the next election, the Future Fund is over because the Labor Party has promised to open up the Future Fund and take out $2.7 billion for a failed telecommunications policy. Why would you do that? You have Telstra lining up to build fibre to the node. You have Optus lining up to build fibre to the node. We now know that there are investment banks that want to come in and build fibre to the node. The private sector is prepared to carry the full costs and yet the Australian Labor Party, for ideological reasons, wants to open up the Future Fund, raid it for $2.7 billion, and get into the business of building fibre to the node. The reason the Labor Party wants to open up the Future Fund and raid it is the Labor Party wants to treat the Future Fund as a political vehicle for its own electoral prospects. Once you open the Future Fund for one purpose, you open it for all purposes.We have had the member for Melbourne saying he is going to open up the Future Fund and put it into infrastructure, but only hard infrastructure. We have had the member for Perth saying he is going to open the Future Fund and put it into education. We will have member after member after member, once you have established the principle, determining to open the Future Fund and to dissipate the savings of future generations. This is an important fork in the road for Australia. There was no other government in Australian history that had the wit to establish a Future Fund. If the Australian Labor Party gets elected, it will destroy it. It will go down in history as the government that destroyed Australia's future opportunities. It is an important financial point; it is important for our children. This is the government that freed our children from debt. We will free them from liability, and the biggest threat to their future comes from this Leader of the Opposition and the Australian Labor Party.</DOC>

 - The answer to that is no. The benefits of this announcement, as will be demonstrated in the weeks and months ahead, will be spread evenly throughout the entire country. The evidence of that is to be found in the fact that, as a result of this announcement, 99 per cent of all of the Australian community - and I do not think either side of politics is ever going to represent 99 per cent of the Australian electorate - will enjoy a very fast broadband in two years time. We will not be doing this at the expense of the future superannuation of our soldiers and our Federal Police. I have just been handed a map of an electorate. I think the name of this electorate is Griffith. I have also been handed a map of the electorate of Ballarat. - The map shows that one, two, three, four, five areas in the electorate of Ballarat are going to get the benefit, starting this year - starting almost immediately. Here it is -  - That red on the map is good. Normally I think green is pretty good, but red means it is an ADSL2+ turn-on. That means the member for Ballarat is going to do very well out of this. The Leader of the Opposition has already done very well out of this, but we have not ignored him. We have a map for him. We have a map for everybody because this is a government for all of us. - I am happy to do so.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hasluck for his question and note that in the electorate of Hasluck in 1996 the unemployment rate was 7.4 per cent. Today it is 3.5 per cent, so it has more than halved, and that is good news for the people of Hasluck. I am aware of a report on the front page of the Australian today. It begins with:CONSTRUCTION giant John Holland has warned that a multibillion-dollar productivity dividend will be threatened if Labor wins office and winds back the Coalition's industrial relations reforms.There is that magic word 'productivity', the word that the Leader of the Opposition does not understand -  - and the word that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition does not understand either, although you would fail to believe anything the Deputy Leader of the Opposition says because she does not tend to tell the truth on many occasions at all. The report goes on to say:With some building firms reportedly factoring in 'risk-of-Rudd' premiums into future contracts, John Holland also wants Labor to drop plans to scrap the building industry watchdog.It goes on to say that as evidence of what the Labor Party's initiatives will do, the John Holland document:... warns that the reintroduction of previous industrial practices such as payment of non-working union delegates on building sites would be hugely expensive.Imagine employing someone not to work for the firm but to work for the unions. That is what John Holland is warning against. It says the estimate of the cost of this alone would be $20 million a year - for John Holland to employ union officials on their books who do not have any productivity, even by the definition provided by the Leader of the Opposition. It goes on to say:In a strong endorsement of the Government's 14-month-old workplace blueprint, John Holland says these have already delivered achievements of great significance to the industry, our employees and our clients ..._            _            _'There is every reason to expect at least another 10 ... to 20 per cent improvement in productivity over the next five years,' ...'The current regulatory framework is therefore an essential plank in the nation's economic framework,' ...That is exactly right. It is not Joe Hockey, the member for North Sydney, the member for Bennelong, the member for Higgins or anyone else saying this. It is one of Australia's largest builders saying explicitly that a return to the bad old days of Labor Party industrial relations policy is not only bad for the construction industry but bad for the Australian economy.I can tell you that there is one area where productivity is high. I understand that Kevin Reynolds and Joe McDonald, the leaders of the CFMEU in Western Australia, are doorknocking the Pilbara to try and get new members. In an area of Australia that has traditionally a very low union membership, there are Joe McDonald and Kevin Reynolds going around with their backpacks. Lord knows what is in their backpacks. I will not speculate again. With their backpacks - and I am sure there would not be a water bottle inside - there they are travelling around the Pilbara trying to recruit new members for the CFMEU at a time when the building industry and the mining industry are creating and generating enormous wealth for the Australian economy. If you really want to know what the 'risk-of-Rudd premium' is, as the building industry calls it, it is about the fact that the Labor Party wants to wind back the clock on industrial relations. That is bad for the workers, and it is bad for the Australian economy.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Bass for his question. I thank him for the endorsement of the budget, and for his vote in passing the budget; I appreciate that very much.From 1 July, every Australian taxpayer will receive an income tax cut, and that is because of this year's budget, which lifts the low income tax offset and which increases the threshold for the 15 per cent rate, taking it up to $30,000. As we continue the countdown to 'fundamental injustice day', which is the day before 1 July, we can remember on 'fundamental injustice day' itself that every Australian will be receiving another income tax cut on 1 July.I am asked whether I am aware of any alternative tax policies. The answer is this: it depends what day of the week it is, because on some days of the week there are alternative tax policies and there are not on other days of the week. For example, back in February 2006, the member for Lilley said this:Labor recognises the need for root and branch tax reform ...It was going to be 'root and branch' back in February 2006. At the National Press Club on 16 May, the member for Lilley said this:I'm not anticipating taking forward any significant change to the personal-income tax system at this stage.The member for Melbourne Ports then left the chamber. - So 'root and branch' tax reform disappeared on 16 May. I read in the Adelaide Advertiser on Thursday, 7 June that tax policy was back on: 'Swan hints at tax cuts if Labor elected'. That was what appeared in the Adelaide Advertiser. Then, on Saturday, in the Australian Financial Review, as reported by Laura Tingle - get a load of this! - Mr Swan said:... we will certainly have a tax policy. I just wasn't going to raise expectations ...Well, producing a policy - wouldn't that raise expectations! It would really raise expectations if Labor came out with a policy on tax. 'I wasn't going to raise expectations'!When I made the point that there was no tax policy, I was wrong about that, too. This was picked up in a document published by the member for Lilley. He said that one of the myths that I was propagating was that Labor does not have a tax policy. That was a 'myth' that I was propagating; it was a 'myth' that Labor did not have a tax policy. He said this was a myth because in May 2005 Labor outlined its alternative tax plan. So on one day you are going to have root and branch; on the next you are not even going to have a leaf; on the next you are going to cut tax; and on the next you don't want to raise expectations but there might be a policy. But it is a myth to say there is no policy because Labor has its 2005 tax plan.I invite members of the public and members of the press to have a look at this 2005 tax plan because a document was released last week saying it was a myth to say that Labor did not have a tax plan because it has got one - the 2005 tax plan. Let me say this: the 2005 tax plan would increase the marginal tax rate for the lowest earners in our community by increasing the 15 per cent rate to 17 per cent, and it would increase the marginal tax rate for middle-income earners in our community from 40c to 42c and 45c to 47c.Let me say it again: Labor's 2005 tax plan would have three higher marginal tax rates and every threshold would be lower. For example, under the coalition, the top marginal tax rate of 45c cuts in over $150,000; under Labor's 2005 tax policy, the top rate would be 47c and it would cut in over $100,000. Under the coalition, the rate of 40 per cent applies between $75,000 and $150,000; Labor would have a higher rate of 42 per cent applying between $67,000 and $100,000.Mr Speaker, I do not make this up; this was published by the member for Lilley last week. He said that it was a myth to say Labor did not have a tax policy: 'In May 2005 Labor outlined its alternative tax plan.' The Labor alternative tax plan is for higher taxes. There is no point in the member for Lilley saying in the Adelaide Advertiser that he would like lower taxes. The member for Lilley is one of those white-bread politicians who will tell a journalist anything he thinks the journalist wants to hear. And it will vary from day to day, according to who the journalist is and which outlet it is.In politics, you need a policy. In politics, you have to be able to put it out, you have to be able to cost it and you have to be able to defend it. The member for Lilley and the Labor Party are playing games with the Australian people. They will not come forward and have a policy properly costed; they will not put themselves under scrutiny because they are not fit to form a government and they are not fit to be trusted with economic policy.</DOC>

 - The overriding principle of the government's policy is that 99 per cent of the Australian community will, in two years time, have access to very fast broadband, and that includes people represented by Labor members in this House as much as it includes people represented by Liberal and National members. I notice the Leader of the Opposition is focusing -  - all of his questions on a leaked email and not on the difference in substance between his policy, that will raid the Future Fund and rob the superannuation of Australian soldiers and Australian Federal Police, and a plan from the government which will leave it to the private sector to provide what the private sector should provide and leave the government purse to provide those things that the private sector cannot provide. That should be the point of comparison. But let me put the troubled mind of the Leader of the Opposition at rest: this is a policy for all Australians, not for some Australians.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Corangamite for his question. He is a fine member of this place. In 1996, when this government was elected, the unemployment level in his electorate was 8.6 per cent. Now it is 4.6 per cent, so that is great news.This government is focused on ensuring that all employees covered by the federal system will receive a workplace fact sheet that provides them with a straightforward guide to where they stand in relation to workplace relations. The fact sheet - and we will be moving an amendment in the Senate to this effect - will contain basic information about workplace entitlements like wages, minimum standards, protected award conditions and the fairness test, as well as the roles of the Workplace Authority and the Workplace Ombudsman. The fact sheet will be drafted by the Workplace Authority and it will be gazetted. The fact sheet will not cost employers anything. They can download it from the internet, or the Workplace Ombudsman will supply them with copies.You would think that most people in Australia would be happy to provide more information to Australian workers about their entitlements at work. You would think that this basic information that allows the workers of Australia to know where they stand under the workplace relations laws would be fully supported on both sides of the House. But yesterday, on the Insiders program, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition said:I'm troubled Australian employers are basically being forced by the Government to hand out its propaganda.I thought that was a bit tough. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition went on to say:It's a ridiculous burden to put on business, particularly small business.I thought, 'This is pretty strong outrage,' and I asked myself: 'Why would the Deputy Leader of the Opposition be saying that?' The Deputy Leader of the Opposition is so opposed to providing information to employees that it is actually part of the Labor Party's policy - unless they have forgotten their policy already; we have not. It is documented. Page 8 of the Labor Party's own policy states:8. Information in the workplaceEmployers must provide all new employees with a Fair Work Information Statement which contains prescribed information about the employee's rights and entitlements at work - and, in the little bit that we do not do, the Labor Party policy goes on to state - including the right of the employee to choose whether to be or not to be a member of a union and where to go for information and assistance.So the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is so outraged about this government providing information through an independent authority to employees, but the Labor Party's own policy says that they are going to do it - and, by the way, employers will have to give employees an opportunity to join the union. That is part of their own information statement. That smacks of hypocrisy from the Labor Party. But that is not new ground. They are hypocrites when it comes to productivity; they are hypocrites when it comes to the information statement.We learnt today that when it comes to Dean Mighell they are hypocrites as well. We know that, with confected outrage, the Leader of the Opposition went before the people of Australia and said: 'I am so outraged at Dean Mighell's behaviour that I have asked that he be sacked from the Labor Party and that all ETU money be sent back to the ETU. We will not accept a dollar from the ETU.' Not only was there a full-page ad by the ETU in the Courier-Mail last week against the government's industrial relations system but a fellow by the name of Stephen Newnham, the secretary of the Victorian Labor Party, told the Australian Financial Review that Mr Mighell was free to rejoin the ALP at any time, was keen to maintain an active role in the party - I bet - and could well do so after the federal poll.So the Leader of the Opposition has gone before the Australian people and said, 'I will not tolerate Dean Mighell's behaviour; I have called for him to be sacked; he is gone from the Labor Party,' and the state secretary is saying: 'We will have him back. We want him back. We want his money.' And you know what? He will turn up the day after election day. That is the hypocrisy that the Labor Party have made part of their basic manifesto. The way they behave must be seen for what it is: rich in hypocrisy. And when old Deano, Dean Mighell, comes out to open the batting for the Labor Party at the next election, we will all be waiting there with bated breath.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for the question.The member for Melbourne then left the chamber. - The member for Calare asks me about parity of treatment. Let me point out to him that, under the plan announced by the government today, in two years time 99 per cent of the Australian population will have access to broadband of 12 megabits per second at metropolitan comparable prices. That is the essence, that is the nub, of the announcement that has been made today. I would have thought that that explanation alone would indicate that there is parity of treatment, because what is happening under this OPEL proposal is that, for the first time, many regional and country areas of Australia will have the same access to broadband speeds as is now available in metropolitan areas.The member has asked me about fibre-optic provision. I know that others have spoken of providing a fibre-optic network to just about all parts of Australia. It is our view that there are formidable technological challenges and difficulties in relation to that. International experience has shown - and I invite those who question this to listen carefully - that fibre networks require tens of billions of dollars of investment, even in countries a fraction of the size of Australia. In South Korea, which is a country less than half the size of Victoria, the cost of a fibre network was in excess of $A50 billion and, in December 2005, fibre connections accounted for just 14 per cent of South Korea's total residential broadband subscriptions. In Singapore, a country with a landmass of 660 square kilometres, half the size of Sydney, the fibre roll-out cost was over $A5 billion.The point I make out of all that to the member for Calare is that I would take with a large grain of salt what has been proposed by the Labor Party in this area and I would see the proposal put forward by the government as a fair and successful attempt - within the technological and affordability criteria that will govern any administration in this country - to provide parity of service to all Australians.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Moreton for his question and I say to him that, although the government is sometimes criticised for the failings of the state Labor governments in this area, in fact the Howard government initiated Medicare cover of some dental treatment. This Medicare cover was dramatically expanded in the recent budget. From 1 November, people with chronic disease with contributing poor oral health will be eligible for an initial dental consultation and up to $2,000 worth of Medicare funded dental treatment a year. This will cost some $378 million and cover some 200,000 people over four years, many of whom would otherwise be languishing on the states' public dental waiting lists.But this dramatic new initiative was not enough for the opposition, because two weeks ago the shadow minister, the member for Gellibrand, promised that every Australian earning less than average weekly earnings would receive free dental cover. I have here an article from the Sunday Age. The headline is 'Smile - it's free dental care', and it is an exclusive from Jason Koutsoukis. It says:People earning average income or below would have free dental care under a Labor plan to solve the nation's teeth crisis.Nearly 16 million Australians live in households earning average weekly earnings or below. To give 16 million people just one hour of dental care at the cost of $295 an hour nominated by the member for Gellibrand would cost taxpayers $4.7 billion every year. If the member for Gellibrand is to be taken seriously, Labor will spend almost as much on dentistry as the government currently spends on the PBS. The member for Gellibrand would wipe out half the surplus in just one ill-considered, half-digested item from her wish list. And this person would be a minister in a Rudd Labor government.The Leader of the Opposition, of course, knows all about poor dental health. When he was the director-general of the Christian socialist state of Queensland, people waited up to three years on public dental waiting lists. When he was the director-general he took no action whatsoever to fluoridate the Queensland water supply, which is why people in Queensland have by far the worst oral health in Australia. When he was the director-general he all but closed down the dental clinic at Queen Elizabeth II hospital in the electorate of Moreton. Why does anyone think that this failed former public servant would be better at running the country than he was at helping to run the state of Queensland? I ask the Leader of the Opposition: please say clearly what Labor's dental policy is. I think he will know as much about Labor's dental policy as he knew about Labor's productivity policy. If he does not know his own policy, he is certainly not fit to form a government in this country.</DOC>

 - In answering that question I might observe that, unlike the Leader of the Opposition, at least the member for Calare asked a question on behalf of his constituents. - The Leader of the National Party was a major participant in the government's decisions in relation to these matters, and I can assure you that the constituents represented by the Leader of the National Party and all of his colleagues, as well as the rural and regional constituents represented by the Liberal Party, are well pleased with the decision that has been taken.We have now had about six questions - not on the substance, not on the technology. It is all about this pathetic argument of the Leader of the Opposition that there is something wrong with the fact that the majority of country people in this nation are represented in this parliament by the National Party and by the Liberal Party. Let me say to the Leader of the Opposition that the reason for that is that those parties represent the interests of country people more vigorously and more effectively than does the Australian Labor Party. We have demonstrated that by the fact that we have set aside a $2 billion telecommunications fund for the bush. That is a dedicated fund. It is a fund that, under our policies, will be kept for the bush, effectively in perpetuity. The Labor Party proposes to rob the bush of that money and use it to fund a large company to roll out a fibre network essentially in the built-up areas of Australia. If the people of rural Australia want to know who is on their side, let me tell them that the Leader of the Opposition wants to take their $2 billion and use it to pay a large company to roll out essentially a fibre network for the built-up areas of Australia when they should be rolling out that network out of their own pockets and not out of the pockets of people who live in the rural parts of Australia.I would never presume to speak for my friend and colleague the Leader of the National Party, but I think he would be one with me in saying that the interests of rural people are being well and truly served in the announcement both of us were very proud to make this morning in Goulburn.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question and for her interest. The government warmly welcomes the announcement made by the Indonesian authorities that they have captured the man who is often described these days as the overall leader, or the emir, of Jemaah Islamiah, who goes by the name of Zarkasih. The announcement followed an earlier announcement by the Indonesians - as I mentioned in the House last week - that Jemaah Islamiah military operations chief Abu Dujana had also been captured. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the work that the Indonesian government is doing in the area of counterterrorism. I understand that Abu Dujana has told the Indonesian police that Zarkasih was the latest in the line of emirs - which included Abu Bakar Bashir, who will be familiar, at least by name, to many members in this House.Having said these things, and having congratulated the Indonesians on the excellent work that they have done, let me make this point: Jemaah Islamiah is still a dangerous foe, and it is very important that we are not complacent in addressing this issue. I know that questions of terrorism are not so much front of mind in public debate in Australia today, but that does not mean they have gone away. There are still key individuals on the loose, like Noordin Top, but it must be recognised that Jemaah Islamiah and other extremist groups have suffered a very severe reverse in recent times. In broad terms, what is happening in Indonesia, in the Philippines and elsewhere in the region in counterterrorism is very successful.I want to take this opportunity to say what a good job my department, the Australian Federal Police and the intelligence agencies of Australia have done in working with allies, like the United States, in assisting countries in the region to address these issues. I know this does not interest the opposition very much - I do not think they have asked me a single question in 2007, as a matter of fact - and they must find all this baffling, because it was not long ago that the narrative of the opposition, including from the Leader of the Opposition, was that our foreign policies made Australians less safe. That was the basic argument of the Leader of the Opposition, yet here we are seeing great success in the area of counterterrorism in South-East Asia in our own immediate neighbourhood.If I may say so, I think the opposition is very complacent about this issue. Why do I think that? On 2 March, the member for Melbourne issued a press release in which he said he wanted to cut $31.3 million off the budget of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in areas which, in particular, focus on counterterrorism and the consular and crisis response work of the department. This government will continue to be strong and determined in confronting and fighting terrorism. We will work bilaterally - not just as liberal multilateralists - with our friends and neighbours in the region to assist them wherever we can. I hope that we can continue with the successes that so far have been achieved.</DOC>

 - I was actually absent from the 5 June meeting, so I am not a direct witness. But, knowing him as I do, I am absolutely certain that the Leader of the National Party and Deputy Prime Minister would have conducted the cabinet meeting with complete integrity and propriety and that appropriate advice would have been obtained before that meeting. The most important thing is that the right decision was taken. What came out of that meeting was a decision that 99 per cent of Australians will have access in two years time - as against four or five years time from the Labor Party taxpayer funded scheme - to very fast broadband.I just do not understand why the Leader of the Opposition is going on about and criticising a decision that is good for 99 per cent of the Australian people. It beggars belief that the Leader of the Opposition could object to something which is overwhelmingly in favour of people spread right throughout the country. As understanding of this decision spreads around Australia, he will find that it is even-handed in its benefits and even-handed in its application. If 99 per cent of the population is going to benefit, how on earth can the Leader of the Opposition be logically opposed to it?</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Wakefield for his question. The Howard government is committed to ensuring that parents have a right to choose the school that best meets the educational outcomes for their child. The Australian government is committed to a strong public sector and a strong private sector. That is why the Australian government has ensured that there has been record funding for all schools across Australia since 1996. In fact, there has been a 160 per cent increase in funding for all schools, and that includes a 120 per cent funding increase for government schools, even though enrolments in government schools have increased by only one per cent over that time.I was asked about alternative policies. According to a transcript on 702 ABC, the Labor Party are saying publicly that they are committed to the current indexation arrangements, that Labor will not take money off schools and that Labor have abandoned the Beazley-Macklin-Latham hit list. That is what they say. We know that the unions are committed to the hit list, because their misleading advertising campaign shows that they are hell-bent on taking money away from Catholic and independent schools. But guess what? So is Labor. Labor are committed to the hit list. It is done in a very underhand way. Labor's 2007 national policy platform says that the Labor Party in government will fund non-government schools based on need. The words are specifically that they will take into account 'income from private resources when assessing financial need'. This is Latham's resources model. This is, word for word, Mark Latham policy. The resources model was the basis for the hit list - so the hit list lives on. As the independent schools sector of New South Wales said only last week on radio, the resources model in the Labor Party's national policy platform is a direct attack -  - Mr Speaker, I am quoting from the Association of Independent Schools of New South Wales, who said last week that this resources model is 'a direct attack on parents of children in independent schools'. But it gets worse. The Leader of the Opposition has now chimed in on education policy. According to the Leader of the Opposition, they will fund all schools - government, non-government, religious or secular - based on need. In other words, they will fund all schools based on the resources model. And the resources model equals the hit list. So the hit list has now been extended to government schools. So the private income sources of all government schools are now being taken into account. Parents who raise money -  -  The member for Sydney then left the chamber.  - Out of the Leader of the Opposition's own mouth, we find that the hit list will now be extended to government schools. Government schools that raise funds from private sources such as fetes, building appeals, fundraising from parents and fees from parents - and parents in government schools pay fees, make no mistake - will have these sources taken into account when funding is calculated for government schools. - It is not just me identifying this issue; it is not just the independent schools. We have already seen what a state Labor government is doing. The member for Calwell then left the chamber. 
 - As the Treasurer always says, 'Do not listen to what Labor say; look at what they do.' The South Australian Labor government has already identified government schools that have savings accounts. It has identified schools that have put savings from fetes, building appeals and fees into a savings account, and as part of this year's budget the state Labor government is raiding those bank accounts. I call on the Labor Party to identify the government schools that will have their funding affected under a resources model. I call on the Labor Party to identify the non-government schools that will have their funding arrangements affected under their resources model. The hit list lives on and Labor should be up-front with the Australian people about their dishonest education policy.</DOC>

I completely support the decision of the Liberal Party preselection committee in Mitchell. I uphold the due processes of my party. The Treasurer and I were exercising the due processes of our party in its Victorian division manifestation when we made the comments that we did before the matter was dealt with by the administrative committee. I take this opportunity - which I have availed myself of in relation to this question - to place on record my very deep affection for and gratitude to the member for Mitchell, Alan Cadman, and for the wonderful job -  - that he has done representing the people of Mitchell since that very rainy day on 18 May 1974 when both of us were elected to the national parliament. Alan has been a wonderful servant of the party and the people of Mitchell. - I will have another opportunity of thanking him, but I will thank him now seeing that I am on my feet - and I thank the member for Grayndler for giving me this unexpected opportunity; life is full of surprises, and he is one of them.</DOC>

 - What figures and comments on productivity in recent days demonstrate is that the Leader of the Opposition has had a John Kerin moment on the issue of productivity. The best way I can deal with the opposition and the issue of productivity is to quote him in that now daily more famous AM interview when he said:_ look at the budget papers, the productivity growth numbers reflected in that are dismal indeed for the overall trajectory of the Australian economy.That was the unadvised, the ill-informed, the misunderstanding Leader of the Opposition on productivity, but his leaked adviser's paper had this to say:Even so, we should expect that, as the rate of GDP growth picks up, quarterly productivity statistics will be strong in the next year or so.It goes on to say:Given growth in employment and hours, this implies accelerating productivity growth in the non-farm sector. If export volumes and output growth continue to improve, it is likely that we will see a noticeable pick-up in productivity over the years to come abstracting from the impacts of the drought.On this occasion, the Leader of the Opposition cannot blame his staff. I know he blames his staff for other things but on this occasion his staff at least were pointing out the facts, although it has to be said, from the briefing paper that has come into the hands of the media, that having isolated the true facts his staff did advise him to keep on deceiving the Australian public on the subject.</DOC>

 - I can say in reply to the member for Deakin that, yes, I am aware of claims having been made by the member for Griffith from the moment he became the Leader of the Opposition about social equity and productivity in this country. Within days of becoming Leader of the Opposition the gentleman who sits opposite me in this place began assailing this government on the grounds of its lack of social compassion and social equity. He made numerous speeches and gave numerous interviews extolling his theories about 'Howard's Brutopia' and the failure of this government to deliver a fair go to the Australian people. I can best summarise what the Leader of the Opposition has been on about in relation to social equity over the last six months by quoting from a speech he made in the House of Representatives on 5 December, a few days after he became Leader of the Opposition, when he said:Right now this country is engaged in a battle of ideas for Australia's future. On the one side of this battle - referring obviously to the government parties - we have a vision for Australia's future which says that, when it comes to economic prosperity, you cannot have economic prosperity and social justice - that these are incompatible.That has been his argument ever since he became Leader of the Opposition. He said that, yes, the country is prosperous but the government has not delivered social justice and social equity, that it philosophically regards those two things as incompatible. That could not be further from the truth. Not only has this government delivered the greatest fairness in the workplace any nation can have - that is, we have a 33-year low in unemployment - not only have we seen massive increases in real wages, not only have we seen a significant reduction in industrial relations disputes, so that the take-home pay of Australians is not diminished by absurd union-introduced strikes, but last week we had some ABS statistics which delivered the most comprehensive evidence yet of just how fair Australia has become under this government.The ABS figures released last week show that only the top 40 per cent of households pay net tax after cash and in-kind benefits are taken into account. Can I say again for the benefit of the Leader of the Opposition, who accuses us of social injustice, who accuses us of not worrying about the battlers and who says that we have thrown the fair go out the back door, that the independent statistician shows that only the top 40 per cent of households pay net tax after cash and in-kind benefits are taken into account. The ABS reports the following:Low income households receive more social benefits in cash and social transfers in kind and pay less taxes than high income households.This is hardly the society of a government that regards economic prosperity and social justice as incompatible. This is in fact the outcome, the human dividend, of a government that set out from the moment it was elected in 1996 to make sure that the growing prosperity of this nation was fairly shared amongst all of its people. That is what has happened. I acknowledge that there remain in our community people who are not sharing to the full - all societies have that no matter how prosperous they are. But this proposition that we have been a rich man's government is totally false. We have been a government for all of the Australian people. We have been a government that have deliberately redistributed income in favour of the less well off in the Australian community. The ABS concludes:The net effect of benefits and taxes is to increase the average income of households in the lower income groups, and decrease the average income of households in the higher income groups.Once again, that is not the action of a government that regards prosperity and social justice as being incompatible. The other limb of the opposition leader's attack on us has been his now absolutely discredited claims about productivity. The Leader of the Opposition has had two mantras in the last six months: there is no social justice under the Howard government - that is the social mantra - and we may be doing well in a superficial way but productivity is falling and therefore the economy is being poorly run, which is the economic mantra.The truth is that the Leader of the Opposition has been caught out by his own advisers. He deceived the Australian people on AM last week. If he did not deceive the Australian people on AM last week when he could not answer a simple question about productivity, he demonstrated a total misunderstanding of basic economic concepts. The truth is that productivity is on the rise in Australia. There was a temporary lull in productivity because of the lag in output, particularly in the mining sector, in line with the fall in unemployment and also the impact of the drought. I would like to remind the Leader of the Opposition that one of the first questions he asked me on 7 December 2006, after the release of the September quarter 2006 national accounts, was this:_ is it not implausible to blame the drought, as you did yesterday, for the government's failure to come anywhere near its growth target?That was the question he asked, and he was telling the House that it was implausible to blame the drought. Yet in the very perceptive leaked memo, under the heading 'Some of the slowdown in productivity has been cyclical', the following statement is contained: 'The drought and the significant cuts to agricultural production are another temporary factor impacting on productivity growth.' So this man has been caught out deceiving the Australian people both on social justice and on productivity. The two arms of his attack on the government over the last six months have been completely cut off by the statistics of the ABS and out of the mouths of his own advisers.</DOC>

 - I am intrigued every time the Leader of the Opposition talks about the mining boom. It sounds as though he wants it to come to an end, and maybe that is because he knows that if his industrial relations policy is introduced it will come to an end. The Leader of the Opposition in that speech he made in December last year was talking about two vastly different visions on display before the Australian people. There are vastly different visions on display before the Australian people in relation to many things, and in relation to the resources boom our vision is that if we pursue the right domestic policies there is no reason why the resources boom should not continue for years into the future. That is the philosophy of the coalition parties.The philosophy of those who sit opposite is that somehow or other the mining boom has been a complete accident, that it is going to come to an end - if Joe McDonald and Kevin Reynolds get their way, it will come to an end; they will see to that - and that we might as well assume that it is going to come to an end. I have greater faith in the resourcefulness of the mining industry of this country. I have greater faith in the bilateral relations between Australia and China, between Australia and Japan, and between Australia and Korea to believe that with the right mix of domestic and foreign policy the resources boom can be continued for years into the future. So the vision is between the soaring optimism and hope of those on this side of the parliament in relation to the mining boom and the dreary pessimism of those who miserably sit opposite.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I have seen recent analysis of Australian productivity, some of it all right and some of it downright awful. The awful analysis that I have seen commenced on the AM program on 14 June 2007, when our Leader of the Opposition decided to take up the interviewer Chris Uhlmann by saying:The premise of your question, that productivity growth, by the way, has been rising in recent years, is just plain wrong _That is what he said: 'just plain wrong'. And Chris Uhlmann said:It's in the national accounts._            _            _Have you seen the recent national accounts?Well, there was no answer to that question as to whether he had seen the recent national accounts, so Uhlmann tried it again:Are you saying there's no productivity growth in the recent national accounts?_ RUDD: _ if you look at the budget papers _The budget papers are not the national accounts. Uhlmann continued:_ the national accounts are the latest figures. Are you saying there is no productivity growth there?At this moment, for those of you who watched cartoons when you were young, we have a moment when you hope someone pulls a lever and you just disappear into the ground. Here he is, on AM, saying that there has been no increase in productivity; he is asked about the national accounts, and it is clear that the Leader of the Opposition does not know what the national accounts are, let alone what they say. Somebody pull the lever and hope that he just disappears! What happened next is almost as instructive.The Leader of the Opposition then goes back to his office, having been humiliated on AM, and he demands that someone give him the answer to the question that Chris Uhlmann asked him. I must say I was lucky enough to come into possession of this answer. It is called 'Leader's meeting policy brief' - topic: productivity; adviser: Tim Dixon, John O'Mahony and Ankit Kumar; and purpose: 'To provide a response to the questions on productivity you were asked yesterday,' on 14 June. It does not matter - it is only 24 hours late, but Tim Dixon, John O'Mahony and Ankit Kumar come up with the figures. I am pleased that this has been sent to the government, and I would like to record my appreciation, because what this shows is not only did he not know the answers but, when the answers came to him, what were they? The answers were that the government was right and he was wrong. Listen to this. This is what they say. -  - All three of them on the other side of the table need a big gasp at this point! I would ask the attendants to stop giving out vodka, if I may! I would take a double shot, if I were you, at this point. After he has flunked the question and asked for the answer, this is what he is told:Given growth in employment and hours, this implies accelerating productivity growth in the non-farm sector.So he is told there is accelerating productivity growth in the non-farm sector. What would the explanation be as to prior to the national accounts? Why would they have been down if there is accelerating productivity? This is what his advisers tell him:Some of the slowdown in productivity growth has been cyclical. There has been significant investment in mining, but long lead times mean that we have not yet seen this translate into increased output. When this investment does flow through to higher output, productivity will likely accelerate.That is what he is told. He asked a question a moment ago about the mining boom. If you just looked at the productivity figures, you would think that mining has become suddenly unproductive. Has the mining industry in this country become suddenly unproductive? No. What has happened is it has engaged in huge investment which has not yet worked out into production. When it does, you will get an acceleration in productivity. You do not have to take my word for it, because this is in the memo from Tim Dixon to the Leader of the Opposition. They go on to say:What else could have affected productivity?They say:The drought and significant cuts to agricultural production are another temporary factor impacting on productivity growth. Non-farm productivity growth has been stronger than overall productivity and is showing signs of a sharp pick-up.So here is his advice: productivity is accelerating, it will accelerate further when the mining investment leads to increased production, and it will accelerate further when you get a recovery in the agricultural production. That is what he has been advised. The one thing you have got to say is he has got front to come to the dispatch box and ask a question about productivity today. Having comprehensively, 24 hours after the event, explained why he was wrong and why his central argument cannot be maintained, what do they actually advise him? They say:The final statistic on the year 2006-07 will only be available in September after the release of the June quarter national accounts. It is likely the outcome will be higher than estimated in the budget. Nevertheless, our view is that you should continue to cite the budget estimate.In other words, you are wrong about the national accounts, you are wrong about the reasons but you keep on referring to the argument nonetheless. It reminds me of previous claims by the ALP. Remember a $600 payment that was not real? Remember the productivity that was not real? This is a man who not only was wrong but, when he was caught in his error, rather than confront the truth, wants to maintain the falsehood. He wanted to maintain the falsehood right up until he walked to the dispatch box here today. He does not understand and he cannot be trusted. What more do you want to know about this Leader of the Opposition?</DOC>

 - I agree with the Leader of the Opposition's economic advisers. The Leader of the Opposition's economic advisers have not got it wrong - they pointed out that he had it wrong. I also agree with the observations made by the Governor of the Reserve Bank when he recently gave testimony before the House of Representatives committee on economics. The truth is that the Leader of the Opposition does not understand the first thing about productivity. The more questions he asks about this, the more he reveals -  - his complete ignorance on this subject. - He has made productivity -  - For six months this Leader of the Opposition has assailed the government on one economic issue above all others, and that has been the alleged decline in productivity -  - The last national accounts demonstrate that in the last two recorded quarters there has been an increase, cumulatively, of two per cent in productivity - 1.4 and 0.6. I am not going to annualise those figures. I am not going to say, 'Well, that means that productivity is going to be four per cent for the financial year,' but what those figures do indicate -  - For six months, the central claim of the Leader of the Opposition has been that productivity has been declining. We have now had national accounts covering part of the period that he has been Leader of the Opposition, and they show that productivity has gone up during that period. For six months he has been telling the Australian public an absolute porky. - He has been representing to the Australian public something he now knows was completely false and completely misleading. When confronted on the AM program the other day, he demonstrated either a total determination to deceive the Australian people or a total ignorance of the fundamentals of his own economic attacks. It is not as if productivity were one of a number of elements of economic attack on the government - it has been the central proposition. His social attack was unfairness; his economic attack was productivity. Last week he came unstuck on both of them, and the more questions he asks about productivity, the more he demonstrates an abysmal failure to understand the first thing about the economic concept of productivity.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Bass for his question, recognising that that electorate in regional Tasmania can certainly use the investment the government has proposed to make in broadband right across regional Australia. We are going to provide to 99 per cent of Australians access to high-speed broadband as a result of the announcement made by the Prime Minister yesterday through the Australia Connected investment program. It goes without saying that in this age of rapidly developing technology regional Australians need to get access to what is a significant productivity boost, the same as constituents in metropolitan Australia. It is certainly vital for business to remain connected and to be able to compete and be efficient in doing business both domestically and internationally.As has been pointed out in question time, on all of these issues - whether they be about productivity or the great debate on the availability of broadband - the strategy of the Leader of the Opposition and the Labor Party is to mislead and misinform and then to continue to reinforce that. We have just seen that with the leaked document regarding the Leader of the Opposition's outing on productivity last week. When it was indicated to him by his staff that he was wrong, he continued to misinform and mislead us as to the best political way forward. It is the same with the debate on broadband. The Leader of the Opposition and a whole range of frontbenchers denigrate the technology that we are proposing to roll out across Australia by 2009 to give 99 per cent of Australians access to speeds in excess of 12 megabits per second.This is technology that is not just being deployed in Australia; it is being deployed around the world. It is proven technology. The fact is that in the United States in the next 12 months there will be 100 million customers getting access to WiMAX wireless technology. So instead of accessing technology that is being introduced into the United States, the largest economy in the world, years later, we are getting it rolled out in Australia, and into regional Australia particularly, at the same time. Major global companies such as Intel and Motorola are investing in WiMAX wireless technology.All the Labor Party have been able to do in the last 24 hours is attack the technology. They will attack the process, but they will not make one comment on their policy or their alternative. I have called their alternative 'Fraudband by 2013'. The Labor Party have a few fundamental questions to answer about fraudband, like: where is the technical backing for it; who will be excluded under Labor's plan; when will Labor release costings; how will Labor provide for the future needs of regional Australia; and why do Australians have to wait until 2013 to get access to faster broadband under the Labor policy?It only came to the member for Hunter today to answer some of those questions in a doorstop interview. This morning he answered some of those questions about Labor's plan by saying, 'Well, those things are yet to be tested.' He went on to say, 'Obviously there may be some people excluded from that.' Then he said - and this is the best of all - 'We don't have the technical backing to make those final conclusions.' Yet the Leader of the Opposition has been out presenting to the people of Australia a plan whereby, he maintains, he only has to spend $4.7 billion worth of taxpayers' money, stolen from the Communications Fund for the bush, to get 12 megabits of speed right across Australia - or, he claims, to 98 per cent of Australia. We maintain it will only reach 75 per cent of Australians. But the member for Hunter said it: 'We don't have the technical backing to make those final conclusions.'The people of Australia want to see broadband by 2009, not 2013. They should support Australia Connected, not Labor's fraudband.</DOC>

 - The person who is wrong is the Leader of the Opposition; it is not the Reserve Bank Governor. The Leader of the Opposition, in a flash of candour, says that you cannot extrapolate from a short period, but that is exactly what the opposition has done. The productivity growth in the Australian economy for the year 2005-06 reflected the long-term average of 2.3 per cent. It was only in the early part of 2006-07 that there was a temporary fall in productivity. The explanation for that is best contained in some testimony given to the Senate estimates in February this year by Treasury officials. I remind the Leader of the Opposition, in reading out the Treasury testimony, that fundamentally productivity is output per worker. Therefore, you have to measure levels of employment with levels of investment and levels of output. This is the key to this whole debate. This is what the Treasury had to say to the Senate in February 2007:_ the level of productivity in the mining sector has been falling through this mining boom. We have seen massive increases in employment in the mining sector, but so far increases in output are relatively muted compared to the employment growth._            _            _So part of the slowdown in productivity that we have seen in the last several years is in fact due to that shock. The economy is adjusting, and you would expect over time that that shock would unwind and we would run at a higher rate of productivity.What has happened is that the Leader of the Opposition has lighted on a particularly short period, explained by the very phenomenon to which the Treasury officials refer -  - plus the impact of the drought. Out of that, in his ignorance, he has tried to extrapolate a long-term decline in productivity. He is wrong to do that. He has deceived the Australian people in trying to do that. It has taken a leaked document from his own advisers to expose him for the fraud that he is on this subject.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Greenway for her question. I have seen the New South Wales budget which was handed down today. On an underlying cash basis, it projects that the New South Wales budget deficit will be $2.4 billion in the current financial year and around $2 billion in 2007-08. Let me say that again: the New South Wales government is budgeting for a deficit in the current financial year, in the next financial year and right across the forward estimates. When you add up the state Labor governments, collectively the state Labor governments are budgeting for deficits right across the forward estimates. There is only one level of government that is running a surplus budget in Australia, and it is the Commonwealth government. Let me make this point: we would not have been doing that if Labor had been successful in defeating all of the measures that we proposed which were necessary to do it.Let me also say that, with New South Wales being the final state to now put its budget down in terms of its borrowing requirements for the four years across the forward estimates, the state governments collectively will borrow, across the forward estimates, $57.3 billion. And, if you add in their borrowings in this current year, 2006-07, they will borrow $70 billion - $70 billion! So here you are: the coalition gets elected and it wipes out Labor's $96 billion federal debt. Yet we have watched the states, over five years, run up $70 billion of state debt. The Commonwealth is adding to savings; we have our Future Fund which is adding to savings. And the states are borrowing - $70 billion. They are out in financial markets borrowing against the private sector.This has been a very big change - state Labor governments going into deficit. They were not in deficit a year or two ago. This has been a very big switch. This was the point that the Reserve Bank Governor picked up on when he was interviewed about fiscal policy. Ian Macfarlane was quoted in the Weekend Australian of 12 August 2006 as saying:I have been lucky - for most of my time, fiscal policy has consisted of small surpluses.So the movement in the government account has not been big enough to be important in the consideration of monetary policy.It might become an issue because the states are now part of the equation.So here we are: the Commonwealth has been saving; the Commonwealth has been running surpluses; the Commonwealth has been taking pressure off monetary policy. The states are now running deficits; the states are borrowing $70 billion; the states are now putting pressure on monetary policy.Whatever Labor say federally, just have a look at what Labor are doing at the state level. Labor never had the wit to balance the budget. They opposed this government. They never had the wit to pay off debt. They opposed this government. Their state governments are out borrowing $70 billion over five years. And, if you want to know what an incompetent Labor federal government would do, just have a look at the incompetent state Labor governments. It is a risk to the budget position and it is a risk to the monetary prospects of all Australians.</DOC>

 - The Leader of the Opposition is flailing around like a drowning man on this subject because he does not really understand that productivity is output per worker. And what he has tried to grab hold of is this occurrence in the Australian economy occasioned by the combination of the drought and the huge investment in and growth of employment in the mining industry which has not thus far been matched by increases in output. As soon as it is matched by an increase in output, you will see, in the words of Treasury's advisers to the Senate estimates in February 2007, an unwinding of what it calls a shock, and that productivity will run at a higher level.Just to inform the Leader of the Opposition again: up to the end of 2005-06, productivity growth was 2.3 per cent, which was in line with Australia's long-run average. We had a fall in the early part of the next financial year due to the combination of what happened in the mining industry and the drought, although the Leader of the Opposition pretended, when he asked me a question in this House in December of last year, that it was implausible to hold the drought in any way responsible for the fall in productivity, even though his advisers, in the leaked memorandum that has seen the light of day, indicated that the drought did have a major part to play. So, through a combination of the drought and what happened in the mining industry, we saw in the early part of this financial year a fall in productivity, despite the fact that in the previously concluded financial year productivity was running at 2.3 per cent, which is the long-term measure.Focusing just on the early part of this financial year, he throws up his arms in horror; he lights upon a very segmented set of statistics to try and demonstrate his case, and when he is confronted with the national accounts on AM he either professes ignorance of them or demonstrates that he does not understand the basic concept of productivity. The truth is that the last two national accounts have shown a recovery in productivity. The last two national accounts are bearing out the testimony of the Treasury officials at Senate estimates in February 2007, and the last two national accounts have demonstrated once again that the Leader of the Opposition does not know the first thing about a fundamental economic concept - namely, productivity.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Mallee for his question, and I am delighted to answer it, representing the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts. The honourable member for Mallee well knows how the government's broadband policy announced yesterday, Australia Connected, will benefit his electorate and all of Australia. For instance, I note that the 3,800 people living in Kerang, in his electorate, will receive an exchange upgrade to very fast ADSL2+ broadband. There will also be some 24 new wireless broadband sites, WiMAX sites, across the electorate, including in the towns of Bannerton, Dimboola, Dooen, Macorna, Shelford, Quambatook and Wycheproof. There are 24 towns in the Mallee that are part of the 1,361 new WiMAX sites across Australia that will begin coming online in September this year.So the member for Mallee has a story to tell, but then again so does every member of the government, wherever they represent an electorate, because 99 per cent of Australians will receive a benefit under the government's broadband policy and, for the one per cent, we will continue the subsidy of $2,750 to maintain broadband access. Compare that to the Labor Party's broadband policy, which covers only 75 per cent of Australia's population - and the remaining 25 per cent are not catered for. Too bad if you live in some of the towns in the member for Mallee's electorate that I have just mentioned or even in some of the regional centres such as Ballarat, Traralgon, Bendigo, Orange and so on.But as we all know, telecommunications is ever evolving, and we as a government need to continually invest in it where there is market failure or disadvantage, especially in rural and remote areas. That is why we have the $2 billion Communications Fund. That will provide, on average, $400 million of interest every three years which will be invested in infrastructure throughout regional Australia. It could be for mobile phone towers, broadband access or even back-haul fibre capabilities. So it is terribly important to have that fund.I am asked by the honourable member for Mallee what the threats are to security of services in rural regions. Obviously the Labor Party's policy to abolish the fund is a threat. They will abolish the $2 billion Communications Fund. The Labor Party have a policy that covers only 75 per cent of Australians, and you can easily deduce where the bulk of the remaining 25 per cent of Australians will live - regional and remote Australia. And they hope to pay for that policy by abolishing a $2 billion fund set up in perpetuity to continue to invest in regional Australia. The Labor Party simply cannot help themselves. They do not have the fiscal discipline. They will always steal from the piggy bank.For that reason, the government is going to legislate to protect the $2 billion Communications Fund in perpetuity. So there will be no sleight of hand, there will be no smoke and mirrors, should the Labor Party come to government; they will have to come into this chamber and legislate the abolition of the $2 billion Communications Fund established for regional Australia. The Labor Party cannot be trusted to manage telecommunications policy now - and certainly not in government. For that reason, we will institute the legislative guarantees necessary to protect regional and rural Australia.</DOC>

 - I have learnt from long experience not to accept from those who sit opposite analysis of statements by my colleagues. But, while I am on my feet, let me take the opportunity to say how very pleased I am with the very positive response to the plan outlined yesterday by the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts. - I was asked a question about the radius from each site and the capacity under the respective plans. According to my advice, under the Labor plan, the broadband speeds they speak of would only be available four kilometres from the exchange; whereas ours will be a minimum of 20 kilometres from the base station. Under the Labor plan, the speed will be 12 megabits per second. Under our plan, it is between 12 and 50 megabits per second. The cost to the taxpayer of the fibre network to be built by the Labor Party if they win office will be $4.7 billion. The cost to the taxpayer of a network built after a competitive bid process if the government's plan goes through will be a big fat zero. Under our policy, the completion date for 99 per cent of the population having access to very fast broadband will be the middle of 2009. That is in just two years time. The completion date of the Labor Party policy will be, at the best estimate, 2013 - which is six years from now. I warmly thank the member for Melbourne for his question, as it has given me an opportunity to compare and contrast many of the benefits of the government's policy.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kalgoorlie for his question. I thoroughly enjoy visiting his electorate, which has 3.4 per cent unemployment and is certainly a revenue bowl for the nation. As the member for Kalgoorlie knows, the construction industry is very important to the mining industry. That is how we are able to take advantage of the ripe global opportunity and take advantage of the resources boom. Construction is a crucial part of that equation, and the Howard government has got the balance right. When we identified some years ago that there was a level of corruption and thuggery in the building industry, we initiated a royal commission and responded directly by putting in place stronger laws and a fully independent watchdog to ensure that thuggery and corruption were not part and parcel of the building industry in Australia - and our timing was very good.There has been a lot of talk today about productivity, and I would like to add my little bit. In fact, I would like to say something about John Holland. A document from John Holland says that Australian workplace agreements are essential for the $90 billion construction sector to achieve further productivity gains of up to 20 per cent. Hang on, the Leader of the Opposition is in this place complaining about low productivity, and his own policies threaten productivity improvements in the construction industry. That is why you have to look carefully at what Labor does, not at what it says. You have to look carefully. That applies in its tough talk with union bosses. We have seen, when it comes to the construction industry, the behaviour of Dean Mighell - the head of the Electrical Trades Union in Victoria - and we all remember the Leader of the Opposition saying, 'I'm so outraged about Dean Mighell's behaviour, I am going to have him sacked from the Labor Party.'There has been an eerie silence about the behaviour in Western Australia of Joe McDonald and Kevin Reynolds, of the CFMEU. Bear in mind that the CFMEU are the single biggest donors to any political party in Australia, and I will give you a hint, Mr Speaker: it is not the Liberal Party, it is not the National Party and - it's hard to believe - it is not even the Greens. The CFMEU are the biggest bankrollers of the Labor Party in Australia. We saw a report today about the behaviour of the people in the CFMEU, our Labor Party royal family. A report today says, 'Union men caught on tape heaping abuse on manager'. I am not going to repeat the words that they used on the building site. I think that is unparliamentary and I think we have heard enough of various expletives, even though I can say that our old friend Joe McDonald was calling a builder an expletive thieving parasite dog who would end up working at Hungry Jack's should there be a change of government. That is what he is about. After seven minutes of abuse, where Mr Dave Noonan, the head of the CFMEU; Joe McDonald; and three others took a posse to a building site in Western Australia to close down the building site - they were so concerned about productivity that they were trying to close down the site -  - Leading the charge was Dave Noonan, the head of the CFMEU. I thought, 'Dave Noonan; that is a familiar name.' I thought to myself, 'I saw a weekend report about Dave Noonan.' That report said that the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition were at a Labor Party fundraiser in Brisbane last Friday at the Hilton Hotel, 'over asparagus spears with Tasmanian salmon and rib fillet with oxtail ragout'. 
A government member - Dinner with the workers! - Yes, dinner with the battlers at the Hilton Hotel, over Tasmanian salmon and rib fillet - at $5,000 a table! They said there were construction people there, but do you know who was there? Dave Noonan. Imagine if you were the poor old builder in Western Australia, you had Dave Noonan trying to close down your site 12 months ago, you paid $5,000 to the Labor Party, and he is sitting next to you at lunch! Can you imagine that? That is not value for money. I will tell you what that is. That is proof positive that Dave Noonan, the CFMEU and the union bosses are front and centre of the Labor Party. They are the heart and soul of the Labor Party. If these people can get away with behaving in a thuggish manner under our laws and our independent watchdog, what do you think they will do should Kevin Rudd be elected? It will be free rein for the union bosses on construction sites around Australia, and if you want to know what that means for productivity just go and ask John Holland.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Gilmore for her question and say to her and to all members of this House that, while the state governments have shamefully allowed some 650,000 Australians to languish on public dental waiting lists, the Howard government has beefed up Medicare dental coverage for people with chronic disease and contributing poor oral health. Some 200,000 patients will be eligible for up to $2,000 a year in Medicare funded dental treatment. I know that thousands of people in Gilmore are looking forward to the chance to make use of this option.Naturally enough, the government's proposal was not good enough for the Labor Party, because we had the member for Gellibrand going out and promising in response that everyone earning under average weekly earnings would get free dental care. - There it was splashed all over the front page of the Sunday Age of 3 June: 'Smile - it's free dental care', an exclusive from Jason Koutsoukis. - It said:People earning average income or below would have free dental care under a Labor plan to solve the nation's teeth crisis.There was only one problem: giving 16 million people just one hour of free dental care would cost $4.7 billion. Uh-oh! Oops! We have Medicare Gold mark II. If Medicare Gold was the turkey of the last election, 'Dentistry Gold' is going to be the turkey of the next election.Someone else must have had that thought as well because, funnily enough, somewhere between the first edition and the last edition the story slipped off the banner and the supportive editorial somehow disappeared. I wonder who might have been on the phone. I wonder whether the Leader of the Opposition might have made another one of his famous phone calls to editors, using the kind of language that would make Dean Mighell blush. The next day, out came an internal memo to ALP candidates. I quote from this leaked document: 'There have been reports that Labor has announced free dental care for everyone earning under average income. We understand that some candidates are receiving calls on this. Labor's policy has actually not yet been announced.'In fact, it had been announced; it had been announced by the member for Gellibrand on the front page of the Sunday Age the previous day - it is just that she was disowned. The member for Lalor's Medicare Gold policy lasted two years before it was killed off; the member for Gellibrand's 'Dentistry Gold' policy did not even make it to the final edition. What a shocking humiliation and repudiation for the member for Gellibrand. She has only put out one press release in her own name since then. Normally, there are blizzards of useless press releases from the member for Gellibrand, but there has only been one in the fortnight since then. There is a clear message for the Leader of the Opposition here: if you do not have a credible health shadow, you cannot have a credible health policy and, without a credible health policy, you are not fit to form a government in this country.</DOC>

 - Obviously, the member for Bruce was not listening very well last night in the Main Committee when these matters were canvassed over a quarter of an hour. What occurred was pretty straightforward. A journalist indicated that the Australian Electoral Commission had made a statement that the Kirribilli function could be disclosable. We knew that the Electoral Commission had not requested any information and therefore could not make such a statement. Peter Phelps, on behalf of me, the Special Minister of State, simply contacted the Electoral Commission to determine what the Electoral Commission had actually said to the journalist. The Electoral Commission officer indicated that he had answered a question that was a hypothetical question not in relation to Kirribilli, and we ensured that the Electoral Commission knew that the media statement was going to be different.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and his interest. This government assisted with the liberation of the people of Afghanistan from the Taliban regime. After the events of 9/11 in 2001 we provided substantial aid to Afghanistan. We are building up to just short of, I think, 1,000 troops in Afghanistan at the moment. Australia has made a great contribution. The Afghans now have a freely elected parliament, seven million children - including two million girls - are back at school, 83 per cent of the population has access to basic health services and GDP growth has been about 12 to 14 per cent since 2002.It is a country with a lot of problems - there is still a lot of violence there, and there is a need for troops in Afghanistan today - but Australia has made a strong contribution. That was recognised by the Afghan foreign minister, who wrote to me last week expressing his appreciation for our troops, who are doing their vital work there, including the additional 300 troops we announced quite recently. Australia and, in particular, the Australian Defence Force have made a great contribution there. I think the House realises that there is no greater decision that a government ever takes than to send our troops into a combative environment. It is a very difficult decision, and whenever we have made those decisions there has been substantial discussion within the government, understandably.It is with that in mind that on this side of the House we are pretty surprised that the Leader of the Opposition, just on the basis of a 'news crawl', as they are called, on Sky television, decided to rush out and say he was delighted about and the opposition supported the deployment of an additional 300 troops to Afghanistan, which the government had not announced. In fact, the Leader of the Opposition had seen those troops off on 15 May. I do not think he forgot; I think he saw the news crawl and thought, 'There's another news opportunity; I'd better get out there.'If the Leader of the Opposition were a serious leader, not just somebody acting on the advice of Hawker Britton and playing a bit of politics day by day, he would, firstly, have contacted members of his shadow cabinet and, secondly, made sure his office or he himself contacted the government to find out what the deployment was about, because there is no more serious decision that the government makes than to deploy our troops. - But apparently the gravity of such a decision did not weigh on the Leader of the Opposition, who rushes to a media conference, because that is what is really important to the Leader of the Opposition, without any sincere concern about what may or may not be happening with the government's deployments.It is part of a pattern of a kind of instant policymaking in foreign affairs by the opposition under this Leader of the Opposition. He pretends to be some sort of an expert on international relations - that is part of the marketing that he does with the media and elsewhere - but the reality is that there is a pattern of ad hoc media based decision making. He was going to China to fix up relations with China on climate change and suddenly he decided to cancel that trip because of so-called scheduling problems. We know it was nothing to do with scheduling problems. The pattern is there. The opposition leader stands before the nation as somebody who went out there and supported 300 troops being deployed - who were not being deployed - without even bothering to check. Given the gravity of the deployment of troops, that demonstrates the sort of person we are dealing with in the Leader of the Opposition.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and recognise his and his constituents' very keen interest in and knowledge of water resources. The National Plan for Water Security is the most significant reform to water management in our nation's history. It is designed to ensure that our irrigated agriculture uses water most efficiently, that we make every drop count - a particularly important objective as we move into hotter and drier times in southern Australia. It is also designed to ensure that the management of the Murray-Darling Basin reflects the hydrological reality of one large, connected system of surface and groundwater resources and, in doing that, seeks to change the way in which the basin has been managed, or perhaps mismanaged, for more than a century.We have been working very closely with four states and the Australian Capital Territory - five other jurisdictions - to bring the national plan to completion. It is fair to say that the state of Victoria has had a different view from the very outset as to what the plan should involve. But we have recently had very constructive discussions with the Victorian government. Only last week I had a very lengthy, detailed and constructive discussion, which went over four hours and through every page of the legislation, with my Victorian counterpart. Today, officials from all jurisdictions are meeting again and going through the detail. I am confident that we can reach an agreement that will enable us to bring this great vision to completion - a vision which would not be possible without the commitment of the Howard government to undertaking innovative measures, long-term measures, to deal with longstanding problems and without the financial security that more than a decade of strong economic management and the repayment of Labor's debt have enabled it to afford.I also thank the honourable member for asking me about stock and domestic water. Mr Speaker, as you in particular would know, landholders have a basic right to draw on water from contiguous surface and groundwater for the purpose of watering their stock and providing water for their domestic purposes. Stock and domestic purposes do not include irrigated agriculture. Nor do they include intensive animal husbandry such as feedlots. Stock and domestic water is not limited by volume; it is limited by the purpose for which it can be used. It is not charged for, like irrigation water is, because it is seen as a right inherent to the ownership of the land itself. The Commonwealth recognises and respects those rights. They are protected in the legislation of the basin states - in fact, in all states - and there is no intention to qualify or limit them in any way at all.Concern has been expressed in some quarters about the metering of stock and domestic bores. Let me confirm that there is no intention to require metering of stock and domestic bores except in special circumstances where a particular groundwater system is under stress or where there are local disputes about water sharing. Those circumstances are canvassed in the National Water Initiative. Better metering and monitoring of water, of course, is a vital element in the national plan and essential for sustainable and informed management of our water and, in particular, our groundwater resources. In the rare cases where metering of stock and domestic bores is warranted, the cost should not be borne by the landholder other than with his or her agreement.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Barker for the question. Representing one of Australia's major wool-growing areas, as he does, he would be interested to know that this year marks the 200th anniversary of the export of the first bale of Australian wool - essentially Australia's first export. There is a function in London tomorrow night to commemorate the arrival of John Macarthur's first bale 200 years ago. Wool has played a very important role in Australia's exporting history over the years. In the 1950s it was said that Australia rode on the sheep's back and, in reality, wool was a very important part of our exporting. It is still one of our major export commodities, particularly amongst our primary sector, and it is making a very substantial contribution to our nation's export effort.In commemorating 200 years of Australian exporting, it is interesting to observe that it took 190 years for Australia's exports to reach $100 billion in a year. It has only taken the 11 years of this coalition government for us to double that number to $210 billion. So this has been a government that has been good for exporters. We have provided enormous opportunities to open up new markets and to ensure the prosperity of the Australian economy through our export sector. This government has particularly supported the farm sector in trying to open up new markets and to find new opportunities for Australian products.Unfortunately, it seems that not all members of the House share the view that it is important to open up new markets for our export sector. The opposition spokesman on trade put out a press release in the last 24 hours or so in which he made the observation that if negotiations are stalled because of issues in one particular sector, such as agriculture, then the government should go on with negotiations with other sectors. He said that this is Labor's policy. So it is Labor's policy that if there are any problems in agricultural negotiations - as there almost always are - then we should forget about agriculture and go on and do other things. That is the kind of mentality that Labor came away from the Uruguay Round with. They dudded farmers in the Uruguay Round. But they did make a promise, along with other countries, that these issues would be resolved in the Doha Round.Now Labor are telling us that, if things get tough in the Doha Round on Agriculture, they will walk away from the farmers, do nothing for farmers, and go on to negotiate with other sectors. That is not our approach to trade. We want comprehensive agreements that deliver benefits for all sectors, including farmers and including wool growers, and that is the approach we will be taking to trade discussions. This is an important approach. It differentiates us from those opposite and helps look to deliver export opportunities for all Australians who have interests in exporting around the world.</DOC>

 - I think Glenn Stevens is a first-class Reserve Bank governor, and he has spoken a great deal of common sense in the testimony he has made. He certainly understands more about productivity than the Leader of the Opposition does. I have had the opportunity to look at a report released overnight by the OECD. This report has something very interesting to say about two subjects of great interest to the Leader of the Opposition - namely, productivity and labour market regulation. I listened to the Leader of the Opposition very carefully, in an interview with Fran Kelly on the ABC Radio National program this morning, and he seemed to be arguing a number of things. One of the things he was arguing was that Labor Party policy would make our workplaces more productive. That is what he was arguing - that we really need to wind back the industrial relations clock so that we can wind our productivity forward. The problem with that is that it was blown out of the water overnight by none other than the OECD. In table 2.1 of the report, when it spoke of the possible links between labour market policy and productivity, it had this to say:Strict statutory or contractual employment protection for regular workers impedes flexibility and slows the movement of labour resources into new high productivity activities.What that means is that if you bring back the unfair dismissal laws, you will deliver a very serious blow -  -  - I know the sound effects man doesn't like this, but if you bring back the unfair dismissal laws, which Labor has pledged to do, according to the OECD this will strike a blow at the movement of workers into high-productivity activities. I thank the Leader of the Opposition for concentrating on productivity. He is demonstrating yet again an abysmal misunderstanding of some fundamental economic concepts.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Stirling. I know he is very interested in, and well informed about, productivity. I am very happy to inform the House that when the government assumed office in 1996 the level of unemployment in Stirling was 9.4 per cent, and it is now 5.2 per cent. The member has asked me about trends in relation to productivity. In answering that question, I recommend that he not take the advice tendered by the Leader of the Opposition on Radio National this morning. What the Leader of the Opposition was doing this morning was deliberately using different figures in relation to the claims that he was making about productivity. If you listened very carefully, just on the surface it sounded okay. He said that between 1993 and 1998 we were running at annual average productivity growth of 3.3 per cent, between 1998 and 2003 that fell to 2.1 per cent, and then he went on to say: 'If you look at Mr Costello's Intergenerational report, the projected annual productivity growth for the decade we are currently in is only 1.5 per cent per year.' The problem with that is that he was using figures that were measured by different measures of productivity. The first two figures measured productivity movements in the market sector of the economy, and the second figure measured movements in the entire economy.In pointing out the duplicity of the Leader of the Opposition, I would have thought that the best authority I could quote was in fact the Productivity Commission itself. On its website, the Productivity Commission describes the difference between the two measures. The Productivity Commission says this:Whilst productivity can be measured for the economy as a whole, productivity in the market sector of the economy provides a more accurate indication of aggregate productivity. The market sector is where output can be reasonably well measured - by market transactions _ In 'non-market' industries, such as government administration, outputs are typically measured in terms of expenditure on inputs.What the Leader of the Opposition has deliberately done is to take what is by definition a measurement of productivity that would yield a low result and compare it with measurements of productivity which by definition would yield higher results. In the process, he has deliberately set out to mislead the Australian public in relation to this issue. He did not disclose this in the interview that he gave this morning. He must have known - or after the interview he would have been told by his advisers - that he had misled the Australian public. Once again we have the Leader of the Opposition faced with the dilemma of confessing to one of two sins: is he ignorant of what productivity represents in this country or, if not ignorant, has he deliberately misled the Australian public by falsely comparing a set of figures with another set of figures, knowing full well that the measurements and the definitions of those two figures are quite different? Everybody knows that it is difficult to measure productivity in government administration, in health and education services and in services generally, whereas it is very easy to measure productivity in mining and manufacturing. What the Leader of the Opposition did was to conflate the two in the interview this morning to give a completely false impression and to continue the process of deceiving and misleading the Australian people on what he says is the centrepiece of his economic attack on the government. The Leader of the Opposition ought to lift his head from his papers and face the reality that, again, he has deliberately deceived the Australian people.</DOC>

 - My view about the position of Australian families is that I recognise that some Australian families, no matter what the state of the economy might be, are finding it difficult. I accept that, but I would point out to the member for Lilley that, if you look at the overall figures, you see that they are very strong. We do have a 33-year low in unemployment. The spokesman for Treasury matters on the opposition side belongs to a party that boasted about the fact that real wages fell when it was in power. You actually boasted -  - Don't get too excited! - You boasted about the fact that you drove workers' wages down. It was a passionate conviction. They fell by 1.7 per cent when you were last in office, and they have risen by 20.8 per cent in a shorter period of time.But let me deal with the question of the alleged indebtedness of the Australian community. I point out to the Leader of the Opposition and to the shadow spokesman on Treasury matters that, overall, personal insolvency in Australia remains quite low. The Reserve Bank of Australia - and this is a very good measure - reports that, as at the end of December 2006, the ratio of non-performing to total housing loan on the banks' Australian books stood at 0.31 per cent, which is a very small proportion of the market. While we are into comparisons, this compares to a peak of 0.6 per cent of outstanding loans in 1996. So, if you look at the distressed section of the Australian economy measured by indebtedness, you will see it was 0.67 per cent in 1996 and it is now at 0.31 per cent. That suggests to me that things have got better rather than worse over the last 11 years.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Kingston for his question. I can inform the House that in the last 24 hours there has been another abysmal failure on the part of the opposition leader to come to grips with productivity. I would recommend to the Leader of the Opposition the old adage: 'If you are in a hole, stop digging' - because the more he digs, the more trouble he gets into. For example, he went on Radio National today and, in an attempt to prove that there had been a decline in productivity, he combined the ABS findings on labour productivity for the market sector with the IGR findings and assumptions on productivity for the total economy. They are two completely different measures. The market sector is much more easily measured because you measure it by output, but in the total economy you have areas like the Public Service, where it is very difficult to measure output. So the cycles of market sector productivity as reported in the national accounts are different to those for total productivity which are used for long-term assumptions in the IGR.But I do not hold the Leader of the Opposition entirely responsible for this, because when I went back to read the document that had been prepared for him by Tim Dixon, John O'Mahony and Ankit Kumar, I found that they had not themselves actually made that distinction in the 10-page briefing. Whilst I am dealing with this document, I should say in passing that it is worth recording that the Leader of the Opposition was vehemently protesting yesterday to journalists that this document had been stolen from the Labor Party, but there was one problem: the cameras had him leaving it in a public place and then demanding his staff go back and find it. I suppose he thinks it was stolen from him by his staff. That is another example of a Leader of the Opposition who always blames everybody else for his weaknesses. The document was not stolen or taken by the coalition. The camera does not lie: this document was lost by the Leader of the Opposition and him alone. It was lost in just the same way as his credibility was lost when he went on AM on 14 June. People in this House will know that I am very interested in and am counting down to 'fundamental injustice day', 30 June. Well, we have just passed fundamental incompetence day, 14 June, when the Leader of the Opposition went on AM -  -  - Even the member for Lilley thought that was a good one. He is enjoying the joke as much as I am.As if on cue, the OECD yesterday came out with an important piece of research which is on the correlation between increasing employment and productivity. What it finds -  - I would ask the member for Lilley not to interject. Every time he interjects, I think of that old Al Jolson song, 'Swanee - how I love ya, how I love ya'! Here is what the OECD reported on the correlation between more jobs and labour productivity:There is a negative correlation - listen to this - between employment growth and average measured labour productivity growth, which suggests that evaluating the success of employment enhancing structural reforms by measuring labour productivity can be misleading.What it is saying here is that, as you pull more people into the workforce as unemployment falls, particularly if you pull in people who are unskilled, because they are unskilled, rather than meeting the overall productivity of the workforce, they tend to have a negative effect. And they have a negative effect on the overall productivity of the workforce until such time as they have been in the workforce long enough to improve their skills, to move up to the averaged measure and eventually to increase it. That is why there is a negative correlation between increasing employment and labour productivity. In particular, the correlation is negative when unemployment is low and when, by definition, you are pulling into the workforce people of lower skills than you would be in the immediate aftermath of a recession, when you would be soaking up people who had been more recently put off.This is what the OECD finds:However, any slowdown in average measured productivity resulting directly from a change in employment is to a large extent a statistical artefact and does not imply that individual productivity has fallen. Its implications for policy evaluation therefore are not immediately obvious.Why do I mention that? Because anybody who thinks about it for a moment knows that, when you are pulling long-term unemployed into the labour market when unemployment is falling, people who do not have the same level of skill when they join the workforce will not have the same level of productivity. They will get it after years in the workforce. When you are pulling people off welfare and into work, they do not have the average productivity of the rest of the workforce. That is why the OECD says that, by pulling those people into employment, as a 'statistical artefact' you get a negative impact on labour productivity.Does that mean we should not pull them into the workforce? Does that mean we should say, 'Keep the long-term unemployed out of the workforce,' because we do not want to change our labour productivity figures? No, of course not. We want to bring those people into the workforce. We want to give them an opportunity in the general economy. We know it will have that effect, but we also know that over a period of time you will get a much stronger economy as a result.Those people who pull out these 'statistical artefacts' and try to make them a political point when they have no understanding of what they are talking about cannot be trusted with the Australian economy. They are not humane; they are not people who have the interests of the unemployed at heart. They are political charlatans.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Gwydir for his question. It is self-evident that the member for Gwydir has a great deal of interest in this issue, given that one of the recent announcements that we have made with regard to developing our strategy on rail infrastructure in the future resulted from a report from a study that was instigated by the member for Gwydir when he was the Deputy Prime Minister and the minister for transport. I refer to the Ernst &amp; Young study that was done on the north-south rail corridor between Melbourne and Brisbane. Last week I announced $15 million in funding to commission the next stage of this process, which is an engineering and scoping study to move the planning of this proposal forward so that it can be tested in the marketplace.We have maintained at every point that we would expect private sector investment to fund significantly the development of this inland rail corridor, but it is all about increasing our competitiveness and improving productivity in Australia. You need to continue to invest in much-needed infrastructure across the country to continue increasing competitiveness and productivity.The member for Gwydir would also be cognisant of the latest statistics in terms of the efficiency of one of the key coal rail corridors in Australia, following federal government investment in that corridor. I refer to the Hunter Valley coal line, where we see that the capacity of the coal line, as a result of our investment, is now ahead of the capacity of the port to be able to move that coal onto ships. It is only because of the investment of the Commonwealth government into that coal line, which we are managing through the ARTC, that that is happening. I draw to the House's attention the fact that it is not happening in Queensland, where the Queensland government is not investing.Investments like these mean that we can improve our efficiency in this area. One thing that the Ernst &amp; Young study did identify and highlight was that the freight task in Australia is going to double by 2020 and, unless we match that with the appropriate level of investment in infrastructure, it will have a detrimental impact on productivity. So we need to ensure that investment keeps pace with that growth in demand.The other positive aspects of this are the job creation opportunities that will be generated in electorates like that of the member for Gwydir, when construction takes place and the operation and servicing of a key transport linkage is implemented. That was also highlighted in the OECD report referred to by the Treasurer and the Prime Minister. That report confirms that employment growth in Australia is among the best in the industrialised world. Of the 29 most developed economies in the world, Australia is leading the way in terms of employment growth. This only happens through investment in infrastructure. We continue to get productivity growth only as a result of investment in infrastructure - like the inland rail proposal, like the investment we have in the coal line in the Hunter Valley that I have referred to, like the $22 billion we propose to invest in Australia's land transport program beyond 2009 and like the $1.8 billion that will be invested in communications infrastructure in regional Australia.The Leader of the Opposition should take a bit of notice of some of this. I know that he has been treading water a little in this debate about productivity. Maybe it highlights - if we go back to a comment that was made by him on the John Laws program in April - what his view is of normal levels of unemployment - and we have a particular view about unemployment on this side of the House. But he said to John Laws in that interview, 'Well, normal in the sense that it will be higher levels of unemployment rather than lower levels of unemployment in the future if the demand particularly out of China eases.' That is the point he makes. He will accept that unemployment is going to go up. Maybe that underpins his view of improving productivity: that he will generate more unemployment so that the productivity statistics improve - take 2.1 million Australians out of the workforce that we put into the workforce.On this side of the House, we believe in investing in infrastructure to drive long-term productivity. We believe in creating jobs to drive long-term productivity. We do not believe in normalised levels of higher unemployment; we believe in normalised levels of lower unemployment - and that is the stark difference between the coalition government and a Labor opposition.</DOC>

 - The government will not be funding any business campaigns any more than we will be funding any union campaigns. - The member allows me to make this comparison: the big difference with the links between the Australian Labor Party and the union movement is that the union movement run the Australian Labor Party. They have delegates at major party conferences. The campaign director for the union movement's campaign -  - Hello, we don't like this, do we! - It is well known that members of the trade union movement dominate ALP conferences. Members of the Business Council are not delegates to Liberal Party conferences. The campaign director for the trade union movement against Work Choices is none other than the Labor Party candidate for what is the seat of Shortland in the upcoming federal election. Any attempt to draw some kind of link between the Liberal Party and this campaign is absolute nonsense.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Bowman for his question. I can inform him that on 1 July the low-income tax offset will be increased from $600 to $750. It will apply over a greater income range to reduce tax for the lowest income earners in Australia. The lowest marginal tax rate will apply to $30,000, an increase in that threshold where the 30c rate cuts in. As a result of these changes, every Australian taxpayer will receive an income tax cut on 1 July and that is good news.There is a certain pattern to political life. One of the patterns to political life has been, in recent years, income tax cuts on 1 July. This is a government that cut income tax in 2000, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007. There is a certain pattern to Australian political life. Like the seasons, where we have summer, autumn, winter, spring, and the school year, where we have term 1, term 2, term 3, there is the political year: we have the budget, we have Fundamental Incompetence Day, we have Fundamental Injustice Day and then on 1 July we have an income tax cut. And the seasons move on.It is an open question as to whether or not the Labor Party is going to have a tax policy at the next election. I say it will not and they say that is a myth, but they cannot actually point to what it is. At the National Press Club, the member for Lilley said this:If we are going to have something large and complex, it would obviously have to be out earlier rather than later, but I'm not making a commitment one way or the other.He said: 'I'm not making a commitment as to whether it is large or small. I'm not making a commitment as to whether it will come out. I'm not making a commitment at all.' In the Adelaide Advertiser on 7 June, he said:... we would like to see tax not exceed a fixed percentage of GDP and we'd like to see it a bit below where it is now, if that's affordable. But I can't make any commitments on that.I guess this is the trouble with modern Australian males: they are shy of commitments, and modern shadow Treasurers are commitment shy when it comes to tax. The people of Australia need to know whether Labor stands by their 2005 tax policy, as the member for Lilley said last week, because that is a policy which would increase the thresholds and the rates of taxation in Australia. There can be only one reason that Labor will not put out a tax policy and that is because they know it will not help them win votes. If they thought it would help them win votes, they would not mind putting it out there.If you go through what frontbenchers of the Labor Party, who would be ministers in a Rudd government, have said about taxes, it is absolutely frightening. This includes the member for Melbourne who advocated higher taxes in this House. Listen to this:I think our overall tax take at the moment has become too low. I am quite happy to state that I think the total tax take is too low.I will read the next bit too; you will like this bit. This is the member for Melbourne, who said:... there should be a return to the 60c in the dollar tax rate for people earning over $75,000.He wants a 60c tax rate. He is the shadow finance minister in Labor Party. Now the Labor Party has a duty to Australians. Its duty is this: get a policy, announce it so that Australians can have a look at it and let people know what the Labor Party is really about.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for McMillan for his question. I recognise his very hard work and note that in 1996 the unemployment rate in McMillan was 7.7 per cent. Today it is 4.1 per cent and that is good news. A modern and flexible workplace relations system is absolutely essential for a productive economy. As the OECD noted in its Employment outlook 2007 report, labour market reforms can have a sizeable impact on productivity levels. That is pretty explicit: labour market reforms can have a sizeable impact on productivity levels.Those reforms could mean many things such as the abolition of the unfair dismissal laws. Small business hated those unfair dismissal laws, absolutely hated them. One of the reasons that we have seen 360,000 new jobs created over the last 15 months - 95 per cent of them full-time jobs - is the abolition of the unfair dismissal laws. We have got rid of centralised wage-setting process and, most importantly, we have made it harder for union bosses to engage in frivolous strike action.Mr Speaker, I can report to you that strike action in Australia today is at the lowest level since records were first kept in 1913, and that has had a positive impact on productivity. But, sadly, the message has not got out to some friends of the member for Hotham, including the leader of the ETU in Victoria, Dean 'expletive' Mighell. At around 11 am on Tuesday, representatives of Australian Paper, at the biggest paper manufacturing mill in Victoria, had all their CEPU and ETU members called out on strike by Dean Mighell, in unlawful strike action. He called the boys out on the site, in unlawful strike action, in support of an old site deal which is unlawful and which, in many cases, forces employers to pay union delegates on site and provides for compulsory deduction of union dues and paid time off for union meetings. In this case, the strike action is costing the company over $250,000 a day. Dean Mighell from the ETU - Labor Party royalty - sent a text message to the boys on site and said, 'Come out for a meeting,' and they are still on strike.Even worse, the Industrial Relations Commission, which the Labor Party says they are going to abolish, ordered the workers to go back to work and Dean Mighell refused to agree to that order. He refused to consent to his members going back to work. So he is stopping work at the site to make a poor political point about a site deal which is unlawful under our reforms. How is it good for productivity to allow union bosses to, at the flick of a moment, call people out on strike? How is it good for productivity to have people like Noonan, Reynolds and McDonald in Western Australia go onto construction sites and try to intimidate the workers and close down work, all in the name of trying to build their membership and get the Leader of the Opposition into the Lodge? Real productivity is about workplace reform, making hard decisions and standing up to the union bosses who are trying to close down hardworking businesses that are trying to make a buck and keep the economy strong. When you are in government you have to show leadership and courage, and the Leader of the Opposition has failed to show courage in standing up to people like Dean Mighell, Kevin Reynolds, Joe McDonald, Sharan Burrow and all their mates.</DOC>

 - I do thank the member for Lindsay for her question. Let me say not only that the Howard government is the best friend that Medicare has ever had but that the Howard government is the best friend that Australian nurses have ever had. Nurse numbers are up 11 per cent since 1999; there are 3,000 more nurse training places since 2005. There are now 5,000 nurses in general practice. - Thanks to the work of the Howard government, the great work of Australian nurses is now recognised through a Medicare rebate for the first time. As far as the government is concerned, we want nurses to be nurses; but members opposite want nurses to be pawns in political campaigns run by the ACTU. The ACTU's notorious dirty tricks manual cites Nepean Hospital as a case study in how to run a political campaign out of a healthcare institution. I cite Workers Online from last December:Workers at Nepean Hospital, the biggest workplace in the federal marginal seat of Lindsay ... are running the first workplace-based Rights at Work campaign in Australia. With a 3000 strong workforce and hundreds of patients and their families moving through each week, the potential for campaigners is extraordinary.I can inform the House that at Nepean Hospital nurses have been pressured into attending union meetings, and at least one worker has been threatened with losing his job if he votes Liberal. For weeks at a time walls and fences have been used as billboards for union propaganda, and for weeks at a time the hospital looked more like a polling booth for just one candidate than a proper healthcare institution. I say to the patients at Nepean Hospital and other hospitals in Australia: if some odd-looking person with a stethoscope around his neck approaches you -  - it might be Greg Combet masquerading as a doctor. If someone approaches you acting furtively with a pill bottle it might be Sharan Burrow masquerading as a nurse. In fact, a new peril is stalking the patients of Australia - Dr Death and Nurse Ratched - just like the new peril stalking the voters of Australia: Dr Death and Nurse Ratched sitting opposite.The real question is this: why is the Leader of the Opposition, who claims Dietrich Bonhoeffer as his mentor, supporting the union dirty tricks campaign in Australian hospitals? In fact, on that topic, why has he just put two champion dirt-diggers on his staff, including one person who put the mental health of a Sydney family at risk by fabricating stories about them? - I ask this question: was it Walt Secord who advised the Leader of the Opposition to claim that his productivity manual had been stolen when in fact it had been lost? June 14 was Fundamental Incompetence Day; yesterday, 19 June, ought to go down as Fundamental Dishonesty Day, with the Leader of the Opposition, advised by the dirty tricks merchants from the New South Wales Labor right, going out and peddling that blatant lie. What is pretty clear is this - move over St Kevin; the halo has been ripped off - the union thugs and the dirty tricks merchants from Hawker Britton are running this opposition.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I am not aware of the statement by Al Gore, but I will certainly make inquiries and come back to the member about that. In terms of biofuels more generally, the Howard government have consistently supported a commercially viable biofuels industry as a means of diversifying our fuel mix. We have backed that with more than $80 million in ethanol production grants, more than $37 million in biofuels capital grants, a commitment to ensure ethanol remains effectively excise free until 2011 and the $17.2 million Ethanol Distribution Program, which encourages petrol stations to install new pumps or convert existing pumps to sell E10 blended fuel. That investment is paying off. Production of transport ethanol grew from 28 million litres in 2005 to nearly 63 million litres last year. - Production of biofuels more than doubled in 2006 and we are on track to meet, and most likely exceed, our target of 350 million litres of biofuels by 2010. Indeed, we expect to meet it in 2008.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Wakefield for his very strong commitment to a strong economy and a strong Defence Force for Australia. Yesterday, the government made a very important decision for Australia's future - announced by the Prime Minister this morning - to invest $11 billion in out-turn pricing to build five ships for the Royal Australian Navy. These ships will shape not only the Royal Australian Navy but the Australian Defence Force for the next 40 years. The government has decided that we will have the Australian shipbuilder and defence supplier, Tenix, work with a Navantia designed LHD - landing helicopter dock. These will be the largest ships that have ever been built in Australia. The hulls will come from Spain and the superstructure and the fit-out will be built predominately but not only in Victoria at the Williamstown dock. These ships can carry up to 2,100 soldiers, they can carry 23 Abrams tanks and more than a dozen helicopters, and airlift two armed rifle company groups. They can carry two combined armed battle groups and four, for example, landing craft medium, each of which can carry an Abrams tank. And, of course, they will also carry a state-of-the-art, well-developed hospital.Those ships are extremely important for many reasons, not only because they will carry more equipment and more soldiers more quickly into our region but also because they will allow Australia, for the foreseeable future, to meet our obligations in security, stabilisation, peacekeeping, disaster relief and humanitarian assistance in our region. The government has also announced that we will build three Australianised Navantia F100 air warfare destroyers in South Australia with the Australian Submarine Corporation, at a cost of almost $8 billion. These ships will be equipped with the Aegis combat system, they will have 48 vertical missile cells and they will carry SM2 missiles and harpoon missiles, and leave us open in the future to make the decision to equip them with the SM3 missile interceptor.The first of the ships will go into the water in 2012 and the last of the five ships will go into the water in 2018. These two projects will give jobs to 3,600 Australians. More than 1,000 contractors will receive work totalling $4½ billion out of this decision. And it is a bonanza for Australian contractors. There will be up to $700 million worth of work in Victoria and almost $700 million worth of work in New South Wales. Cairns and southern Brisbane will share in almost $250 million in work. There will be $2 billion worth of work for South Australia, $200 million for Western Australia, and in Tasmania almost $75 million worth of work. This project and these five ships will shape our nation. It is nation protecting and it is nation building, and it is happening because this government believes in defence and investing in defence. And we have created an economic environment in which we can afford to do it.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for the question that he asked because it enables me to deal with a rather ill-informed article in the Bulletin today - a matter which could have been easily addressed if the reporter made an attempt to speak to me or my staff to verify the claims that were made. The simple answer in relation to the question that the honourable member asks implicitly is that there is no 'dirt unit' in my office in Sydney or anywhere else. There have been many people who, from time to time, have been in my office and would know and have been in a position to see that there are not six to eight extra people in my office. Like the Labor Party, I have staff who provide me with advice on issues relating to my portfolio and issues relating to my ministerial responsibilities. The people who work from Sydney in my office provide me with policy advice and the support I need to serve the Australian people. Like the Labor Party members opposite, I would expect my staff to be cognisant of current issues, to read newspapers, to listen to the radio and to watch the TV news so that they can tell me what mistakes those on the other side are making, particularly when you read articles like that.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hinkler for his question. I am sure my colleagues will understand if I single out the member for Hinkler for special praise for the role he has played over many years in contributing to the formulation of the government's broadband policy, released with such fanfare to largely, if not entirely, uncritical acclaim throughout the nation. The member for Hinkler will appreciate that the people in his electorate will benefit from the five exchanges being upgraded to very fast ADSL2+ broadband and from the 25 new wireless broadband sites, WiMAX, which will be built across his electorate, including in the towns of Buxton, Elliott Heads, Gin Gin, Kinkuna, Lakeside and Howard. These are just 25 towns in the electorate of Hinkler, out of 1,361 new WiMAX sites across Australia.The member for Hinkler asked me if there are any alternative policies that might threaten the broadband roll-out of the coalition government. It may not surprise him to know that the largest threat comes from the Labor Party, not because they have a policy, but because they do not have a policy. The Labor Party are extremely skilled - I have to give them this; in certain circumstances, anyway - at making a splash and attracting attention. But when you strip away the show and look at the substance, the Labor Party have nothing to offer, especially on broadband policy. Three months ago they released a 21-page policy document. If anyone should go to it and look beyond the assertions and the claims and the sound bites, they will find that 19 of the 21 pages are commentary. I refer to the index. The first 19 pages of the document relate to the importance of broadband - well, we all agree with that. 'Australia's broadband performance' - we can google that anywhere. 'International experience' - likewise. 'The Howard government's missed opportunities' - don't miss the opportunities to attack your opponent. So we are left with two pages and, if we take out the additional statement of facts and commentary, we are left with a one-page policy. That is the simple fact. What we do know from this one-page policy is that the Labor Party will spend $4.7 billion of taxpayers' funds, the policy will not take effect until 2013, and will cover only 75 per cent of the population. Compare that to the government's policy, which will take effect from 2009, will not cost the taxpayer anything and, moreover, is fully tested and fully creditable.So the Australian people face a stark contrast on broadband policy: the Labor Party's policy of one page, which can best be summarised as 'You pay more to get less', and the government's entirely creditable policy. The worst thing is that the Labor Party has abandoned 25 per cent of the Australian population; 25 per cent of the population will not benefit under Labor's $4.7 billion proposal. I thought the member for Hunter summed it up so very well when he was asked whether there were any gaps in Labor's broadband policy in his electorate of Hunter. He said this:Well, those things are yet to be tested; we will roll out fibre to the node right throughout the Hunter region. Obviously, there may be some people excluded from that. We don't have the technical backing to make those final conclusions.Well, here is a tip for the people of the Hunter: don't hold your breath for the member currently representing you to tell you who wins and who loses - which 75 per cent receive broadband and which 25 per cent lose out. To help the member for Hunter and the people of his electorate, we have done a map which shows exactly how the people of the Hunter will benefit from the government's proposals. I table that map. I challenge the member for Hunter to do likewise for the people of his electorate, showing them the supposed benefits of the Labor Party's proposal. - In summary and in conclusion, the Labor Party's policy has no credibility. They are like snake oil salesmen - they roll into town with bells and whistles, sell a proposal and then get out of town at the first available opportunity. The Labor Party's proposal does not stand up to scrutiny, whereas the government's policy has been acclaimed by one and all, far and wide.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. Water is the source of life. Nobody is more aware of that than the people of south-east Queensland. No Australian government, no Commonwealth government, has ever invested so much in water resources. The National Water Initiative was established by the Prime Minister, leading the states and territories into this important intergovernmental agreement. The $2 billion Australian Government Water Fund is funding innovative water infrastructure around Australia, including $408 million into the western corridor recycling project, which will deliver greater water security for all of south-east Queensland, including the constituents of the member for Moncrieff. The $10 billion plan, A National Plan for Water Security, is an example of the government's long-term planning to deal with longstanding errors and to rectify longstanding mistakes - the vision in water policy that has been so lacking in state governments around Australia.The honourable member asked me what is the alternative. If you look at Labor's water policy cupboard you will find it is bare. When I last looked on their website there was a press release from 21 January proposing that a meeting be held. While there is not much on the website, we know that the Labor Party have form. The Leader of the Opposition, the member for Lilley and the member for Kingsford Smith have a lot of form on water. The communities of south-east Queensland have neither forgotten nor forgiven them. Take this front-page article in the Gold Coast Bulletin under the heading 'Dam drips': 'These men got us into the drought mess'. And who are these smiling creatures? Mr Goss is not smiling, but the other three are smiling - Kevin Rudd, Wayne Swan and Peter Garrett. - I am just quoting the newspaper. - I will do that. When the former Queensland Premier, Wayne Goss, and his then advisers - the opposition leader and the member for Lilley - scrapped the Wolffdene dam in 1989, they consigned south-east Queensland to the current water crisis. Even Labor's environment spokesman, the member for Kingsford Smith, then in his Midnight Oil days, lobbied against the dam. Just as our water policies are determined to make every drop count, to make us efficient in our use of water, to make every drop count, so must we make every drip accountable. There they sit - drip one, drip two, drip three. Three drips. You cannot trust Labor with the economy; you cannot trust Labor with water. The three drips have got form and it will be a dry time for Australia if they get to this side of the House.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for La Trobe for his question and I congratulate him on the fact that unemployment in his electorate has gone down by 50 per cent since the John Howard government was elected. We have just celebrated 10 years of the great Work for the Dole program. Over half a million unemployed Australians have got a new life through this; 40 per cent are employed just four months after completing the program. While we have dropped long-term unemployment rates by 75 per cent from Labor's peak in 1993, we still have 80,000 people who are unemployed for more than two years in this country. So we are not going to rest on our laurels, even though we have achieved the lowest unemployment rate in 33 years. We know from when Labor was in power that long-term unemployment causes disadvantage, distress - a great human cost - and intergenerational welfare dependency. The Howard government are determined to give all Australians a fair go; hence our $3.6 billion Welfare to Work reforms and our recent extension of the Work for the Dole program into a longer program for the most disadvantaged.I am asked about any threats to the future of those now being helped into work. The major threat would be the election of a Labor government. If Labor was ever re-elected, employers' current confidence in creating record numbers of jobs would collapse as the economy faltered, as Labor rolled back our industrial relations reforms, especially the unfair dismissal laws, and as union bosses once again asserted themselves. The second threat to the unemployed and their children is the Labor Party's failure to clearly articulate a consistent response or endorsement of any employment programs like Work for the Dole. For example, despite Labor originally voting for Work for the Dole in the Senate, they have changed their minds repeatedly. In 1997, the member for Jagajaga said, 'Labor doesn't think it is fair and reasonable to expect a person to work in return for an unemployment benefit.' But just last night on ABC radio, the member for Jagajaga said that she now supports the principle of reciprocal obligation. - You invented it? Well, in 1997 the member for Jagajaga absolutely refuted the need for any mutual obligation. In the ALP's 2001 election policy, Labor proudly proclaimed, 'Labor is committed to retaining Work for the Dole.' But then two years later, the member for Grayndler stated that Work for the Dole is a 'cynical use of the unemployed for political advantage'. Flip-flop, flip-flop! So where on earth does Labor stand on assisting the long-term unemployed into work? Since Labor's economic mismanagement actually creates record levels of unemployment, you would think they would have something to say about unemployment programs. Today, we are very pleased to see that the OECD Employment Outlook 2007 has confirmed that our government's mutual obligation and employment programs are key to getting people back into work. I recommend the Labor Party read that report very carefully because, for a party whose incompetence creates unemployment, they really need to get a handle on what to do about the ensuing human cost.</DOC>

 - I will be happy to facilitate a full briefing. I will speak to my minister. I welcome what the Leader of the Opposition has said. This is a national emergency. There is no greater obligation that this parliament has than the obligation of caring for the young and vulnerable in our community. We are dealing with a group of young Australians for whom the concept of childhood innocence has never been present. That is a sad and tragic event. Exceptional measures are required to deal with an exceptionally tragic situation. That has been the substance of what I announced a few minutes ago.In the course of saying that, I pay tribute to the minister responsible, the Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs. From the moment he assumed that portfolio, he identified this problem and he pursued it. He was ridiculed and criticised by some for doing so. If he had not pursued it, the inquiry which has led to this response would never have been established. I thank him for the contribution he has made. I know that he is very committed and will be very happy to brief your shadow minister on the substance of the matter.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Solomon for his question and I also thank him for the advice and counsel he provided to me and to the relevant minister regarding this matter prior to the government's final decision. The measures are essentially as follows, and they are couched against the background of believing that this is a national emergency. The Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs put it to me very powerfully yesterday when he said that if this report had been about events in the suburb of Dickson, here in the Australian Capital Territory, there would have been a massive and immediate community response and a demand that something along the scale that I outlined a few minutes ago be undertaken by the government. We take the view that the same attitude should be adopted in relation to the Indigenous children of the Northern Territory.The actions that the government has announced will be overseen by a task force of eminent Australians, including logistics and other specialists and child protection experts. I am very happy to announce that Dr Sue Gordon, the eminent Western Australian magistrate, has agreed to assume a leadership role in the task force. Essentially, what the government has in mind is the introduction of widespread alcohol restrictions on Northern Territory Aboriginal land for six months - banning the sale, the possession, the transportation and the consumption - and broader monitoring of takeaway sales across the Northern Territory. We will be appealing to the Australian Medical Association to encourage the provision of doctors to undertake a medical examination of every Indigenous child in the Northern Territory under the age of 16. The federal government will bear all of the additional costs involved in relation to those health checks. I have no doubt that the Australian Medical Association, given its longstanding interest in this issue, will respond very enthusiastically to what the government has in mind.We propose a major change in the area of welfare in order to stem the flow of cash going towards alcohol abuse and to ensure that funds that are meant to be used for children's welfare are actually used for that purpose. The main intention here is that 50 per cent of these welfare payments will effectively be quarantined for the purchase of food and other essential items. That will apply to all families receiving these payments anywhere in the affected areas. We will be enforcing school attendance by linking income support and family assistance payments to school attendance for all people living on Aboriginal land. We will be ensuring the provision of meals for children at school, with parents paying for those meals.The Commonwealth government will take control of townships through five-year leases to ensure that property and public housing can be improved. That will include, if appropriate, the payment of just terms compensation. We will be requiring intensive on-ground clean-up of communities to make them safer and healthier by marshalling local workforces through Work for the Dole arrangements. We intend to scrap the permit system for common areas and road corridors on Aboriginal land. We intend to ban the possession of X-rated pornography in the prescribed areas and we will check all publicly funded computers for evidence of storage of pornography.In the area of law enforcement, there will be an immediate increase in policing levels, which have been woefully inadequate for many years in the Northern Territory. We will be calling on the state police services to provide at least 10 additional officers at Commonwealth expense, and they will be sworn in as Territory police officers to assist with the policing task. We will provide additional resources to set up an Australian government sexual abuse reporting desk, and we will appoint managers of all government businesses in all of the relevant communities. Next Thursday there will be a meeting of the Intergovernmental Committee on the Australian Crime Commission, and the federal representative on that body, the Minister for Justice and Customs, will ask his fellow ministers to refer to the Australian Crime Commission a reference to allow the commission to identify and locate perpetrators of sexual abuse of Indigenous children in other areas of Australia. After the identification of those perpetrators, that will lead, hopefully, to the prosecution of those people.I also indicate to the House that the minister will be bringing to cabinet at its next meeting proposals for further extending the conditionality of welfare payments to all Australians receiving income support, to ensure that these payments are used for the benefit of their children. I should put the House on notice that it may be necessary for parliament to be recalled from the winter break in order to pass the legislation needed to give effect to this package. That legislation will involve amendments to the Northern Territory (Self-Government) Act and to the Northern Territory land rights legislation. At this stage I am advised that amendments to other pieces of legislation will not be required.Many in the House will know that the terrible, sad and tragic set of circumstances revealed by this report in Northern Territory is duplicated in other parts of the country. The difference between the Territory and other parts of the country is that this parliament has the constitutional power and authority to do something about it in the Territory. We do not have the constitutional power to act in the same way in the states. I would appeal directly to every state Premier who has got the same problem in some part of his state to do the same as I have announced this morning. I appeal directly to the Premier of Queensland, to the Premier of New South Wales, and particularly to the Premier of Western Australia. They know that they have the same problem, and many of them have had reports saying that. I am asking them to do the same for their Aboriginal children as we have today announced a willingness to do for the Aboriginal children of the Northern Territory.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hunter for his question. Today the Chief of the Australian Defence Force, the Chief of Navy and the Maritime Commander for Australia are releasing the board of inquiry report into the Sea King tragedy which occurred on 2 April 2005. Every one of the 256 recommendations in that report are being implemented fully. Thirty per cent have been implemented already and by the end of this year 90 per cent will be implemented. It has been a very painful process, particularly for the families of those who lost their lives, for the two men who survived and their families, and for all of those in the Royal Australian Navy - and No. 817 Squadron in particular.There are issues of natural justice which need to be addressed. A significant amount of legal opinion has been applied to the report prior to its release, and there are a number of redactions throughout the 1,700 pages of the report. Those redactions - or deletions, as the member for Hunter may choose to call them - reflect operational requirements, they reflect issues of natural justice, and they also reflect very strong legal advice which was provided to the Royal Australian Navy and the board of inquiry.I wish to reassure not only the member for Hunter and the House; I particularly wish to reassure the families and every Australian who has an interest in making sure that a tragedy like this, for these reasons, does not ever occur again. Whilst there are redactions in that report, every single one of the individuals who have been identified - irrespective of his or her rank - will be pursued with the full force of the law but with the application of natural justice.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Wakefield for the question. As a man who puts the family first in everything he does, he understands the significance when a family unit breaks down because of grog, because of marijuana, because of sexual abuse, or because of domestic violence, and knows that it is an issue of national significance and national emergency.I refer to the very first recommendation of the report. It states: 'That this be designated an issue of urgent national significance by both the Australian and the Northern Territory governments.' I have likened this to the action we should take when a community is struck by a cyclone or a flood. Certain things have to be put aside. Certain normalities have to be discarded. You have to move boldly and you have to do it quickly. When I first came into this job, the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory said to me that the town camps in Alice Springs were her No. 1 priority. Here we are, some 16 or 17 months later and, unfortunately, I cannot report any significant improvement - in fact there is no improvement in the town camps. It has not been through want of trying. It has not been through lack of money, resources or will on behalf of the Howard government that it has not happened. What we are calling for here is not to delay another day. I could not live with myself and I know that not one member of this House would want to live with themselves knowing that we sat on a report like this for eight weeks and then said for another six or eight weeks that we would wait and try and come up with some answers and then start to implement them.The children deserve and need us to implement things today. The first thing that we can do that does not require legislative change, that does not need the recall of the parliament, is for the premiers of the other states in this country to stand up, to come up to the plate, to come forward with the police resources so that we can have them sworn in as Northern Territory police and have them on the ground. We know for a fact that when police are on the ground people come forward. In Kulumburru, when the Western Australian government put a police station there, in very short order a young woman came forward and as a result of her evidence we now have 13 men who have been charged with child sex abuses. That is 13 males out of an adult male population of about 90. That is just unbelievable in this country. And no-one should think for a moment that that is the only community. Without police, without someone responsible to report that abuse to, it could not happen. We can do something about that now.In the same way as this country responded to the tsunami - we had people up in the Indonesian archipelago and other places within days - we need that to happen here. We are prepared to stand by and have the military forces of this country provide their logistics, their vehicles and their communications, and the language skills of the Indigenous parts of our defence forces to support the men and women of the Australian police forces in their duty. That will give comfort. That will give real purpose to what we are doing. That is the first thing that needs to happen and it does not need to take weeks. I ask the state premiers to start working on this now in the interests of these children.One other issue that I would go to, in the multitude of things that we are undertaking here, is the compulsory acquisition under just terms. We are doing that because we need to be able to ensure that people are living in hygienic conditions, so that the conditions that currently prevail where people are living in overcrowded houses, where there are no norms and where all of the abuse can take place can stop. But we need to have control over the homes - the condition they are in, who is in them and what is occurring in them.We are asking for that now, so that we can do that and return normality over the next five years. There are three phases to what we are doing: (1) stabilisation, (2) normalisation and (3) exit. This will require the entire support of the Northern Territory government. Phase 2 will deal with the issues that many of you will think need to be dealt with. But, first of all, we have to stabilise. The grog has to be restricted. As a senior woman in Wadeye said to me, 'Please stop the cash flowing into these communities because they are buying grog, they are buying gunga and they are then destroying our children, and this is money that we need to have.' These are the steps we have announced today. These are the steps no less that will deal with the insidious crime against the children of our nation.</DOC>

 - It is the case that people are buying ever more expensive houses, and they are doing that because of a number of factors. One of them is that interest rates are lower and people can borrow more. The member for Lilley is very good at selectively quoting from things. -  - Well, he is. The Reserve Bank's March 2007 Financial Stability Review says:The average mortgage repayment on a new owner-occupied loan as a share of average disposable income is below its peak in 1989.In other words, notwithstanding the fact that people can now afford to buy ever more expensive houses, it is still below the 1989 peak. So I do not know what the member for Lilley is talking about. I recognise that some Australian families are doing it tough. I always have and I always will. No matter who is in office, there will always be some families who miss out. If you look at overall wages, if you look at unemployment, which is at a 33-year low, you will find that if fairness is the chance of a job of then, as Tony Blair famously said and truthfully said, fairness in Australia is at a 32-year high.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Boothby for his question. I think I can say that all the international advice from all of the respected agencies, including the OECD and the IMF, is that the more flexible the labour market is the higher the productivity outcomes you will get, all other things being equal. The point was made yesterday by the OECD in their Employment outlook where they said:The clearest result emerging from our analysis is that too strict statutory employment protection for regular contracts appears to dampen productivity growth, most likely by restricting the movement of labour into emerging high-productivity activities, firms or industries.What they are saying is, 'Don't tie your labour market down with too strict statutory controls such as unfair dismissal laws. Make sure that it's flexible enough for people to be able to move into high-growth, high-productivity activities and for those firms to pick them up.' That is the best way of having a productivity-centred industrial relations system.This week, of course, we have been witnessing the gaffs of the Leader of the Opposition in relation to productivity. But, leaving aside all of the gaffs that he has made, what policy lessons are there to draw in relation to productivity? The first is this: if you really want a system that is pro-productivity, you will support flexible industrial relations; you will not want to have a return to the past. Another thing that you will want is workplaces where people can get on with work without having to put up with thuggery and intimidation. That is why this government introduced the ABCC: to bring an end to thuggery and intimidation. The Leader of the Opposition, it appears, has discovered for the first time in his life that thuggery and intimidation occurs on building sites in Australia. He discovered that because he has discovered film evidence of Joe McDonald, the Assistant Secretary of the CFMEU, engaging in that very behaviour in Western Australia. It came to light because the ABCC, investigating, managed to get some video. But, of course, if the Leader of the Opposition had had his way, there would have been no ABCC, there would have been no video and there would have been no end to the continuing pattern of behaviour of Joe McDonald and his cohorts on building sites, not just in Western Australia but as goes on on hundreds of building sites and other workplaces around Australia.Having suddenly discovered what everybody who knows anything about industrial relations in Australia has known for decades, the Leader of the Opposition says that he is going to get rid of Joe McDonald. He says he is going to draw a line in the sand. I have this question to ask the Leader of the Opposition: on which side of that line in the sand will Kevin Harkins, the ALP candidate for Franklin, stand? Joe McDonald is not the only building official who has engaged in intimidation. One of the candidates that is lining up as a Rudd Labor candidate at the next election, in the seat of Franklin, Mr Kevin Harkins, an official of the ETU, is in exactly the same situation. He is still, to this day, being paid by the ETU, having been despatched to Tasmania by Dean Mighell. He has been described by Harry Quick, the current member for Franklin, as 'a foul-mouthed, bullying trade union person of the worst ilk'. Seeing that Mr Rudd is now in the business of getting rid of bullying union officials -  - the Leader of the Opposition ought to have a very careful look at Kevin Harkins. You can take the word of the member for Franklin or you can take the word of the Royal Commission into the Building and Construction Industry, which found that Kevin Harkins had 'engaged in unlawful conduct'. At the Melbourne Eastlands project he threatened a builder by saying, 'If necessary, the union will block off the entrance to our site with a truck, in the middle of a concrete pour.' That is the Labor candidate for Franklin. It is all very well to say, just because Joe McDonald got caught on video and you are embarrassed about it, that you want to do something about Joe McDonald, but I call on the leader of the Labor Party and the whole of the Labor Party to dissociate themselves from this ETU official, Kevin Harkins, to make it clear that they will stand up against thuggery, whether it is captured on videotape or not, and to immediately disendorse Kevin Harkins as the ALP candidate for Franklin.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dobell for his very perceptive question. I can report to the member for Dobell that the level of industrial disputation in the building and construction industry is at an all-time low. There has been a fall from something like a factor of 35 out of 1,000 days of work, in the number of strikes, to something less than two as a result of the legislation introduced by this government. It is very interesting that, in the past 24 hours, the Leader of the Opposition has told the Australian people that he will adopt a policy of zero tolerance towards thuggery and illegal behaviour in the building and construction industry. They are fine words and they might be believable if they had been matched by action. But let me point out to the House that, far from exhibiting zero tolerance towards thuggery in the building industry, the Leader of the Opposition has exhibited maximum toleration towards thuggery in the building industry. He now wants the Australian people to believe that if he were to become Prime Minister he would seriously retain in its present form the ABCC - that is, the watchdog that protects people in the building industry against the likes of Joe McDonald, Dean Mighell and Kevin Reynolds. - Yes, and Kevin Harkins. The ABCC is the watchdog, and what the Leader of the Opposition is now saying is: 'I'll keep it for two years.' That is not much of a concession on its own. Of course we all know that if he were to become Prime Minister he might keep it in its form for two years but he would deny it funding, he would withdraw its staff, he would denude it of resources and he would make it an absolutely toothless operation from the moment he assumed office.If you think I exaggerate, let me remind you that, on two occasions when the Labor Party and the other parties had the numbers in the Senate, the Leader of the Opposition joined with others to stop this body coming into operation. I have got a couple of division lists. In 2003 on the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Bill, the ayes include a number of very meritorious people like 'M. Vaile', 'P. Costello', 'A. Downer', 'A. Abbott', and so the list goes on; I think you get my drift. But I now go to the noes. I am sorry to report they include these people. There are 'Adams' and 'Albanese' and as I scroll down I come across the name 'Gillard', that of the deputy leader. How was she voting? She was voting against the very laws that the Leader of the Opposition would now have us believe he has sworn to uphold if he becomes the Prime Minister of this country.If I scroll down a bit further, I come across another name. It comes after 'Roxon' and it comes before 'Sawford'. What is it? It is 'Rudd'. Mr Rudd is the member for Griffith and he is now the Leader of the Opposition - and he voted to kill the watchdog. And he now wants us to believe that he would be in the corner of the average punter on a building site protecting them from the thuggery of Reynolds, McDonald, Mighell and Harkins! Yet when he had the opportunity, he voted against this body being brought into operation.If it had not been for the wisdom of the voters of Queensland, I am pleased to say, at the last election that gave this parliament four coalition senators, we would never have had the protection of this body and Joe McDonald would have been able to do his worst on every building site in Western Australia. The only reason this video was taken - the only reason this is an issue - was that the very body that the opposition leader tried to stop being created in the first place came into existence because we were able to pass this through the Australian parliament.The trickery of the Leader of the Opposition on this subject knows no bounds. This morning he was asked about returning the donations of the CFMEU in Western Australia. This is what he had to say, and this is a measure of how tricky he is on this subject. He said:Furthermore, others have raised with me the question of campaign contributions from the Western Australian division of the general construction division of which Mr McDonald comes.Listen to this; isn't it tortuous? He goes on to say:I have spoken to the national secretary of the party about this this morning - you know: 'Tell us the truth, Tim, all about this' - and I've confirmed with him that the federal campaign has received no contributions from this division of the union - the federal campaign - and I have also confirmed with the national secretary that he will be seeking no campaign contributions from this division of the party as well.That is the greatest piece of trickery and a great charade. I happen to have in my hand a document. It is called 'Donor to political parties annual return'. It covers the financial year 2004-05. The name of the organisation - I think I can read the handwriting - is: 'Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union, C&amp;C division, Western Australia'. And who is the person completing this form? None other than Joseph McDonald, who is shown as the 'Assistant Secretary'. The endearing Joseph lists, in his own fair hand, donations totalling about $70,000 in the financial year 2004-05. What the Leader of the Opposition is asking us to accept is that, if the union of which the dreaded Mr McDonald is assistant secretary gives $70,000 to the Western Australian branch of the Australian Labor Party, none of that is beneficial to the federal aspirations of the Labor Party in Western Australia. All I can say is that on occasions -  - Can I just remind the House that this return signed by Brother Joseph is to the Australian Electoral Commission and that the Australian Electoral Commission, the last time I checked, was responsible for Commonwealth electoral matters and not for electoral matters in the state of Western Australia. So if Brother Joseph believes there was a federal destination for this money, are we seriously to believe this tortuous, tortured and sneaky explanation that has come from the Leader of the Opposition about this money? The truth of the matter is that the Leader of the Opposition has once again contorted the truth. He has been less than candid, he has been very tricky and he is so far in with the likes of McDonald and Reynolds that he has to resort to those devices. As to what he is trying to do today with this meaningless stunt of having McDonald expelled from the Australian Labor Party - and it is a meaningless stunt - if the Leader of the Opposition wanted to demonstrate how tough he is with the unions he would dump the legislation that would bring back the thugs.Leave granted.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Blair for his question. The member for Blair would be well aware that the government is in the middle of delivering $38 billion worth of investment, via the Australian construction industry, in infrastructure in Australia - much-needed infrastructure that will power growth and productivity in the Australian economy well into the future. Of course, very important to that in south-east Queensland is the level of commitment from our government in terms of making sure the infrastructure in south-east Queensland keeps pace with the growth in population that the member for Blair indicated in his question, particularly in that area outside Brisbane and out towards Ipswich.One of the significant announcements already made, a project to which funding will be going in the early stages of and through AusLink 2, is the development of the Goodna bypass between Brisbane and Ipswich. It is a visionary project that has been championed by the member for Blair against the nay-sayers in the Queensland Labor government and others -  - and one that shows a great deal -  - of vision -  - building a piece of infrastructure that will last for 30 years after it has been built -  - and that is what we are on about. But we want to make sure that this record level of investment that we propose to make in infrastructure across Australia delivers on the ground - that every dollar we have allocated gets spent on building infrastructure, not wasted on either inefficient state bureaucracies or inefficient work practices in those industries.We have seen and heard a lot recently about some of those practices that used to exist in Australia - about a lot of the union intimidation that used to take place when subcontractors were not complying with their wishes. I mentioned earlier this week an example in my own area of a family small business that was nearly drummed out of business, sent bankrupt, because of intimidation by the CFMEU in the construction industry. To their credit, those people went along and gave evidence to the Cole royal commission into the building industry, and as a result of that and other evidence the recommendations of the Cole royal commission were implemented and today we have the Australian Building and Construction Commission as a watchdog, to ensure that those intimidatory practices no longer exist in construction industry workplaces in Australia.As the Treasurer and the Prime Minister have indicated in their comments, what we have been witnessing, what Australians have been appalled by witnessing on television in the last 24 hours, is evidence that those practices do still exist in this industry - evidence that is available only because of the existence of the Australian Building and Construction Commission, which provides support and advice to employers in these industries and on these construction sites across Australia. Now, we know what the Labor Party is going to do. We know what the Leader of the Opposition is going to do: he will bone out this commission between now and 2010 until it no longer exists. There will be nobody there protecting the investment that taxpayers make, protecting employers in these industries from the thuggery of some of these unionists like Joe McDonald in Western Australia.But it does not stop there. That evidence has come from the west coast, but there are also all sorts of interesting activities on the east coast - and not just by the CFMEU; this is rampant throughout the union movement. We read with interest a story in the media today, in the Daily Telegraph, entitled 'Union violence: officials charged'. The story read:Two National Union of Workers officials, organisers Charlie Morgan and Bruno Mendonca, were yesterday charged with assaulting and intimidating a Transport Workers Union official, allegedly stomping on and fracturing his feet and throwing him against a wall.These are not other workers. These are not employers. These are not employees intimidating other employees. This is cannibalism within the union movement. This is about turf warfare. This is the NUW wanting to muscle up and strengthen its numbers in advance of the possible election of a Rudd Labor government - and they are salivating about getting back into power.Do you know what the slogan of the NUW is? It is not 'The interests of workers', it is not 'Improving the pay of workers' and it is not 'Improving the safety of workers'. Their slogan is: 'Organising for power' - that is, political power in Australia through the Australian Labor Party. We all know the support they have provided for the Australian Labor Party over the years. While the coalition government is putting in place common-sense policies that are delivering new jobs in the Australian economy, the Labor Party is preparing to wreck the economy and hand power back to the union movement.</DOC>

 - That is a very interesting switch of questions. Where is the concerted IR attack? What about broadband, IR, tax, the economy, social policy? - Can I say to the member for Fraser that, in the end, the best judges of arrogance in public life in this country are the Australian people. I am glad that those who sit opposite nod their heads in agreement, because I seem to remember that the member for Fraser and his colleagues asked me the same question in 2004 and in 2001. I gave the answer then - and it was a truthful answer - that it is an enormous privilege to be the Leader of the Liberal Party of Australia. It is surpassed by only one other privilege that is even greater than that, and that is to be Prime Minister of this magnificent country. The people who decide how long I remain in my position as Leader of the Liberal Party of Australia are my parliamentary colleagues in the Liberal Party, and those who decide how long I remain Prime Minister of this country are the people of Australia. As always, I will accept with the very best of grace whatever judgement my fellow Australians make on the contribution I can make to the future of this country.</DOC>

 - Can I, firstly, acknowledge the member for Deakin and congratulate him on the way he represents the electors of Deakin. I think all people who are against thuggery in Australia will be hoping that he is re-elected against the ETU candidate in Deakin, Mike Symon - the Dean Mighell ETU candidate in Deakin. I say that in passing because this Leader of the Opposition is so deeply in hock to the brutal face of trade unionism in this country that he just does not know how deeply he is in hock.This government believes in cutting taxes where we can do so. Consistent with balancing our budget and paying off debt, and consistent with funding medical services, pharmaceutical services, defence services and educational services, we believe the tax burden should be as low as possible. That is why on 1 July those Australians who pay income tax will be receiving another income tax cut. 1 July is income tax cut day. It will be done in two ways: by increasing the low-income tax offset and by shifting the threshold for the lowest rate from $25,000 up to $30,000. I also want to remind Australians that, if you happen to be an age pensioner, this week you will be receiving a bonus of $500. Every age pensioner will be getting $500 and every age pensioner couple will be getting $1,000 in recognition of the work they have done in building this economy.I also want to remind all Australians who are self-funded retirees and entitled to the seniors concession allowance that this week they will be receiving a bonus of $500 for an individual and $1,000 for a couple in recognition of the work that they too have done in building the Australian economy. These are some of the social dividends that you can get from running a strong economy - help for the age pensioners, help for the self-funded retirees and income tax cuts for all Australians.I do not want to let the session end without remembering some of the great milestones in this House in previous years. This is the last sitting day before the nation gets to the annual commemoration of 'fundamental injustice day'. Fundamental injustice day was 30 June 1999. We have heard great speeches in this House but none in their own terms were delivered in a way which was designed to last 100 years so that, in 100 years time, men would still say that this was the finest hour of the member for Griffith. Let us remember his words on 30 June 1999. He said earnestly to this House:When the history of this parliament, this nation and this century is written, 30 June 1999 will be recorded as a day of fundamental injustice - an injustice which is real, an injustice which is not simply conjured up by the fleeting rhetoric of politicians. It will be -  CT4 
Costello, Peter, MPMr COSTELLO - he was rising to the occasion - recorded as the day when the social compact that has governed this nation for the last 100 years was torn up.I think what he had in mind is that, if this parliament and its people should last for another 100 years, men would still say this was fundamental injustice day. Let me say what has happened since fundamental injustice day on 30 June 1999. We cut tax on 1 July 2000; we cut tax on 1 July 2003; we cut tax on 1 July 2004; we cut tax on 1 July 2005, 2006, 2007; and we will cut it again on 1 July 2008. Sometimes in public life, you come across people who have lofty rhetoric which is not matched by underlying values and underlying policy. - Oh Swanee, how I love ya, how I love ya! If it had not been for me, this day would have been forgotten. I have single-handedly rescued fundamental injustice day. - I have stamped it in the minds of Australians forever, and I hope that when they think about fundamental injustice day, from this day until the ending of the world, they will know that here was fraud if they ever saw it. - </DOC>

 - I can confirm a number of things. I can confirm that Mark Textor has done polling for the Liberal Party at a federal level since the early 1990s. I can secondly confirm that his advice has been reasonably accurate over the years. I can thirdly confirm that he does research on a large number of things for the Liberal Party. I can fourthly confirm that that research remains confidential. I can fifthly confirm that Mark Textor, along with Lynton Crosby, a very fine former federal director of the Liberal Party, run a successful business and like anybody in business - I mean, you understand that people have more than one client in business; you do know that - they are entitled to have more than one client. In polling they do not operate a closed shop. I know that you have this mentality that a firm is only meant to have one union, but that does not apply in private enterprise. You can actually have more than one client, and Crosby/Textor have got more than one client - and good luck to them. They run a good show. They are good pollsters, and I wish them well.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Corangamite for his question and note that he and people on this side of the House believe that you have to have a strong watchdog taking care of the construction industry whilst they build Australia. You cannot in any way compromise that watchdog as it goes about its business ensuring that intimidation and thuggery are not part of the building sites and that people who engage in that sort of thuggery are brought to justice.I know the Leader of the Opposition only last night discovered Joe McDonald. Only when there was a videotape from the Western Australian court obtained by six media organisations did the Leader of the Opposition discover that in his policy of zero tolerance there was no place for Joe McDonald. It is not as if Joe McDonald is new on the scene. In fact, I got a list of unlawful conduct, trespass and other charges against CFMEU officials, and Joe McDonald gets a lot of naming. These are the events where he was convicted of trespass: firstly in the early nineties, and then it goes 1998, June 2000, September 2000, 2001, 2003, 2004 and October 2005. He was convicted of assaulting two managers of a building company in August 2005, and then trespass again in February 2006, November 2006 and December 2006. Of course, this is Joe McDonald - and the Leader of the Opposition discovered it yesterday - facing charges for illegally entering Doric Constructions, Q-Con, Broad Constructions and Pindan Constructions.The Leader of the Opposition yesterday discovered that Joe McDonald pointed at a camera held by one of our watchdogs and said, 'Your days are numbered.' So what does the Leader of the Opposition do? He goes to sack Joe McDonald, but he keeps the policy to make sure that the watchdog's days are numbered. He sacks the messenger but keeps the policy. If that is not hypocrisy when it comes to zero tolerance, I am not sure what is.But it goes even further. Kevin Reynolds, the branch secretary of the CFMEU, has 230 findings of unlawful conduct, the majority of findings against CFMEU officials. Kevin Reynolds is listed as a repeat offender. John Sutton, National Secretary of the CFMEU, on 19 May 2003 pleaded guilty to charges of malicious damage - the CFMEU national secretary engaging in malicious damage. But it goes further than just the CFMEU - what a surprise! The Prime Minister pointed out that in fact Joe McDonald was donating money to the Australian Labor Party - $70,000 on one occasion. What a surprise then that the Labor Party is not prepared to chuck out two people that have serious charges in the New South Wales courts - Charlie Morgan and Bruno Mendonca for engaging in alleged intimidation and assault. So Joe McDonald is thrown out for swearing at a cameraman, but two officials of the NUW still have so-called natural justice even though charges have been laid against them. Do you know what, Mr Speaker? Kevin Reynolds says -  - Do you know what Kevin Reynolds said today? The member for Hotham is former NUW going in to bat for the boys - good on you. Kevin Reynolds said it this morning. - When it was put to him about Joe McDonald, Kevin Reynolds said: 'I've noticed there's a couple of other union officials been arrested for being involved in a punch-up and they are members of the Labor Party and I'm sure he'll have to deal with them now. Well, he has to.' That is Kevin Reynolds - still a member of the Labor Party. Kevin Reynolds says that there are two NUW officials currently with charges before the court, and now Kevin Reynolds is calling on the Leader of the Opposition to take action and draw a line in the sand - zero tolerance.This is thick with hypocrisy. Dean Mighell was thrown out of the Labor Party for swearing, and yet the secretary of the Victorian ALP said, 'After the election he'll be back.' The Leader of the Opposition said, 'Not only are we throwing out the individual; we're going to send the money back to the ETU.' We have seen no receipt. No-one has seen any receipt. The money never went back to the ETU; it is still sitting in Labor Party coffers. Today, after he has seen a videotape of Joe McDonald, despite numerous previous convictions for intimidation and thuggery, now suddenly the Leader of the Opposition tends to believe he has to draw a line in the sand. 'Zero tolerance,' he says. That is not zero tolerance. Zero tolerance is getting rid of the links between the Labor Party and the union movement; zero tolerance is not accepting union money; zero tolerance is not accepting union candidates in seats; and zero tolerance is tearing up the Labor Party's industrial relations laws.</DOC>

 - Unlike the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, we do not set out to injure business and we do not set out to injure employers. I speak to Mark Textor from time to time. He is a very wise man from time to time. What you do not need to know from polling is that the Labor Party links with the trade union bosses are not well accepted in the community.I speak to the business community all the time. I have no involvement in the business community campaign. I do not even have any detailed knowledge of the business community campaign; I am only aware of what I have read in the newspapers. Out of all of that, yesterday the Deputy Leader of the Opposition was saying that we were giving our research to Crosby/Textor; today she is suggesting that Crosby/Textor are giving us their research for some reason. - Is that right? I can tell you that Crosby/Textor have not given me any of their research associated with the Business Council campaign. That is why we are focused on the real deal, which is jobs, employment, higher wages, fewer strikes and getting rid of union thugs.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Hume for his question. I am delighted that there is so much interest in privacy matters. - I suspect that all members know where I am going, because the Privacy Act does provide protection for personal information that people hand over when they join an organisation. The expectation is that that information is needed for the organisation to be able to function or to be able to provide services to the person who is a member of that organisation. If the personal information is going to be used for other purposes or to be given to someone else, there is an obligation on that organisation to inform the individual at the time that they collect that information or to ask their permission.For example, it might be of concern to some union members if their union were to collect personal details from its members and then give them to, for instance, a database company, like Magenta Linus, which can then match this up with other data about them, such as where they live and the electorate in which they live. They might be even more concerned if the union decided to hand the data to a market research company, like E-lect Interactive -  - and to survey members about their voting intention and their attitude to various policy issues. - After all, we do have secret ballots in this country. People are entitled to maintain the confidentiality of those matters. That concern might grow further if the union came back to them and started using all the information that they had collected without the person's permission to follow the tactics that are outlined in the ACTU handbook and to lobby them about their voting intentions.There are concerns about the way in which unions are using their members' personal details. I want to inform members that the Privacy Commissioner is giving consideration to starting an own-motion inquiry in relation to the ACTU tactics on this matter. The Privacy Commissioner is an independent statutory officer. She makes her own decisions on these matters. But the Australian Electoral Commission examination relating to the handbook might provide some information which could be of particular interest to her. I would remind the community and members of unions generally that if their union seeks information from them they are entitled to know why and they should make sure that it is necessary for the union's functions. If people believe their personal details are being misused in this way by an organisation that they belong to, they should make their complaints known to the Privacy Commissioner.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. I regret to inform him that, despite $14 billion worth of Commonwealth funding under the health care agreements and despite almost $2 billion in GST windfall revenue over the last three years, the New South Wales government is still short-changing patients in that state. To give one example: the member for Gellibrand keeps saying that there is a dental crisis. She says that is why we need 'Dentistry Gold', at the cost of $4.7 billion every year. Do not accept what Labor says; watch what Labor does. The New South Wales budget allocated just $4 million more for public dentistry, even though people with no teeth wait up to 2½ years and people in severe pain wait up to three weeks for treatment at the Westmead dental hospital.Above all, the people of northern New South Wales know that you cannot trust Labor with health care. In June 2004, on the strength of an $8 million commitment from the Howard government, the New South Wales Labor government promised a new cancer centre for Lismore Base Hospital. The New South Wales government promised that construction would start by the middle of this year. Now the New South Wales Labor government will not start construction until 2010 at the earliest, and the New South Wales budget delivered a paltry $145,000 for planning, not the $20 million or more that this centre will need.If the Leader of the Opposition can call a national executive meeting to expel Joe McDonald, why can't he call a Premier to help cancer patients? If the Leader of the Opposition can make 11 phone calls to the editor of the Australian to support a lie, why can't he make a single phone call to Morris Iemma to expedite the construction of this cancer centre? If the Leader of the Opposition can phone-stalk editors to kill stories, using language that would make Dean Mighell blush, why can't he phone-stalk a few premiers to support health services? This guy sends more text messages than Shane Warne. I reckon the editor of the Australian is entitled to ask to go on a do not call register to protect himself from harassment from the Leader of the Opposition. - I just make the point that the Leader of the Opposition should be just as interested and active in the support of patients as he is in the support of his own shabby political interests. I make this point: the people of Australia are waking up to this guy. They are waking up to this guy and they are rapidly coming to the conclusion that they will not let him do to Medicare what people like Morris Iemma and Bob Carr have done to public hospitals in New South Wales.</DOC>

 - I think Mr Goodyear is a very fine businessman. He has run a company very successfully, and one of the things that have happened under his leadership and under the leadership of his predecessor, Paul Anderson, is that there has been a marked change in the industrial relations policies of BHP Billiton. In fact, the old BHP used to believe in centralised wage fixation. The new BHP, now in the BHP Billiton manifestation, has moved progressively -  - to a less regulated industrial relations system. I do not have to speak -  - Under his leadership, the company that he has so ably led has embraced, by their tens of thousands, AWAs. BHP Billiton is a stern and resolute opponent of the industrial relations policy of the Australian Labor Party, and I endorse everything that Chip Goodyear has said about that.In respect of climate change targets, I also endorse what Mr Goodyear has said about targets, and the interesting thing -  -  - I do. I endorse everything he says, because what he was clearly talking about is the climate change target we currently have. That is the climate change target set by Kyoto. That climate change target is extant until 2012. - We have a target, and that target is 108 per cent over our 1990 levels between 2008 and 2012. Although we have not subscribed to the Kyoto protocol or ratified it, Australia is going to be one of the few countries that will actually meet their target. Unlike many of these countries that have sermonised, hectored and lectured Australia, we are going to meet our target.The Leader of the Opposition also asked about BHP Billiton. If my memory serves me correctly, one of the members of the task force that recommended the approach to targets embraced by the government and rejected by the opposition was none other than a Mr Lynch of BHP Billiton.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Gilmore. This is the last question time of the first six months of this year, and I appreciate the many members of the government who have asked me questions on great issues of foreign policy. - But not one member of the opposition has asked a single question about foreign policy in six months. That shows you how little they value the great things of Australian foreign policy like the strong alliance we have with the United States -  - which they want to downgrade; the ties we have been building up with Japan, China, Indonesia and India; the pride with which we promote our country around the world; and the respect which Australia has won in many parts of the world.All I can say in answer to the honourable member's question about alternative approaches is that the reason that the opposition has not asked any questions about this issue in six months is that it does not fit in with the spin, it does not fit in with the Hawker Britton strategy and it does not fit in with the insincere and superficial approach that the Leader of the Opposition takes to public issues. But the Leader of the Opposition has occasionally ventured into the area of foreign policy and, of course, professes to be a great expert. Honourable members might recall that he made an overseas trip to the United States of America. They may not recall that, while he was in the United States of America, he did not meet with one single political leader, Democrat or Republican. So the main thing was that there were pictures of him in America, and it did not matter what happened in terms of the substance.Honourable members might remember that the Leader of the Opposition was planning a second overseas visit, and that was to Vietnam. He was going to go to Long Tan and set up a fake dawn service with the Sunrise program. He told the media that he did not know anything about it. Two days later, it was revealed that his office knew all about it. Of course, that is life in the fast lane. Honourable members may remember that the Leader of the Opposition was then going to go to China - one of his great initiatives. He was to lead Australia on initiatives to deal with China, where he once served as a junior diplomat, and to build a climate change relationship with China. He then claimed, when it did not suit him to go - and we all know why he did not go to China - that there were scheduling difficulties.When the Leader of the Opposition sees trade union leaders behaving badly on TV - not when he knows they are behaving badly but when he sees a picture of them on TV behaving badly: swearing, bullying and threatening - he demands that those people resign from the Labor Party. That is apparently the line in the sand. But, when the Leader of the Opposition is exposed over the so-called Sunrise scandal in relation to the Long Tan fake service, he rings up the editors of newspapers and he threatens them and bullies them and swears at them but apparently does not have to resign from the Labor Party because it is not recorded by a television camera. My point is this: the Leader of the Opposition, coming to the end of this session, is a person who has been exposed as superficial and driven by focus groups and the advice of Hawker Britton, which is all very well if, beneath it all, there is a person of substance. But he is not a leader of substance; he is a weak and directionless Leader of the Opposition.</DOC>

 - I am aware of that data. I am also aware that - to use an expression I have heard often - when it comes to working families, a lot can be said about the conditions for working families in Australia at the present time. Let me preface these general remarks by acknowledging that not all Australian families enjoy the sorts of things that I am about to describe. I acknowledge that some Australian families are missing out and some Australian families are not realising as much as the great bulk of Australian families are.The first thing I can say is that there are more Australian families working now than ever before. The Leader of the Opposition uses the expression 'working families' as a given. I remind the Leader of the Opposition that, when his party was last in office, it was not a given that families could get work. In fact, it was the norm for over a million Australians that they could not get work. I remind the Leader of the Opposition that unemployment in Australia - the greatest measure of the dividend of economic policy - is now at a 33-year low. I remind the Leader of the Opposition - and this affects working families all over Australia - that interest rates under this government for housing have averaged 7¼ per cent over the last 11½ years, compared to 12¾ per cent under the previous government, a clear difference of five percentage points. On an average mortgage of $235,000, a homeowner would have paid, on average, $1,416 a month in mortgage payments under the current government, compared to $2,497 a month if the average interest rate under the Labor Party still applied.I remind the Leader of the Opposition that real wages of Australian workers have increased by 20.8 per cent over the last 11½ years, compared to a fall of 1.8 per cent under the former government. I remind the Leader of the Opposition that only the top 40 per cent of Australian households pay net income tax and that research by the OECD shows Australia has one of the fairest and most redistributive tax and income support systems in the OECD.On the issue of housing affordability, which is clearly the basis of the question asked by the Leader of the Opposition, I draw his attention to the report released yesterday by the Urban Development Institute of Australia, which identified 16 factors contributing to declining housing affordability, three of which it examined in detail: supply issues, approval delays, and costs and charges. The report had this to say:It is acknowledged that the vast majority of steps that need to be taken (and in some jurisdictions are being taken) are at local government and state government level.The report's assessment of housing affordability in Sydney demonstrates the damaging effects of state government policies on homeownership. On land supply, the report had this to say:In the mid 1990s the New South Wales Government adopted a largely ideologically driven and widely contentious policy experiment with urban consolidation._            _            _The policy has had an unprecedented impact._            _            _The lack of housing supply has led to dramatic price escalation in Sydney and New South Wales. ... house building costs have remained remarkably consistent over the 30 year period whereas land has increased markedly so that it now represents almost 80 per cent of the cost of buying a house and land package.I would say to the Leader of the Opposition: the impact of all of these things on working families in Australia is significant. Working families in this country have been uppermost in our mind over the last 11½ years, and that is why we have pursued policies during that period of time demonstrably to their benefit and for their support.</DOC>

 - As I said in answer to the question asked by the Leader of the Opposition, the most important measure, the most significant human dividend of strong economic management, is low unemployment. Nothing goes to the heart of the wellbeing and welfare of working families in this country more than low levels of unemployment. As the former British Prime Minister famously said, 'Fairness in the workplace starts with the chance of a job.' On that measure, fairness in Australia is now at an 11½-year high, because we now have the lowest unemployment levels for 33 years.The reason we have low unemployment is that we have a strong economy. We have a strong economy because this government, with no help from the Labor opposition, took all of the economic decisions that were necessary to get the Australian economy back in shape. The former Labor government not only left us with a $96 billion debt but their colleagues at a state level have now committed themselves to increase their debts over a five-year period by $70 billion. And, to add insult to injury, having left us with this appalling economic legacy, the Leader of the Opposition and his colleagues voted against every single measure that this government introduced in order to get the Australian economy back on its feet. They now take as their starting point for the political debate in Australia the strong economy we now have - which they tried to prevent.At every point those who sit opposite us frustrated our endeavours to get the Australian economy back on track. I do not think there is any argument that the prosperity, low unemployment, strong economic conditions and high levels of business investment we now have are the products of 11½ years of careful economic management and, in a number of areas such as taxation and industrial relations, courageous economic reform.The member for Moreton asked me, 'Are there any threats?' Yes, there are a number of threats, and they all sit opposite. Every single one of them represents a threat. I pose a simple rhetorical comment: if you want to know what federal Labor would be like in government have a look at what state Labor is like in government. If you want a character reference for a federal Labor government look no further than the report cards on state Labor governments. If you want a model of how a federal Labor government would treat its opponents have a look at what the Queensland Premier is doing today in Queensland to people who happen to disagree with his policy on local government amalgamations. If you want to know how fiscally responsible the Leader of the Opposition would be if he were in government, have a look not only at what he has done in opposition by opposing our fiscal responsibility but at the $70 billion of state government debt that his colleagues are going to run up over a period of five years.Another threat, of course - and a very specific one - is a return to a centralised wage fixation system. If Labor win the next election they will dismantle our industrial relations system and they will replace it with a union dominated system. That will result in a flow-through of wages from those sectors of the economy that can afford them to those that cannot. As a result there will be inflationary pressures and much greater pressures on the levels of interest rates. I conclude by quoting some comments made by the Governor of the Reserve Bank on 21 February 2007, when he spoke of the role of flexible labour markets in containing inflationary pressures. He said:We are not getting today what we might once have gotten had we had a shock like this - the late 1970s resource boom or earlier occasions. On those occasions, the strong sectors would get a big pay rise and, through the centralised wage setting system, that would flow through to everybody else, through the Arbitration Commission. That does not happen any more.If there is a change of government it will happen again, and the benefits of the resources boom will be lost and squandered for future generations of the Australian people.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. Those information ads are very effective; those information ads will continue. The fact that they are being attacked by the Leader of the Opposition, the ACTU and the Public Sector Union demonstrates just how effective they have been. The Leader of the Opposition, as we know, famously comes from the state of Queensland - might I say the great state of Queensland. I am proud of the fact that there are more Queenslanders on this side of the House than there are on the other side of the House. What is more, we intend to keep it that way. The Leader of the Opposition comes from the great state of Queensland and, never to be outdone, the good old Queensland Premier has a mate here who will be a colleague of his if the Labor Party wins the next election. While the Leader of the Opposition is up here complaining about government advertising, his colleague in Queensland has absolutely no shame about a 14-page colour booklet released in the Sunday Mail. It is great advertising for the Queensland newspaper. I do not want to knock that fine organisation. They will take business from anybody - that is fair enough - even the Queensland government. Here we have page after page, and what is the explanation? - We are invited to believe that this is a public information campaign. Do you know why? Because it has been run by a Labor government. It has nothing to do with the content of the campaign. - I see my colleague, the member for Boothby, and he reminds me - I apologise for what I am about to say - of the South Australian Premier, because the South Australian Premier after the last budget put out a full-page advertisement extolling the virtues of his budget. They have absolutely no shame when it comes to this. Let me inform the Leader of the Opposition of two things: firstly, the 'Barbara Bennett advertisements', as he calls them, are legitimate information campaigns; and, secondly - not only that - they are completely in accordance with the values of the Public Service Act, as certified by none other than the Public Service Commissioner, Lynelle Briggs. I am informed that to date the information campaign in relation to the fairness test has cost in the order of $23 million. There will be further expenditure. I do not disguise that; I make no apology for it. I think the provision of legitimate information on the fairness test is justified.If we are talking about the use of government resources to run a political campaign, I also have in my possession a circular from Mary Kelleher, the senior director of the Human Resources Branch of Queensland Health. The circular is dated 11 July 2007 and it has the heading 'Your Rights at Work campaign'. This is on the letterhead of Queensland Health. It is not the union. What it has to say is:The Queensland Council of Unions is coordinating the Your Rights at Work campaign on behalf of all unions. The aim of the campaign is to raise awareness about the impact of the federal industrial relations laws on all workers, including those in the state system, and the need to remove the laws by removing the current federal government.This is Queensland Health. Presumably this is legitimate. Presumably this is an information campaign. It is directly political. There is nothing in the Barbara Bennett ads that in any way attacks the Labor Party, in any way attacks the trade union movement or in fact provides other than factual information on the operation of our policies. In those circumstances, our expenditure is totally legitimate. The ads will continue.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Boothby for his question. He would know that it is the policy of this government to run the budget in surplus - that is, not to spend more money than we raise but to keep our expenditures within our revenue envelope, a revenue envelope which we in fact cut in 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007.It was not always the case, of course, that the Commonwealth government lived within its means. When I first became Treasurer the budget was $10 billion in deficit. The year before that it was $13 billion in deficit. The year before that it was $17 billion in deficit. The year before that there was a deficit of four per cent of GDP. If we had a budget deficit of four per cent of GDP, as Labor had in the mid-nineties, it would be a deficit of over $40 billion for one year. So by running a budget in surplus we have been able to pay down debt, and in fact we have now reduced to zero the net debt of the Commonwealth. Over the next five years, to 2010-11, we estimate that the Commonwealth government will save over $60 billion. The state Labor governments will go out and borrow $70 billion over the next five years. In other words, whilst the Commonwealth is adding to savings, the states collectively are borrowing $70 billion. Far from running their budgets balanced, the states collectively are running budget deficits from now until 2010-11.If you want to see an illustration of the difference between a coalition government and the Labor Party, which cannot be trusted with money, you will be able to see it in the states' records between now and 2010. The former Governor of the Reserve Bank, Ian Macfarlane, when he retired, was asked whether fiscal policy had ever been a problem for him. Listen to what he said, on 12 August 2006:I have been lucky - for most of my time, fiscal policy has consisted of small surpluses. So the movement in the government account has not been big enough to be important in the consideration of monetary policy.Listen to this:It might become an issue because the states are now part of the equation.That was the Governor of the Reserve Bank in August of 2006. - It is a killer, I am afraid. The socialist member for Melbourne interjects: 'That's a killer.' It is, and it kills you, old son, to hear that the Governor of the Reserve Bank in August of 2006 said that what had emerged as an issue was that the states had moved from surplus to deficit, and they now have plans to borrow $70 billion.What is also a killer - a killer in the comedy stakes - is whenever you see the member for Lilley, Mr Swan, being interviewed on TV. It was one of those vintages with David Spears yesterday, on 6 August 2007. He was asked this question: 'How does state borrowing not put upward pressure on interest rates?' That is not a bad question, is it?A government member - No. It is a good question. - And what was his answer? He said that the states do borrow - they borrow for infrastructure and they have been doing it for 100 years - and borrowings are necessary to keep our economy strong. That was his answer. How does it not put pressure on interest rates? His answer was that it does not put pressure on interest rates because it is the Labor Party that is borrowing - 'Labor borrowing good; coalition surplus bad!' This is one of these whitebread politicians that Gary Gray used to complain about. He practises his doorstops for the day in the mirror. Remember the day we caught him with his press secretary mouthing the words - they had been practising all morning - 'Labor borrowing good; coalition surplus bad.'There is one level of government that is saving money and living within its means. It is the coalition. There is another level of government that is in deficit and that is borrowing and it is the Labor Party. It always was thus. You cannot trust Labor with money. You cannot trust them at the state level and when they were last in government you could not trust them at the federal level either.</DOC>

 - I have lived through the best of times and the worst of times, as William Shakespeare once wrote. 
An opposition member - It was Dickens. - Oh, I am sorry, it was Charles Dickens. I thought he wrote 'now is the winter of our discontent'. I am reminded to quote the member for Lilley - I am reminded of that famous Australian poet, Banjo Paterson, was it not, who wrote those immortal words: 'Aussie, Aussie, Aussie, oi, oi, oi!' This is someone who would not know his Shakespeare from his Dickens or his Paterson from his soccer chants. He purports to want to become the Treasurer of Australia.

 - I thank the member for Blair for his question. I can say in reply that the government I lead does have a proud record of achievement in supporting local government. In the current financial year, we will provide about $2.1 billion in direct assistance to local government. That is $1.7 billion in local government financial assistance grants and $307.5 million in the very well received and strong Roads to Recovery program. These untied grants deliver a lot of services to Australians, which people especially but not only in regional areas come to expect: that is, waste collection and recycling, libraries and community centres and sport and recreation facilities. These grants have increased by more than 50 per cent since the government came to office in 1996.Unfortunately, not all levels of government share our attitude to helping local councils in delivering these services. Right at the moment, in the great state of Queensland, the Beattie Labor government is ripping the heart out of local democracy with the dramatic slashing of council numbers from 156 to 72. This is being done without so much as a semblance of consultation with the people who live in these areas. Yet this is the Premier who, when I intervened on behalf of this government to help the people of Queensland who have been denied a service from the state government, accused me of riding roughshod over the rights of the state of Queensland. He is the man who is riding roughshod over the rights of people who not only sit on local government bodies in Queensland but are serviced by those local government bodies. This plan by Mr Beattie will slash thousands of jobs in regional communities and threaten the viability of many hundreds of small towns throughout Queensland. I fear that it is a harbinger of what might come if you remove the final check and balance against the excesses of state Labor governments - that is, a federal coalition government. We need checks and balances in our democracy and one of the great checks and balances is that you should from time to time have different parties in office at the different levels of government. Let me say to the people of Queensland who are unhappy with what their Premier is doing: within the limits of the Constitution we will do what we can to force the Queensland government to consult the people of Queensland and, if necessary, to shame the Queensland government into consulting the people of Queensland.As the House will know, the Australian Electoral Commission conducts all federal elections and all federal referenda. The Australian Electoral Commission also undertakes a wide range of other activities. These include the provision of all election and ballot services for the trade union movement in Australia at a cost in the last financial year of about $6.2 million. This is not a fee-for-service arrangement; that $6.2 million bill is footed by the taxpayer. It is meant to ensure free and fair elections and ballots in the trade union movement. But at least on this occasion the trade union movement is going one better than Mr Beattie: it is actually allowing ballots to take place; Mr Beattie is not allowing the ballots to take place. What I am announcing today is that the government has decided to allow the Australian Electoral Commission to undertake any plebiscite on the amalgamation of any local government body in any part of Australia. Mr Beattie has threatened to sack councils if they dare to dabble with democracy. What Mr Beattie has said is: 'If you dare to have a vote, we will threaten your jobs; we will threaten your livelihood.' That is what Mr Beattie has said. Let me say back to Mr Beattie that, on behalf of the people of Queensland who are being denied a democratic choice, the Australian Electoral Commission will conduct free of charge, at the expense of the Commonwealth, referenda or plebiscites about the amalgamation proposals of the Beattie government in any of the local government areas. Within the limits of our constitutional power, we do not intend to remain idle and silent while the wishes of people in these local government areas are denied. We do not take sides; we simply -  - Let me return to the scene of the crime and the Beattie government. What the Beattie government is doing is riding roughshod over the wishes of the people of many parts of Queensland. We are not trying to compel a ballot in every shire and every council area. We are saying that, if you want a vote, the AEC will conduct it and we will pay for it. I challenge the Premier of Queensland to let the people speak on his amalgamation proposal. Let the people of Queensland decide. Let this be a reminder that, if you remove the checks and balances in our system and have Labor governments at every level, this sort of behaviour will become the norm.</DOC>

 - The particular allegation in the book is wrong. I have made that clear, as has the former Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. As to the other matters, let me point out to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that the workers, generally speaking, are better off under our policies than they were under the former policies. There are more of them in jobs, strikes are fewer, wages are higher and the economy has benefited from the flexibility extended by these changes.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Dobell. I can inform the House that this morning the ACCI and St George Bank released their business expectations survey, which shows that business conditions improved significantly in the June quarter and are at their highest level in eight years. The index improved from 58.5 points to 60.5 points. Expectations also rose strongly to near record levels, which, the ACCI noted, indicates excellent conditions ahead. The survey showed that investment in plant and equipment rose strongly and is at its highest level since the survey began. This comes along with the NAB quarterly business survey, released for the June quarter, which shows that business conditions rose three points and expectations for the three months ahead are now at record levels.What is significant about this is that this is coming at the end of the longest period of continuous growth in the Australian economy ever recorded. We are now in the longest continuous growth period ever recorded and yet business is still reporting near record expectations. This long expansion in the Australian economy is responsible, along with the government's economic reforms, for 2.1 million additional jobs having been created in this country and for inflation during this long period of expansion being within our band of two to three per cent. In fact, the consumer price index to June was 2.1 per cent higher.The major contributor to that increase in the consumer price index was fuel prices, coming off record world oil prices. But the good news is that the average petrol price in July was lower than the average price in June, meaning that petrol is now at its lowest price in four months - and, far from contributing to inflationary pressures, as it did in the June quarter, the fall in petrol prices, if it continues for the remainder of this quarter, should actually detract from the consumer price index.The government's policy, which has been to balance the budget, pay off debt, reform the tax system, improve industrial relations, improve the productivity on Australia's wharves and improve the welfare system to encourage people out of welfare and into work, has now contributed to the longest period of economic expansion in Australian history, job creation at a level we have never seen and unemployment now at 33-year lows - and it has been done consistently with a low inflation rate of two to three per cent.This does not mean that there is not more to be done - of course there is more to be done. But this is the government that pioneered those reforms that have got us to where we now are and this is the government that will take us on to those reforms in the future.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Bass for his question and note that I had a very enjoyable time in Tasmania last week. I visited the member for Bass, the member for Franklin and a number of others. I did not happen to catch up with Kevin Harkins, though, which was a little disappointing.There are more than one million employers in Australia - and, whilst the vast majority of employers do the right thing by their employees, there will inevitably be bad employers out there, just as there are bad employees. This government has put in place very strong protections. The fairness test ensures that penalty rates cannot be traded away without proper compensation. The Workplace Authority checks all the new agreements. That does not happen with the Labor Party's 45c-an-hour contracts. The Workplace Ombudsman goes after employers who do the wrong thing, but there will always be some bosses who try to get away with breaking the law.My attention has been drawn to the transcript of an interview on the ABC late on Friday night. It was a very interesting interview, I might say. It was an interview with Cassie Whitehill. Cassie Whitehill said:It was the last working day before Christmas, so it was a Friday. It was the day after our Christmas dinner and I got a call to the office. _ I went in with my friend _But her boss:_ asked her to leave the premises while he spoke to me for two minutes and I went into his office and he closed the door and just said, 'I'm terminating your employment.'I said, 'Why?'. He said, 'I don't have to give you a reason. Don't try and back me into a corner.'I said, 'What are the reasons?'' He said, 'I'm not telling you why. That's just the way it is.'He said, 'I want you to resign on the spot.'I said, 'I'm not going to resign.'He said, 'I want you to sign a deed of release to say that you won't bad mouth us or sue us or anything.'I said, 'I'm not signing anything.'Then he went on to offer a week's pay and she said, 'I'm not signing.' What sort of boss would treat an employee like that? The boss was not from the Lilac City Motor Inn - we remember what the Deputy Leader of the Opposition did to them - or a painter on a government ad or something. Who was this boss who sacked this employee and would not give her reasons? It was the secretary of the Australian Services Union. And you know what, Mr Speaker? That man, Sean Kelly, is the President of the Labor Party in Tasmania. So the president of the Labor Party in Tasmania goes and sacks an employee, gives no reason and tells her to get her friend out of the office so there is no record. The ABC interviewer went on to ask whether Cassie went to the union's head office. Cassie said yes. The interviewer asked, 'You were not offered union support to be in the office with you?' Cassie said no. The interviewer continued: 'Or any other workplace support? And you were told you were sacked on the spot and no reason had to be given?' Cassie said, 'Yes, that's right.' It is an alarming case. Cassie Whitehill has had a pretty tough time. Her mother was terminally ill in palliative care, and a few days afterwards, very sadly, she lost a child through a miscarriage. The ABC pointed this out. The interviewer asked: 'So in December last year you lost your job, you lost your baby and you lost your mum?' She said, 'Yes, all in the space of five days.'Cassie called Simon Cocker, the head of the union's peak body, Unions Tasmania. She said:The same day I was dismissed, I phoned Unions Tasmania and spoke with Simon Cocker and he advised me there wasn't much he could do but if I wanted to I could take it to the anti-discrimination tribunal _Mr Cocker said the union has no role in the internal affairs of any other unions. I found that hard to believe. The head of the ASU is sacking one of his employees, but I thought, 'If she goes to the ASU, she might get a response.' So I did not go to Kevin07 this morning; I went to the ASU website. I wondered, 'What do they do when it comes to unfair dismissal?' The ASU website says:The ASU handles many cases of unfair dismissal each year. Generally we obtain a better outcome ...That is what the ASU say. They did not lift a finger for Cassie. -  - It is under state law as an incorporated organisation. Unions Tasmania did not lift a finger for Cassie. Cassie went on to say:I wasn't going to go down without a fight. I emailed the national secretary of the ASU. He didn't respond at all. I emailed Kevin Rudd. He did respond and said he was passing the matter on to Julia Gillard, but I didn't hear anything back from her either. - That is right; she has been closed down. So we have Cassie, who feels as though she has been unfairly dismissed and may be subject to duress - according to Peter Patmore in the same interview - and subject to bullying. And what happens? She goes to the union and they do not want to know about it because she is not a member. She goes to Unions Tasmania and they do not want to know about it. The state government responsible for these laws in Tasmania did not want to know about it. She goes to the Leader of the Opposition and he does not want to know anything about it, and she goes to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and she does not want to know anything about it.We have in place the Workplace Ombudsman. We are prepared to stand up for the workers. We will not be intimidated by the Labor Party and their dirty tricks campaign. We will stand up for individual workers, and we will investigate this case. The Labor Party, particularly the Leader of the Opposition, should put aside their hypocrisy and get rid of the President of the Labor Party in Tasmania, who has acted in this deceitful way. The Leader of the Opposition should change his policy so that he is not beholden to the union thugs.</DOC>

 - We will investigate all allegations, including Cassie's, under state labour laws, where the unfair dismissal laws would apply to the union movement. We are happy to investigate these matters, and we do it responsibly. When an allegation is made, about any individual, we will have the matter investigated. That is why we set up the Workplace Ombudsman.The Labor Party do not have a policy on anything. They do not have a defence policy, a health policy, an education policy, a trade policy, a tax policy, a small business policy, a climate change policy or a finance policy. They do not have any policy, apart from their half-baked industrial relations policy framework, which says nothing about a workplace ombudsman. In fact, they say that they are going to abolish the Workplace Ombudsman. Where would Cassie go to get help then? Where would the children involved in these allegations go to get the matter thoroughly investigated? The Labor Party have a policy to abolish the Workplace Ombudsman. Do you know why? It is because they want to channel everyone through the union movement, so that the union bosses are the only arbiters of fairness in the workplace - the union bosses that represent only 15 per cent of the private sector workforce, the union bosses that are represented by the 70 per cent of the Labor Party frontbench who have come out of the union ranks.The Labor Party are so hypocritical when it comes to these issues that they are prepared to stand up for the people in their own ranks who have potentially been breaking the law, yet they are prepared to go after other individuals in this forum and outside of the chamber.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Maranoa for his question. The member for Maranoa recognises only too well, given the diversity of his electorate, the importance of the relationship that has been established between our government - the federal coalition government - and local authorities across Australia, particularly in the electorate of Maranoa in Queensland, where we have worked very closely in delivering to local communities the sorts of services that they need. This includes programs like Regional Partnerships, which is directly targeted at addressing local issues and helping to strengthen the local economic and social fabric. A lot of the Regional Partnerships program is actually delivered by local government. Since Regional Partnerships was established there have been 1,350 projects funded to the tune of $311 million across Australia, $140 million of which has gone to local governments that have applied for funding under that program. It is interesting - and the member for Hotham might listen to these statistics - that Regional Partnerships projects have attracted $969 million in cash contributions from other participants in the program and $106 million in kind. So well over $1 billion has been spent on Regional Partnerships projects, a lot of them in local government areas - 1,350 projects for an investment of $311 million by the Commonwealth.But it does not end there. In 2001 we recognised the need and the ability of local authorities to get money directly onto the ground to benefit local communities. We announced the establishment of the Roads to Recovery program. We have been funding that program since 2001 and, as the Prime Minister indicated, that is $307 million a year to local authorities across Australia. We announced in the budget this year that we are going to take that up to $350 million a year for the term of AusLink 2, from 2009 to 2014, to give certainty to local governments across Australia. Many of the projects have been funded under the AusLink Strategic Regional Roads Program, $470 million having been spent on this program in recent years, with a lot of that money going into much needed road projects in local government authority areas.No wonder we are concerned at the way that the Beattie Labor government in Queensland is trashing democracy, and local government democracy, in Queensland with its ham-fisted approach to the forced amalgamations in Queensland. We are in there trying to help local government. We are holding up our end of the deal, delivering every cent we give on the ground to local communities, and the Beattie Labor government is going to trash that. This afternoon it is introducing legislation to reduce the number of local government authorities in Queensland from 156 to 72. There are 45,000 Queenslanders employed in local government in Queensland. All their jobs are now being put at risk because the Beattie Labor government in Queensland does not care about democracy or about those 45,000 people who work in local government. There is outrage throughout Queensland, from Noosa on the coast to Longreach in the west and right up into the Cape. They are marching in the streets in Queensland because they have been ignored. Just like the Leader of the Opposition turns his back in question time, he has turned his back on local government in Queensland and the 45,000 people who are employed by local government in Queensland.We have continued to say that the risk of a Rudd Labor government here in Canberra is that it does not know how to manage money - and that is right. We know that he will be a patsy to the union movement. Last week he confirmed, and he confirms again today, that he is just going to be a patsy to the Labor premiers. He has been making all the nice noises about being concerned about amalgamation of local government in Queensland, but he has not done anything about it. He has not got the guts to get on the phone to Premier Beattie and tell him to back off and respect those 45,000 jobs that are in local government in Queensland. It is proof positive of why, last week, the Labor Party announced that it was going to remove all conditions of specific purpose payments to state governments. He is just going to be a patsy to Labor premiers right across Australia. Australia cannot afford to have coast-to-coast Labor governments or there will be a lot more of this sort of ham-fisted approach to democracy as we know it in Australia.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Solomon for his question and his obvious interest in the children of the Northern Territory. It has been nearly six weeks since the government announced its intervention into the Northern Territory. Of course, that was a response to the Little children are sacred report, with the one goal, the one aim, to protect the children of the Northern Territory. Much work has been done in that six-week period. I can report to the House that we have formed a task force headed by magistrate Dr Sue Gordon, a woman who is, unfortunately, too accustomed to hearing these sorts of things in her work in the children's courts of Western Australia. She is currently living in Alice Springs and is moving around the Territory talking with, consulting with and reassuring the broader community, women in particular, of what the government is achieving and what our aims and objectives are.Major General David Chalmers, who is the task force's operational commander, is doing a wonderful job. He too is in Alice Springs with his team. They have visited all sites and made an assessment of some 47 of them. To date, 41 advanced communications teams have taken visits. Thus, a lot of work has been undertaken in that first phase. The reality is that there was a fair bit of misinformation, with people suggesting that the military were coming in to steal children and to shoot dogs, which of course never occurred. It was great to see the military getting out of the vehicles and young fellas running up to the soldiers and playing footy with them. That was in stark contrast to some of the media reports that filtered through in the early days.I also want to take the opportunity to thank the volunteers. Over 400 medical professionals and doctors volunteered to go to the Territory to assist with this humanitarian work. Without their efforts it would simply not be possible to get the necessary health checks - so far 440 children have had health checks. Unfortunately I also report to the House that there have been referrals to authorities in relation to child abuse, and further testing of these children for sexually transmitted diseases has been undertaken. That is sad, but it is much sadder if the abuse goes undetected and the sufferings of those children are not brought to the surface.Policing has been a key issue. The Australian Federal Police have been trained and have been sworn as special constables into the Northern Territory police force. They are on the ground in a number of communities, including Imampa, Mutitjulu, Santa Teresa and Haasts Bluff. An additional 10 AFP officers are undergoing training at the moment, and they will be deployed shortly. I am told that by the middle of this month the Queensland police will be ready to deploy. They will then undergo training and move into the communities.There is much to be done today. I have introduced five bills into this House, including two appropriation bills for a total of over $580 million of additional Commonwealth expenditure. That is the commitment in financial terms. The Defence Force and our department are putting the human capital in place so that we have managers on the ground. These are the practical measures that are giving expression to our response to protecting the children in the Northern Territory. I bring to the attention of those who think the Commonwealth did not need to act, or thought that the Northern Territory would act, the comments by the Chief Minister in the last day. Ms Martin said:The compulsory acquiring of town camps has nothing to do with protecting children.This shows how out of touch she and her government are on this matter. I visited the town camps task force in Alice Springs last year, and they advised me that there was an average of one murder per month in Alice Springs and that Alice Springs had one of the world's highest rates of stabbings. In May this year, two women were murdered in separate instances in the town camps. The legendary Australian artist Albert Namatjira's 15-year-old great-granddaughter was raped and murdered.In June last year Ms Martin said that housing was the critical issue, which highlights the challenges we face. Albeit that we get words of comfort from the Northern Territory government, it is very difficult to move forward and help these children when people still hold those sorts of attitudes. I will leave the last comments to the local Catholic priest, Father Raass, who said of the town camps:These appalling conditions have led many people to despair and expose children to risk.We have to stop that risk. This is why the government is moving. This is why the legislation is before the House. This is why the Howard government sees the urgency in protecting all Australian children at this time, particularly those in the Northern Territory.</DOC>

 - Can I just pick up the reference made to interest rates. What I promised, and what I repeat here today in front of this dispatch box, was that in Australia interest rates will always be lower under a coalition government than under a Labor government. It ought to be reinforced by the fact that the Labor Party has policies - namely, a return to a centralised wage-fixing system - that guarantee that there will be more upward pressure on interest rates under a Labor government than under this government. I would remind the member for Ballarat that, throughout the debate in 2004, that was the principal forward argument that I put in advance of the argument that interest rates would always be lower under us than under Labor.I pointed to Labor's record in government. They do not like this, but my argument about interest rates - and I am very happy you asked me this question - is based on: Labor's performance when last in federal government, when interest rates hit 17 per cent for housing; their behaviour at a state government level; the fact that the government was left with a very large amount of debt in 1996; and a comparison of our industrial relations policy with that of the Labor Party. Those who sit opposite want to go back to the days of a centralised wage-fixing policy - where, if you paid a big wage increase over here, it flowed through to the rest of the economy, it put upward pressure on wages everywhere and therefore upward pressure on inflation and, thereby, interest rates. We have broken that connection. The only thing that threatens to reconnect those two things is the election of a Labor government.I am fascinated that the opposition should ask me about people who do focus group work, because I am reminded of something that somebody said about those who advise the Leader of the Opposition about the attitudes of the Australian public. I do not normally draw on this source, but I will make an exception on this occasion because the comment was so good. -  - Here we see the Leader of the Opposition's back again. Of course, I am referring to the description given by my immediate predecessor in the office I now hold, former Labor Prime Minister Mr Paul Keating, when he spoke of those who advise the Leader of the Opposition. He had a lot of things to say about them, but the best of all is this:The Labor Party is not going to profit from having these proven unsuccessful people around who are frightened of their own shadow and won't get out of bed in the morning unless they've had a focus group report to tell them which side of bed to get out.If ever that description fitted anyone, it fits the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Lilley. They do not eat a morsel of food without getting a focus group report first. They are the most poll-driven group. They talk about Crosby Textor; Hawker Britton would leave them for dead.</DOC>

 - First, I thank the honourable member for his question and for his interest. I was in Manila last week at the ASEAN Post-Ministerial Conference, the East Asia Summit and the ASEAN Regional Forum. A significant focus was counter-terrorism and three or four issues came out of those meetings. The first was that all the delegations recognised that we must have tough laws to counter terrorism effectively. To use a phrase that the House will have heard in recent times, it is better always to be safe than to be sorry. The second issue is that this government has focused on building bilateral links with ASEAN countries in the area of counterterrorism. No link is more important than the bilateral memorandum of understanding on counterterrorism that we signed with Indonesia and the subsequent Lombok Treaty signed by the Indonesian Foreign Minister and me in December last year. That has underwritten excellent work in the field of counterterrorism undertaken by Australia and Indonesia with consequences that have been very important to the security of this country.Honourable members may not know, but the opposition says that we should downgrade bilateral relations and upgrade multilateralism. That is the opposition's hypothesis. Members opposite say that we should place greater emphasis on the United Nations and less emphasis on these bilateral relationships. With the greatest of respect to the United Nations, I do not think that as an institution it would have been able to do anything like the work we have been able to do bilaterally with Indonesia in South-East Asia.My third point flows from my second point. I do not mind saying this in the teeth of what Mr Beattie said about the Australian Federal Police, but I think the Australian Federal Police have done an outstanding job. I know that honourable members opposite do not agree, but the Australian Federal Police have done an outstanding job in countering terrorism in South-East Asia. It is my view that the work of the Australian Federal Police in South-East Asia on counterterrorism has saved many lives. These people deserve more respect than being called Keystone Cops. It surprises me that the Leader of the Opposition is not big enough to stand up to the Premier of Queensland and say that he completely rejects that analysis. That is a shame, because if Labor wins the next election this country will have a Prime Minister who has not repudiated those appalling remarks made by Premier Beattie. My final point is that since 9-11 this government has invested a further $450 million in counterterrorism measures. The Labor Party, in the form of the honourable member for Melbourne's 2 March press release, says that it will cut $32 million from the part of my department's budget dealing with counterterrorism. -  - I would be quite happy to have a policy debate with the Labor Party on these issues. The best that the Leader of the Opposition offers is not a policy debate of substance but a T-shirt competition and some sort of stunt on cyberspace. I think this country deserves a Leader of the Opposition with substance, not stunts.</DOC>

 - On this occasion, no, he was not. But he has considerably improved with the opportunity and experience of being a member of my government. I take this opportunity to address the substance of the issue. I am interested to learn that the opposition is opposed to the government's plan to keep the hospital open. - It is the second killer blow of this question time! That is a real revelation! It suggests that you were in the Labor Party, Brendan. I have never heard that before!Could we go back to the Mersey hospital? I think what the people of Devonport and the people of Northern Tasmania would like to know is: where does the Leader of the Opposition stand on this issue? Does he want to keep this hospital open, or does he effectively want to downgrade it to a subclass facility? He was asked this by Fran Kelly on three occasions yesterday morning and he said, 'Oh, I'm waiting on all the details.' But all the details are there.There comes a time when you can no longer sit on the fence and you can no longer keep all of your options open. We are for the people of Devonport. We are for keeping this hospital open as a full public hospital facility. We believe in looking after the interests of 70,000 Northern Tasmanians - and they would like the Leader of the Opposition to get off the fence and say where he stands.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Corangamite for his fine question. Our policy is very clear. We believe in putting in place in law the appropriate protections for employees and also - indirectly for employees - in making sure that employees are able to get on with the job without having union thugs come onto the work site to try to close it down. What does this mean? In the case of the government, we were the government that introduced changes to the building code. We introduced the Building Code itself and set up the Australian Building and Construction Commission, which has delivered real dividends not only for the people who are buying homes and purchasing office space but also, importantly, for workers in the building industry.The ABCC commissioned an Econtech report into the benefits of having set up the Building Code in the ABCC. The Econtech report found that, if the independent building watchdog were to be abolished, as the Labor Party want to do, it would have a dramatic impact not only on inflation but also on housing prices. In fact, Econtech found that, by curbing unwarranted and vexatious union strike action and acts of thuggery, the ABCC has reduced inflation by one percentage point. Just think about the impact on interest rates should the Labor Party's industrial relations policy be implemented and the union thugs and the CFMEU were to go back onto the work site and close down housing construction, certainly making it more expensive.In fact, Econtech found that the cost of a house in Australia is now three per cent lower, thanks to our industrial relations laws. On a $300,000 home, that is nearly $10,000 - and the Leader of the Opposition, me old china here, says that he is worried about housing affordability! For new entrants the biggest barrier to housing affordability is the Labor Party and their industrial relations laws changes. The biggest impediment to cheaper housing is an inflexible workplace relations system. The only policy the Labor Party have released - and it is only part of a policy; it is a working document - is their industrial relations policy. They still do not have a policy on health. They do not have a policy on education. They do not have a policy on foreign affairs. They do not have a policy on defence. They do not have a policy on small business. They do not have a policy on transport. They do not have a policy on immigration. We are waiting for the policies - and the election is around the corner. But do you know what? They have a policy on T-shirts.I was wondering why they would have a policy out there on industrial relations. Why did they go so early on industrial relations, when they have not come out with any other policy? I came across a letter on the union intranet from the Finance Sector Union, the FSU. It is a standard pro forma letter that the FSU sends out. It says:In my view - that is, in the union's view - the key principles of Labor's policy are similar to those outlined in the policy adopted by the ACTU at its congress of 2006.So we had the hypocrisy of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, who went on the John Laws program and said:I've already had some disagreements with the trade union movement. The policy we produced was not the policy they wanted.Yet here, the unions are running around saying that, in fact, the Labor Party's policy is the policy that the union bosses wanted. Do you know what, Mr Speaker? This says everything about the Labor Party and everything about their hypocrisy. They go out there and say one thing to the general public, but behind closed doors they are doing these shady deals with the union bosses - because it is the union bosses that are funding the Labor Party, it is the union bosses that are supplying the candidates for the Labor Party, it is the union bosses that make up 70 per cent of their frontbench and it is the union bosses that will be back in control on the dark day that a Rudd Labor government gets elected.</DOC>

 - The thing that I regret most is the impact that any interest rate rise will have on working families. That is the thing I regret most. If the Leader of the Opposition were interested in the human impact of these things rather than the politics, he might have addressed his question to the impact of things on Australian families. I remind the Leader of the Opposition that the most definitive thing I said in the election campaign of 2004 was in answer to a question from Neil Mitchell, 'So you would not be embarrassed to win the election and then have an interest rate rise?' My answer was: I do not seek to give guarantees or judgements about individual movements. It is my argument that they will always be lower under our policies,' and that argument is supported by the last time Labor were in government and the impact of their industrial relations policies.For the benefit of the House and for a wider audience, I repeat what I said in answer to this question. I regret very much the adverse impact of any interest rate rises on Australian homebuyers. I regret that very much. I would, however, remind the Leader of the Opposition that when the current increase in the cash rate is passed through to housing loans the level of the average housing loan in Australia, at 8.3 per cent, will still be lower than it was at any time under the Hawke and Keating governments. I would remind the Leader of the Opposition that interest rates for housing loans averaged 12¾ per cent under the former government, and that is a full 4½ percentage points higher than those interest rates will be as a result of today's increase in the cash rate. Notoriously, of course, interest rates hit 17 per cent in the late 1980s.I also remind the Leader of the Opposition that the industrial relations policy that he is handcuffed to, if implemented, will push up interest rates. That is the view of economists and of business organisations. It stands to reason that, if you deregulate the labour market and re-establish a centralised wage-fixing system, you will create wages breakouts in areas of the economy that cannot afford to pay those high wages, with adverse consequences for unemployment and for higher interest rates. I say that without moving into the area of fiscal policy, where, despite the Leader of the Opposition's protestations of conservatism and responsibility, in the eight or nine years he has been in this place he has voted against every attempt by the government to get the budget back into balance and into surplus.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Greenway for her question about the impact of strong economic management on the daily lives of Australians. In reply to that question: the most important thing about economic management is the human dividend it produces. Those who sit opposite who seek to look only at the politics of the situations should be reminded that the greatest thing this government has achieved over the last 11½ years is to have driven the unemployment rate down to a 33-year low. A low unemployment rate means that more and more Australian families are in work. A low unemployment rate means that the dignity of work is within the reach and enjoyment of many more Australians than used to be the case under the Labor government. We have seen, in the last 11½ years, 2.1 million new jobs generated. We have seen 365,000 new jobs generated since the government's recent industrial relations reforms.We have also, as I indicated in answer to the Leader of the Opposition, seen housing interest rates, even after today's rise, at lower levels than they were at any time under the former Labor government. We have seen an increase of 20.8 per cent in real terms in wages compared with a reduction of 1.7 per cent in real terms during the 13 years of the Hawke and Keating governments. So strong has been the government's performance in the area of economic management that the Leader of the Opposition is now trying to make a virtue out of the fact that his economic policy is very close to the economic policy of the coalition. Rather, he has tried to make a virtue out of the claim that his economic policy is similar to ours. In his news conference this morning the Leader of the Opposition said to the Australian people, 'There is no difference between the government and the opposition when it comes to economic policy.' That is his claim.If we are so bad in managing the economy, why does the Leader of the Opposition run around Australia saying, 'Ladies and gentlemen, there is no difference between me and the Prime Minister when it comes to economic management'? That is the claim that I would like to analyse for a moment for the benefit of the House. To start with, it is a palpably false claim because, over the last nine years - and the Leader of the Opposition came into this parliament at the 1998 election, just under nine years ago - he has joined every effort of the opposition to frustrate this government in its efforts to get the Australian economy in the shape that it is today. So impressed is he by that shape that he pretends to the Australian community that he really has no difference with the Australian people on economic policy.If he has no difference, why did he, in virtually his first act as a member of this parliament, vote against taxation reform? Why did he vote against industrial relations reform? Why did he vote against tax cuts two budgets ago? Why did he vote to stop the budget being put further back into surplus? Why did he vote against the privatisation of Telstra? Why did he vote against all of the economic reforms of this government which have made a contribution to the very strong economy with which he now seeks to identify himself? The truth is that the Leader of the Opposition claims to be a fiscal conservative, yet his behaviour in the last nine years has been the exact opposite.I search in vain to find the real economic principles of the Leader of the Opposition. What do I find? I find four things. Firstly, I find a false claim of fiscal conservatism, disproved by his voting record in this place. Secondly, I find a commitment to reregulate the Australian labour market, which will have the effect, if implemented, of reducing the high levels of employment we now have and putting upward pressure on inflation. Thirdly, I find that he will hand spending policy over to the states by removing the restrictions on state profligacy in specific purpose payments. And, finally, I find that he has a policy of not having a tax policy for the next election.In conclusion, I say to the member for Greenway, strong economic management returns an enormous human dividend to the Australian people. I have enumerated some of that dividend. The alternative being offered by the Leader of the Opposition represents not only an empty cupboard but a very serious threat to the maintenance of that economic prosperity years into the future.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Deakin for his question. I can inform him that this morning the Reserve Bank announced that it would make a move in the market to increase interest rates by 0.25 of one per cent, from 6¼ per cent to 6½ per cent. The bank issued a statement of the reasons why it had decided to do this. The principal reason which it cited was that domestic economic data in recent months had signalled a pick-up in the pace of growth, demand and activity. In other words, the economy is strengthening, demand is therefore strengthening and activity is therefore strengthening. As a result of that, the board decided to move to increase the official interest rate.Whilst an increase of 0.25 of one per cent will obviously affect mortgage holders and will mean that people will have to pay more for their mortgages and therefore place a heavier burden on those who are paying mortgages, the standard variable rate of 8.3 per cent, which will result from this decision - and of course many homebuyers do not pay 8.3 per cent; that is the reference rate - is still more than two per cent lower than it was when this government was elected - it was then 10½ per cent - and lower than at any time during the previous Labor government, when mortgage interest rates averaged 12¾ per cent.To think that the mortgage interest rate would be lower today than it was in 1996, notwithstanding 11 years of economic growth in the interim and the creation of 2.1 million new jobs, shows how far we have come in Australia since 1996. A big part of the story has been 10 surplus budgets which this government has delivered. We did not have surplus budgets before this government was elected; we had deficit budgets. We had $96 billion of cumulated deficit budgets before this government was elected, culminating in the ripper in 1993 of a deficit of four per cent of GDP - the equivalent of a $40 billion deficit in one year.I was very keen to watch what the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Lilley had to say today about their economic policy. The member for Lilley was asked: 'Why is Labor promising to keep the budget in surplus on average rather than just point blank in surplus each and every year?' The member for Lilley said, 'Because that is prudent fiscal policy'. He went on to say:We would most certainly not be running deficit budgets in the sort of circumstances we have at the moment. We need strong surpluses at the moment.The journalist asked: 'Why are you leaving yourself wriggle room?' We know why he is leaving himself wriggle room: because the Labor Party reserve the right to take the budget back into deficit. That is what they are doing. Why did he go to great lengths to say budget surpluses 'at the moment'? Because, as the journalist pointed out, he wants wriggle room. And why would he want wriggle room? Let me put it this way: if it is important that there be surpluses at the moment, in the current economic conditions, wouldn't each and every government be running a surplus at the moment, in the current economic conditions? But, Mr Speaker, I regret to inform you that there is only one government which is running a surplus at the moment, in the current economic conditions, because between them the states and the territories, whilst surpluses are required 'at the moment' - even by the admission by the member for Lilley - are not running surpluses at all but have taken their budgets into deficit. If you want to see what Labor is doing at the moment, rather than what Labor says it would do at the moment, look at the Labor states and territories. We have it that at the moment there is no excuse for not running a surplus and yet at the moment the Labor Party in government at the state and territory level is doing precisely that.Obviously, this was a faux pas from the member for Lilley because twice he had to be cut across by the Leader of the Opposition, who said, firstly, 'Our position is a mirror position to the government,' and then had to cut across and say, 'Our budget position is identical to the government's.' So let me get this straight: their position is identical to the government's. So they obviously endorse totally what the government has done in fiscal policy. It makes me wonder how they could actually criticise the government in relation to monetary policy when their position is identical. But this is what you get from the Labor Party - you get walking both sides of the street. The suggestion is that somehow the government is responsible but, when they are pinned, the answer is that they have an identical position. We have a Leader of the Opposition whose dearest wish is to be a Liberal, to be a mirror of the Liberal Party, to be identical to the Liberal Party. He would like to hold out that a vote for Rudd is a vote for another Liberal government at the next election. If Kevin Rudd wants to be a Liberal prime minister, there are no grounds whatsoever to try to sheet responsibility home to this government, because there is a big difference between Mr Rudd wanting to be a Liberal and this government. This government does not just want Liberal policies; this government delivers Liberal policies.</DOC>

 - In his press conference today, to which the Treasurer has already referred, the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Lilley had a number of remarkable things to say. One of the claims made by the Leader of the Opposition was that in the whole area of skills the government had effectively ignored taking action over the last 10 years. I take the opportunity of not only refuting that claim but also informing the House that since 1996 the government has provided over $22 billion for skills and over $12 billion to the states and territories for TAFE and vocational training. This compares with spending by the Labor governments during the previous year they were in government of some $1 billion.Over the next four years, the government will spend a record $11.4 billion on vocational and technical education. In the 2007-08 financial year alone the Australian government has committed $2.9 billion, which includes funding for a range of initiatives aimed at addressing skills needs, particularly those in traditional trades. We have established 28 Australian technical colleges in 24 regions across Australia. We are providing a wage top-up of $1,000 per annum for two years for apprentices in trades with skills shortages, $500 a year for two years for training fees for apprentices in trades with skills shortages, FEE-HELP for people studying diplomas and advances diplomas in the VET sector and up to $50,000 for training organisations developing fast-track apprentices. We are establishing the Australian Institute for Trade Skills Excellence. We are providing a tool kit worth up to $800 to Australian apprentices in occupations with skills needs, employer incentives of $4,000 per apprentice, a $13,000 wage subsidy for mature age apprentices and work skills vouchers of up to $3,000 for individuals aged 25 years or over who do not have year 12 or equivalent qualifications We are also providing for apprentices business skills training vouchers of up to $500, the living away from home allowance, Austudy, Abstudy and a $1,000 regional allowance.We are also providing two $500 Commonwealth trade learning scholarships to Australian apprentices who are employed by small- or medium-sized business or group training operations in occupations with skills needs. We are providing an additional 5,000 places in the Access Program, which assists job seekers experiencing barriers to skilled employment. We are providing up to 4,500 prevocational training places in the trades through group training arrangements. We are working in partnership with group training organisations to provide an additional 7,000 Australian school based apprenticeships. We are increasing the funding for Australian apprenticeship centres to allow them to intervene at key points during an apprenticeship to increase retention and completion rates. We are extending the employer incentives to include selected diploma and advanced diploma qualifications. We are establishing the Australian Surf Lifesaver Training Academy, which will provide a nationally consistent approach to surf rescue and public safety training. We are supporting national reforms agreed with the states and territories through the Council of Australian Governments designed to underpin a new genuinely national approach to apprenticeships, training and skills recognition. In the face of that record over the last 11 years, it was a complete distortion of the truth for the Leader of the Opposition to have made the claim that he did this morning.</DOC>

 - The thing that working families should believe is what they experience under different governments. I am very happy that the Leader of the Opposition has asked me to talk about the experience of working families under different governments. I am very proud to contrast the experience of working families under this government with the experience of working families under the government of the party to which the Leader of the Opposition is formally committed, the Australian Labor Party. We know what his secret desires about political affiliation are, but he does formally belong to the Australian -  - I do not pretend to this House or to the Australian public that every working family in this country is enjoying to the full the very strong and prosperous economy we now have. There are some who are, through no fault of their own, missing out. But, if you look at the proper measures that affect the living standards of Australian families, those measures suggest that they have fared better under this government than they did under the previous Labor government - and not only that but that they will fare better through a continuation of this government than they would under a Rudd Labor government. That is what this debate is all about: whether working families were better off under Labor than they are now or would be better off under Labor in the future than they are now. - By any measure, be it unemployment, be it interest rates, be it real wages or be it levels of taxation, working families in this country - generally speaking; not every one of them - have fared better under this government than they did under the previous government.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Wakefield for his question and for his interest in these matters. The Reserve Bank did note in its statement today that it had given careful consideration to recent developments in the global economy and that credit markets, particularly in the US, were experiencing turbulence and that these may provide downside risks to the US economy. That is a reference to what is called the US subprime market. Subprime loans are typically loans that are made to borrowers with impaired credit histories - that is, they may have had a previous payment default, a foreclosure or a bankruptcy. Because they have an impaired credit history, the rate at which the loan is made is generally higher. Subprime mortgages make up about 15 per cent of the US mortgage market. In relation to that 15 per cent, the delinquency rate - that is, those who are in arrears in 90 days - is about 10 per cent. In Australia, the closest thing we have is what we call a non-conforming loan. Far from that making up 15 per cent of the Australian market, in Australia it is about one per cent of the market. The delinquency rate of those borrowers is about 6½ per cent. So the US has a far larger exposure to subprime lending.In relation to all mortgages, in the United States the percentage of all mortgages that are 90 days in arrears is about 2½ per cent. In Australia the percentage of all mortgages that are 90 days in arrears is 0.4 per cent. That rate of arrears is about one-sixth of what you see in the United States. There are some Australian financial institutions that do have an exposure to the US subprime market. These are generally in funds to which mortgages have been on-sold as investments. Some of those financial institutions have been affected by developments in the United States. But I can assure you, Mr Speaker, and the House through you, that the Australian financial institutions are in a very strong position, very well capitalised and highly profitable, and our prudential regulator does not see any of the problems developing in relation to them that have arisen in the US subprime market.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, let me say to the Leader of the Opposition that I accept total responsibility for things that happen under my watch and under the watch of my government. I accept responsibility for the good things as well as the bad things. It is true - and I do not mind saying it to the Leader of the Opposition and through him to the broader Australian community - that there have been increases in interest rates, most recently today. It is true that interest rates have moved up by 1¼ per cent since the last election. It is also the case that interest rates now on housing are still lower than they were at any time in 13 years of Labor. It is still true that interest rates on housing averaged 12¾ per cent under Labor over 13 years - a full 4½ percentage points higher than they are at the present time. It is true that unemployment is now at a 33-year low. It is true that working families' wages in general have increased significantly in real terms during our time in office. It is true that business conditions now - and the profit share as a result - are at near record levels. It is true that the Australian economy is in a stronger position now than it has been at any time since the end of World War II including, by any proper comparison, the 1950s and 1960s.In asking me if I accept responsibility, I accept responsibility for everything that has gone wrong within the government's control over the last 11½ years. - In doing that I am entitled to point to the successes that this government has had. Looking through the transcripts of interviews that I gave during the last election, I have come across an interview I gave with Barry Cassidy of the Insiders program on 7 October 2004. This was two days out from the last election and it was probably the last interview I gave on a significant ABC program during that election campaign. The very last question I was asked was:Prime Minister, if you are fortunate to win on Saturday, what do you think will have made the vital difference?My answer was as follows - I have read through the answer and now, almost three years on, I would not alter a word of this answer because it remains as true today as it was on 7 October 2004:The fact that the people trust us to better manage the Australian economy. That we have delivered periods of very low interest rates, of strong employment growth and great stability. And they better trust us to lead this country at a time of international peril as a result of the threat of terrorism.I would not alter a word of that three years later.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hinkler for his question. Obviously, the government's investment in road and rail infrastructure during our time in office has been considerable and recently has increased dramatically. Of course, that goes to the very heart of driving economic growth and jobs growth in Australia. As the member for Hinkler would be well aware, under the Auslink 1 program we are in the process of investing $15.8 billion in Australia's land transport infrastructure. We can do this because of the good economic management that this government has brought to the economy in Australia. We are doing this with funds from revenue, not from borrowings. We do not have to borrow funds to invest in land transport infrastructure. As a result of the budget this year, we have announced that we are going to extend that investment through until 2014 with a further $22.3 billion in land transport infrastructure. That will be a total of $38 billion over 10 years invested in Australia's land transport infrastructure from revenues, not from borrowings. That is a hallmark of this government which is in stark contrast to many state governments across Australia. Also in delivering the lowest level of unemployment in 33 years - it is down to 4.3 per cent - we have seen 2.1 million new jobs created since 1996. This is fundamental to the ongoing growth of the economy in Australia.The member for Hinkler asked whether there are any alternative policies. There are actually two - not one. In response to the budget announcement of Auslink 2 earlier this year, the member for Batman made a very positive comment when he said, 'That is why Auslink 2 must build on the investment of Auslink 1 in Australia's strategic, economic, transport infrastructure.' We agree. We accepted that as a positive comment on the direction in which we are going, that we need to invest in infrastructure and that it needs to be done very quickly. In contrast, last week the Leader of the Opposition announced his plans for the so-called 'Infrastructure Australia', a new statutory authority which he wants to set up. He has committed to, within 100 days of being elected, establishing Infrastructure Australia - that will be three months down the track. Then he is going to give Infrastructure Australia 12 months to produce its first infrastructure priority list. We argue, and we presume the member for Batman agrees, that we have negotiated a priority list with the states and identified the strategic corridors into which we need to invest $38 billion. We are getting on with that job and investing in infrastructure, but the Leader of the Opposition wants to freeze it. He wants to put it all on hold for 15 months, while he establishes a new statutory authority, and that would be going back to the old Labor way of dealing with policy - establish a committee, have an inquiry and look at the options, thereby providing more time for the union movement to get back into control and for the CFMEU to be back on construction sites to help the union masters get back control of the construction industry in Australia.In answer to the member for Hinkler's question, he knows very well what the government is doing. We are in the process of delivering that infrastructure, including on the Bruce Highway in his electorate, and on local roads and strategic roads in his electorate. But we have two policies from the Labor Party: one from the member for Batman, the shadow spokesman, who seems to support the government strategy of getting on and investing in the infrastructure that we know we need, and another the policy of the Leader of the Opposition, who wants to freeze everything, establish another statutory authority and have an inquiry.</DOC>

 - The figures constantly used by the opposition are those which include all mortgage liabilities and are not restricted to homebuyers. They include people who have borrowed money on their existing homes to buy a second property and they include a lot of older people who, having paid off their homes, are remortgaging or repledging their homes under a mortgage arrangement to enable their children to buy homes. If the shadow Treasurer were a little more in touch with the changed practices of homeowners in this country over the last 11 years, he would understand that he is not making a valid comparison.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hasluck for the question. I note that this government has introduced laws that provide very strong protection for workers. We guarantee minimum wages, sick leave, parental leave and so on. It is also quite obviously illegal to underpay workers. In the states, in partnership with the Commonwealth, we have strong laws in relation to a range of factors, whether they be discrimination, bullying in the workplace or any other activity that may represent unlawful activity against a worker.Nationally we have strong laws to protect workers, which the Labor Party want to rip up. We have a strong and independent Workplace Ombudsman, who the Labor Party want to sack. The reason the Labor Party, with their half-baked policy, want to rip up our workplace laws and replace them with laws that favour the union bosses, and abolish the Workplace Ombudsman and put in place only an option for workers to go to the unions is that they are doing the bidding of their union mates. That is because 70 of the Labor Party frontbench are former union officials. The Labor Party and the unions are hand in glove, with an agenda to wind back the industrial relations system to the 1970s.Yesterday in this place I pointed out the case of Cassie Whitehill. I outlined an alarming case. Cassie claims that her employer, the Australian Services Union, engaged in bullying and discriminatory behaviour before sacking her on the last working day before Christmas. Cassie claims the Australian Services Union then asked her to sign a deed of release to stop her speaking publicly about the matter. Given that you can hardly hold back the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition from getting out there in relation to any other case, it was surprising to hear a deafening silence on the Cassie matter from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the Leader of the Opposition and our old friend Sharan Burrow. There was not a word about it.In fact, it was reported in today's newspapers that phone calls were made to union officials and the Labor Party, and they were not returned. That is hard to believe - a media inquiry not returned from the Labor Party! I ask myself: why would the Leader of the Opposition not take action against the employer, the Australian Services Union, and Mr Sean Kelly, who is also the President of the Labor Party in Tasmania? Why would he not take any action against this person? I found out in the Hobart Mercury today that Sean Kelly, the President of the Labor Party in Tasmania, is now trying to find Kevin Harkins a job outside politics to try and get him out of the way in Franklin and ensure that Kevin Rudd, the Leader of the Opposition, wins the seat.There is a deafening silence from the Leader of the Opposition when it comes to Cassie, but when it comes to getting Kevin Harkins a job his mates are doing the bidding. These are serious allegations. In the Hobart Mercury today it says that Mr Harkins has been offered an elevated union position, increased salary and a future Senate seat if he steps down as the Labor candidate in Franklin. I refer the parliament to the Electoral Act, which states:A person shall not, with the intention of influencing or affecting ... any candidature of another person ... give or confer, or promise or offer to give or confer, any property or benefit of any kind to that other person or to a third person.This matter has been referred to the Australian Electoral Commission because it represents, potentially, a very serious offence by Mr Kelly and the Australian Labor Party. According to the Hobart Mercury they are trying to buy their way out of a problem by getting rid of Kevin Harkins in Franklin while they do not have the guts to stand up for a worker that has been sacked by the President of the Labor Party in Tasmania. This is all about Kevin Rudd's Labor - turning your backs on an innocent young person and taking care of a union thug for a political fix.</DOC>

 - I am confused. I will tell you why I am confused. This is why I am confused. The Labor Party asks me what our policy is but the Labor Party supports it. So what is this? You are now asking me to define what your policy is as well. Do you think you should have asked me what my policy was before you stood up and said that yours was identical? Let me tell you what my policy is and therefore explain to you what your policy ought to be. My policy is to produce surplus budgets. As it turns out, we have produced 10 of them. If it had not been for the fact that when we were first elected the budget was $10 billion in deficit, we would have produced a few more.By producing surplus budgets we have now been able to pay off $96 billion worth of debt. I hold this out as a model, because in the current circumstances in Australia it should not be hard. It was much harder in 1996 to balance the budget, but in the current period in Australia, with booming GST receipts, it should not be hard to balance the budget. What we are seeing in Australia is that there are some levels of government that were in surplus but are now going the other way - they are the Labor governments. They were in surplus in 2005-06. They have booming GST receipts. Some of these states have booming mining royalties. They ought to be able to pay for their infrastructure out of their revenue and yet they are going into debt. Why would that be? It is because they are Labor state governments.The old hairy-chested Leader of the Opposition - who wants everybody to believe he is a fiscal conservative and who dearly wants the electorate to think he is a Liberal - cannot make a statement of complaint about this fiscal policy by the states. Why is it? Mr Speaker, has it ever occurred to you that, if he were such a fiscal conservative, he would have no problem being critical of a level of government that was in surplus in 2005-06 and is now going into deficit? A fiscal conservative would not have any trouble doing that. But, as we know, the truth is that he is no fiscal conservative. He wants people to believe that he is a Liberal - but he only talks the talk; he never walks the walk.He had plenty of occasions to stand up in this parliament and vote for fiscal conservatism. He had plenty of occasions to stand up here and support important economic policy. But, when the crunch came, Kevin Rudd was never on the right side. Kevin Rudd never had the decency or the courage to support good economic policy. If he ever became Prime Minister, he would be as much a patsy in the hands of the Labor premiers then as he is now. The difference is that then he would have some influence and some power; fortunately, now he has none.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Braddon for his question. I appreciate how important this issue is for him and for the people of north-western Tasmania. Let me say that north-western Tasmania has never had a better representative than this member for Braddon. Let me make it absolutely crystal clear -  - I hope the people of north-west Tasmania are listening to the caterwauling from members opposite. If the members opposite have something to say to those people, let them say it and not cackle like hyenas in this parliament. Let me say to the people of Devonport, La Trobe, Kentish, Sheffield and Ulverstone that they deserve a comprehensive general hospital that delivers services suitable for a catchment of that size. The situation is very simple. The state Labor government wants to destroy Mersey hospital as it has been known, and the Commonwealth government wants to save it. The state government says that it has a plan for hospital services in the north-west. It is true; it has produced hundreds of pages of paper. It has not committed a single dollar - and, without a dollar, its plan is not worth the paper that it is written on. - It is a paperweight and not a plan. The Commonwealth have a plan; we have a very good plan. - There are three essential elements to the Commonwealth plan. The Commonwealth will fund the hospital, the community will control the hospital and the hospital will deliver the same level of services that it safely and effectively delivered for many years before the state government started the downgrade. The Commonwealth plan means there will be $45 million more for health services in north-west Tasmania. The Commonwealth plan means one level of government funding the hospital and it means that the community that delivers the services and receives the services is the community that controls the services. This is a good model for public hospital service delivery. It is potentially a better model than that currently practised by the state governments.Let me make this point: a state government that refused to accept what was, in effect, a $45-million free gift in health services for the people of north-western Tasmania would be insane; and a federal opposition that supported such a state government would be equally insane. This is a real challenge for the Leader of the Opposition: does he support what the Commonwealth is doing here? On Radio National, on Monday, he was given a chance to say where he stood five times. He wimped out five times - and he is turning his back now.The people of Australia do not want a wimp for a Prime Minister and they do not want an alternative Prime Minister who swivels around in his seat like this whenever he is put under pressure. I say to the Leader of the Opposition: it is time to be a leader and not a follower; and it is time to be a decision maker and not a fence-sitter. He now says that he is some kind of a Liberal in disguise, but he cannot even be trusted to support Liberal policy. - He can never be trusted to deliver Liberal policy. The fact is that the people of Australia know what this guy is. He is just a phoney - a simple phoney.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, I choose to answer the question. It gives me an opportunity to restate the government's position. The government's position is to keep the Mersey hospital open as a full public hospital facility. Unlike others, we happen to believe that providing that hospital would be a very good thing, but it is now apparent from the action of the member for Gellibrand that she and the Leader of the Opposition are opposed to keeping the Mersey hospital open. In other words, we are expected to believe that you can behave in question time as if you are opposed to something, you can pretend that you are opposed to something -  - but, when you are actually accused of being opposed to something, you stand up and you say, 'No, I didn't say that.' What kind of opposition do you have? Whether you agree with our decision or you do not agree with our decision -  - why doesn't the opposition have the courage to stand up and say whether or not it supports keeping the Mersey hospital operating to full capacity? Our position is very clear -  - The member for Gellibrand can play games. I do not think the people of - The member for Gellibrand then left the chamber. - What matters on this issue is not whether you can hold up a facsimile of a newspaper. What matters is who is prepared to look after the people of Devonport, who is prepared to keep open the Mersey hospital. Those on this side of the House are; those on that side of the House are opposed to doing it. They can score all the points they want. - They can crack all the jokes they wish to, but there is a very simple difference on this issue. - We are in favour of this hospital; the Labor Party is against it. We say to the 70,000 people in the catchment area covered by this hospital: we are prepared to invest $45 million to keep this hospital running. The Labor Party thinks so poorly of the people of Devonport that it spends question time making jokes - The member for Fowler then left the chamber. - Can I let the people of Devonport and the people of Northern Tasmania know that, whilst the government has spent the last few minutes arguing in favour of keeping open a full public hospital facility in Devonport and being willing to contribute $45 million to it, the Labor Party opposition has been so contemptuous of their interests that it has had two members asked to leave the House, it has made jokes at the expense of the interests of the people of Devonport and it has put a passion for playing politics above caring for the interests of the people of Devonport.</DOC>

 - First, can I thank the honourable member for Tangney for his question. We were, on balance, very pleased with the way the East Timor elections were conducted. I think they were conducted on the whole quite peacefully, and it was great to see that expression of democracy yet again by the people of East Timor. They elected a parliament and now the president has chosen Xanana Gusmao to be the Prime Minister of East Timor as part of a CNRT party led coalition, which will have 37 seats out of 65 in the East Timor parliament. So they will have a clear majority.We look forward to working with Xanana Gusmao. He is well known to many members of the government. I first met him in 1999 when I visited him in a jail in Jakarta, so he is somebody I have known for a long time. I think we can look forward to a productive relationship with him. Having said that, of course, I know that some people in the Fretilin party - which is the largest single party in the parliament, with 21 seats - will be disappointed that they have not been asked to form the government. Nevertheless, we look forward to maintaining a constructive relationship with the Fretilin leadership and parliamentarians and working with them as they play a part in the new parliament.Let me just make this point: there have been some outbreaks of violence over the past couple of days, seemingly in response to the appointment of Xanana Gusmao and his party and his coalition in East Timor to government. We would urge the East Timorese people to allow the parliament itself to make decisions as to where the majority should lie and, if they have constitutional issues that they wish to raise, then those constitutional issues should be raised where they are meant to be raised - in courts. But the political differences should not be played out on the streets through rock-throwing or, even worse, the use of guns, lawlessness and violence, because in the end not only will that sort of activity be counterproductive, not only is that sort of activity against the laws of East Timor, but it will do devastating damage to the overall state of East Timor and the welfare of the people of East Timor. I would hope that all East Timorese people would first and foremost put the interests of their country before all else.We retain somewhere between 800 and 900 troops in East Timor. We have quite a number of police officers - about 50, I think - working in the United Nations police. That of course underlines the strength of our commitment to East Timor. Those people will stay there for as long as they are needed. We obviously hope that it will be possible to reduce those numbers before too long, but it is going to depend on the situation on the ground in East Timor. I repeat: I very much hope, at this time where we have seen a very successful expression of democracy in a neighbouring country that we have done so much to help, that the people of East Timor - and I mean by that all of the people of East Timor - will accept the democratic results of both the election and of the parliamentary vote, respect the constitution and respect the courts, the broader institutions of the country and not resort to violence.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Macquarie for his question. Over recent months, in the absence of any worthwhile policy ideas on the other side of the House, they have resorted to asserting that the government has done nothing on skills - and the Leader of the Opposition was at it again this morning. This is just not true; it is a political lie, and the Leader of the Opposition knows it. He knows that apprentices in training in the electorate of Griffith have more than doubled since 1996. In 1996, there were 1,350 young people doing apprenticeships in the seat of Griffith; today there are 2,890 doing apprenticeships.Recent research, released today, also puts a lie to the assertion. It shows a massive increase in the number of trade apprentices since 1995-96 - for example, there has been an increase of 67 per cent in the number of apprentices doing construction apprenticeships; there has been a 63 per cent increase in the number of young people doing electrical and electronic apprenticeships. It is the result of the $22 billion worth of initiatives that the Prime Minister detailed earlier. It is why over the last four years in Australia 544,000 young people have completed apprenticeships, compared to 30,000 - a lonely 30,000 - in 1996 when we took office. This has not happened by accident.It is a response of 10 years of hard work by the Howard government, yet what do we hear from those opposite? On the eve of an election and after eight months as Leader of the Opposition, the member for Griffith has provided no plan whatsoever to address the labour and skills shortages. There has not been one question in this House to me or anybody else about skills shortages from those opposite in eight months, yet we hear them assert again and again that this is a priority for the country; not one question. And why? It is because they are devoid of suggestions and ideas.The only response to date that Labor have announced is a program all the way through to 2018, an 11-year program of spending, to tack on a technical classroom to every secondary school across Australia. Putting an oven or a lathe in a classroom down the back end of every secondary school is not a solution to the skills challenge and will only continue to reinforce the view that a technical education is a second-class career. In every one of those secondary schools, the academic stream will continue to dominate. This response would only serve to reinforce the view that a technical career is a second-class career. Recent research from Monash University shows that the one-size-fits-all approach is counterproductive. Labor made 'apprenticeships' and 'trade training' dirty words. If they win office, they will do it again.</DOC>

 - I will take those particular figures on notice and have a look. But what I do stand by, in more general response, is what I said earlier in question time - that, although not every Australian family has benefited to the full from the economic bounty of current times, if you look at the general measures there is no doubt that there is a higher level of prosperity now than there has been at any time over the last 30 years. You cannot deny the fact that unemployment is at a 33-year low. You cannot deny the fact that real wages have increased by 20.8 per cent over the last 13 years. You cannot deny the fact that interest rates now, even after today's increase, are at a lower level than they were at any time under the former government. You cannot deny the fact that, under the 13 years of Hawke and Keating, interest rates for housing averaged 12¾ per cent. Even after today's rise, which will take them to 8.3 per cent, they are still a full 4½ percentage points lower than the average under 13 years of Labor. These are indisputable facts. I will have a look at the Richmond figures - I have my doubts, but I will have a look at them - but the indisputable facts are as I have described them.</DOC>

 - In my portfolio there are two simple reasons why interest rates would be higher today if the Labor Party were in government. Firstly, when it comes to industrial relations, an Econtech report released on 16 July says unequivocally that inflation would be one per cent higher if there were no independent building watchdog, which is the Labor Party's policy. Their policy is to abolish the independent building watchdog, to close down the Building Code. As a result of that, GDP would fall by 1.5 per cent, inflation would increase by 1.2 per cent and that would of course increase interest rates. Secondly, a statement from the Governor of the Reserve Bank says:Capacity utilisation is high after a lengthy period of expansion, and unemployment over recent months has continued to decline.One of the key factors there is about getting people into the workforce, increasing the size of the workforce when there is demand for more workers in the economy.This government had the courage to undertake welfare reform, opposed all the way by the Labor Party. On 1 July this year, nearly a quarter of a million Australians who were in receipt of a parental pension and whose youngest child was of school age had, for the first time, an obligation to go to work for 15 hours a week. We moved that because we knew that Australia needed more workers. The Labor Party, including the Leader of the Opposition, voted against that reform, saying that it was heartless and inappropriate. In fact, the member for Lilley said it should be dumped.We have made the hard decisions about the economy. We made the hard decision on industrial relations reform that Bill Evans from Westpac said on Sky News today is helping to deliver a flexible workplace environment. As he said, if we had the resources boom of the 1970s and the same industrial relations system of the 1970s, things would be out of control. But today we have an equivalent resources boom and we have a flexible workplace that helps to keep unnecessary wage claims in check and at the same time contains inflation - the second area in relation to welfare - opposed all the way by the Labor Party because they do not have the guts to make the hard economic decisions. If you want to know how you can end up with higher interest rates, look no further than the Labor Party if they ever get into government.</DOC>

 - The promise I made at the last election - and I repeat it today - is that interest rates will always be lower under a coalition government than under a Labor government. That is supported by the experience of the last few years - indeed, I suspect of the last 25 to 30 years. Even after the latest increase - which, if flowed through by the banks, will take the housing loan rate to 8.3 per cent - interest rates for housing will still be a full 4½ per cent lower than the average of housing interest rates under the former Labor government. Moreover, the policies of the opposition which diverge from those of the government in relation to economic policy - namely, in the area of industrial relations - if implemented, will exert upward pressure on interest rates. The promise I made has been validated by the experience of the last 2½ years and is validated by a comparison of the policies of the government and the opposition.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Bass for that question. I am very pleased to inform the House that unemployment remains at 4.3 per cent, which represents the lowest unemployment rate this country has had for 33 years. An additional 21,800 jobs were created in July. All of those jobs were full time and half of those jobs were created in Victoria, which gives the lie to the argument advanced by the opposition that all of the jobs growth in Australia over the last few years has been due to the mining boom in Western Australia and in Queensland.I am happy to tell those who sit opposite that 387,500 jobs have been created since the new industrial relations laws were introduced in March last year. I say that again: 387,500 jobs have been created since the new industrial relations laws were introduced, despite the warnings of the former opposition leader, echoed no doubt by the current opposition leader and by leading union officials, that, so far from creating new jobs, the new industrial relations laws would in fact destroy jobs.I am also happy to note that 84 per cent of the jobs created since the industrial relations changes have been full-time jobs. One of the features of the new industrial relations laws is that they have encouraged the provision of full-time as distinct from part-time jobs and that is very welcome and very pleasing to the workforce in Australia today. What today's labour force figures tell us is that there has been no change in the underlying strength in the Australian labour market. Unemployment remains at a remarkably low level and the participation rate remains at a record high.Looking below the headline figures, there are some interesting further statistics which paint a picture of a wonderful social and human dividend from the good economic policies of the last 10 years. Between 1997 and 2006, the proportion of single parents in the labour force has increased from 52 to 62 per cent, an increase of 10 per cent over the last 10 years. The proportion of lone mothers in the labour force rose over the same period from 49 to 60 per cent and, very significantly, the number of dependent children aged 15 or less in families where no parent is employed has fallen by 117,200 or 17½ per cent since June 1996. I would have thought that that particular figure is a wonderful validation of the value of a sustained fall in unemployment in Australia.Since the introduction of the Welfare to Work reforms, the number of all welfare recipients has fallen by 100,000, a reduction of 3.9 per cent. Welfare to Work has been a great success. It is a reform that was bitterly opposed by the Labor Party when we introduced it. We were told that we were heartless, we were told that we were indifferent and we were told that we were contemptuous towards people who, after their children had reached a certain age, were being asked to return to the workforce.The evidence has been to the contrary. Welfare to Work has been a great success. And now, of course, we hear not a word of criticism offered about Welfare to Work from the man who sits opposite me, the Leader of the Opposition. Having scathingly attacked Welfare to Work, he now of course faithfully says that he agrees with me on Welfare to Work. He is practising 'echonomics' on this, as he is on so many other issues.The member for Bass asked me whether there was any threat to the very low level of unemployment in Australia at the present time. I would have thought the biggest threat to the low level of unemployment in Australia would be the abandonment of the workplace relations reforms of this government. If we go back on workplace relations, if we turn back the clock, if we retreat on a major economic reform, that will not only have a negative effect on the economy overall but specifically, if we bring back the unfair dismissal laws, small business in Australia once again will be frightened to take on new staff.One of the spectacular features of the labour market at the moment is that there has been over the last year a fall of about 26 per cent in the level of the full-time unemployed in this country. They are people who have been out of work for more than a year. It should be a matter of jubilation for everybody in this parliament that that figure has fallen by 26 per cent over the last year. We should all be saying, 'What a wonderful thing for the unemployed of this country.' Why has that happened? I think one of the reasons it has happened is that, faced no longer with the threat of the old unfair dismissal laws, many small businesses in this country have taken on more staff. They have taken a risk. They have taken on more staff knowing that if, unfortunately in some cases, it does not work out somebody can be allowed to go, without the small business operator facing the prospect of paying $30,000 or $40,000 of 'go away' money and eating into the meagre profits that some of them make. I think it would be a tragedy for long-term unemployment in this country if we bring back those old unfair dismissal laws. And the only party that is promising to do that is the Australian Labor Party.</DOC>

 - I saw the member's remark earlier today because somebody mentioned it to me. If you look at the context of it, the member for Macquarie has been misrepresented by the Leader of the Opposition. I ask the Leader of the Opposition to have a look at everything I said in the last election campaign; it will enlighten him a great deal. What I said in the last election campaign, what the Treasurer said - and it is absolutely the truth - is that interest rates under a coalition government will always be lower than they are under a Labor government. I would have thought that the Leader of the Opposition understood - The promise that we would keep interest rates at record lows still stands. - I would have thought the Leader of the Opposition understood that if you subtracted 8.3 from 12.75 you would be left with in excess of 4½. That is the difference between what interest rates will be for housing in Australia after the latest increase by the Reserve Bank and what they averaged under the former Labor government. I would have thought the Leader of the Opposition understood that if you take 8.3 and you double it you get 16.6, which is still 0.4 below 17 per cent, which was the level that housing interest rates hit when the Labor Party was last in office. So when I say now, when I said three years ago and when I will say over the weeks and months ahead that interest rates will always be lower under the coalition than they are under Labor, I speak the truth. Not only is it verified by the experience of the last Labor government compared with ours; if you look at the policies of the Labor Party for this coming election, particularly its industrial relations policy, according to independent economic experts the industrial relations policies of the Labor Party will exert upward pressure on interest rates. So not only do we have history but we also have current policy to validate my claim and my argument that interest rates will always be lower under the coalition than under the Labor Party.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Stirling for his question. I can inform the House that the labour force in the month of July just passed showed that an additional 21,800 Australians were able to find a job. And they were, nearly totally, full-time jobs. This means that although we have a record number of people that want to participate in the labour market - a participation rate of 65 per cent - we still have an unemployment rate which is the lowest in 33 years. That rate is 4.3 per cent. Over the last year there have been a quarter of a million new jobs created in Australia. That is net new jobs: after you allow for those people that have lost work, the number of people in net terms who have gained work in Australia over the last year has been 250,000. A quarter of a million Australians have come into the workforce, and many of those have come off welfare. People who otherwise would have gone onto a disability pension, people who otherwise would have been on a single parent pension - these people are now joining the labour force, they are now looking for work, and the good news is they are now finding it.Managing the economy at a time when unemployment is at 4.3 per cent brings a whole range of new challenges. One of the challenges, of course, is that in some areas of the country we now have a labour shortage - that is, we have more jobs than there are people to fill them. As you might imagine, that puts pressure on wages and on inflation. Therefore, it takes a great deal more care to manage inflation when you are at very low levels of unemployment. It would not be possible to manage the inflationary pressures if we were operating under an award system of industrial relations or a pattern bargaining system of industrial relations, because what would happen is that you would get wage settlements taken from profitable areas of the economy and applied across the board - general wages increases and general inflation.I said earlier that an unemployment rate of 4.3 per cent puts pressure on inflation. At the moment, on an unemployment rate of 4.3 per cent, the Reserve Bank's official cash rate is 6½ per cent. That 6½ per cent is still lower than the cash rate was when unemployment was nearly double what it is today, and that is a fair comparison. When we were back in 1996 and the unemployment rate was at 8.3 per cent, we were not getting pressure from full employment or labour shortage. In fact, we had a big margin of unemployed labour which was acting to keep a brake on wages, and yet, even though the unemployment rate was nearly double what it is today, the cash rate was higher. If you want to go back to the early 1990s when unemployment was around 10 per cent, the mortgage rates were still higher than they are today, and that is a fair comparison, because you are comparing a monetary policy in the context of capacity in the economy. So, when you actually view interest rates and compare them to the context of employment, the fact that unemployment is so low and yet the interest rate is lower than at periods when there was much higher unemployment shows you how far we have come in the Australian economy. And we have come a long way. It could not have been done if we had not reformed the budget, got rid of debt, improved the tax system and improved the waterfront. If we had not had Welfare to Work and all those measures it could not have been done. These are the policies that have put people back in work, and putting people back in work is the object of economic policy - to give young Australians a start in life and to give families security in employment. This is the goal of economic policy, and we must continue to keep unemployment low in this country.</DOC>

 - I suppose, on occasions, I agree with the member for Lilley. I agree with the member for Lilley when he agrees with me in relation to my action over Queensland. The member for Lilley is a great follower. He belongs to the school of 'echonomics', which, it seems to me, will rival the Chicago School soon. We have the Chicago School of Economics, we have monetarism, we have Keynesianism and we now have 'echonomics' coming from those who sit opposite. There is something that the member for Lilley said this morning that I certainly did not agree with. He said that, if Labor had won the election, there would not have been any interest rate rises. Can you imagine that? What a fool I have been. All I have to do to stop interest rates ever going up in this country is to sign a piece of cardboard paper, which is what Mark Latham did in the last election campaign. But there he is, there is the member for Lilley, the shadow Treasurer -  -  - They are getting very carried away with themselves at the moment. Hubris has taken over the frontbench of the Labor Party. I would have thought that he would have drawn the line somewhere. But basically what the member for Lilley is suggesting is that, if Mark Latham had become Prime Minister, he would have been able to stop any increases in interest rates. Let me say that occasionally I do agree with the member for Lilley. Maybe we might barrack occasionally for the same football team or one or two things like that, but, I tell you what, to try to suggest to the Australian people that Mark Latham, if he had become Prime Minister of this country, would have put a permanent lid on interest rates is really stretching things a bit too far.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Boothby for his question. It is the government's view that, in a growing economy as we have now, it is important that the government deliver a surplus in its budget - that is, that the government keep its expenditure within its revenues and that it add to savings at the end of the day. This government has now delivered 10 surplus budgets and cleared Australia of the Labor Party debt - the $96 billion Labor Party debt - which was in place in 1996.The would-be Liberals on the other side, the Leader of the Opposition and his shadow Treasurer, say that their policy is a mirror image of the government's. This was the claim by the Leader of the Opposition yesterday: 'There isn't a sliver of light between him and the government when it comes to fiscal policy.' Leave aside the fact that he voted against every measure that was required to balance the budget, leave aside the fact that he was against paying off government debt, leave aside the fact that he voted against tax reform and leave aside the fact that he is opposed to industrialisation and modernisation, he says there is not a sliver of light between his economic policy and the government's economic policy.Let me show where a massive gap - not a sliver of light, but a massive gap - opens up between the Liberal government and the Labor Party. I said earlier that the Liberal government believes in surplus budgeting and paying off debt. Between 1996 and 2005, the state governments were also paying off debt. The Commonwealth reduced its debt from $96 billion to zero, and the states reduced their debt from $48 billion to $10 billion. So there was a net reduction in debt of $96 billion at the Commonwealth level and $38 billion at the state level.Between 2006 and 2010, we will continue to reduce debt, this time by building savings up, with another $60 billion - so $96 billion and a $60 billion asset position. The states mirrored us for those first 10 years. They reduced by $38 billion. Now, what are the states going to do over the next five years? Will they keep their debt reduction going? No, because the states - now all controlled by Labor, as they were not back in 1996 - instead of continuing to reduce debt as they did for 10 years between 1996 and 2006, will build their net debt from $10 billion to $80 billion between now and 2010.What we had was the states following the Commonwealth with debt reduction of $38 billion, but instead of continuing to follow the Commonwealth, the states are now building $70 billion of debt between now and 2010-11. When you add together the two levels of government - the Commonwealth and the states - whilst the Commonwealth over the next five years will be building savings of $60 billion, the states will be borrowing savings of $70 billion. They will completely net out the surplus budgeting of the Commonwealth over the next five years, so that between the two levels of government in fact there will not be surplus budgeting - there will not be government putting savings back into the economy. Between the two levels of government, they will be completely netting out.I see the Leader of the Opposition is now trying to get an instruction from the member for Melbourne as to how this situation could possibly have occurred. It occurred because, between 2005-06 and 2007-08, the states decided to start going into deficit budgeting and they decided to go into borrowing. Let me say this to the Labor Party: if there is not a sliver of light between us and the Labor Party on fiscal policy, the Leader of the Opposition will have no hesitation in condemning this move by the states into deficit and will have no hesitation in demanding that the state governments do not counteract federal fiscal policy. If there is not a sliver of light, if his fiscal policy is the mirror image, if we stand identically, he will have no trouble at all demanding that the Labor level of government do precisely what the coalition is doing - that is, get their budgets back into surplus, stop borrowing, and add in to savings.The fact that they are borrowing at a time when the economy is strong means they are going procyclical at the wrong time. If they had wanted to do this, the time to go procyclical would have been in 1999-2000. The time not to go procyclical is in 2007-08. We await the new economic conservative, the Leader of the Opposition, who claims to support coalition policy. We await him walking to the dispatch box to say unequivocally that he condemns the Labor state level of government, that he demands surpluses and that he does not want federal fiscal policy to be countervailed by the Labor states.</DOC>

 - I have not seen that report, but I can assure you that the member for Lilley is wrong in saying that the member for Wentworth is out of touch. I have found the member for Wentworth, in matters relating not only to economics but also to his own portfolio area, to be very, very much in touch. I think he knows a bit more about economics than you do.Leave granted. - The member for Wentworth has had some experience in putting into practice his economic beliefs. He has some acquaintance with the business community and he demonstrates a better understanding of economics than anybody who sits over there. The truth is that those who sit opposite do not have an economic plan of their own for Australia's future. Those who sit opposite are desperately trying to agree with the government and practising what I call 'echo-nomics'. The member for Lilley reminds me a bit of my childhood. My parents used to take me to a place called Katoomba in the Blue Mountains in New South Wales. The first spot we went to was Echo Point. You would stand there at Echo Point and look out to Mount Solitary and when you called something out the echo would come back. I am reminded a bit about that in the parliament these days. You stand up here and you say 'budget surplus' and 'budget surplus' comes back. You say 'rigorous monetary policy' and 'rigorous monetary policy' comes back. - Can I say in relation to working families that there has not been an echo because when Labor was in office there were fewer working families than there are now. The echo did not work. Let me say again - and it is a very, very serious point to make in this place - that the man who sits opposite me does not have a plan of his own for Australia's economic future. He either mouths a platitudinous agreement with things that we have done and practices what I call 'echo-nomics' or, alternatively, when he cannot do that and he is told what he has to do by the trade union movement, he advocates policies that are dangerous to Australia's future. This country wants as its leader somebody who has got some plans of his own - not plans that are an expeditious echo of those of others or the dictatorial requirements of an out of touch trade union movement.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Fairfax for his question. I have been quite amazed at developments in Queensland today where the Queensland Labor government, led by Mr Beattie, has taken the extraordinary step of proposing legislative amendments to enable them to sack any local council that seeks to hold a plebiscite to provide Queenslanders with a democratic say in the proposed amalgamations. We will come to them in a minute. What Mr Beattie said today is this - and I ask everybody on both sides of the House to listen:_ we will amend the Bill today to provide for the immediate dismissal of any council which goes ahead with plans for a poll or referendum or plebiscite.This is a slap in the face for every Queenslander. It is the act of a Labor government that is drunk with power. It is the act of a man who in his hubris boasted in the Queensland parliament the other day that he could govern for 100 years. And it is an example of what this whole country would become if you had state Labor governments everywhere untrammelled by the check and the balance of a coalition government at the federal level.He is proposing to fine the councillors. He now wants to sack them. I suppose the next step will be to put them in the slammer, because that is essentially the attitude of the Queensland government in relation to this matter. We are not arguing that all the amalgamations are wrong; we are not arguing that all of them are right. We are arguing to give the people of Queensland the right to vote to express their view, which is a fundamental right of any citizen when you are talking about dismantling a structure of government. So, Mr Speaker, our offer stands: we will finance the holding of plebiscites in local government areas so that Queenslanders can express their views on these proposals.Once again we have seen Mount Solitary at work. I stand up here and say, 'Let us have a referendum to let the people of Queensland decide whether they like the amalgamations,' and back it comes: 'Yes, let's have a referendum to let the people of Queensland decide.' But everybody in this parliament knows that if the Leader of the Opposition were now the Prime Minister he would not have proposed the referenda. Everybody knows that, just as he would not have proposed those referenda, if he had been Prime Minister on 21 June this year he would not have proposed the intervention in the Northern Territory because it was totally against everything that the Labor Party had said and done in relation to Indigenous policies. The only reason that the Leader of the Opposition has faithfully echoed, in a very rapid-fire fashion, what I have said is that he has become a follower rather than a leader on these sorts of issues. He knows how monstrously unpopular the tactics of the Queensland government are in relation to local government amalgamations.Every man and his dog, including Rusty, knows that Peter Beattie is going to retire in September or October this year and his retirement gift to the people of Queensland is to put the jackboot into the democratically elected people of various local government bodies. Let me say to the people of Queensland that, if you were facing a federal Labor government as well as a state Labor government, you would not be getting any help from that federal Labor government. It is only the check and the balance provided by a coalition government at a federal level that is giving to the people of Queensland the opportunity to express their disdain for the violently undemocratic way in which their Premier has behaved.</DOC>

 - What I have repeatedly said is that I recognise that not every Australian family has enjoyed to the full the bounty of the last few years. I recognise that. I have never argued that every single family is equally as well off as they may have been. But having said that and acknowledged that, I do argue that generically, looking at unemployment levels, you cannot have any wealth if you do not have a job. If you do not have a job you cannot afford to buy a house, you have difficulty paying your rent and you have difficulty looking after your family.I read out some statistics at the beginning of question time that illustrated just how much this fall in unemployment had reduced social deprivation in Australia. There are 117,000 fewer children in households with either parent unemployed. That is a massive improvement. It is a 17½ per cent reduction. OECD research has shown that there is no country in the developed world that has done better than Australia in providing for the less well off in the Australian community. One of the great lies of the Labor Party against the government is that we do not care about the underprivileged. The best way to care about the underprivileged in this country is to give them a job. If you use that as a measure you will have to acknowledge that this government has done everything it humanly could to help the underprivileged.You asked me about the Urban Development Institute. I have read that report, and I have had a look at the housing affordability comparisons. I can confirm a large number of them. I will have to check whether the one used by the member is correct. I will give her the benefit of the doubt and say it is. I do not want to accuse her of deliberately distorting the figure in the document but I can confirm that the Urban Development Institute in that same report - and I am sure the member has read this as well - says that there were a number of factors affecting home affordability. The three factors given particular attention in the report -  - We do not like this, do we? No, we do not like this! This is the cherry picker exposed. They do not really like that. These are the three things: firstly, supply issues; secondly, delays in approval processes; and thirdly, state and local government costs and charges. I can also confirm that the report gets even better, my friends. It says:It is acknowledged that the vast majority of steps that need to be taken (and in some jurisdictions are being taken) are at local government and state government level.I think if the member for Sydney were - shall I put it this way? - objective enough in relation to these matters she might have prefaced her question by acknowledging those facts from that very same report.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Bonner for his question. As the member for Bonner would well recognise there has been an enormous amount of communication and correspondence with members in Queensland, particularly the member for Bonner, from many constituents in Queensland who are extremely concerned at the way the Beattie Labor government is trampling on their democratic rights in Queensland - from voters and constituents in the community through to people involved in local councils and the Queensland Local Government Association.I think all Australians would have a great deal of sympathy, today, with Queenslanders when they see how the democratic processes in Queensland have been trampled on. No Australian would condone the value that has been destroyed in the political freedoms and democracy in Queensland, where the Queensland Labor government is forcing amalgamations on local government authorities across Queensland. We watched Premier Beattie arrogantly mouthing off his government's position on television last night and this morning. He is acting like an emperor in the Ming dynasty, where there is only one person that counts, and that is him. He is going to lord it over every single individual Queenslander.Of course, we have not heard boo from the leader of the Labor Party here in Canberra, who has a bit of form on this issue. Actually, he is like a mandarin in the imperial court kowtowing to Premier Beattie in Queensland. We all remember that when the current Leader of the Opposition was a senior bureaucrat in the Goss Labor government in Queensland they did exactly the same thing. There were amalgamations with no consultation with the people that were being affected. There was no consultation at all and no referendum. That happened back then, and he has form now. But now he is trying to echo the concern that the coalition government is expressing, by giving the people of Queensland the opportunity to have a say through a plebiscite or referendum conducted by the Australian Electoral Commission.That is a bit of a telling line about the attitude of the Australian Labor Party. At the end of the day, all they are doing is kowtowing to the union movement in Queensland. It is outrageous that, in the democracy that we have in Australia, the Premier of Queensland has today introduced legislation that will give him the power to instantly dismiss any council major or councillor who seeks the views of the people they represent. What a horrible thought - to seek the views from the people! They will sack anyone who dares to exercise that political freedom of speech. That is Stalinism, Queensland Labor style, in 2007. It is just outrageous and should be condemned by every Australian. Labor are effectively making political prisoners out of every mayor and every councillor in Queensland by threatening to charge them and to put them in jail if they dare seek the views of the people they represent.So what is driving this? Where the councils are being amalgamated forcibly by the Queensland Labor government, they are being driven by the union bosses of the Labor Party in Queensland. If you drill down into this, you see that when this legislation goes through there will be transition committees established in every local government area across Queensland to manage the transition to the new authorities and mandated to be on those committees are three union delegates in every local government area. In every local government area, there will be three union delegates on those committees. There will not be three representatives from the Chamber of Commerce, the CWA, the National Farmers Federation or AgForce in Queensland, but it is mandated that there will be three union delegates on every committee. Premier Beattie not only wants to exercise these jackboot tactics over councils across Queensland but also wants to put unions into these committees.The unions will decide who the CEOs of the new councils will be. The unions will decide who runs the Labor Party in the local area. The unions will decide who runs the Labor Party in Brisbane. The unions will decide who will be the Premier in Queensland. The unions decide who will lead the Labor Party down here and who sits on the frontbench down here. All Australians need to understand very clearly that not only can the Labor Party not be trusted to manage money but also you can guarantee that the Labor Party will be the patsies of the union movement. The unions control the government in Queensland and, if there were ever a Labor government elected here in Canberra, the unions would control them.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for New England for his question. I think his question could properly have been put to the Minister for Health and Ageing, because it is a question about dental health. I would refer him to the budget announcements about dental health, which were generous and important and linked the Commonwealth government's role with respect to dental health for older Australians - with a commitment of, I think, over $380 million specifically for dental health - to chronic illnesses associated with dental health. The Commonwealth government has, through the PBS, the Medicare benefits schedule and through this particular commitment and program in the budget announced this year, specifically catered for senior Australians.That is just one of the areas in which the Commonwealth government, led by John Howard, have put seniors front in centre in our policy. I am very proud to be the Minister for Ageing, following on from a number of ministers over the last 11 years who have increased the spending on aged care from $3.1 billion in 1996 to $10.1 billion by 2010; increased support for respite for carers of older Australians from a measly $18 million in 1996 to $184 million this year - and an extra $41 million was announced in this year's budget for respite; increased the number of community aged-care packages from 4,500 in 1996 to over 45,000 in the present day; and increased the places per 1,000 people aged 70 and over from a measly 93 in 1996 to 108 today.</DOC>

 - I am delighted to follow the Minister for Ageing and inform the House of more good news from the Howard government. I want to thank the member for Braddon for his question, and I want to again congratulate him on his ceaseless advocacy for the people of north-west Tasmania. Let me make it very clear that the only government with a proper plan for health services in north-west Tasmania is the federal government. The Tasmanian government has a big, fat pile of paper but it is not a plan, because there are no dollars associated with it. Without dollars involved, it is nothing but a wish list.The Commonwealth's plan has three essential elements. The Commonwealth will fund the hospital to the tune of $45 million a year, the community will control the hospital, and the hospital will deliver the same range of services that were safely and effectively delivered at the Mersey hospital for many years before the Tasmanian Labor government began the downgrade. This is a good model for public hospitals. It ends the blame game, because just one level of government pays the bills, and it cuts the bureaucracy, because management decisions are made locally and not at head office. The federal government is offering to permanently relieve the state government of responsibility for Mersey hospital. This gives the state government up to $45 million a year extra to spend on health services at Burnie and Launceston hospitals. Woe betide any state government that wilfully refuses a $45 million a year free gift to north-west Tasmania out of sheer bloody-mindedness and hurt pride.We have bizarre behaviour from the state government. What about the Leader of the Opposition? Yesterday the Treasurer said that the Leader of the Opposition was desperately trying to be a Liberal. With respect, no Liberal would be such a fake. Yesterday at a press conference he denounced the Mersey decision as absolutely rotten and then he said he would not oppose it. This is how the journalist Matt Price described the Leader of the Opposition's me too'ism. He said:Rudd agreed it was too early not to agree with Howard on the Mersey, so he agreed instead to agree with the intervention until it was agreed he might agree to disagree.This is the kind of verbal sludge that we constantly get from the Leader of the Opposition. Let me say this: if he is not willing to lead, he is not ready to govern, and the last thing the Australian people want is a phoney in the Lodge.</DOC>

 - The shadow minister complains that there had not been consultations with clinical staff at Burnie Hospital. I will tell the shadow minister why there have been no consultations with clinicians at Burnie Hospital. It is because the state government will not allow it. The Tasmanian state government has threatened clinicians with the loss of their jobs if they engage -  - It gets crazier and crazier from the member for Gellibrand. On the one hand she says that there were no consultations and the next minute she says, 'I met with them.' Come on, Mr Speaker. She has got to -  -  - First of all, she says that there have been no consultations. I point out that consultations have been prohibited by the state government. - And then she says, 'I have actually met with this guy.' She cannot have it both ways. - I say to the Leader of the Opposition, 'If you want the opposition to be taken seriously on health, put a serious person in as health shadow minister.'</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. No government in the world is doing more today to put forestry on top of the climate change agenda. One of the great omissions of the Kyoto protocol was forestry. As a consequence, we now have the bizarre situation that Professor Tom Lovejoy spoke about in Australia only a few days ago that the Kyoto protocol is actively encouraging deforestation in tropical developing countries, such as Indonesia, where incentives are offered to produce palm oil and to grow other biofuel crops but no disincentives to reduce deforestation. We now have commitments from leading nations in the developed world to establish a global network to monitor forests and forest cover and emissions. That will enable, for the first time, the vast and growing pools of money available to abate CO emissions to be connected to sustainable forestry around the world. The Australian government is in the lead there and is developing a new approach to ensure that the new global arrangement - the new Kyoto, if you like - will be effective.This government's approach to climate change is based on effective results and on doing the hard work required to ensure that we get the economics right. We do not apologise for spending time to build the framework necessary in what will be the world's most comprehensive emissions trading scheme to ensure that the economic implications, the implications for Australian families and businesses and the implications for Australia of the actions of other countries are fully understood. The government does not apologise for doing that work.The Chairman of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Dr Rajendra Pachauri, was in Australia this week. Interestingly, he complimented the government's approach. He said that informed debate based on rational thinking and rigorous analysis had to precede the rolling out of policies on climate change. Dr Pachauri said:Otherwise one might come up with a lot of emotional and political responses that may or may not be the best, and I think in a democracy it's important to see there is an informed debate in officialdom as well as in the public.One would also have to look at the macroeconomic effects - will that result in a decline in jobs and economic output?I am asked about alternative policies. The Labor Party's policy on greenhouse is to set a massive target of 60 per cent for emissions cuts by 2050 regardless of what any other country does and regardless of the cost. It is a policy that is as reckless as it will be environmentally ineffective. We need not just a cut in Australia but also a massive global emissions cut, and the Labor Party has nothing to offer on that. It is a consequence of its climate change policies not being driven by economics or environmental science but by hard-left ideology. One need refer only to the remarks of the member for Kingsford Smith reported in the Age a few years ago when he said that every step forward in economic growth is matched by environment degradation or perhaps when he spoke to Liz Hayes in 1989 - and this was the undiluted member for Kingsford Smith - and said:We've got to overthrow one very important furphy and that is that we can continue with economic growth - That is a furphy - continuing with economic growth. He went on to say:Both of the parties talk about economic growth, but what we now know globally and nationally is that continued economic growth will ultimately mean continued destruction.That is the genuine voice of the ideology that is informing Labor's climate change policy. It is antagonistic to growth and economic prosperity and it will deny the poor of the world the economic growth they deserve. You said -  - Do you still believe that? Come on! On your feet! Do you still believe that? - I invite the honourable member for Kingsford Smith to tell us whether he still believes that continued economic growth will ultimately mean continued destruction - yes or no.</DOC>

On the subject of the AMA, I quote in response Dr Roger Watts, who said that morale at the hospital had already improved since Prime Minister Howard announced last Wednesday his $45 million a year plan to underwrite the Mersey.

 - I would like to thank the member for Solomon for his question and his interest. He is a great supporter of the Australian Defence Force. I know that Defence Force personnel in Solomon appreciate very much the work he does for them. I explained in a speech last night the importance that Australia places on our relations with the Pacific and the energetic and activist approach we take in promoting improvement in a region which obviously has real problems with stability. When I got back to my office, I noticed that the Leader of the Opposition had also made a speech on strategic policy. That is a speech which deserves a little bit of scrutiny. I flicked through it early in the evening, and it interested me for a couple of reasons. First of all, I was reflecting on what happened when Labor were in government. During the last five years of the Hawke-Keating government, they reduced defence personnel by 10,000. They closed down two army battalions. They cut defence spending by about four per cent in the last two years of the Keating government.When we became the government, our Defence Force did not have the capability to do the outstanding work it does today, contributing to regional and international security. In the Leader of the Opposition's speech last night, I noticed that he would commit to the forward outlays - that is, a three per cent real increase per annum in defence expenditure up to 2016. He would commit to forward outlays of the present government.He said, very interestingly, that the 'US alliance sits squarely in the centre of our strategic vision'. When he was the opposition spokesman on foreign affairs and, indeed, before his time, when others were spokesmen on foreign affairs, the Labor Party - all the people sitting in this chamber to the left of the Speaker - argued that this government was too close to the United States. They always argued that we were too close to the Americans and now they say that the 'US alliance sits squarely in the centre of our strategic vision'. By the way, Mr Speaker, I think members on this side need to know that the Leader of the Opposition claims the American alliance was formed by John Curtin. Actually, the alliance was formally formed during the Menzies' years, but informally it was formed back in the First World War. I know that those on the other side of the House never mention Billy Hughes. He was a good man, Billy Hughes. He was a great Labor leader - the last decent Labor leader. It was Billy Hughes who formed the American alliance.Regardless of that, I make this point: the opposition leader has yet again said: 'I agree with the Prime Minister. I agree with John Howard.' The fact is that the opposition leader either agrees with John Howard or agrees with the trade union leadership. He has no ideas of his own. What is worse, if he became the Prime Minister, he would have no ideas of his own. He could, of course, still ring up the trade unions and ask them what to do. But what would he do when it came to economic policy? Ring up Peter Costello down in Melbourne and say: 'What should I do next? I don't know what to do.' Ring up John Howard and ask what to do about security policy -  - The Prime Minister would be John Howard then. The point is that he would ring him up and ask him what to do about good security policy or he would ring up the member for Wentworth and ask him what to do about environment policy. The fact is that, if the Leader of the Opposition wins the election, we will of course be gone and he will have no-one left to copy. He will be on his own, and the only people he will be able to go to will be the ACTU. It is a pathetic thing that the Leader of the Opposition in this country has no ideas or policies but instead just a series of stunts.We had the T-shirt competition this week, the Kevin07, cribbed almost literally from the Obama '08 website, as the Herald Sun pointed out, under the headline: 'Copycat Kevin takes his cue from the US'. At least there is somebody making policy for the Leader of the Opposition at the moment, and that is the government. God forbid that we would lose the election and he would have no-one to guide him.</DOC>

 - I do not know what comments of Mr Macfarlane the member is referring to. But let us put that aside and look at the facts. The last time the Labor Party was in office, housing interest rates averaged 12¾ per cent. The housing interest rate after the latest increase will be 8.3 per cent - that is a full 4½ per cent below. Housing interest rates hit 17 per cent. If you double 8.3 you get 16.6, which is still 0.4 below 17 per cent. So the facts speak for themselves.I imagine that the member for Melbourne has verballed Ian Macfarlane. They verbal just about everybody when they get up in this House. They even verbal some members of the government when they get up in the parliament and ask these questions. If the member for Melbourne wants to have a serious debate about which party has got a better interest rate record, all we say is: bring it on. Look at the last Labor government and compare it with this government. Look at the policies of the Labor Party on display at the moment in industrial relations, which will, according to Econtech, according to the ACCI, drive up inflation and thereby put upward pressure on interest rates.Labor would take away the industrial relations system we now have. You would have wages break-outs because sectors of the economy could not afford to pay wage increases demanded and received in the more prosperous areas of the economy. You would therefore end up with an extraordinary situation where there would be upward pressure on interest rates, and that would be to the detriment of the entire Australian community. If the member for Melbourne wants to continue to argue that interest rates would be lower under a Labor government than under a coalition government, he is fighting against all of the available evidence and he is about as misguided on the subject as the member for Lilley is.Leave granted.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for La Trobe for his question. I recognise he is a great local member, someone with real-life experience as a former senior policeman. It was this government that removed the burden of Labor's unfair dismissal laws on small business. The result of that is that, since we removed the unfair dismissal laws on small business, 387,000 new jobs have been created, 84 per cent of them full time. Why has this occurred? It is because now small business has the courage to go out and employ people with no employment history. That is why the number of people who are long-term unemployed has dropped to record low levels in Australia. That is why youth unemployment has dropped to low levels in Australia. The OECD found that restrictive and punitive laws, such as the unfair dismissal laws, act as a disincentive for employers to take on more staff and disadvantage those most disadvantaged. Of course, the Labor Party has a rather complicated policy in relation to the unfair dismissal laws. - The Deputy Leader of the Opposition interjects. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition was asked by David Spears on Sky News yesterday about the application of the unfair dismissal laws to Cassie Whitehill in Tasmania, and she did not understand her own laws. What a surprise! They want to abolish our laws, but they do not even understand their own. Of course, whether the laws are in or the laws are out, they do not apply to the Labor Party and they do not apply to the unions. That is why, when we heard about the case of Cassie Whitehill, who was sacked the day before Christmas by the President of the Australian Services Union in Tasmania - who also happens to be the President of the Labor Party in Tasmania - the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition did not lift a finger. But we hear today that Kevin Harkins has been sacked. A government member - Unfair dismissal! - We do not know if it is unfair dismissal, but what we do know is that on the following dates the Leader of the Opposition backed Kevin Harkins as the candidate for Franklin. He backed him on 22 and 24 June and on 19 and 20 July. On 23 July the Leader of the Opposition said this about Mr Harkins:Well, Mr Harkins is the candidate for the Australian Labor Party and I have seen nothing to date which would require me to cause any change in that position. As I said, the matters which we are dealing with here are civil matters. And we really need to start rocking and rolling.'We really need to start rocking and rolling' - I am not quite sure what that means; it is a Kevinism. On 24 July the Leader of the Opposition backed Harkins as well. So what changed? 
Government members - Harry! Harry! Harry! - Is it the scalp that sits on the belt of the member for Franklin? No. Was it only last week that I went down to Franklin and campaigned for Vanessa Goodwin and there were all these endorsements from the Leader of the Opposition of his candidate in Franklin? And yet yesterday we saw a report in the Mercury under the headline 'Jettison Harkins push'. It said:_ despite offers of an elevated union position, increased salary and a future Senate seat, Mr Harkins is determined not to quit voluntarily.This was yesterday. So what happened in the last 24 hours? These are the questions that the Leader of the Opposition has to answer. He has lost his candidate in Franklin and he has not explained to anyone why. Why has he lost his candidate in Franklin? That was a candidate that he has supported on numerous occasions. That was a candidate endorsed by the Labor Party. And yet, as soon as a report comes out of possible inducements, even perhaps bribery, in relation to the candidate in Franklin - that he has been bought off, that he might end up at a later time in the Senate as a representative for Tasmania from the Labor Party - all of a sudden Harkins resigns.There was no explanation from Sean Kelly, the President of the Labor Party in Tasmania, and no explanation from the Leader of the Opposition. Do you know why, Mr Speaker? Because the Leader of the Opposition is totally in the control of the union bosses - that is why. The Leader of the Opposition is not prepared to stand up for the people of Australia because he is being dictated to by union bosses, union thugs, and people that preach one message and do not adhere to it when it applies to them. The Leader of the Opposition has to answer some questions. These are serious allegations involving, perhaps, breaches of the Electoral Act. He cannot laugh it away. He cannot continue to be controlled by the union bosses and expect the people of Australia to back him.</DOC>

 - In reply to the greatest member the electorate of Hasluck has ever had, can I say that my attention has been drawn to a report released by Econtech last Friday - an examination by Econtech commissioned by the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry. What that report found was that if the Australian workplace were re-regulated there would be over 300,000 jobs lost and interest rates would rise by 1.4 per cent. This was carried out by an organisation described on 23 May 2007 by the shadow Assistant Treasurer as being an organisation run by a 'respected consultant'. In other words, it is somebody who is looking at these things from an objective point of view. What Econtech found was that Labor's policy would put upward pressure on interest rates and it would cost jobs. This is the opinion of an independent economist as well as being, of course, the opinion of the government and the opinion of many industry organisations.Right at the moment the Australian Industry Group is conducting its annual gathering here in Parliament House. That particular organisation is not contributing financially to the campaign of concern being waged by other business groups about the implications of rolling back workplace relations reform. But yesterday on Channel 10's Sunday program Heather Ridout, the executive director of the Australian Industry Group, said that if you went back to the bad old days of a union-run IR system it would cost jobs and put upward pressure on interest rates. She described Labor's policy as 'risky economics that would put upward pressure on inflation and interest rates'.We have the phenomenon where the Leader of the Opposition is pretending that his economic policy is the same as the government's. He said on Thursday that there was not a sliver of difference between the government and the opposition on fiscal policy. The Leader of the Opposition wants to have it both ways. He wants now to pretend that he is no different from me on economic policy yet, when I was leading a government that was building the economic prosperity we now have, the Leader of the Opposition and his mates in the Labor Party were doing their level best to stop us implementing our policies. Now that we have paid off that $96 billion of debt, now that we have got a healthy budget surplus, now that we have got a strong fiscal position, the Leader of the Opposition wants to be identified with it, almost as if it were his own. Yet the truth is that he tried to stop us bringing it about. What is more, if he ever got the opportunity he would be neither experienced enough nor strong enough to make certain that the good economic conditions this government has created would be preserved. He would do the bidding of the trade union movement and he would do the bidding of the six Labor premiers.The Leader of the Opposition cannot have it both ways. He cannot pretend that he is the same as me on economic policy when in the past he has tried to stop every step that we have taken in order to bring about today's strong economic conditions. A Labor government rolling back industrial relations would be a risk to the prosperity of the Australian economy, it would put upward pressure on inflation and, through that, interest rates and it would break the wonderful cycle of low unemployment that this country has now enjoyed for many years under this government.</DOC>

 - I think the Australian people can rely on the performance of this government in relation to interest rates, and we can rely on any comparison between the performance of this government on interest rates and the performance of the Labor government in the past. But, worse still, we can rely on the likelihood that if there were a Labor government elected at the end of this year the implementation of its roll-back of industrial relations would put upward pressure on inflation and thereby upward pressure on interest rates.As I was scanning through my newspaper this morning I did come across some expressions of public opinion, and the one expression of public opinion that really hit me in the face was the expression of public opinion that said only seven per cent of the Australian people thought that interest rates would be lower under a Labor government than under a coalition government. I think that particular survey is right on the money.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Stirling for his question. I have actually seen proposals to roll back industrial relations reform in this country. They of course are the proposals of the Australian Council of Trade Unions and their political creation, the Labor Party, which is led by the Leader of the Opposition. Australia has come a long way since the days of highly unionised, highly centralised industrial relations. But all of that is at risk at this next election, because it is the plan of the Leader of the Opposition to roll back all of the reforms that have been made and to take Australia backwards by decades. He was belled on this by none other than one of his own heroes, former Labor Prime Minister Paul Keating, who, on 7 June, on Lateline, described Labor's industrial relations roll-back as:... something that will take them further back than legislation I put in place in '93.So this throwback, this roll-back, of the Labor Party is not just to pre Work Choices. It is not just to pre the 1996 election. It is going back to before 1993 in its attempt to appease the trade union movement. I said in the parliament last week that the Leader of the Opposition's dearest wish is to be a Liberal. But he can never be that, because he is a pawn in the hands of the ACTU. He might be able to talk the talk, but he will never walk the walk, because he is beholden to the political apparatus of the trade union movement.Econtech, the modelling agency, has now done a model on what Labor policy means. This is not mine; this is not the Treasury's; this is from Econtech, a consultancy which the Labor Party itself likes to quote. Listen to what Econtech says Labor policy will do. In three years it will reduce GDP by 4.8 per cent. This will be the equivalent of losing $2,700 per person in Australia. In three years employment will drop 2.9 per cent and we will lose 316,000 jobs in this country. In three years the CPI will rise to five per cent. Of course, as a consequence of that interest rates will rise. They will rise to double figures. There will be pre-1993 IR and pre-1993 interest rates. We will be back into double figures for home mortgage variable interest rates. In real terms average wages will be lower by $787 a year after three years. And, of course, real wages would begin to decline as inflation broke out.This was the story of the last time Labor were in government. Those of us who were here remember there was no prouder boast from Mr Keating as he walked to this dispatch box than to say he had managed to depress real wages in this country. It was a boast that the Labor Party had. That is what they are looking like doing again: depressing real wages, increasing the CPI, increasing interest rates, declining the GDP and lowering real wages. Why would you do that? Why would any political party want to do that? I will tell you why: because at their heart the Labor Party are owned, operated and controlled by the trade union movement. They are here to do the bidding of the trade union movement. Every single Labor member is a member of a trade union. Every single one of the members of parliament sitting opposite is a trade union member put here, paid and supported by the trade unions to do their bidding. Australians do not want lower real wages, lower GDP, higher inflation and higher interest rates, and they do not want Labor's industrial relations policy.</DOC>

 - Let me say that this government has put in place measures which have improved benefits for families. Just to give you some idea of the improvements that have been put in place, I think the family tax benefit today is about double what it was in 1996. The family tax benefit has delivered real improvements to families in our society. And, of course, not only has the family tax benefit increased but we have a $600 annual payment of family tax benefit - Government members - Real money! - which is real money and goes into people's bank accounts and helps them with their bills. The honourable member for Sydney, if she had had her way, would have abolished that payment. That was Labor's policy at the last election. There is no point shaking your head, Member for Sydney; it was your policy at the last election and if you had been elected Labor would have taken that payment away. In fact, if Labor had had their way, after the last election they would have actually increased tax for single-income families and made them worse off.So one thing I can say is this: not only has the family tax benefit been of great assistance to families and helped them with their bills but, if it had been left to Labor, families would be worse off today. The other thing I can say is this: nothing helps families like getting a member of a family in a job. If a family does not have a job then a family does not have a stake in the real economy. I think, when you look back and you see that over 200,000 new jobs have been created in the last year, when you look at the fact that real wages have increased by about 20 per cent, you would say to yourself, 'This has given hundreds of thousands if not millions of people in families in Australia the opportunity to improve their position.' That is what the coalition has been about: improving benefits to families and giving families a stake in this great country.</DOC>

 - I say to the member for Wakefield, who represents very effectively in this House thousands of working families in the electorate of Wakefield, that his concern for working families has been very strong and evident in the more than 2½ years that he has been a member of this parliament. I notice in every speech that is made by the Leader of the Opposition and every speech that is made by a prominent member of the Labor Party that there is a professed concern for working families. I therefore want to take the concern of the Leader of the Opposition at face value and remind him that his concern for working families has been well listened to by this government and that over the last 11½ years the number of families in work has dramatically increased. We now have the lowest unemployment rate in Australia for 33 years.In the 12 months to June this year, the long-term unemployment rate in Australia - that is the number of people out of work for more than one year - fell by no less than 29 per cent. Not only is the level of long-term unemployment at its lowest since the statistic began to be kept but there cannot be any period of a year since that statistic was separately kept when the long-term unemployment rate would have fallen by such a sharp figure.There can be only one explanation for that. The explanation is that the government's new workplace relations system, which the Labor Party, directed to do so by the union movement, will dismantle if it wins the next election, has made it easier for small business to take on more staff. There can be no other explanation because, while over the last number of years there has been a steady decline in the number of long-term unemployed, for it to fall by no less than 29 per cent in the space of a year must at the very least owe an enormous amount to our industrial relations policy and owe an enormous amount to the removal of the unfair dismissal laws which Labor is pledged to bring back.In answering questions asked by the Leader of the Opposition earlier, I made the observation that, even after the most recent interest rate rise, interest rates on housing loans in Australia, at 8.3 per cent, will be a full 4½ per cent lower than the average during the 13 years of the previous government. On an average mortgage of $235,000, a home owner would have paid on average $1,416 a month in mortgage payments under the current government, compared to $2,497 a month if the average rate under the former government still applied. That is a difference of $1,081. Real wages of Australian workers have risen by 20.8 per cent over the last 11 years and only the top 40 per cent of Australian households pay net income tax when you take into account the impact of family tax benefits. Finally, research by the OECD shows Australia has one of the fairest and most redistributive tax and income support systems in the OECD.All of those things give the lie to the warnings that were given more than a decade ago that a coalition government led by me would dismantle the social security safety net. The member for Wakefield asked me what the alternatives are. The real alternative to this general level of prosperity for working families - although, I acknowledge, not all of them are sharing to the full the bounty of current prosperity - the biggest single threat is rolling back our industrial relations reforms. Rolling back those reforms will, in the opinion of Econtech, cost us 300,000 jobs, increase interest rates by 1.4 per cent and reintroduce the unwanted thuggery of union bosses into many workplaces. But, worse than all of that, they will send a signal to the Australian community and the rest of the world that this country has lost the stomach for long-term reform.

 - As I said in answer to the last question, families' positions have improved significantly through the improvement of the family tax benefit system, job opportunities and real wages. I do not think that can be disputed. I do not think it can be disputed that families today, through the introduction of family tax benefit parts A and B, are better off than they were in 1996. I do not think this can be disputed either - that if Labor had won the last election they would be worse off today than they are now. I do love getting questions from the member for Lilley because it was the member for Lilley who thought up the idea of docking every family $600 a year in family tax benefit. When the member for Werriwa went to him and asked, 'How do we explain docking families $600 of their family tax benefit?' the member for Lilley advised him, 'Tell 'em it's not real; tell 'em it ain't so, Joe. That $600 that goes into their bank accounts just does not exist.' Coming, as he does, from the background of state secretary of the ALP in Queensland where he specialised in dirty tricks as part of his campaign armoury -  - The nine words I like are, 'Wayne Swan had money in brown paper bags.' Were they the nine words? I do not have any trouble saying them, Mr Speaker. In fact, I think there ought to be an investigation. - Eight words - 'Mr Wayne Swan had money in brown paper bags.' - He said it was only eight, Mr Speaker. Here is an interesting question. If you are the brother of the Leader of the Opposition you get expelled from the Labor Party for giving money to the Liberal Party. What if you happen to be a state secretary who gave money to the Australian Democrats? - The attempt at the last election by the member for Lilley to pretend that $600 that is paid to every family per annum per child - and now of course it has been indexed, so if you add three children it will be $1,800 plus indexation - did not exist was up there with one of the great howlers of Australian politics. It comes from a long line of machine politics in which he was schooled in the state of Queensland, and Australian families would be far worse off if the Australian Labor Party ever found its way into office.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Bass for his question. I can inform him that a single-income family with children is eligible for the maximum rate of family tax benefit where they have an income less than $41,318. That means that a family with two children and an annual income under $41,000 is eligible for a family tax benefit part A payment of $290 per fortnight. That is $145 a child. They are entitled to a family tax benefit part B payment of $212 a fortnight. That makes their family assistance under those two benefits around $500 a fortnight. In addition, that family is entitled to rent assistance of up to $122 a fortnight. Because the government was re-elected, they are still eligible for the family tax benefit, a supplement, the $600 payment, which entitles families to $667 per child: an FTB A payment of $290 per fortnight, an FTB B payment of $212 a fortnight, rental assistance of $122 a fortnight - a family supplement of $667.95 per child.Since 1996-97, the real disposable income of a single-income family on average weekly ordinary time earnings has risen 34 per cent. Let me say that again: the real disposable income - that is, after CPI, after tax - of a single income family on average weekly ordinary time earnings, with two children, has risen by 34.6 per cent. That is real money into their bank accounts from which they can pay their bills. In fact, a single income family with two children has to earn more than $50,000 a year to pay net tax - that is, the amount that they are repaid in family tax benefits outweighs their tax liability so that a family on $50,000 with two children does not pay tax in net terms.For a single income family with two children, the rent assistance - which was $86 back in 1996 - is now $122 per fortnight, which is about a 50 per cent increase. This government believe in improving benefits for families, effectively cutting them out of the tax system, increasing rent allowances and delivering better family tax benefits. The maximum family tax benefit today is $4,460 per annum - an increase from $2,420 back in 1996. The government have been about directly assisting families through the family tax benefit system. We have done that by recognising the additional costs that come from rearing children. It has improved the position of families as a result, and, of course, economic reforms have given those families the best opportunity in 33 years for a member of the family to get into the workforce and to benefit from that. These are improvements for families - all would be put at risk by a Labor government.</DOC>

 - This gives me the opportunity to talk further about the benefits which this government has delivered to families. Of course, before this government was elected there was no family tax benefit part B; that was introduced by this government. - I am talking about the way in which this government has improved the position of families. -  - It gives me an opportunity to talk about the way in which families have been assisted by the government's family tax benefits improvements over the last 10 years. The family tax benefit part B was introduced by this government. There was no family tax benefit part B before this government introduced it. That benefit goes to families who have only one income earner. In addition to that, the government increased from $2,420 to $4,460 the maximum family tax benefit part A per child. - The member for Grayndler may not know this: that is an increase per child. In addition to that, of course, the government introduced the annual supplement, which the Labor Party attempted to abolish. In addition to that, the government increased rent assistance and -  - in addition to that, there is a better opportunity today than in the last 33 years for families -  - to get into the workforce and to take the opportunity to actually get a job. All of that means that the position of families today is significantly better than it was 10 years ago. It means that the Liberal Party has put families first -  - The member for Swan then left the chamber. - All of that means that the position of families has improved very considerably over the last 10 years. It means that families are in a stronger position than they were in 1996. And it means that all of that is at risk if the Labor Party is elected, because the Labor Party stands for lower wages, taking back family tax benefit and less economic opportunity for Australian families.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Bonner for his question. Of course, the member for Bonner would recognise that, during the life of the coalition government, we have increased the number of programs that actually deliver very meaningfully to local communities through local government. We recognise that local government in Australia is the closest level of democratically elected government to the people and deals with people's issues from day to day, with programs like Roads to Recovery and Regional Partnerships. I am sure that the member for Bonner, in representing his constituency, has ensured that there have been applications for those programs by the local authorities in his area.Another we have introduced that the Labor Party never thought of when they were in government is the Rural Medical Infrastructure Fund. I mention this because we recently announced a grant of $360,000 for the Aramac Shire to develop a new medical precinct delivering vital health services in that small town in western Queensland. I am sure the member for Maranoa is well aware of this project in the Aramac Shire. I give that example because, if the Queensland Beattie Labor government gets its way, this will not happen anymore, because the shire of Aramac will not exist anymore. It is on the Beattie Labor government's hit list to eliminate as a local authority representing the interests of the people in that part of Australia.I was in Queensland on Friday last week and woke up to the news that the Beattie Labor government had added a further draconian measure to their legislation to wipe out local government in Queensland, and that was basically to stop any of the elected representatives from talking about it. I am sure that the member for Bonner, when he woke up on Friday morning at home in Brisbane, was aghast, the same as most Queenslanders. But we know one Queenslander who has had nothing to say about this and who was not shocked about the measures that are being taken by the Beattie Labor government, and that is the member for Griffith - another Queenslander who seems to have gone silent and very, very weak on this issue in Queensland, where democracy at a local government level is being totally trashed. All he has been able to say so far is: 'We'll look at it very carefully.' They will start nicknaming him 'the mirror' shortly because he will keep looking into it.It was interesting to read an article in the Australian today written by Glenn Milne - an interesting report on some of the views inside the Labor Party. There are Queensland members of the Labor Party who would like to see the member for Griffith act on this, who believe he actually has some power to do so and that he should start tidying up the damage that Beattie is causing in Queensland under the rules of the Labor Party. It is interesting that this article refers to the federal platform of the Labor Party recognising the 'autonomous role' of local government that is being trashed by Premier Beattie. They also recognise the 'value of democratic and accountable' local government in Queensland. The Leader of the Opposition has the ability to do something about this. He was able to get rid of his brother out of the Labor Party and he was able to get rid of Dean Mighell; he has not been able to get rid of Joe McDonald. Does he have the backbone to deal with Premier Beattie on this issue? Premier Beattie is just trampling the rights of individual ratepayers across Queensland by denying them the right to have a say in what happens in their local communities and, with his latest escapade, he is denying the right of their elected representatives to have a say in what is going on in Queensland. We know that a future Labor government here would be not just a puppet of the union movement but also a puppet of the state premiers.</DOC>

 - First of all, I thank the member for La Trobe for his question and also for his interest. As was made very clear by the international community around the time of the so-called surge - the enhanced forces being sent by the United States to Iraq - this had to be supported. It was important that it was supported by greater efforts towards reconciliation by the Iraqi government. The Prime Minister's letter, which was published in the newspapers over the weekend, is a follow-up to conversations he, the Prime Minister, had with Prime Minister Maliki back in March and that I had with Prime Minister Maliki back in June. When I saw Prime Minister Maliki in June, I made it very clear to him that we thought the process of reconciliation was moving too slowly. I would have thought that for observers of Iraq it was clear that that was the case, and I think it entirely appropriate that the Australian government should do what it can to try to accelerate that process. I did make the point to Prime Minister Maliki in June that I thought it would be valuable to have a high profile reconciliation conference of the key sectarian leaders in Iraq. I am, by the way, pleased to hear that a conference of the sectarian leaders is to proceed in Iraq. I think that is a good development and it is very much hoped that it brings successful results.I would hope that all members of this parliament would support that particular proposition. After all, we were reminded only yesterday in the newspapers that back in 2003 the Leader of the Opposition went to Iraq, came back and wrote to our Prime Minister. He said that Australia should put its shoulder to the wheel, that we should do what we can to help the people of Iraq. That was in the old days of Kevin03. We went to Kevin04, and then it was 'troops out by Christmas'. Then there were a few variations through Kevin05 and Kevin06. Kevin07 is a very interesting issue. In Kevin07, the Labor Party apparently now has the view that some troops should remain in Iraq - that under Labor around 1,000 of the defence personnel involved in Iraq would remain if Labor was elected. But, over a period of time, perhaps the best part of a year, the Overwatch Battle Group - the 500 or so in Southern Iraq, in Tallil - would be withdrawn.The Overwatch Battle Group is doing a fantastic job. They have been training Iraqi soldiers. And Australians, by the way, have either directly or indirectly trained about 15,000 soldiers in the Iraqi army, so it is a very impressive record. The Overwatch Battle Group also provides backup support should Iraqi forces get into difficulties in that part of Southern Iraq. I visited them myself fairly recently. Yet, this morning, I heard on the radio the Labor candidate for Eden-Monaro, ex-Colonel Kelly, say that their presence was only symbolic. Here are 500 Australian soldiers risking their lives in a dangerous environment, and the Leader of the Opposition's candidate for Eden-Monaro - and I have heard this coming from the member for Hunter and the member for Barton as well, and the Leader of the Opposition has endorsed this position - is saying that those soldiers' role there is only symbolic; it is a flag-waving exercise. I do not know how that has gone down this morning with the Australian soldiers in Tallil, but I would like the House to know that there are a lot of us who think that is a deeply offensive thing to have said about the Australian soldiers. They do a dangerous job and they do a critical job.In conclusion, let me say this about the Labor Party: if the Labor Party thinks it is wrong to have any troops in Iraq, that we should be out of Iraq and it is all a terrible thing, the Leader of the Opposition should have the courage to say so. He should have the courage to say, 'If you vote Labor, all of the troops will be out of Iraq because Iraq' - as he says - 'is a debacle, a bad thing and a catastrophe.' That is what he should do. He should say, 'We would pull all of them out.' The interesting thing about the Leader of the Opposition, and this is a real character issue, is that he cannot quite bring himself to say that because it might be controversial. The trouble is that, at the end of the day, political leaders are expected to believe in things - or at least something. And the Leader of the Opposition, I am afraid, is very short on beliefs and very long on stunts.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for her question. I am aware of this report. It was a very small sample - 121 women were interviewed for this report. Some of the stories were clearly distressing to read and I would suggest that these people should take their stories to the Workplace Ombudsman if in fact they are the case. I also notice that this survey was done before the Australian government introduced the fairness test. There is a very important political point to make here: the fact is that, since the Howard government came to office, more than a million women have obtained work in Australia. Over a million women now have a job -  - about 515,000 of those are full-time jobs and about 578,000 are part-time jobs. Women have more choice, more opportunities and more flexibility in the workplace than ever before.The member for Fowler then left the chamber. - There is also another point I want to make here - that is, that a million Australian women now have a job under the Howard government. Remember that back in 1992 under Labor there were a million people unemployed; since we have been in government a million women have been able to get a job. There is also another point I want to make and that is that the Labor Party seems to be engaged in its own series of extreme makeovers. You have the Leader of the Opposition who is now trying to appear as a fiscal conservative. - You have the Labor Party undertaking these extreme makeovers. You have the Leader of the Opposition doing glossy ads declaring he is a fiscal conservative to distract attention from the fact that over the last nine years he has voted against every single fiscally conservative reform in this House. You have the Deputy Leader of the Opposition doing her glossy photo shoots to distract attention from the fact that under her industrial relations policies, the Australian economy would go backwards -  - If the Deputy Leader of the Opposition was so concerned about working women, what about Cassie? Have you called her back recently? While we have the Labor Party desperately trying to distract people's attention from their policies, we have independent economists telling us that under Labor the economy will go backwards and 300,000 jobs will be at risk because of the harsh reality of their industrial relations laws. Interest rates will go up 1.4 per cent and the economy will suffer if Labor were ever to get into government. The industrial relations laws that this government has introduced have ensured that nearly 300,000 jobs have been made available for working families in Australia since Work Choices was introduced.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Deakin for his question. I note that there is no doubt that turning back the clock on the government's workplace relations reforms would have a negative impact on Australian families. It would have a dire impact on inflation, interest rates and unquestionably housing affordability. The independent construction watchdog found through an independent report released last month that housing would be three per cent more expensive if the Labor Party were elected into government and inflation would be one per cent higher.Only last week, an independent report commissioned by small business found interest rates would be 1.4 per cent higher if the government's workplace relations reforms were rolled back by the Labor Party. Yesterday, the head of the Australian Industry Group, Heather Ridout, said that interest rates would be higher if a centralised and fixed workplace relations system was introduced. So it is not hard to understand that under the Labor Party it is likely that interest rates will go up higher than anything under this government and, significantly, more than 300,000 jobs would be lost and it would be much harder for working Australians.There was speculation today in a national newspaper that the Labor Party would change their policy. Heather Ridout said yesterday on Meet the Press that she was looking forward to the Labor Party's industrial relations policy mark 2. I thought to myself: will the Labor Party change their policy? I think it is highly unlikely they will. The Labor Party are totally captured by the union bosses.I was surfing YouTube today - for a brief moment during my morning tea break - and I came across an interesting photo from the ETU. It has Mike Symon, the Labor Party candidate for Deakin; Kevin Harkins, the now disgraced candidate for Franklin; Dean Mighell, the disgraced leader of the ETU; and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. There is Dean Mighell with the three stooges. What we can glean from this information on YouTube - and I am happy to table that photograph - is that the Labor Party remains built, owned and operated by the union bosses, the Dean Mighells, the Kevin Harkins. We hear today that Joe McDonald is going to be defiant in remaining in the Labor Party. Do you remember the Leader of the Opposition saying it was a zero tolerance policy? Joe McDonald has new allegations against him and the response of the Labor Party is: 'We'll have to put back his suspension from the Labor Party to February next year.' Joe McDonald is still in the Labor Party wearing his 'no ticket no start' braces.As for the new ETU candidate for Deakin, they are all fingers on the same hand - the hand that wants to reach into the pocket of working Australian families; the hand that is going to deliver control of the Labor Party to the union bosses. The Labor Party is built, owned and operated by the union bosses. The more evidence we see and hear proves it yet again: they will be controlled by the people who want to control every workplace, and that is very bad for Australian working families.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dobell for his question. He is the member for an area which has obviously seen a huge growth in the older population as people move there for the lifestyle. Affordability is a very important issue to him and his constituents. If the coalition government had not been elected, if the coalition government had not changed the indexing of pensions to twice a year and linked pensions not only to the CPI but also to 25 per cent of male total average weekly earnings, a single pensioner currently residing in the electorate of Dobell would have $66.20 less per fortnight in their pay packet. That is what they would have to survive on without that policy change initiated by the Howard government. For a couple that is $111.40. This is the real measure of good strong economic management and real policies that go to addressing the needs of all Australians, not just those in the workforce - $111.40 is what it means today.Of course, when we are able to, the Howard government ensures that all Australians benefit from a strong economy. In June of this year pensioners received, per individual, $500 in a one-off bonus - the equivalent of $10 a week on top of the CPI increase in their pensions. To a couple that meant $1,000.I recently heard reports of pensioners saying they have to make a choice between putting food on the table and paying for electricity, so I asked some pensioners in my electorate how much they pay for their electricity each quarter. They said that it was around $160 a quarter. Basically, for a single pensioner that means this bonus on its own will virtually pay the year's electricity bill, or it will go a long way towards paying for the registration of the motor vehicle - those big lumpy payments. These are things that are capable and possible when you actually listen to and react on behalf of the seniors who have built this economy over their working lives, and who today do not necessarily benefit directly from tax cuts but do need that benefit that comes from such things as the bonus.That was in June. In September, with the changes that the Treasurer has made to the superannuation scheme, some 300,000 people will have their pension increased as a result of the changes to the asset test. That is the taper rate. That is more money on top of the $500 and the 25 per cent of MATWE that directly benefit them. In addition, for the first time no tax will be paid on those superannuation payments. That is a wonderful thing and it will enable people to improve their lifestyle.I was also asked what the government would do to sustain these measures into the future. It goes without saying that if we do not have high employment, strong productivity and real wages growth we cannot do that, and that is what the Howard government is delivering. It is doing that in the face of what Labor is delivering today to pensioners. Labor state and territory governments have increased water and electricity charges - hitting the hip pockets of our pensioners. The Tasmanian government will impose a new ambulance fee on all Tasmanians, including pensioners, regardless of whether they use the service. That government has taken its lead from the Queensland government, which did that a few years ago. That is what Labor is doing in Tasmania.What is Labor doing in government in New South Wales? It is imposing a 15 per cent booking fee on CountryLink train fares and it is suggested that it intends to reduce the travel concession for pensioners. That is what Labor does in power. It is doing that in an economy in which the coalition is saving money and providing concessions. The only reason that the coalition government is providing utility allowances directly to pensioners is that state Labor when offered a partnership to provide this assistance to pensioners refused to help. It did not refuse to help the Howard government; it refused to help pensioners. The Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Treasurer live a lie by making fraudulent statements about grocery and fuel prices. I assure the pensioners of Australia of one thing: you cannot talk those prices down, but bad policies can drive them up, and that will affect the prices that pensioners pay. They can rely on the coalition government to ensure that they benefit from a strong economy, that downward pressure is placed on the price of things they need and that it will deliver for them. They should look at what Labor has delivered at the state level to see what it will deliver in government if it ever gets to the Treasury bench here in Canberra.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question and for the very considerable assistance that she and many of her constituents have given us in the preparation of the Water Bill 2007, which I trust will pass through this parliament this week. This will in large measure implement the National Plan for Water Security in respect of the Murray-Darling Basin. It will enable us for the first time to effect this historic change to the way water is managed in our most important river system.The government looks ahead; it has a vision for the future - not simply beyond an election or five years, but decades into the future - to ensure that the Murray River and its tributaries in the Murray-Darling Basin are managed sustainably. Honourable members opposite scoff. It is that sort of contempt for the environmental needs of our biggest river system and for the sustainability of irrigated agriculture that has characterised Labor Party policy on water for decades. That is why long-term reform is overdue and it took the courage of this government to undertake it.For the first time we will have a basin run as one, with a Murray-Darling Basin Authority that sets an enforceable basin-wide cap on sustainable diversions. We will have a working water market and consistent water pricing; we will have a basin environmental watering plan and an environmental water holder that will purchase and deliver environmental water. This is the most fundamental reform of water management in our history and it took the vision of this government, looking decades into the future, to offer that to the parliament.The state governments have an enormous amount to gain by supporting this water reform plan and signing the intergovernmental agreement that this government will offer them. It is a great pity that alone of the basin states Victoria chose not to support the comprehensive water plan. That is why we are legislating now relying only on our constitutional powers. The consequence of Victoria's not supporting the IGA will be that the federal government will not invest in the off-farm water infrastructure belonging to state government authorities in Victoria. The Victorian government estimated last week that the cost of upgrading its ageing and very leaky water infrastructure was $2 billion, but it has committed only half that amount. By its own admission it is at least $1 billion short. If it refuses to sign the IGA on the misguided, politically driven agenda it is pursuing it will deprive itself and the communities that depend on that infrastructure of this substantial injection of Commonwealth funds.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kingston for his question. I know that he is as concerned as I am for the welfare of the frail and vulnerable aged in our community. The reaction of the Labor Party to this question suggests to me that they are not taking this issue nearly as seriously as they should. It came to my attention last week that activities that are stipulated in the standards required by the government as appropriate for people in high-care residential care - namely, the things that most people would regard as normal and appropriate for these frail and vulnerable aged Australians - were being obviously flouted by the union and ALP representatives in the electorate of Kingston. It was revealed last week the activities to which these aged-care residents were being subjected. Residents from two aged-care facilities, the Vails and Aldis homes, were bussed to a vaudeville and propaganda afternoon which was touted as 'Irish Albert, with guest artistes'. I am not sure that the residents of the Vails or Aldis nursing homes were told that the guest artistes were Janet Giles of SA Unions, Amanda Rishworth, the ALP candidate for Kingston, and Gay Thompson, the local state ALP member.This would be funny if it was not quite so serious, because the people we are talking about were taken from high-care residential aged-care residences. These are the most frail and the most vulnerable people in aged care in Australia and yet they were removed from their homes to a union-ALP rally and subjected to vaudeville and propaganda. After Irish Albert, enter Janet Giles, Amanda Rishworth and Gay Thompson stage left, shouting slogans at frail aged people.This is straight out of the ACTU-ALP manual that was revealed by the minister earlier this year which says that every step should be taken in local areas, and any depth plumbed, by Labor to get these messages across. - Sadly, the people from the Aldis and Vails nursing homes could not be protected from the appalling behaviour of SA Unions and the ALP. This is a template for all around Australia and residents of aged-care homes should be warned. The Leader of the Opposition should have the guts to do something about it.The member for Oxley then left the chamber. - If the Leader of the Opposition had any guts, he would do something about this appalling display. He would discipline Amanda Rishworth, the Labor candidate for Kingston, and he would assure the Australian public that frail, vulnerable, aged people will not be removed from their homes and taken to union and ALP rallies in the future.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Greenway for her question. I can inform her that the Commonwealth spends about $2 billion a year in rental assistance to help families and pensioners pay rents. Over the next five years the Commonwealth will spend about $5 billion on public housing. That is money which will go to the states and the territories to construct public housing at subsidised rentals. Of course, the best thing you can do to help families is help them get into work and help them to get an income to pay the rent.I have been asked about alternatives. I was interested to read a proposal that was announced yesterday by the Leader of the Opposition to give an $8,000 tax break - $6,000 from the Commonwealth and $2,000 from the state - for the construction of new properties which would be rented out under market rents. In passing, I note that the generosity of the tax breaks is not matched by the reduction in rent. The tax break is worth about $150 a week. On a $400 rent the rent cut would be about $80, and on a $300 rent the rent cut would be about $60. So you are paying a very significant tax break for only a portion thereof to find its way into the hands of a renter. But it was said by the Labor Party that 3,500 properties would qualify in the first year, 11,000 in the following year and 25,000 in the third year.Last night on the news the Leader of the Opposition went out to a property to tout this policy. He touted the policy with someone who had been selected by the Labor Party to go on the evening news. I know that because I have the email which the Labor campaign workers sent out asking for a volunteer to be part of this photo op last night. The person whose house it was was somebody called Rosanna Harris. The Leader of the Opposition said this - and this was carried on all of the news bulletins last night - 'What's the rental on a place like this?' Rosanna Harris said, '$260 a week.' Kevin Rudd said, '$260' so you're effectively going to get 50 bucks plus off each week.'That was entirely false. Rosanna Harris will get nothing off her rent. Rosanna Harris will not qualify for any part whatsoever of this scheme because this will only apply to new construction from 2008, and any person who is currently in a rental will receive no benefit whatsoever. Not only did he deceive Rosanna Harris but, of course, there is no show without 'Punch' - the old member for Lilley was out there. It is a wonder he did not have 50 bucks in a brown paper bag for Rosanna Harris.The ABC news carried Kevin Rudd again making this false claim to Rosanna, 'If you're here on $260, you are effectively going to get 50-plus bucks off each week.' That was false. That again was a completely false statement to Rosanna Harris. And 'Punch' backed it up by saying to Rosanna Harris, 'Hopefully, it gets you off the merry-go-round where you are paying so much rent you can't afford to do anything else.' Rosanna Harris will not get any cut whatsoever under this policy.It is possible that the Leader of the Opposition does not know his own policy. The people of Australia are entitled to wonder why he would go and announce a policy which he did not understand. It is also possible that he does understand his own policy and it is possible that, notwithstanding that, he took the calculated decision to deceive not only Rosanna Harris but also every renter who would have been watching last night's television.This is a repeated pattern we are now seeing from the Leader of the Opposition. There is a stunt today but, after the cameras have left and after you start analysing what he has actually said, you will find that it is not quite truthful; it is not quite accurate. It is like when he said he was going to monitor grocery prices. After the cameras had left, he had to concede he would not do anything to bring them down. It was like his promise to monitor petrol prices. When you got to the bottom of it, he conceded he would not do anything to bring them down. Running a country is more than stunts on the evening news and it is more than the kind of false promise that was made to Rosanna Harris last night. The people of Australia deserve the truth and the Leader of the Opposition ought to apologise for misleading Australia last night.</DOC>

 - Let me make this point: if Labor were worried about the half a million people which it is talking about, why does it have a policy which will not do anything except in four years time for 50,000 people - one-tenth? If Labor were worried, why would it offer a tax break, which is, as I said, $150 a week, which on a $400 rental could give a benefit of $80 and on a $300 rental a benefit of $60? I call that wasteful. Who pockets the difference? Have you ever thought about this proposition? Who pockets the difference between the $150 tax break and the $50 decrease in rent? Have you ever thought about that proposition? Who pockets the difference? The 100 bucks does not just disappear; it does not go into the ether. It does not end up in a brown paper bag on its way to the Democrats. It is there.The last point I will make is this: if the member for Sydney is really worried about renters, perhaps she could go back, now that the cameras have left, and speak to Rosanna Harris and explain to Rosanna Harris that, although Rosanna was used as a prop last night on the national news, the promise that was made to Rosanna by the Leader of the Opposition, the member for Lilley and the member for Sydney was false. I will tell you one thing you could do for Rosanna: you could tell Rosanna the truth. That would be a big improvement.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Moreton for that question. Before going to the substance of it, can I take this opportunity, on behalf of everybody in the House, to wish the Treasurer many happy returns of the day. 
Honourable members - Hear, hear! - The Treasurer turns 50 today. It is a milestone for anybody. I think he can be very proud of what he has achieved in his 50 years. Amongst other things, he has undoubtedly been the best Treasurer this country has had. I think he should be very, very proud of the contribution he has made to the economic fabric of this country in occupying that position for longer and with greater distinction than any of his predecessors.There are threats to particular sectors of the Australian economy, and those threats come from the possible implementation of the policies of the Australian Labor Party. The Leader of the Opposition is only too ready to identify with certain economic policies of the government; although, he would have you believe, when he identifies with them, that he supported all of the measures that were adopted in order to bring about the strong economy we now enjoy. He would have you believe that he was hand in glove with the government in bringing about the strength of the economy that we now enjoy. That strength is overwhelmingly due to such things as industrial relations reform, fixing the Australian waterfront, implementing A New Tax System, paying off government debt, privatising assets that the government was running inefficiently and putting the budget back into surplus. And yet, astonishingly enough, although he now identifies with the results of that work, he opposed every attempt made by the government to achieve those reforms. The Leader of the Opposition wants to have it both ways. He wants the easy ride of the surplus, but he did not want to support the hard yakka to get the budget back into surplus. In fact, along with his mates in the Labor Party, he ran interference on all of our reform attempts from the moment he entered the parliament in 1998.These reforms have contributed mightily to the fact that we have a very strong economy and the lowest unemployment rate in 33 years. The member asked me: are there threats to particular sectors? There are threats. There is a particular threat coming from the possible implementation of the Labor Party's industrial relations policy. The Econtech report released last Friday shows that, if Labor's plan to re-regulate the industrial relations system is made into law, interest rates will rise by 1.4 per cent and over 300,000 jobs will be lost. On page 44 of the Econtech report it identifies the industries which face the biggest risk from Labor's policy. I quote from the report:The largest percentage losses in output in 2011 are in the trade-exposed industries of manufacturing which falls by 11 per cent ... mining down 8 per cent, agriculture down 7 per cent and transport down 7 per cent. These trade-exposed sectors are particularly affected by the loss of international competitiveness from the combination of a wages breakout and lower productivity.They are the words of a respected, independent economist. They are not my words, they are not the Treasurer's words and they are not the finance minister's words, although we certainly share the negative assessment of Labor's policy. They are the words of Econtech, a respected economic consultancy.I would advise the Leader of the Opposition to listen to a member of the board of the Reserve Bank, Mr Graeme Kraehe, who is also the Chairman of BlueScope Steel. I do not think the Leader of the Opposition would argue that Mr Kraehe is doing other than exercising his independent responsibility as a member of the Reserve Bank board. This is what Mr Kraehe had to say:The industrial relations reforms of last year are an essential step in securing the kind of workplace performance Australia needs to meet the challenges of international competition ...The threat of major changes to the reforms that have been made fuels union expectations of a resurgence of their power and undermines the confidence of business.They are the words of a member of the board of the Reserve Bank, a respected Australian businessman.I say finally to the member for Moreton that we have come a long way in the last 11½ years. We have come a long way in the last 20 years. We have embraced many reforms. It would be a sad indictment of our stomach and capacity for reform if we were to turn our backs on one of those reforms and threaten much higher interest rates and the loss of some 300,000 jobs.</DOC>

 - I cannot see them, but I can hear the sound effects from the corner over here. - I thank the member for Blair for his question. Unlike the last question from the Labor Party, it was a very serious question. Over a number of years, we, through our local members like the member for Blair, who is an outstanding representative for that part of Queensland and who listens to the local constituency -  - I have visited his electorate with him. People really enjoy and appreciate the representation they get, because they know they are not getting listened to by the state government in Queensland. The member for Blair raises a very important issue. Over the years, particularly through the AusLink funding programs, we provided a number of very important funding programs for local authorities to improve their infrastructure, their economies, their economic structure and, therefore, the social fabric in those communities, particularly in regional Australia. One such program - and I know the member for Blair has been a great supporter of it - is the Roads to Recovery program, which delivers funds directly to local government to enable them to fund local road and bridge replacement projects that they need in their local areas. The reason we took the decision to do this in 2001 is that we believe in local government and we believe that they are the closest level of government to local communities. They understand the aspirations of those local communities.Since 2001 we have delivered $2.1 billion to local authorities across Australia; 25,000 local road projects have been funded by local government authorities with funding under the Roads to Recovery program. We announced in the budget this year that we are going to continue this program through to 2014. So between now and 2014 there will be a further $2.36 billion available for local road projects across Australia. This is serious investment in Australia's infrastructure, which I have often said is not just the major highways or the major port access roads but also the local arterial roads in all those communities across metropolitan regional Australia. Because of the good economic management that we have delivered in Australia, we can afford to spend this money and provide this funding to local authorities. But, most importantly, we believe they have the ability to be able to do that because they are the closest to those local communities.Premier Beattie in Queensland does not believe that. He is bullying councils, forcing amalgamations on them, stopping them from having any public commentary about it and, in past legislation, has actually moved to close down any comment by local mayors and local councillors. But we read in the paper today that he has also closed down and stopped any comment from Labor Party candidates throughout Queensland in federal seats. This is interesting because it runs a bit opposite to what the Leader of the Opposition would like to see. He says that he supports local government in Queensland. He believes that they should have a say, he believes they should have been consulted, but he has not been able to do anything about it. Now Premier Beatty is forcing amalgamations on local councils. He is closing down the mayors and the councils and not allowing them to have a say or to seek the view of their local community. He has stopped federal candidates in all those seats in Queensland from having a say. I can guarantee the members opposite that the members for Blair, Leichhardt, Lindsay, Herbert, Dawson, Hinkler and Wide Bay will all have a say, even if the Labor candidates are not allowed to mention local government amalgamations.We are now seeing who is running Queensland and who has the influence in this federal election, and it is not the Leader of the Opposition. But we also found out in today's media that the Leader of the Opposition has got form on this issue because, when he was a senior bureaucrat in the Goss Labor government in Queensland in the early nineties, that was when the last round of local government forced amalgamations occurred. That was under the stewardship of the Leader of the Opposition when he was working for then Premier Wayne Goss. And guess what? There was no consultation then either. There were no referenda held about those forced amalgamations either.The Leader of the Opposition has not got the ticker to stand up to Premier Beattie on this issue and represent Queenslanders properly and give them a say. We have seen that he does not have the ticker to stand up to Joe McDonald. He has been able to kick his brother out of the Labor Party. He has been able to kick Dean Mighell and Kevin Harkins out, but he does not have the ticker to stand up to Joe McDonald or Premier Beattie on this issue, and if he cannot do that he cannot lead a government in Australia.</DOC>

 - The Treasurer made a lot of statements in 2004 and they were very effective. The one that I treasure the most out of the 2004 election campaign was when he pinged the member for Lilley for not only trying to falsely allege that our $600 family tax supplement was not real but actually promising the families of Australia that if he became Treasurer after the 2004 election they would be $600 a year per child worse off. I invite the member for Lilley to ask me another question on the Treasurer's statement - and I can think of quite a few more that would embarrass him and do him a lot of damage.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Wakefield for his question. At the moment the Australian economy is strong. It is strong because we have more Australians in work than ever before. We have unemployment at a 33-year low. We have GDP higher than it has ever been before. We have real wages which have increased some 20 per cent. In these circumstances, where we are as close to full employment as we have been in 33 years, you do tend to get price pressures in the economy.The task of managing the economy from this point forward is going to be the task of managing a strong economy and keeping inflation in check. Absolutely critical to that great task over the years which lie ahead is industrial relations policy. Let me quote Ian Macfarlane, the former Governor of the Reserve Bank, in August 2006. He said:Obviously, it makes the job of [managing] monetary policy easier, the more deregulated the labour market is. If you get pressure in one part of the economy - in the past the fact that wages had risen there would be used as a persuasive argument for it to be carried right across the country, the comparative wage justice argument - it's easier to have hot spots without the hot spots moving throughout the economy.The governor of the bank was saying that where you have parts of the economy which are hot, either because there is profitability or because there is labour shortage, if you do not have a deregulated labour market those hotspots move right across the economy and they put pressure on inflation. As was always the case in Australia, the boom leads to a bust. Because this government has put in place Work Choices with Australian workplace agreements - because this government has improved industrial relations - those hotspots do not move their way across the economy and push out inflation, and as a consequence we are not being subjected to the same bust as we normally would have at this period of the cycle.There would be nothing more damaging to the Australian economy than to turn our back now on industrial relations reform and to roll back to the way in which we were let down in this country in the years gone by. This is where Labor is a complete throwback. Labor is wanting to throw back not just to the industrial relations system of 2000, or even to the industrial relations system of 1997; Labor wants to throw back pre-1993. It wants to go back to pattern bargaining, awards, the abolition of AWAs and centralised wage fixation. Nothing could be more damaging to where the Australian economy is at the moment than to have that throwback from the Australian Labor Party.The Leader of the Opposition has a wonderful capacity to get economic policy wrong. You will recall, Mr Speaker, that when we reformed the tax system the Leader of the Opposition said it was fundamental injustice - the great day in 100 years where fairness in the Australian nation ended. Always one for pompous rhetoric, the Leader of the Opposition, when this government reformed industrial relations, had this to say. This is when we reformed the industrial relations system which, since it was reformed, has led to 390,000 new jobs. This is what the Leader of the Opposition said in the parliament:If these laws remain in place in Australia, Australian families will look back to these days in November 2005 as the time when parliament legislated fairness out of the Australian way of life.Three hundred and ninety thousand new jobs later, I do not think many Australians are looking back to November 2005 with a fondness and demanding we return there, just as there are not many Australians wanting to go back pre-2000 to the old wholesale sales tax, the state taxes and higher income taxes. The thing about the Leader of the Opposition is that he has been persistently wrong on economic policy. He has always made pompous rhetorical boasts. He has no part in taking any credit for the modern Australian economy. If it had been left up to him, it would never have occurred. And, if it is left up to him, the objectives that we have in the years to come will never be achieved.</DOC>

 - It is a bit rich for the Leader of the Opposition to ask me a question about today's inflation rate. As I understand what the Treasurer said this morning, he said it was within the band agreed between the government and the Reserve Bank -  - which, as the Treasurer reminds me, the Labor Party wanted to sue us over. -  - I will accept service on your behalf, Mr Speaker. That question reminds us, of course, that there is, as the bank has identified, a need to make sure that the policies we have at the present time bear downwards on inflation. That, of course, invites yet another examination of the industrial relations policy of the Australian Labor Party, because the industrial relations policy of the Australian Labor Party, as identified by Econtech, would be bad for the level of inflation in Australia and consequently lead to an increase of 1.4 per cent in interest rates.</DOC>

 - First of all, I thank the honourable member for Stirling for his question and for his interest. I appreciate it very much. There is of course a vital link between security and the reconciliation process in Iraq. It is the view of most analysts that you do need some degree of security in Iraq for reconciliation to proceed. It is our view, by the way, that the reconciliation process has been proceeding too slowly. It is the view, though, of the Leader of the Opposition that, without security, reconciliation will proceed - that the withdrawal of foreign troops from Iraq will lead to reconciliation. Most people would agree with the proposition that if foreign troops immediately withdrew from Iraq then the consequence would be blood-letting which would make the blood-letting in Darfur minor by comparison. It would be a simply horrific circumstance. The Labor Party rightly support intervention in Darfur to stop bloodshed and they rightly support intervention in Afghanistan to defeat terrorism and stop bloodshed, but for party political reasons they support withdrawal from Iraq, which will of course lead to massive increases in bloodshed.Yesterday the Labor Party's candidate for the electorate of Eden-Monaro said that our troops were just involved in 'a flag-waving exercise'. I did think that was shameful and I said so. The Leader of the Opposition, to be fair and to his credit, dissociated himself from the remarks of the Labor candidate for Eden-Monaro. He said that he had 'nothing but respect for our troops in the field' and he had nothing but respect for the job they do. He repudiated the Labor candidate for Eden-Monaro, but a little research found that the member for Barton, who is the opposition spokesman on foreign affairs, and the member for Hunter, who is the opposition spokesman on defence -  -  - I know the opposition are interested to hear what those two gentlemen do. They put out a press release on 2 July which said:But increasingly evidence suggests the Howard Government's purpose for having these combat troops in Iraq has more to do with symbolism than military strategy.These two honourable gentlemen said the same thing as the Labor candidate for Eden-Monaro said, and if the opposition leader had any sense of leadership he would also repudiate the remarks made by those two members of his frontbench. The fact is this: these soldiers in the south of Iraq are doing a brave job and an important job, and we should be proud, not just of the soldiers but of the job they do. I refer to an AAP report in which Lieutenant Dan Wright was quoted, which said he:_ leads a troop of up to six vehicles on patrols which run from 12 hours to four days and could range across _ al Muthanna or Dhi Qar province.This, he says, is hard work in desert conditions.'When we are out there for a number of days we really need a couple of days back here to recover,' _ Lieutenant Wright hasn't yet needed to open fire, which he attributes to a combination of diplomacy and intimidation.This is what he said:'We are a much better-drilled opponent. We like to think we present a hard target and by doing that they are not going to attack us because they know they are going to come off second best.'For the government, they are not the words of somebody who is doing a symbolic job; they are the words of a brave man doing an important job. The member for Barton and the member for Hunter should be repudiated for saying precisely what the Labor candidate for Eden-Monaro said - for taking exactly the same attitude to our troops. Ultimately, the Labor Party needs to explain what it wants in Iraq. What is its vision? Is its vision victory for terrorism? Is its vision conflict, civil war and bloodshed on a grander scale than Darfur? Is that the vision of the Australian Labor Party, or does the Labor Party want a struggling democracy to survive and people to be able to live stable and prosperous lives? The Labor Party should be careful in what it wishes for. I would have hoped that a major political party in this country would support peace and prosperity in Iraq, not options which would turn it into a bloodbath much greater than the bloodbath in Darfur.</DOC>

 - I think it was the 1999 budget where I put $100 million into the Australian Greenhouse Office. - I am sorry, but this was the government that put record funding into the Australian Greenhouse Office. - This was the government that went on to set up the greenhouse challenge. This was the government that established the Natural Heritage Trust and then the National Action Plan on Salinity. - This was the government that probably put more money into the environment than any other government in Australian history. I do not think that is challenged. Perhaps we could go back and have a look at the Hawke government. The high point of the Hawke government was Graham Richardson standing out at Wentworth, as I recall, and promising a million trees. The member for Grayndler is shaking his hand. Don't shake your hand; I know Graham Richardson was a good factional friend of yours, Albo - a close personal friend. There was Richo, trampling on the fauna, trampling on the flora and promising to be a good environmentalist.But that was the record of the Hawke government. We funded the Natural Heritage Trust, the National Action Plan on Salinity and the Greenhouse Office. We are the government that has launched an emissions trading scheme that I think is the best anywhere in the world. - We are the government that has introduced photovoltaic rebates; we recently announced water tanks for every school; we have rebates for solar power. Mr Speaker, the more I think about it, this has been the greatest environmental government in the history of Australia.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Braddon for his question. He is not going to give up on this issue, and the Howard government is not going to give up on this issue -  - because the people of Devonport, Latrobe, Kentish, Sheffield and Ulverstone deserve their own hospital. They deserve a general hospital suitable for a community of that size. They should not have to go 60 kilometres up the road for any general hospital admission for an acute condition.The problem is that the Tasmanian government wants to destroy the Mersey hospital, as it has been known, and the Howard government will not let it do this. We have a clear and straightforward plan to preserve the Mersey hospital. The Commonwealth will fund the hospital, the community will control the hospital and the hospital will deliver the range of services that it has safely and effectively delivered for many years at that site. - I regret to say that so far the Tasmanian government has totally refused to say how much money it is currently spending at this hospital, how much money it intends to spend and how many services are currently being delivered. In addition, the Tasmanian government is trying to bully hospital staff against talking to Commonwealth officials. I say again that the Tasmanian government should not try to sabotage this proposal out of hurt pride, because this proposal amounts to $45 million a year more for health services in north-western Tasmania.The federal government is serious about this. I can inform the House that today I have written again to the Tasmanian health minister, enclosing a detailed implementation plan for this hospital's transition to community control. I have warned her against a politically motivated rejection of this plan. She should not reject this plan because she thinks that is what Kevin Rudd wants. On this topic, as on so many others, the Leader of the Opposition does not know what he thinks or what he wants. I quote from a letter to the Mayor of Burnie in which the Leader of the Opposition says to the mayor:Labor is currently in discussion with the Tasmanian Government about its clinical services plan, with a view to announcing our plans for hospitals and health services in Tasmania in the lead-up to the federal election.What a pathetic cop-out from the Leader of the Opposition! It is slippery, it is fake, but it is so typical of this man, who is the least experienced person ever to present himself for national leadership in this country. He has never even run a local council, let alone a national economy.The people of north-west Tasmania know what they want. They want decisions and they want answers. They do not want more waffle from the alternative Prime Minister of this country. I table my letter to the Tasmanian minister, I table the implementation plan and I also table this pathetic document from the Leader of the Opposition.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. The honourable member is correct in saying that the bulk of Australia's water resources are in Northern Australia and that it has only a very tiny fraction of our population and a tiny fraction of our agriculture. Water planning in Australia has been bedevilled, particularly in the last three decades or so, by a lack of long-term vision and long-term planning. There has been a tendency to make very short term political decisions in order to seek a particular electoral result on a particular occasion and to deny the type of long-term vision that the country needs.Nobody is more experienced at this sort of short-term thinking and the consequences of it than the Leader of the Opposition. Of course, it was the Leader of the Opposition who decided, together with his then boss, Mr Goss, who was then the new Premier of Queensland, not to build the Wolffdene Dam in 1989. That was a classic case of the problem of short-termism you see right around Australia. There was a long-term problem. The honourable member talks about the long-term challenge of agricultural development in Northern Australia. It has to be met with a long-term response. South-east Queensland had the long-term challenge of water shortage and a growing population. It had to be met with a long-term response. But, when put to the test, the member for Griffith failed dismally. He made a short-term political decision and condemned his neighbours, the community in which he lives, to the devastating drought which they are experiencing.The contrast between the short-term thinking of the Leader of the Opposition and the long-term thinking of the Prime Minister and this government could not be more stark. The National Plan for Water Security looks decades into the future - not a few years but the rest of this century. We are endeavouring to set up the most efficient use of Australia's water over many decades to come. We have established a Northern Australia task force whose task it is to examine the potential for further land and water development in Northern Australia. This is a long-term job. The reality is that water projects are always controversial. They always take a long time to build. The environmental issues are always complex and take a long time to examine. But you have to start somewhere. The member for Griffith would know the great Chinese saying, 'The journey of a thousand leagues begins with a single step.' The problem the member for Griffith has demonstrated is that he does not have the character to begin the first step. Without that type of leadership he has no capacity to be the Prime Minister of this country.</DOC>

 - I thank the greatest ever member for Hasluck for the question. I feel a little disappointed that I did not get the title, but I know I have a lot of successful predecessors! An Econtech report has found that if the Labor Party is elected it will cost 300,000 jobs in the Australian economy, and interest rates will increase by 1.4 per cent. That is because the Labor Party wants to roll back the industrial relations reforms of this government. It would be the first significant roll-back of a major economic reform by a government in a generation and it would not come without cost: interest rates up a further 1.4 per cent and the loss of 300,000 jobs. That is because the Labor Party policy is about rolling back our reforms beyond 2006 - beyond our reforms to the waterfront, beyond our 1996 reforms, even beyond the Keating reforms - and going back to pre-1993 reforms.I came across an interesting article in the Canberra Times today. I never thought I would be standing here quoting the Canberra Times. The article is a repeat of what was said 10 years ago and reads:The Australian Labor Party has formally declared it will be dumping many of the industrial relations policies of the former Keating government.Opposition spokesman on industrial relations Bob McMullan said the approach of the next Labor government to industrial relations would be 'distinctly and noticeably different'. He said the new approach would differ significantly from the approach of the former Keating government, making a deliberate turn away from enterprise-based arrangements and a return to collective bargaining underpinned by the traditional award system. The ALP would in future be pursuing industry-wide arrangements.Pattern bargaining is back. That is what they said 10 years ago and that is what they say today. What would be their motivation for winding back a major reform in the economy for the first time in 30 years? The Labor Party's policy, as we know, is written by the ACTU, it is owned by the ACTU and it is funded by the trade union bosses - and 70 per cent of the Labor Party frontbench are former union officials. There is concern in the broader community. Listen to this, Mr Speaker. It is reported today that one commentator with an expert knowledge of the unions said that the Labor Party's policy is all about heading towards compulsory unionism. He stated:It consolidates the power of the unions and of course it will be those unions linked to the Labor Party.You might think that this is a right-wing commentator, Mr Speaker, someone with an opinion more in the Adam Smith mould than any other, but this person went on to say:I don't see much in the Labor Party's policy for union members to get overjoyed about. I do see a lot for union officials to get overjoyed about in terms of opening up right of entry access.Those are the words of the head of the Australian Nursing Federation in Western Australia. He is saying that the Labor Party's policy is all about the union bosses. It is not about the members of the union; it is not about the workers of Australia. The Labor Party's industrial relations policy is all about the union bosses. The President of the ANF in Western Australia said he did not want to waste hundreds of thousands of dollars to effectively support Labor's industrial relations policy because it would shore up power for unions linked to Labor. This is not some flippant right-wing commentator or anyone else who, in a dispassionate way, may be passing an assessment on the Labor Party's policy; this is a senior union official saying the Labor Party's industrial relations policy is all about the union bosses. That is why they want to roll back industrial relations reform. It is not about the workers because, for the workers, wages have gone up since our industrial relations reforms. It is not about those most vulnerable in the community, because, for those people, the number of jobs in Australia has increased dramatically - 387,000 new jobs, 84 per cent of them full time, since we introduced our Work Choices reforms. It is all about the union bosses; it is for the union bosses - the same union bosses that will take control of the Labor Party, the same union bosses that control a weak Leader of the Opposition.</DOC>

 - I think there is one claim to greatness that I would not make of myself or any of my colleagues, but it is a label I will place upon the Leader of the Opposition, and that is that, of all the leaders of the Australian Labor Party I have faced - and I think he is the sixth leader of the Australian Labor Party I have faced - he is the greatest contortionist. What he has been able simultaneously to do is to wrap his arms around policies that he has spent all of his time in parliament opposing. It is a pretty energetic and great achievement of political contortion to say that there is not a sliver of difference between the economic policies of the government and the economic policies of the Australian Labor Party when you opposed taxation reform, you opposed paying off $96 billion of debt, you opposed industrial relations reform, you opposed the privatisation of Telstra, you opposed putting the budget back into surplus - and so the list has gone on. And yet now the Leader of the Opposition would have the Australian public believe that the launching pad for his assault on the government of this country is the very policies that he spent all of his waking hours in opposing. So, if we are handing out descriptions of 'greatest', he has to be the greatest political contortionist I have faced in the office of Leader of the Opposition. - </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I well understand that, like all residents of south-east Queensland, he has very great concern about growing water scarcity. The Water Services Association's latest report reminded us of the grave challenge that urban centres face in terms of water provision. Around Australia, with the sole and honourable exception of Perth, large cities have neglected their water infrastructure for many decades and, as a consequence, with growing population, greater demands on water supply, lower levels of rainfall and, in particular, lower levels of run-off, we have had the inevitable consequence of severe water shortages.When a small country town runs out of water - and we are all familiar with those that have done so and no doubt are doing so now - often it is possible to truck water in as an emergency measure. But, when a city of millions of people runs out of water, it is nothing short of a catastrophe. And that is the situation that some of our major cities could face. It is certainly the situation that Brisbane could face.The Leader of the Opposition spoke a moment ago about the title 'the greatest'. Let me say this: he has made the greatest contribution to south-east Queensland's water scarcity. He is the drought-bringer. He delivered that. He had an opportunity to deliver -  - The Leader of the Opposition had a choice. He had a choice in 1989: the government of which he was a part had a choice to build a dam which would have droughtproofed south-east Queensland - and they wimped it. They said, 'No, we won't build it,' but then they did nothing else.One of the other things that the Leader of the Opposition is very good at is asking himself questions. He is always asking himself questions. He goes on the television and instead of waiting for the interviewer to ask him the question he says, 'I ask myself why I am so clever,' and then tells us why he is, and he says, 'And I ask myself why my policies are so persuasive,' and then he answers that. What about this question for the Leader of the Opposition? Why doesn't he ask himself this question - because he will not answer it when anyone else asks it: 'Why did we not build the Wolffdene Dam?' Why did he and Wayne Goss not build the Wolffdene Dam? Why did they deny the reality that the area of Australia which was the fastest growing in our nation was, so obviously, going to need more water? Why did they deny it the prospect of more water? And why does he have the gall to stand here and pretend that he has the character to be Prime Minister of this country?</DOC>

 - I cannot explain whether that statement is correct - there is no-one here from the Queensland Liberal Party. But let me accept -  - As I was saying before the honourable member opposite went into a sort of paroxysm of St Vitus dance, leaping up and down, I cannot confirm whether this was the view of the Queensland Liberal Party. Oh, he has got it again! - I withdraw the reference to St Vitus dance. - I cannot say whether that is an accurate reflection of what the Queensland Liberal Party said. -  - But we know that the Leader of the Opposition is very devoted to 'echonomics'. - We know that he is trying to be a Liberal.The member for Melbourne then left the chamber. - We know now that the member for Griffith's defence for not building the Wolffdene Dam is that the parliamentary Liberal Party in Queensland at the time was not in favour of it either. So we have had 'echonomics'; now we have got 'echohydrology' - we do not have any ideas of our own. But the fact remains that it is not just a question of not building a dam. Views will differ about a dam, about a recycling plant - they will differ about lots of things. -  - The failure of leadership of the member for Griffith - The member for Corio then left the chamber. - The Leader of the Opposition's defence for cancelling the Wolffdene Dam now apparently seems to be that the parliamentary Liberal Party did not want to build it. The people of Australia are entitled to expect leaders to lead and to form their own views. But, more importantly still, the failure of the Leader of the Opposition in cancelling that dam was that he replaced it with nothing else. It is one thing to say you do not agree with a dam or with a recycling plant or something else, but what he did then - The member for Calwell then left the chamber. - The failure of the member for Griffith's leadership - which underlines the lack of character that he has and his unfitness to be Prime Minister of this country - was that, recognising the great need for a secure water supply that south-east Queensland had, he cancelled one viable option and then replaced it with nothing else. It is for that reason that south-east Queensland is in dire risk of running out of water. The member for Griffith is the architect of south-east Queensland's drought. His complacency, his inaction, is the reason south-east Queensland is short of water.Leave granted.</DOC>

 - I respond to that question from the honourable member for Stirling by saying that today's statistics on wages growth confirm the spectacular success of our industrial relations policy, because what they show is that this economy has maintained strong but containable wages growth. These statistics show that wage rates in the private sector increased by one per cent in the June quarter to be 3.8 per cent higher over the year and that wage rates for all sectors rose by 1.1 per cent in the June quarter to be four per cent higher over the year. What this proves yet again is that we are able to sustain simultaneously record lows in unemployment, relatively low interest rates and strong wages growth, but wages growth which is affordable and relevant to the productivity levels and prosperity levels of the different sectors of the Australian economy. It is relevant to recall some remarks made by the Governor of the Reserve Bank on 14 June. He said:Despite, on most counts, the tightest labour market conditions for a generation, growth in most measures of labour costs has remained well disciplined for the past two years or more, after a mild acceleration earlier. Wages are rising quickly in some areas, but quite slowly in others. That is, relative wages are changing, adjusting to the forces at work on the economy, but without, so far at least, a serious inflation of the whole economy-wide cost structure. This looks like a text-book case of adjustment.That was a ringing endorsement of the industrial relations policy of this government, and I say in reply to the member for Stirling: there is a threat to that orderly and affordable growth in wages and that is the introduction of the Labor Party's industrial relations policy. Any return to centralised wage fixing will threaten the non-inflationary growth in wages in this country. It will threaten low unemployment. It will put pressure on inflation and thereby on interest rates, which, in the words of Econtech, the respected economic consultancy, will rise by 1.4 per cent and unemployment by 300,000.I read a few articles in the paper this morning and there was one that really caught my eye. It was an article written by the respected columnist Paul Kelly, who had this to say in his very last paragraph:But Labor's folly is industrial relations. This threatens the economic credentials of a Rudd government and the risk is lethal: higher interest rates. Just look to history.I say, 'Amen to that!'</DOC>

 - Lest there be any doubt, I would like the Leader of the Opposition to listen very carefully: John Howard can win this election and John Howard will win this election. John Howard will win this election because the people of Australia do not deserve to have somebody who does not have a policy position, who has no experience and who would be a patsy for the trade union movement in the prime ministership.</DOC>

 - Today's publication of the wage price index is good news for the economy, because what it showed was that the wage price index rose 1.1 per cent in the June quarter and four per cent through the year, which is actually down on the through-the-year result for the March quarter. Private sector wage costs increased 3.8 per cent through the year and public sector wage costs increased a little more at 4.3 per cent through the year.What this illustrates is that, notwithstanding record low unemployment - now at a 33-year low - wages continue to be moderate. The importance of that is this: on previous occasions when we have experienced either a terms of trade increase or a surge in employment, it has always set off wage inflation in this country. One of the main reasons wage inflation was set off in this country was that, under enterprise bargaining agreements, pattern bargaining and centralised wage fixation, we took wage settlements out of profitable areas of the economy and we put them right through the economy, which set off inflation.With the kind of industrial relations system we now have, we have been able to manage strong employment growth and a terms of trade increase, yet keep wage outcomes moderate. As Ken Henry, the Secretary of the Treasury, said in his speech last night:Today the Australian economy is as close to full employment as it has been for more than 30 years. At 4.3 per cent the unemployment rate is at a level that many would have thought was not achievable without unsustainable wage and price pressures.The IMF has said that improved industrial relations are in Australia's interests, the OECD has said it and the Reserve Bank governor has said it. I know of only one political movement in Australia that wants to roll back industrial relations reforms, and that is the Labor Party. They want to do it because Mr Rudd, the Leader of the Opposition, is a patsy for the trade union movement. He fronts up here for and on behalf of the trade union movement; he is a trade union member; most of his frontbench are trade union officials; he is funded by the trade union movement; and he is beholden to the trade union movement. Let us make this clear: if Australia rolls back industrial relations reform, if we do it in an economy where we have low unemployment, if we do it in an economy where we have strong terms of trade, we will be going back to the boom and bust of previous generations, interest rates will rise and people will lose their jobs. We do not want to go back to the boom and bust, high interest rate Labor way; we want to take this economy forward.</DOC>

 - I stand by the answer that I have just given. - No, I am sorry, if you had listened and not interjected you would have heard me say that I stand by the answer I have just given, which is this: not only do I believe John Howard can win the election in 2007; I believed that he could win it in 2005. I will tell you why. All he had to do was defeat the Labor Party. - I think most Australians would have agreed in 2005 that the Prime Minister was in a position to win the next election in 2005. I think probably the person who would have agreed with him most is the Leader of the Opposition himself, because he was at that time doing everything he could to get rid of the then Leader of the Opposition, the member for Brand, on the grounds that the member for Brand could never win an election. So if I have a sin, it is to have agreed with the Leader of the Opposition.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hasluck for his question. Since 1996 we have introduced laws that deliver more flexible workplace arrangements, and that has resulted in higher wages, improved productivity and more than two million new jobs. The Labor Party's plan for industrial relations, Forward with Fairness, was written by Greg Combet for the Leader of the Opposition. It is an alarming document that winds back not just the reforms of the Howard government but the reforms at the end of the Keating government as well. Whilst many people in this building seem to be focusing on the day-to-day sport of politics, every day another voice joins the chorus of concern about the Labor Party's plans to wind back the clock on industrial relations. Employers like Graham Kraehe of BlueScope Steel, Charlie Lenegan at Rio Tinto and today Wal King, the head of Leightons, which is the largest employer in the construction industry, are expressing dire concerns about the Labor Party's plans for workplace relations.It is not just employers. According to independent economic analysis, the Labor Party's plans would cost 300,000 jobs and increase interest rates by 1.4 per cent. The Governor of the Reserve Bank, Glenn Stevens, has expressed concerns about the effects a centralised workplace relations system would have; the Treasury's Ken Henry has said that retaining a flexible system is important; and today another independent economist, Chris Richardson from Access, said:On industrial relations I fear that Labor misjudges the risks involved. ... I think a slow-up in flexibility of the industrial system risks slower average growth and lower income growth, a smaller economic cake for Australia overall.'A smaller economic cake for Australia overall' as a result of the Labor Party's policies on industrial relations.The Leader of the Opposition is running a duplicitous and tricky campaign on industrial relations. The Labor Party policy Forward with Fairness received unanimous trade union support on the floor of the national conference in April. My colleagues will recall that. All the members of the Labor Party who were there will recall it - unanimous support on the floor of the conference. The day after, on the Insiders program, the Leader of the Opposition admitted that he did not know the detail of his own policy and said that he left the detail to his deputy. As the policy began to unravel over those two weeks, increasingly the Leader of the Opposition hung his own deputy out to dry on bargaining fees; on minimum standards; on Fair Work Australia - we remember that one; on the Building and Construction Commission; and on a range of other issues. As the policy started to unfold, the Leader of the Opposition started to walk away from his deputy. As late as Monday this week, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition said in a doorstop outside this building - and she should listen to this:Labor announced its policy Forward with Fairness in April. We believe in that policy, we got the balance right.So the Deputy Leader of the Opposition on Monday was recommitting the Labor Party to Forward with Fairness.It has been brought to our attention that there is movement at the station. We are hearing from major employers that the Leader of the Opposition is engaging in one-on-one discussions, ensuring that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is not in those discussions, in an attempt to wind back parts of their policy, particularly in relation to unfair dismissal laws and in relation to AWAs. We also understand that the Leader of the Opposition wants to announce some minor modifications to the Labor Party's industrial relations policy during the APEC conference in Sydney.Isn't this interesting? In the same week that we find out that the Labor Party leader is trying to undermine his own deputy, we also discover that the Labor Party is in fact sending out form letters to its own candidates, telling the union members that the Labor Party's policy is exactly the same as that of the ACTU. So, on the one hand, the Labor Party is trying to walk the line of the union movement, delivering everything the union bosses want, and, on the other hand, the Leader of the Opposition is engaging in one-on-one meetings with business leaders, trying to placate their concern - and they are concerned.The business campaign at the moment is an employer campaign, and - do you know what? - the biggest supporters of that employer campaign on TV are small business organisations. ACCI represents all those chambers of commerce out there. Little businesses in regional Queensland and small businesses in South Australia and Victoria are all putting their hands into their pockets to support this campaign, a campaign which we have not seen before in Australia, which covers small business and large business. Employer organisations are quite frankly scared of the implications of the Labor Party's industrial relations policy.All along, the Leader of the Opposition is engaging in deceit. He is deceiving his own deputy. He is deceiving Australian employers. He is deceiving Australian workers. No matter what he does and says, his policy is built, owned and operated for the union bosses, and that is bad for Australian workers.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, I have already answered it three times. The answer the fourth time is precisely the same. But I will take this opportunity to say, having answered the question the fourth time, that the Leader of the Opposition has another six questions to get through in question time. He will be desperately trying to ask this or a variation of this question for the next six as well because, if he ever got off this - and I see people nodding in the gallery as well - he might have to talk about jobs or interest rates. He might have to talk about his tax policy. Maybe he might even have to talk about Rosanna Harris. If we can get onto some substantive issues which the people of Australia care about then they will know that there is one side of politics that is interested in substance. It is the coalition. There is another side of politics which is interested in stunts, and that is none other than that of the Leader of the Opposition.</DOC>

 - Members of the House will be aware that on Monday the Leader of the Opposition announced what he said was a policy to reduce rentals. That was a policy to hold out to property developers a tax break of $150 a week, which for a renter paying $300 a week would deliver a reduction of $60. So it was a tax break of $150 a week for a rental break of $60 a week. It was a ratio of about three to one in favour of the developer. After the Labor Party machine put out an email - and I have a copy of the email - asking for a sympathetic person who could be used as a prop to illustrate this policy, the Labor Party found Rosanna Harris. The Leader of the Opposition, in one of his now all too frequent stunts, went out to the home of Rosanna Harris, where she was renting, and on camera asked this question: 'What is the rental on a place like this?' Ms Harris replied, 'Two hundred and sixty dollars a week.' Rudd continued, 'Two hundred and sixty dollars. So you're effectively going to get 50-plus bucks off each week.' That of course was entirely false. Rosanna Harris will get nothing under that policy because that policy only applies to new construction commencing in 2008. Either he did not understand his own policy or he misled Rosanna Harris. The ABC news carried footage of Mr Rudd saying to Rosanna Harris, 'If you're here on $260 then you're effectively going to get 50-plus bucks off each week.' After the cameras left and the Labor Party moved on - and now they will be on today's distraction - one of the television networks went back to the home of Rosanna Harris. -  - No, it was not the ABC; it was Channel 9. They said to Rosanna Harris, 'Now that you understand what the policy is, how do you feel about it?' Rosanna Harris said this on camera: 'It's one step forward and three steps back.' By the time you have taken one step forward and three steps back, you are hardly in front. She was also quoted as saying, 'It is bloody ridiculous,' after having learnt the truth about the Leader of the Opposition and his policy.Since we are all interested in the propositions of being totally upright, honest and forthright, presumably the Leader of the Opposition will be going back to see Rosanna Harris. Will he be going back to see Rosanna Harris? Will he be saying to Rosanna Harris, 'That promise that I made does not stand'? Will this Leader of the Opposition, who would have you believe that he is an upright purveyor of political truth, be going back to see Rosanna Harris? No, he will not be going back to see Rosanna Harris because, in the Leader of the Opposition's mind, Rosanna Harris is just a prop for his own ambition. Rosanna Harris was wheeled out on the ABC news. Rosanna Harris was made a false promise. Now Rosanna Harris has no further use for the Leader of the Opposition. He will not be going back to Rosanna Harris to tell her the truth. Rosanna Harris will not be getting anything from the Labor Party. Rosanna Harris has received just about all that she is ever going to receive from this Leader of the Opposition.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Riverina for her question. I shared an experience with the member for Riverina in opening a new rail bridge over the Murrumbidgee River at Wagga recently, and she knows full well the significant commitment the coalition government have made to proper infrastructure planning and investment. Under AusLink 1 we are in the process of investing $2.4 billion into the rail infrastructure to improve the freight task across Australia. Of course, the bridge over the Murrumbidgee River at Wagga was one of those investments that we had undertaken that the previous operators of that track, the New South Wales Labor government, had failed to invest in. More than that, and beyond AusLink 1, the member knows that we have committed $22.3 billion in AusLink 2 to continue that investment through to 2014. That will include road transport as well as further developments in rail infrastructure.Part of that infrastructure investment is obviously driving down unemployment. We are seeing unemployment at its lowest level for 33 years - 4.3 per cent - and that is being assisted by the major construction investment that we are making. We have created 2.1 million new jobs in the Australian economy since 1996, and that is all a part of the sound economic management that we have been delivering. But we are also delivering infrastructure that generates, creates and sustains a lot of jobs in the Australia economy.Most importantly, investment in improved efficiency in infrastructure flows right through to consumers. We have been having a debate in this country about the pressures on working families and the costs to households on a daily basis. One of the areas where improved infrastructure can help is in keeping down the pressure on the prices of consumer goods and groceries across Australia. We have announced recently that we are going to invest $15 million to go to the next stage of planning a new inland rail corridor through the centre of New South Wales between Melbourne and Brisbane to improve rail efficiency in Australia. One of the pieces of correspondence I received after that announcement is from none other than the new CEO of Woolworths, Mr Michael Luscombe. He said of this proposal of ours:That inland rail project is a fundamental infrastructure project to cater for the future growth of our nation. An efficient single-gauge, large capacity line that eliminates bypass delays and can link with well planned intermodal locations is a goal which our company would support any government commitment to. Without the investment in rail infrastructure, inefficiencies in the current alternatives will continue to grow and the ability to reinvest cost savings in retail prices will be diminished.In other words, he is saying that if we continue with our investment strategy he will keep downward pressure on retail prices of groceries because the freight task is going to become much more efficient. That comes from one of the major retailers in Australia, supporting what the government is doing with its forward-looking vision as far as rail infrastructure is concerned.There is an alternative view, and it comes from the Labor Party in New South Wales. We know how successful they have been at running rail in New South Wales! The Commonwealth has had to take over a 60-year lease on the main freight rail lines through New South Wales. We have had to take over a 60-year lease on the Hunter Valley coal lines to make them work properly and to ensure that there is investment in those lines. The Deputy Premier and the minister responsible in New South Wales, John Watkins, is vehemently opposing our proposal for inland rail. He said, 'What the Commonwealth is proposing now is a major spend for limited benefit.' He goes on to say that he wants that money spent in Sydney. Of course he does; it saves them from spending money on rail in Sydney. They have been a stunning success in running the commuter rail system in Sydney! They cannot deal with union control over the rail system in Sydney, and the interaction between the commuter system and the freight rail task in Sydney is exactly why that system is so clogged up.That was acknowledged in the Ernst and Young review that was done on the freight rail task, which recommended that we go ahead with an inland corridor. As is always the case, the state Labor government is blaming everybody else for what it failed to do, and saying that we should invest where it has failed to invest. Well, we are not going to do that. We will improve the corridors through Sydney; we will improve the southern Sydney freight line; and we will improve the North Coast freight line. But it will not be enough to absorb the growth in the freight task. As the Ernst and Young study said, we need this new corridor to absorb the growth into the future. This is our government planning and investing for the future, but all we get is criticism from the state Labor government. - If we have a look at federal Labor's platform on this there is no mention of it. The federal Labor platform commits Labor to working with the states on an extension of the interstate rail line. Clearly, Mr Watkins will tell the federal Labor Party to come and invest money in Sydney, to fix up where they have failed and to not plan and invest for the future, so that that is what the Leader of the Opposition will do. Whereas we have a futuristic vision for rail in Australia and for the rail task that will put downward pressure on grocery prices, as has been indicated by Michael Luscombe, we know that a Rudd led Labor government would be a puppet to the unions that are controlling the rail system in Sydney, a puppet to the unions across the rest of the country and, most importantly, and to the detriment of Australia, a puppet to the state Labor premiers.</DOC>

 - I do thank the member for Braddon for his question. Again, I congratulate him on leading the fight to stop the state Labor government's downgrading of the Mersey hospital in Tasmania. Let me say this: to the extent that the state Labor government's health plan involves upgrading one community's hospital by downgrading another community's hospital, it is a bad plan and it should be blocked. Bad plans by the state governments should be resisted by good local members like the member for Braddon.Let me say again that the people of Devonport, La Trobe, Kentish, Sheffield and Ulverstone deserve a hospital of their own. They should not be forced to go 60 kilometres up the road to gain access to acute hospital services. That is why the Howard government has put a plan in place to save the Mersey hospital. The Commonwealth will fund the hospital, the community will control the hospital and the hospital will deliver the same range of services that have been safely and effectively delivered at the hospital for many years. That is the Howard government's plan. And when it was announced, didn't all hell break loose! We had the Leader of the Opposition, no less, describing it as 'an absolutely rotten way to conduct the business of a federation'. We now know that he thinks the right way to conduct the business of a federation is to engage in secret negotiations with the state government, with a state government imposed Friday deadline - just the sort of thing he used to do when he was the Dr Death of Queensland. And, just like the only real job he has ever had, yet again he is taking instructions from the state premiers. - What's that, Mr Speaker? - As taking instructions from the state premiers? - Mr Speaker, it was a self-description, but in deference to you I withdraw it. As the Australian revealed today, the Leader of the Opposition now accepts that the state government's plan was in fact a betrayal of the people of the Mersey region; and the federal government intervention that was a travesty last week, it seems, is a necessity this week. Once again, on a major policy issue, we see the Leader of the Opposition practising followership, not leadership. This Leader of the Opposition only knows what to do because he sees this Prime Minister doing it first. He follows the ACTU on industrial relations and he follows the Prime Minister on just about everything else. The people of Australia are entitled to ask this question: what would the Leader of the Opposition do if he did not have a great Prime Minister to follow and echo? I tell you what he would be. He would be a kind of Manchurian candidate for the ACTU. But what the people of Australia are coming rapidly to conclude is that we need a leader, not a cipher, in the Lodge, and that is what we have got with this great Prime Minister, John Howard.</DOC>

 - What I can confirm is that in 17 years of politics I have had many conversations with journalists off the record. This is well known in Australia. I would be very, very happy if all of the off-the-record comments of the member for Lilley were put out in the public domain, and I challenge journalists to do that. -  - He is very quiet at this moment. Let's see if we can warm him up. He has got seven questions; he needs to ask another three about this issue before he can move to his censure. Let me give him a word of warning: you normally start off soft and come home strong, but you have started off a bit strong and you are coming home soft. So let me see if I can warm him up. I will warm him up by tabling the Australian of 20 November 2000, which carried an article headlined 'I paid poll rival, says Labor MP'. The article states:Labor frontbencher and Queensland power broker, Wayne Swan, has admitted -  - It is very relevant, because I am working him up to his crescendo for the censure. He was failing in his attack and I just want to work him up. I table the Australian.</DOC>

 - First of all, I thank the member for Boothby for his question. He is a very strong member and doing a very good job for the people of Boothby.The security situation in Iraq is difficult and I think that was clearly underlined by the grim news overnight of over 170 innocent people being killed by suicide bombings in trucks. Probably, but not certainly, the people responsible will have been al-Qaeda because the bulk of suicide bombings in Iraq are committed by al-Qaeda or al-Qaeda related organisations.We have a simple view and that is that people who do that sort of thing are simply beyond the pale. We would never want to be defeated by such people and such tactics, and we would never want to see the people of Iraq dominated or ruled by such people. That is why we take the view that there needs to be a continual commitment to security in Iraq until the Iraqi security forces are able to take care of security on their own without the likes of those committing the atrocities overnight being able to take over the security of the country. That is quite a simple proposition. That is not a political proposition; that is a policy proposition.The member for Barton, who is the opposition spokesman on foreign affairs, said on the World Today yesterday that the Iraqi government will have to step up and take charge of security or ultimately lose power. In other words, the Labor position is that all foreign troops should be withdrawn from Iraq and we will see how the Iraqi security forces go. If they cannot do the job, the terrorists and insurgents will take over the country. We think that is an irresponsible position because we believe it is important that the terrorists and insurgents are not able to take control of the country. It is as simple as that. I think most Iraqis, by the way, would agree with that proposition. I noticed the Labour leader saying something that I thought was very true. On 13 July, he said:In Iraq, we have duties to discharge and responsibilities to keep in support of the democratically elected government and in support of the explicit will of the international community.When I say 'Labour leader' I mean the British Labour leader, Gordon Brown. From our own Labor leader, the member for Griffith, we get - as I think the House knows only too well - policy contortions the like of which we have not seen in this House before. Listening to question time today reminds me of it. There is a stench of hypocrisy, if I could put it that way, wafting across to this side of the House. I remember, when Mark Latham said in March 2004 that Labor would withdraw troops by Christmas, the member for Griffith going around the press gallery - and people in the press gallery remember this - backgrounding and saying he did not agree with that policy. It is somewhat reminiscent of the comments by the Leader of the Opposition on 27 November 2006 when he said to Fran Kelly, the well-known ABC reporter:I've said repeatedly last week, and I've said it again this week, that I support Mr Beazley's leadership of the Labor Party. My position on that hasn't changed.Four days later there was a leadership challenge and up turns the member for Griffith challenging Mr Beazley, the member for Brand. My point being that, in the weeks leading up to that, he was constantly backgrounding people in the press gallery about how he wanted to knock off the member for Brand. He was undermining the member for Brand throughout that period. I do not think it sits comfortably for somebody like the member for Griffith, the Leader of the Opposition, to be running the sort of campaign he is running today, because people in the press gallery have seen him backgrounding against his colleagues, including his leader - two leaders, the member for Brand and Mark Latham - in the most vicious of ways, and we have heard of that backgrounding, so I suspect it would be best if we heard no more from the Leader of the Opposition on his hypocrisy. - </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Moreton for his question. The Howard government listens and responds to the concerns of local people in local communities. A fantastic example of this is the Investing in Our Schools program. Members on this side will recall that school communities - the parents, teachers and students - were concerned that their state government schools were being neglected by state governments in their failure to fund basic items like playground equipment, libraries and science equipment. These school communities raised the issues with federal members on this side of the House. The government listened and responded with the $1.2 billion Investing in Our Schools program. Nearly $830 million of that program has been invested in state government schools.I know the member for Moreton is very pleased with the outcome in his electorate, where over $3.3 million has been provided to 27 state government schools. Naturally, these school communities invite our local members along to view the projects -  -  - Naturally, these school communities invite their local members who have fought so hard for these schools along to their schools and want to show them the projects and also to raise with them their concerns about the continuing chronic neglect of their schools by state governments. Mr Speaker, what do you think the response would be from Queensland? After all, in Queensland the Howard government has invested a further $123 million in state government schools. What do you think the response of the Queensland government would be? Do you think it would have sent a note thanking the Prime Minister for this additional $123 million? No, the response from Premier Beattie - or should we call him Emperor Beattie, he who says he will reign for 100 years -  - Thank you, Treasurer - Emperor Beattie and his consort Rusty have now decreed that no federal member is allowed anywhere near a state government school without personal permission, which may or may not be provided; it can be withheld on a whim. That is sheer arrogance on the part of the Queensland government. The Queensland government is gagging our schools. We are investing in our schools; the Labor Party in Queensland is gagging our schools. - The member for Parramatta is warned. - The Leader of the Opposition did not have the courage to pull Emperor Beattie into line over the gagging of local councils. Show some backbone and pull Beattie into line for gagging our schools for political purposes.</DOC>

 - It brings to mind another statement from one of my esteemed colleagues. When I was at school, the schoolteacher said, 'Son, what you need is a brave heart.' -  - Thank you, Mr Speaker. You need a brave heart. What you need to do in Australian politics to show bravery is to put in place those policies that will change your country: things like balancing a budget - that takes bravery; things like paying off $96 billion of debt - that takes bravery; things like reforming the taxation system - that takes bravery; things like introducing a new tax system - that takes policy bravery; reforming industrial relations, establishing the Future Fund, establishing a higher education endowment fund - doing all of those things which will set up Australia for the great challenges of the future. But let me tell you, Mr Speaker, what does not take bravery in politics. What does not take bravery is when you sit around and oppose every policy and then try to claim credit when it is over. - I am taking this opportunity because -  - I am taking this opportunity because this is the second last question before they move the censure motion. The member for Lilley has one more question and then he will move the censure motion. I am taking the opportunity in answer to this question to talk about those things that require decisiveness in the interests of our country. I want to make the point to the people of Australia who are listening today that the Leader of the Opposition has not shown any interest in a single policy today. - I want to say this: what does not take any leadership in this parliament is to stand up here and oppose every change and then, when it is over, try and take credit for the result. We know this is not an economic conservative. We know this is a policy vacuum. The people of Australia will know there has not been a question today about anything that concerns them: a job, child care, the environment, interest rates. This has been an attempt to try and get through 10 questions whilst keeping off policy. There is one more before he moves his censure and we look forward to it.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kalgoorlie for his question and very strong commitment to the protection of Australia's borders. Beyond the economic fundamentals for Australian families, the first priority of the Australian government, the Howard government in particular, is the protection and defence of Australia. There is no higher priority, of course, than the protection of our borders. That means the protection of our gas and other resource platforms; making sure that people do not come here unlawfully and steal our fish; dealing with the people smugglers and drug smugglers; and making sure that our exclusive economic zone is protected.Last year in the budget, the Treasurer announced a $387 million increased investment for the protection of Australia's borders. Border Protection Command, the Royal Australian Navy, Australian Customs, the Australian Federal Police and other agencies make a concerted and coordinated effort to protect our borders. Only last Sunday, a vessel with 200 kilograms of illegally caught Australian fish on board was intercepted and destroyed by the Royal Australian Navy's HMAS Huon. Also, last year I requested the Chief of the Defence Force to strengthen the rules of engagement for the Royal Australian Navy. That means that they are now able to do a number of things, which range from firing across the bows with teargas towards foreign fishing vessels right through to directly firing upon those vessels - all of which have been used. In fact, in the last 12 months, we have had a 91 per cent reduction in sightings of foreign fishing vessels in Australia's exclusive economic zone. This is an extraordinary tribute not only to the determination of the Howard government to protect our borders but to the men and women who do it on our behalf.I am asked about alternative policies. The Australian Labor Party, for a number of years, has had a policy called Coastguard. The Minister for Foreign Affairs has coined it 'coast guide'. It has had four iterations. Firstly, the Australian Federal Police and Defence have expressed very strong reservations about a so-called coastguard. On 30 January 2001, the then Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police told the public accounts committee of the parliament: 'I would gain no comfort at all from those arrangements which would cause a division through the investigative focus in a very counterproductive way.' The Department of Defence said this to the same inquiry -  - 'The creation of a coastguard would have a detrimental effect -  - on Navy training and experience.' Of particular concern, I think, to Australians -  - is that the CFMEU journal, called Common Cause, in October and November 2001, said this about a so-called coastguard: 'The creation of an Australian coastguard would be manned by members of the Maritime Union.' Anybody who has watched Sea Patrol on Channel 9, which is an outstanding reflection of the work that is done by the Royal Australian Navy, needs to imagine what it would be like having Australia's borders protected by small boats of a coast guide, manned by people from the Maritime Union of Australia with a loudhailer, saying, 'You are not welcome. This is a picket line of the MUA.' That is not the way to protect Australia.It is even more disturbing because the member for Hunter, in one of the very few speeches he has attempted to give on defence this year, on 23 April at the National Security and Defence Election Series, was asked a question: 'Are you able to share any thoughts on a coastguard?' The answer was: 'There are some difficult administrative decisions to be made in implementing that policy and we won't be in a position to detail those, even pre-election, because it is too difficult.' The Australian Labor Party and the Leader of the Opposition, before they are in government, are putting up the white flag and saying that it is too difficult, too hard, to protect the borders of this country. As the Treasurer said earlier in question time, Australians need to ask themselves: 'If it is working well, why would you break it? Why would you put someone into government to be the Prime Minister of this country who has no policies, is a patsy for the union movement and, worse still, has no policy on the protection of our borders?'</DOC>

I work with the Prime Minister on clearing $96 billion of Labor debt. I work with the Prime Minister on introducing a new industrial relations system. I work with the Prime Minister on cleaning up Australia's waterfront. I work with the Prime Minister on increasing the position of the lower paid in Australia. I work with the Prime Minister on increasing real wages by 20 per cent. I work with the Prime Minister on increasing child care -  - I work with the Prime Minister on having a $500 pension bonus plan. I work with the Prime Minister on having a $500 self-funded retiree bonus. - I work with the Prime Minister in Australia's biggest defence build-up we have even seen in this country. I work with the Prime Minister and his team of talented ministers. Most of all, I am going to work with the Prime Minister in making sure that the worst opposition in Australian history never gets elected to be a government. I am especially going to work to make sure that somebody so clearly ill equipped to be Prime Minister never gets anywhere near that job. 
Opposition members - You! You! - I will work with the Prime Minister - The member for Denison then left the chamber. - I will work with the Prime Minister to make sure that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition never gets her hands on industrial relations. I will work with the Prime Minister to make sure the unions do not take over this country. Most of all, I will work with the Prime Minister to make sure we never have a Treasurer in this country who goes around giving money out in brown paper bags. Please move the censure. -  - </DOC>

 - That was a hard act to follow from the Treasurer. I say to the member for Bonner: thank you very much for the question. He has a very important role in this government in making sure that we continue to provide assistance to low-income people. That is one of the proud policies of this government. We have delivered not just to people on middle and low incomes but particularly to people in small business as well. In the honourable member's electorate, in the last three years 20,675 co-contribution payments worth a total of $21 million have been made to his low-income constituents.This is part of a $3 billion strategy to help people on low incomes get more money in their superannuation accounts. The problem is that not enough Australians know about the way in which we are helping people through their superannuation. The way in which the scheme works is that for people on low incomes we will, as a government, on behalf of taxpayers, contribute up to $1.50 per dollar that low-income people put into their superannuation funds. That makes a world of difference for people in their retirements. It makes a world of difference because of the effect of compounding, and there is a stark contrast in the way in which this government continues to provide assistance to low- and middle-income earners as opposed to that which sits today as an alternative.Australian people and the members of the public in the gallery today would ask themselves: why, in this question time, has the Australian Labor Party not taken the opportunity to ask one question about policy that this government has put in place to help Australian families in this country? The reason is very clear. At the last election, the Labor Party opposed lock, stock and barrel this government's co-contribution scheme. They opposed it because they had no understanding of how to help Australian families. The second point is that they oppose policy and they oppose good policy discussion in this country because they, as an alternative government, have in mind a policy which will see small business put people out of work.This week they have secretly put something on their website; there have been no press releases, no grand statements and no public statements by any of their shadow ministers. It has just appeared on their website. There has been no grand speech by the shadow Treasurer or the shadow Assistant Treasurer. It has just mysteriously appeared on their website. It says to Australian small business that they want to increase the contribution from nine per cent to 15 per cent and they want small businesses in this country to pay for at least a good part of it. They have not told Australian small businesses this, but it has appeared magically on their website and they are going to say to Australian small businesses, 'Not only are we going to slug you with a wind-back of the Work Choices legislation, not only are we going to have small businesses run by union thugs in this country, but we are going to increase the nine per cent contribution possibly to 11 or 13 or 15 per cent,' which will result in people in this country being put off by small business.The third point that needs to be made - and it needs to be made very clearly to Australian small business - is that the Labor Party, if they are elected at the next election, intend to have as part of their policy platform an obligation on businesses in this country to have a union backed fund as their default superannuation fund. That is what also mysteriously appeared on their website this week. Put into awards, they want the default position for employee superannuation in this country to be an industry fund, most of which are dominated by unions. If people in small business have any doubt about the stranglehold that the union movement has around the throat of the Leader of the Opposition, they need look no further than superannuation.</DOC>

 - That advice in the first instance would come to the Treasurer, and I know the Treasurer will have something to say about this matter shortly. Let me say to the Leader of the Opposition that it is very important at a time like this to reassert our very strong confidence in Australia's financial institutions.Australia is fortunate at this time that we have very strong, properly supervised and prudential financial institutions. We have two regulatory authorities, namely the Reserve Bank and APRA, both of which are run by people of the highest calibre. Clearly, a correction is taking place in world financial markets and that correction has been inspired by adverse developments in the American subprime mortgage market.What I can tell the Leader of the Opposition is that, if you compare like with like, the number of loans in Australia which are the equivalent of the subprime market in the United States is about one per cent as against some 15 per cent in the United States. Some of the commentary mistakenly likens the low-document loans of some of the financial intermediaries to the subprime loans in the United States. That is a misinterpretation of the situation. The subprime loans in the United States are far more risky and adventurous and, for that reason, they have caused very considerable difficulties.The markets at the moment are repricing credit. As a result of that, credit subject to being rolled over at frequent intervals will obviously incur a higher cost, and there will be some interest rate implications as a consequence of that. I draw the attention of the Leader of the Opposition to some of the more informed commentary that has been made on that matter.Let me finally say to the Leader of the Opposition that, as we deal as a nation with this situation, we are fortunate that we do have strong financial institutions. They are well regulated. We have regulators in whom we have great trust. The other great pillar of our financial security is of course our very strong budget position. It is as well at this time that we have a strong budget surplus. It is as well at this time that we have low levels of inflation. It is as well at this time that this country's credit ratings are very high around the world and we have a strong, balanced economy.As people examine the stock market and the developments in it, we should remember that the Australian stock market has enjoyed rises over recent years of unprecedented proportions and has performed in a very strong fashion compared with other stock markets. It is very important at a time like this that people not overreact. Adjustments do occur from time to time and there will be consequences of that. But if your fundamentals are strong and economic management is experienced, if economic management has seen this country through earlier adverse developments such as the Asian economic downturn and the aftermath of the terrorist attack on 11 September 2001, that same strong economic management will serve this nation well at the present time.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Deakin for his question. I can inform him that overnight the United States stock market suffered further falls of around 1½ per cent arising from the subprime crisis in the United States. Stock markets around the world have followed suit as a consequence and, as of a short time ago, the All Ordinaries was down some five per cent. That is a very severe fall and one of the largest falls that we have seen in the last decade.The consequence of that, however, is that the All Ordinaries is still some 17 per cent higher than its close at the end of 2005 and still around 35 per cent higher than its close in 2004. The news in the United States overnight concerned rumours that mortgage lender Countrywide Financial was having difficulty raising funds. The Australian financial system is not nearly as exposed to subprime or equivalent lending as that of the United States. In the United States, it is about 15 per cent of mortgages; in Australia, it is about one per cent.The financial implications for the Australian economy are therefore much less as a consequence of subprime or non-conforming loans. However, there are Australian originators that do raise their funds in the United States. They raise funds in the United States to on-lend to Australian borrowers. Those institutions will have more difficulty raising those funds, and they will be required to pay a premium for raising them. As a consequence, some of those loans could rise in Australia because risk is being repriced. For those borrowers who have taken a loan from some of those institutions, there could be a direct effect. This issue does not concern the Australian banking system. The Australian banking system is well capitalised. There is no reason for Australian banks to pass on any consequence of this subprime failure in the United States.Can I say that I have been in contact throughout the morning with the Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority. I have been in contact throughout the morning with the Reserve Bank of Australia. Our markets are functioning normally. There is liquidity in the markets. The arrangements that have been put in place are serving us well. One of the first things that the government did was to set up the Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority and, over the course of the last decade, it has discharged its duty very well indeed. Of course, this is not the first financial difficulty that the government has encountered. The Asian financial collapse of 1997 was certainly the biggest financial collapse of our lifetimes. As a consequence of that, we tested and strengthened our institutions, and they came through that crisis very strongly.In closing, I say that it is important to bear in mind the real economy. The real economy is growing strongly. Despite the drought, it is growing at 3.8 per cent. Employment growth is solid, with over 250,000 new jobs created over the last year. Wages growth continues to be strong and sustainable. The profit share of corporate Australia is at an all-time high and, in due course, stock prices will reflect those fundamentals. But this is a very significant development which is affecting Australian equity markets. It will affect Australian credit markets. It will affect some Australian borrowers. It will require very capable prudential arrangements, and it will require sensible economic management which focuses on the fundamentals. This is why we get the fundamentals of an economy strong: so that the economy can weather severe events which have a significant effect of this dimension.</DOC>

 - I preface my answer by observing that it is interesting that the Leader of the Opposition places a premium on experience. Can I say to the Leader of the Opposition that I will be speaking to the Indian Prime Minister later today about issues relating to the possible supply of uranium to that country, and I can inform the member that we would only supply uranium to India for peaceful purposes and if proper safeguards are in place, as we have with China. I think many Australians would find it rather strange, on reflection, that this country might sell uranium to China but not sell uranium to India.India does have a very good non-proliferation track record. It has indicated that it does not intend to join the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, so we think it worthwhile to find practical ways to bring it into the non-proliferation mainstream. Of course, one of the conditions that would be involved if sales were to take place would be the negotiation of inspection arrangements with the international agency, the IAEA. I remind the House that, when in office, the Labor Party had no difficulty with uranium sales to France before it joined the non-proliferation treaty in 1992.India is a major and rapidly growing emitter of greenhouse gases. And, unlike the doctrinaire, illogical position being taken by the Labor Party, we believe that uranium ought to be part of the solution and that nuclear power has to be part of the solution. India is the largest democracy in the world. It is a country that has stoically maintained its commitment to democracy since securing its independence from the United Kingdom. Sixty years ago yesterday, 15 August 1947, India received its independence. Over those 60 years, despite many challenges to democracy in that country, it has magnificently maintained it.India is an influential regional power and a potential strategic partner for Australia. In those circumstances, we think that it no longer makes sense under proper conditions, in proper circumstances and subject to proper safeguards for this country not to contemplate selling uranium to India in the same way that we have contemplated, under proper conditions, selling uranium to China. That is how the government intend to handle this matter. When, after my discussion with the Indian Prime Minister, I have further things to say to the Australian public, I will.</DOC>

 - I inform the member for Blair that the joint parties of the government met this morning and they have authorised the introduction of a bill into parliament as soon as possible to amend the Commonwealth Electoral Act. That bill will be entitled the Commonwealth Electoral Democratic Plebiscites Amendment Bill 2007. It will amend the Commonwealth Electoral Act to give effect to our commitment to assist local councils in holding plebiscites on amalgamations if they choose to do so. -  - I notice the static coming from the other side. Is this another contortion? I thought the Leader of the Opposition said he supported what I announced this morning, but maybe he is supporting it while allowing some of his friends to oppose it. That is a typical line. He is walking on both sides of the street.Our amendments will do two things: firstly, authorise the use of the electoral roll by the Australian Electoral Commission for the purposes of conducting the plebiscites or referenda; and, secondly and importantly, this bill will provide that a state or territory law has no effect if it imposes any penalties on or discriminates against anyone who is involved in an activity associated with the holding of a plebiscite or referendum. My message to the Premier of Queensland is: let your people speak. Let the people of Queensland have their say. Let the people of Queensland, if they wish, express their democratic opinion. - I will not express a view on whether I think individual amalgamations are good or bad, but I do express the view that it would be desirable for the Queensland Premier to abandon his jackboot tactics towards the councils of that state. This is the same Premier who rails against any attempt by the Commonwealth government to fill a gap left by a state service in the state of Queensland. In case anybody thinks that the Commonwealth government has no role, business or concern in relation to these matters, I tell the House that this financial year the Commonwealth will provide $403.5 million in general purpose and road funding to the councils of Queensland. That is more than 50 per cent of the amount the Queensland government claims that it will provide to local government in the state of Queensland. Any idea that we have no role, interest or concern in relation to local government in Queensland, that local government is entirely the responsibility of the Queensland government or that this is some kind of gratuitous intervention by the Commonwealth government is completely false.I want to place on record that I first raised this matter on the day of the last budget. On the day the budget was brought down, I spoke very strongly on behalf of many people who had been to Barcaldine and attended a great rally, ironically enough, near the Tree of Knowledge. Ironically enough, that is the birthplace of a political party that we are all very familiar with. I spoke very strongly in favour of the people of Queensland being able to speak on this issue. I also record that the very next day after I made my statement somebody who was in the electorate of Kennedy, accompanying the member for Kennedy to some meetings, put his hand up in a fairly tentative way and said that it would be a nice idea for the people of Queensland to be consulted about this issue. That person was none other than the Leader of the Opposition.</DOC>

 - I inform the member for Kingsford Smith that there is nothing under the present law to stop a local government body from holding a plebiscite and using the Australian Electoral Commission on a fee-for-service basis. I also inform the member who sits opposite that, unlike in Queensland where a law has gone through proposing specific council amalgamations, no specific proposals for a nuclear power plant exist anywhere in Australia. The member for Kingsford Smith knows this. It is perfectly open to either of the esteemed municipalities of Waverley - and the member will be very familiar with that municipality - or Randwick, if they so wish, to approach the Australian Electoral Commission on a fee-for-service basis. -  - It is very interesting. Here we go again. Let the House observe this. For the purpose of the state of Queensland, the Leader of the Opposition is saying, 'Yes, I am following John Howard on council amalgamations,' but he gets his environment spokesman, who comes from Sydney, to run a bit of interference on the other side. The old contortionist from Griffith - he cannot help himself. His predecessor as Labor leader was right: he was probably looking at those focus groups and those focus groups were saying, 'Well, look, on the one hand Beattie has really got you into trouble on this but, on the other hand, you don't want to sound as though you are against these amalgamations.' Let me say to the Leader of the Opposition that we have a very simple proposition - that is, let the people of Queensland speak. Don't try to gag them. 'Let my people speak,' is a very good injunction.</DOC>

In his electorate of Maranoa there was a welcome project under the Regional Partnerships program, which was a $200,000 grant to the Blackall Shire Council to assist with the establishment of the Blackall cattle spelling centre.These programs are very much needed in regional Australia. They are funded by the coalition Commonwealth government but they are delivered through local government because we believe in the fantastic role that local government has to play in the Australian system - and the structure in Australia - to deliver programs very efficiently to local communities. And local communities want their involvement as well. These projects help to drive economic growth in local areas because they are delivered by local government authorities.The member for Maranoa asked whether there were any other views. We know there are other views and they emanate from the Queensland Labor government, who believe that local government is not doing a good job and do not want to give the people in those areas a say in doing that. In fact, the Queensland Labor government want to completely emasculate local government in Queensland. That is up to them, but we believe that the people in those local government areas deserve to have a say in what happens in their communities and in what their elected representatives do. But emperor Beattie in Queensland has got a different view. Here is an Australian politician who believes that he will rule for another 100 years if he so wishes. How arrogant is this Premier - he is unbelievable. After last week, the federal government announced that we would provide the support of the AEC to local councils to seek the views of their constituents - to allow people to have their say and to exercise freedom of speech in Australia. He actually legislated to sack any council that dared to seek the assistance of the federal government to obtain the views of their ratepayers on amalgamations. It is just outrageous in this day and age.But today we saw where the real power in the Queensland Labor Party lies; it lies in the union movement. You only need look at the front page of the Australian to see power broker Bill Ludwig sending a very direct message to the Leader of the Opposition. But he has already sent a message to Labor candidates in Queensland. He said:I've sent the word out to the candidates. What the state Government has done is fair.'I have sent the word out to candidates and they have all gone back into their shells in Queensland.' They are not commenting on this. They are not interested in representing the interests of the people they purport to represent because Bill Ludwig has told them to shut up and he sent the message down here to the Leader of the Opposition to do the same thing. So we know where the power lies. It reminded me to go back and have a look in that great publication The Latham Diaries about the involvement of the union movement in the Labor Party. You do not even have to get inside it - you can read it on the cover. But inside it, on page 254, where the former leader of the Labor Party was trying to reform the involvement of the union movement in the Labor Party, he spoke about their participation. He said:I'm not opposed to unionism per se, just the idea of six union secretaries sitting around a Chinese restaurant table planning the future for everyone else.That is exactly what they do. He sort of pinged the Labor Party on that in saying that the unions own the Labor Party root and branch. If you read the article that quoted Bill Ludwig today, you can see that as clear as the nose on your face. The Leader of the Opposition cries a few crocodile tears about what is happening to local government in Queensland - he tries to walk both sides of the fence - but he has got form on this as well. When he was the head of the premiers department at the time that Wayne Goss was the Premier of Queensland, they did exactly the same thing to local government without any consultation at all. So the Leader of the Opposition has got form. We can now see exactly what is going on with the involvement of the union movement. I said this last week: it is about the unions' involvement in local government. They are going to sit on every committee in Queensland. This is proof positive that the Labor Party is totally owned and controlled by the union movement and any future Rudd Labor government would be owned and controlled by the union movement.</DOC>

 - The member for Gilmore is a magnificent representative. What is more, she lets her people speak - and her people speak very warmly of her representation. I just assure the member for Grayndler that I am quite certain the Australian people will have plenty of opportunity to express their views about nuclear power on a number of occasions in the future.But, while we are talking about nuclear power, I just happen to have come across a bit of paper, marked confidential, which is Professor Ross Garnaut's speech 'China's Economic Growth and the World Energy Balance' - uranium, energy et cetera. A question to Professor Garnaut reads:Ross, as China and India expand their energy needs, do you think, given the dangers inherent in relying too heavily on fossil fuel, that Australia has a moral imperative to sell uranium to - you know - large quantities to those two countries?He is instructive on that, then goes on to dwell on another matter and then says:Well, I think we've all got imperatives, moral and otherwise, to address greenhouse issues seriously. Uranium is part of the alternative to fossil fuels and I think we've got to think about these issues rationally.Can I say to the member for Grayndler, who puts himself forward as a serious member of the opposition interested -  -  - Doesn't he? Do I do him an injustice? No, I do not do him an injustice. He does put himself seriously forward. If you want to be treated seriously, you have to consider all of the alternatives. It is a denial of reality to pretend that you can have a comprehensive approach to the issue of global warming without considering at least the possibility that, when economic circumstances have altered sufficiently, nuclear power becomes part of the solution.We as a government are not going to indicate that a nuclear power station will go in one location or another. The Labor Party has spent all of this year trying to kid the Australian public that it believes in the market. If it really believes in the market, it must understand that decisions as to where nuclear power plants might be located in the future will not be decisions of the government; they will be decisions of commercial investment. Therefore, whether they are located in the magnificent Municipality of Randwick, the Shire of Shoalhaven, the Municipality of Waverley, the City of Ryde or, indeed, wherever you might go, it will be a matter of commercial decision making and not a decision of the government.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. This government has helped to build a fair and flexible workplace relations system - a fair system that has delivered higher real wages; more jobs; importantly, a framework upon which strike action can lawfully be taken, if necessary; and a flexible workplace relations system that responds to the needs of individual industries and ensures that wage increases in one sector do not flow through to other sectors where those wage increases are unjustified. A modern deregulated workplace relations system is absolutely crucial for economic stability in an uncertain time. That is one of the reasons why we got rid of the job-destroying unfair dismissal laws, why we have made Australian workplace agreements more flexible and why we have curbed the irresponsible behaviour of the unions.I am asked about risks. The greatest risk is the Labor Party getting into government. The greatest risk to the workplace relations system and its stability and contribution to the economy is the Labor Party's policy called Forward with Fairness being implemented. It is not just us saying this; it is virtually every business representative group - or perhaps I should say that it is every employer representative group, because without employers there are no employees and there are no employees without employers. Every representative employer group has slammed the Labor Party's policy.Public servants, such as the Governor of the Reserve Bank and the Secretary of the Treasury, have warned about the impact of rolling back our industrial relations scheme. Major business leaders such as Graham Kraehe, Charlie Leneghan and Wal King have warned of the dangers of the Labor Party's policy. Economists, such as Econtech, Access Economics and HSBC have warned of the dangers of the Labor Party's policy. Today, Terry McCrann and Paul Kelly again have warned of the dangers of the Labor Party's industrial relations policy.We continue to wait for the Labor Party's so-called transitional arrangements. When they released their policy in April, the reaction from all employer groups and a range of economic commentators was so fierce that suddenly they said they would have transitional arrangements to address business concerns. That is the equivalent of trying to turn mutton into lamb. They knew their policy was a dog, so they said, 'Well, we'll have some transitional arrangements to address the concerns out there.' We are interested in those transitional arrangements because, on the one hand, even as late as today, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, one of the key architects of Forward with Fairness, was on Radio National saying that their policy would not be changing. At the same time, later this afternoon, the Leader of the Opposition said that the policy was simply a framework and that more information would be coming out.This clearly illustrates the divide between the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the Opposition. We know that the Leader of the Opposition is running around town having one-on-one meetings with business groups, saying to them: 'Hey, listen, don't worry. I'm cutting Julia Gillard out of the loop; I'm cutting the deputy leader out of the loop. I know she's a bit of a concern, but don't worry. Let's talk about the transitional arrangements.'As the Treasurer says, some mothers do have them. He did not let me down. I thought for a minute that maybe the gap was closing between the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, but out came the member for Lilley with a doorstop today. Journalist: 'Has Julia Gillard been sidelined during negotiations with business about the IR policy?' The member for Swan: 'I don't think so. I'm not sure. She might have been sidelined; she might not have been sidelined. I don't really know what the Leader of the Opposition is up to.' This is the chief spokesperson for the Labor Party on economic policy and he is not even aware of the discussions going on between the Leader of the Opposition and business groups about the Labor Party's industrial relations policy. The only economic policy the Labor Party has released is a dog. It barks like a dog, it walks like a dog and it is full of fleas. Mr Speaker, do you know what the danger is? The danger is to the economy, because the Labor Party's industrial relations policy will take us back to a pre-1993 environment at a time when Australian cannot afford it.</DOC>

 - Firstly, there is certainly not a backlog of 100,000. That is complete rubbish. Secondly, isn't it interesting that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition comes to the dispatch box crying about how many of these Australian workplace agreements are backlogged. Yet the Leader of the Opposition says that only four per cent of the workforce are on AWAs, when, in fact, substantially more Australians are embracing Australian workplace agreements - nearly one million by the time of the next election. Even on my rudimentary calculations, that is a hell of a lot more than four per cent. - Thirdly, the Workplace Authority is responsible for applying the fairness test. In fact, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition should know that because she voted for it. I know she does not understand our laws, but she does not understand her own either. That is the disappointing part of it. Finally, if the Labor Party -  - Finally, if the Labor Party is so concerned about the Workplace Authority and the role it has, and is such a strong supporter of the role it has in checking every agreement, why does the Labor Party want to abolish the Workplace Authority? Under our policy, agreements are checked by an independent third party. Under the Labor Party there is no-one checking those individual contracts, especially those that pay 45c for all penalty rates.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Dobell for his question. As he knows, the government has now reduced the Labor debt of $96 billion in net terms to zero and the government is building a Future Fund to provision for future liabilities that will hit us as the population ages. This Future Fund has been lauded by the OECD and the IMF, which said:Australia's Future Fund also looks like a good model for other countries.The Future Fund will not work, however, if politicians are able to raid it for their own political advantage, because we will never have the opportunity to have long-term savings. This government is introducing legislation to make it explicit in the legislation of the Future Fund that no government will be able to direct it to invest in a particular company or to use the assets of the fund to support a particular activity. That will ensure that Labor's grubby attempt to get its hands on the Future Fund will be contrary to legislation.I expect that Labor will support this legislation because the member for Lilley has been demanding, for months if not years, that the Future Fund be a locked box. As he said on 6 November 2005:We have to make the Future Fund a locked box ... It's very important there is public confidence in the Future Fund and that it is a locked box that can't be raided by the National Party, Peter Costello or anybody else.We agree with that statement in its entirety. It should not be able to be raided by anybody, and so legislation is now coming into this House so that all members of parliament can vote as one to make sure that the Future Fund will not be raided for a particular company or a particular investment or for a particular activity.It is important at a time like this that there is one level of government which is saving. The Commonwealth government is saving, the business sector is borrowing heavily and the state sector is borrowing heavily. It is very important that not only the Commonwealth save but it put its Future Fund beyond the grip of inexperienced politicians who would destroy Australia's future prospects.In closing I want to add my welcome to Gareth Evans, who is in the gallery today. He was the first shadow Treasurer I ever faced in this parliament, and the best. I fear to tell him - and this will come as a surprise to him - since he was the shadow Treasurer they got WTG: worse than Gareth. The attempt by the current member for Lilley, undoubtedly the worst shadow Treasurer Australia has seen in the last decade -  - I know that is a big call! I made it after carefully considering it. I do not just make these things up. You are sitting next to one of the ones who was in line for that accolade. Raiding the Future Fund would be one of the worst things that could possibly be done for the Australian economy.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Macquarie for his question. There is no issue that bothers Australian parents more than the threat of illicit drug use. It represents one of the continuing social challenges to the wellbeing of young Australians, and anything that governments can do to help parents deal with this terrible problem they ought to do. I am very proud of the fact that since 1997 this government has spent more than $1.4 billion under its Tough on Drugs strategy across education, treatment and law enforcement measures.I am very pleased that over that 10-year period there has been a major change in community attitudes to the use of what used to be called soft drugs, like marijuana. Eight or nine years ago, attempts were made at a state parliamentary level on both sides of politics - both Labor and coalition - to decriminalise marijuana in the mistaken belief that marijuana was harmless. It is now realised by a growing number of Australians, particularly the parents of young people who have taken their lives in deep depression or because of a severe mental illness occasioned by marijuana abuse, that marijuana and other so-called soft drugs represent an enduring menace to the health of many thousands of young Australians.We are making progress in the war against drugs, but we have a long way to go. I say to those cynics who over the years have said it was all a waste of time and the answer was to legalise it all and the problem would go away, that they could not have been more mistaken. The problem will only get worse if you legalise it all because you are saying to the drug traffickers and you are saying to the parents of children desperately trying to break the habit that it is all too hard and you might as well give up. This government will never give up in the fight against drugs. We will never adopt a harm minimisation strategy; we will always maintain a zero tolerance approach. I am pleased to report that the percentage -  - I notice some people from the other side are interjecting. I notice the member for Denison is vigorously interjecting against a zero tolerance approach. That will be noted. But can I just tell the House that the percentage of the population -  - Another member is interjecting. The member for Fowler is now adding her voice. - The percentage of the population who have used an illicit drug in the past 12 months has dropped from a level of 22 per cent in 1998 to 15 per cent in 2004. The rate of cannabis use has fallen from an all-time high of 18 per cent in 1998 to 11 per cent in 2004. Heroin use dropped from 0.8 per cent of the community in 1998 to 0.2 per cent of the community in 2004. As a result of our strategy, hundreds of young Australians spent last Christmas with their parents who otherwise would have lost their lives or taken their lives as a result of heroin abuse.That is why we introduced a $150 million package of measures in April to deal with the challenge of psychostimulants, including ice. Included in these measures is a $32.9 million program for the third phase of the National Drugs Campaign, launched this morning by my colleague the Minister for Ageing. This is a very hard-hitting communication program. It contains graphic television advertisements that drive home the misery, the shame, the degradation, the loss of dignity, the loss of physical appearance and the loss of mental stability of people who engage in the use of illicit drugs. It has been developed in consultation with the expert reference group of the Australian National Council on Drugs. It is uncompromising. Some may be offended by it, but we make no apologies for the direct message that is communicated.There will be another booklet sent to parents. The one circulated in 2001 was extremely successful. Seventy-six per cent of parents who read the book reported that they found it easier to talk to their children about drugs after reading the book. Ninety-three per cent of 15- to 17-year-old children were willing to talk to their parents about drugs, and 92 per cent of young people said that parents could influence them not to use drugs. It is a campaign that will go on for years. In some senses it is a campaign without end. But it is a campaign that is yielding results, it is a campaign that is saving lives and it is a campaign based on the resolute belief of this government that you never surrender to the scourge of illicit drug taking.</DOC>

 - I am not ruling anything in or out on the run. The fairness test was introduced on 7 May. The Workplace Authority began full operations on 1 July. It is interesting that there has been an increased level of lodgements of Australian workplace agreements, collective agreements and union collective agreements - because you can have union collective agreements under Work Choices, which the Labor Party does not mention, of course. Under our legislation - which the Labor Party voted for - every agreement that is lodged that satisfies the requirements will be tested by the fairness test. That fairness test is applied by the Workplace Authority. The Workplace Authority, when it applies that test, accepts responsibility for whether the test is accurate or not, as an authority.If somehow the Deputy Leader of the Opposition thinks that she is scoring some massive political point on the fact that foreign workers are used - foreigners brought into Australia or foreigners already working in Australia - can I say that there are hospitals in Australia that are full of foreign nurses working in them, and there are hospitals in Australia that are full of foreign doctors working in them, who are providing essential services for Australians. I think that if she is in the business of dog whistling on this sort of thing then it will come back to bite her. The Workplace Authority is applying a test that was approved by this parliament. It is doing a fine job. Barbara Bennett is doing an excellent job for the people of Australia. Importantly, it illustrates comprehensively that our workplace relations reforms are being embraced by the Australian workplace.</DOC>

 - I do thank the member for Braddon for his question. It is very clear what is at stake here. On the one hand you have got the state government, which is planning to downgrade services at the Mersey hospital, and, on the other hand, you have got the Commonwealth government, which plans to preserve them, thanks to the advocacy of this great member for Braddon. Under the government's plan, the Commonwealth will fund the hospital, the community will control the hospital and the hospital will deliver the same range of services as have been safely and effectively delivered at this hospital for many years. The Commonwealth's plan is a $45 million a year addition to health services in Tasmania, and it will free up whatever the Tasmanian government is currently spending at the Mersey to improve services at other hospitals, such as Burnie and Launceston. This is a project of national significance. Having one level of government funding a hospital should end the blame game, and having a community trust controlling the hospital should stop or at least reduce the bureaucracy which so often strangles the delivery of public hospital services.In accordance with the implementation plan released on Tuesday, I can today announce that the Chairman of the Mersey Hospital Community Advisory Committee is the Hon. Neil Batt, a former Deputy Premier of Tasmania, a former National President of the Australian Labor Party and a former chairman of the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories. He is an outstanding Australian who will do a very good job and who ought to be treated with respect by members opposite and by the Tasmanian government. He will be assisted by a deputy chairman, the Hon. Ian Braid, who is currently the Mayor of Kentish - which is served by the Mersey hospital - and a former Tasmanian government minister. I am pleased to say that these gentlemen will begin their important work early next week.Yesterday the Leader of the Opposition belatedly accepted the need for federal intervention in the delivery of health services in north-western Tasmania. Today he floated his plan. According to the Hobart Mercury:Labor leader Kevin Rudd is likely to promise a new hospital at Ulverstone ...His long-term initiative ... is designed to fit in with the new Tasmanian Health Plan put in place by the State Labor government in May. - There is one massive problem with this: it denies the people of the Mersey region comprehensive general hospital services for the five to 10 years which it would take for any new hospital to be built. There is a choice facing this Leader of the Opposition. He can come back to the state government and prove that on this, as on so many other issues, he is a patsy for the Premier or he can back the Prime Minister and demonstrate yet again that there is no case to change the government of this country. The only game this Leader of the Opposition can play is follow the leader. The only question is: which leader will he follow now?</DOC>

 - I thank the Deputy Leader of the Opposition for reminding me of my having said in May of this year that we ought to apply a bit of Australian common sense. Let me apply a bit of Australian common sense and say that the question of whether somebody is applying Australian values or making a contribution to this country does not depend upon their place of birth. As somebody who represents an electorate where something like 35 per cent or more of people were born outside this country, I find the question quite offensive. Speaking on behalf of my constituents, let me say that I find any attempt to divide people according to where they were born quite offensive. - The member for Calwell then left the chamber. - I know the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is trying to appeal to the fact that we have these terrible foreigners here. That is what she is getting at - it really is - and I do not really think that should come into it.Moving on from the application of Australian common sense to which I referred a moment ago, if you have a proposition which says that you cannot lose your penalty rates or your overtime unless you receive compensation in return for it, that sounds like a lot of Australian common sense to me. It is Australian common sense that you would normally measure that compensation in monetary terms, but if the substitute for monetary terms is adequate, clear and visible you may in fact accept that in return. You may accept enhanced childcare facilities. You may accept particularly flexible working arrangements, depending upon the circumstances of the individual. I think these are common sense principles. They are principles that are understood by Australians. - The real contribution that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has made to the industrial relations debate in Australia is not any one of the questions she has asked me or any of the questions she has asked the minister but the interview she gave on Radio National this morning, when she reminded the small business community of Australia - those 1.9 million men and women in this country who are small business entrepreneurs - that if Labor wins the next election those old unfair dismissal laws will be back. They will be back without any conditions. They will be back in a way that will discourage small business from taking on more staff.We have seen a spectacular fall in unemployment. We have had a 29 per cent fall in the level of the long-term unemployed in this country over the last year. A major contribution to that has been the removal of Labor's old unfair dismissal laws. What has happened is that small businesses have said, 'Okay, I can now take on four or five new people and if one of them doesn't work out I can let that person go without facing a lawsuit and being told by some commission or bureaucrat to pay that person $30,000 or $40,000 a year to go away.' That is what used to happen before and that is what the member for Lalor wants to bring back.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Kingston for his question and his interest. Over the years Australia's links with foreigners have been very beneficial to this country. One job in five in Australia is created as a result of trade. That is links with foreigners. They are not all bad; they are okay. Twenty per cent of our GDP comes from exports, and our exports have doubled since 1996 to $210 billion. The point I make is that to achieve these sorts of things requires a foreign policy which builds close relations with key countries. We have never been apologetic for building a strong relationship with the United States of America, and with Japan, China, Indonesia and India. These five key relationships have been crucial to us. When things have got difficult in international economics those key relationships have been especially important to us. I think back to 1997-98 and the Asian economic crisis. Not only did Australia weather that crisis with very great distinction, if I can put it that way - and the Prime Minister and the Treasurer deserve great credit for the way Australia did weather that crisis - but also, importantly, we were able at that time to provide assistance to countries in Asia and help them get out of difficulties; countries such as Indonesia, Thailand and the Republic of Korea. The point I make is that strong bilateral relationships help you through difficult economic times, particularly with key countries.Today we have volatility and uncertainty in global financial markets. That is of concern. The Prime Minister and the Treasurer have spoken about that. It is yet another occasion when we need to use our strong relations to make sure that Australia can weather this storm as best it can, and I am sure we will.The simple point I make is this: to run a successful foreign policy in Australia, amongst other things you need to have strong relationships with five key countries, including: with the United States, a relationship that the Labor Party wishes to downgrade; with Japan - and the Labor Party, by the way, opposed the historic security agreement that we reached with Japan recently; and with China. The Leader of the Opposition has spoken highly of his relationship with China, which is, by the way, fine, and that he is going to make a great visit to China. - We await that visit, which was apparently a visit, as the Treasurer interjects, to solve global warming. When it comes to India, we have heard a bit of opposition over the last couple of days. A suggestion which will not be particularly -  - Yes, we will support them. A suggestion, by the way, that India is a country that cannot be trusted because it will proliferate nuclear weapons is not a suggestion that I suspect is welcome in New Delhi. Neither is it a fair criticism of the Indian government nor the Indian parliament, because India does not have a record for being a nuclear proliferator.The Labor Party wants to replace the strong relationships that this government has studiously built over the last 11 years with its curiously described notion of liberal multilateralism. Everything will have to be decided by the United Nations and by the General Assembly. You are basically saying that you will contract out our foreign policy and we will give the French, the Russians, the Chinese as well as the Americans and the British a veto - any one of them - over what we might want to do. When you are operating in a difficult international economic environment you need those strong relationships with key countries. I do not think the Secretary-General of the United Nations is going to be able to help deal with some of these very difficult international economic issues, even with the best will in the world and all the determination he can muster. This is a country that needs a common-sense and practical foreign policy and not some sort of head-in-the-air kind of theoretical foreign policy articulated by the Leader of the Opposition and built around some construct of liberal multilateralism - some concept from a textbook years old and very dusty.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member - I really sincerely do - for his question, because today is 16 August and that is the honourable member's first question to me in his capacity as the opposition spokesman on foreign affairs. Well done! I anticipated the question because the honourable member put out a press release yesterday saying exactly what he has just said in the question. My answer to the question is: if that is the definition of success -  -  - Oh! Very grown up, aren't you, over there in the Labor Party. Very grown up! If the Labor Party asks a question like that it deserves a serious answer. The member for Barton says: 'If that is a definition of success, what is a definition of failure?' - I will tell you what a definition of failure would be. A definition of failure would be to pull all troops out of Iraq and allow all of that country - with violence already throughout much of the country, particularly the Sunni triangle - to be inflamed in a massive and horrific civil war, to see hundreds of thousands of people killed in that conflict -  - and to see neighbouring countries drawn into that conflict as a result of the tensions and killing within Iraq itself - to see Iran, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Jordan and other countries drawn into the vortex of conflict in Iraq. Yes, if you want to know what the definition of failure is, that would be a definition of failure. I just make the point that, as far as I know, in key countries around the world there is only one major political party that supports that solution, and that is the Australian Labor Party. No matter how difficult the situation is in Iraq today, there are not too many people who join the Labor Party in thinking that a better policy would be just to wash your hands of the place, turn your backs on the people and allow them to kill each other on a scale that would make the present violence look minor. That would be a definition of failure.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Bass for his question and also congratulate him on his strong support for his constituents, particularly yesterday for the members of the Scottsdale community, who received some $6 million to ensure that over 350 jobs remain in that community. With that sort of community commitment, we will see the member for Bass returned to this place.One year ago this week, the Howard government unveiled a practical initiative to help Australian families cope with rising fuel prices. The eight-year LPG vehicle conversion scheme offers motorists $1,000 towards the costs of an LPG dedicated vehicle or $2,000 towards the costs of converting a vehicle to LPG. This initiative has seen an unprecedented response from the general public. After 12 months, the rate of inquiry on this scheme continues to be very strong. We have seen more than 70,000 motorists convert their vehicles to LPG and take advantage of the cheaper fuel option. That has seen this government step in behind those motorists with $139 million worth of support. In some cases, these motorists have recouped their part of the conversion costs in as little as four months, and those savings are ongoing, thus easing the pressure on family budgets.While this government has offered Australians tangible help on fuel prices, the members opposite have taken a very different approach. When it comes to addressing petrol prices, Labor promises - yet again - a more costly token bureaucracy with no guarantee of making any difference to the costs in family budgets. That is in stark contrast to the practical, on-the-ground assistance we see coming from this government and is more evidence of the lofty rhetoric from the Leader of the Opposition that has nothing to offer for Australian families.</DOC>

 - The APEC meeting in Sydney last week was a great success. It was a good meeting for Australia. It was a meeting that put the best aspects of our nation on display: our openness, our friendliness and our modernity. Any of those associated with it - and many people on both sides of the House were associated with the gathering and the attendant bilateral visits - would know what a great success it was.By far the most important statement to come out of the APEC meeting was the Sydney declaration, which, for the first time, joined China and the United States - the two major emitters of greenhouse gases - in a commitment to work towards an aspirational goal to contain the growth of greenhouse gas emissions. It also contained a quite specific commitment to a 25 per cent decrease in energy intensity within the APEC area by 2030 and a 20-million-hectare increase in forest cover by 2020. The APEC meeting also called on those nations who can make the biggest difference to work towards a successful outcome to the Doha Round and stressed the importance of reaching agreement on that multilateral trade approach. There were also some key decisions made regarding the institutional arrangements within APEC, including a policy support unit and increased budgetary contributions.There were a number of very important bilateral visits: from the President of the United States, the President of the Russian Federation - the first ever Russian head of state to visit Australia - the President of China and of course today a bilateral visit to Canberra from the Prime Minister of Canada. Overall, it was by far the most important international gathering held in this country. It was a great success, a reminder that the future of this country lies very much in the Asia-Pacific region and a thumping endorsement of the capacity of this country to deal productively, simultaneously and in a very positive fashion with the great trading and defence powers of the world - the United States and China - and also with our other neighbours in the region. Indeed, it was a meeting that did Australia proud and a meeting that did Sydney proud.I take this opportunity to thank all members of the APEC Taskforce, led by Mr Alan Henderson of my department, for their work. I thank the New South Wales government for its cooperation, and I congratulate the New South Wales Police on their handling of the security arrangements.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Braddon for his question. I can inform him that the national accounts showed that the Australian economy grew 0.9 per cent in the June quarter and 4.3 per cent through the year. This is very strong growth, and we should bear in mind that there is a sector of the Australian economy that is still doing it very tough - that is, the farm sector. In year average terms, GDP fell 19.2 per cent in 2006-07. The Australian economy is being led by investment, with new business investment up 13.3 per cent higher through the year, strong growth in engineering construction and strong growth in machinery and equipment. The outlook for business investment remains positive, with around $23 billion worth of engineering construction projects having been commenced but not yet completed.Members of the House will also note that productivity has increased by 1.2 per cent to be three per cent higher through the year. So we are now seeing what was expected. With an increased investment it takes time before you actually get production flowing from it. Now that we are starting to get production flowing from that investment, productivity is growing strongly. The labour force is also strong, with jobs being created in the month of August at around 1,000 new jobs a day. That is in net terms. After jobs that were lost, there was a net increase of about 1,000 a day in August and, over the last year, 270,000 new jobs.Members of the House will have heard the Canadian Prime Minister address us recently. He said in his speech:I know that Australia has been on a prosperous roll for a decade. I urge you, as I urge my countrymen, to never think that that happened by accident. It had everything to do with prudent policy choices, far-sighted leadership and careful fiscal management.An economy does not run itself, and any person who thinks that it does falls into the trap of threatening the management and the future of Australians right at the time when it would be most dangerous. As the Canadian Prime Minister said:I believe that one of the great dangers facing both of our countries today is complacency ... because ... our citizens have long forgotten, or have never experienced, economic recession. But we cannot take our continued prosperity for granted.The last recession we had in this country was in the early 1990s under the Labor government. We have managed to grow continuously since then but we cannot afford to be complacent, and any so-called leader who tells you that all of this happens without hard work and tough decisions is somebody who does not understand the Australian economy.</DOC>

 - I think the foreign minister and the minister for the environment do great things on behalf of Australia in relation to the environment. I have not seen the exact context of the foreign minister's statement but my recollection is that it was in the context of not having an action plan. I think he was referring to those who sit opposite. I know that the Labor Party are a bit disappointed that we actually reached agreement on the Sydney declaration. You could pick what they did a mile off. There they were, demanding the impossible so that they would be able to say, 'You fell short of what was needed.' It is an old political trick. The reality is that quite a lot of progress was made on getting the three major emitters to agree to the aspirational goal. It is not something that I believed all along was going to be achieved. I am delighted that it has been achieved.I think we will make further progress at the Washington meeting later this month, convened by President Bush. It will be chaired by the Secretary of State and Australia will be represented at that meeting at a ministerial level. That will take the thing further. There will be some further progress made at the Bali meeting. I note that the Leader of the Opposition was talking about full voting rights. Is he suggesting that the United States, which has not ratified the Kyoto protocol but will be attending the Bali meeting, will have no influence on the outcome? This is the sort of narrow, legalistic, bureaucratic approach that he has taken to these things. The truth is that in Sydney, for the first time ever, we got China, America and Russia to agree on something - and that is a real step forward.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Blair for his question and recognise the obvious interest that he has in this issue as we try to continue to expand the availability of health services in regional and rural Australia. State Labor governments across Australia are abrogating their responsibilities to the constituency in rural Australia as far as health services are concerned.One area I would identify to the member for Blair that has been of great assistance, particularly to smaller communities in regional Australia, is the government's Rural Medical Infrastructure Fund. It is not a large fund - $15 million - but it is helping small towns build walk-in, walk-out medical facilities. The member for Blair would be pleased to know that we have invested $165,000 from that fund for the Kilcoy Medical Centre to expand and to allow a second GP to operate and provide relief for the existing doctor in Kilcoy. It is a very important program, one that is delivering opportunities across Australia and one that some members opposite from time to time refer to as a bit of pork-barrelling or a bit of a boondoggle, as the member for Brand used to call it. I suggest they ask their colleagues the member for Lingiari and the member for Lyons whether they think it is a bit of pork-barrelling in some of the investments that have been made out of this fund in their electorates.Since 1996, under our policy, the number of rural and remote GPs has increased by more than 20 per cent. In the last three years it has increased by 10 per cent. We are actively addressing, through the proactive policies that the minister for health is putting in place, many of the challenging issues that exist in regional Australia. Policies such as the Bonded Medical Places Scheme to encourage doctors to move to rural areas, the 500 new medical school places in 2007, rising to 600 in 2010, and the HECS Reimbursement Scheme - which provides an incentive for rural practice across Aust-ralia - are all welcomed by constituents in rural and regional Australia.It comes as no surprise to members on this side of the House that the Labor Party continues to criticise programs like the RMIF. The Leader of the Opposition, when he released his health policy, mentioned rural health just once in 27 pages. Just once in 27 pages did he mention rural health. We all know that the Leader of the Opposition is going to be a patsy, a puppet, of the Labor premiers. They are neglecting rural health across Australia and he is going to do the same. We know that he is not strong enough to stand up to those premiers. Just like he has been very weak on unions, he has been very weak on the economy, weak on policy detail. When it comes to supporting the health needs of rural people, he will be weak again as he remains a patsy of the premiers across Australia.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Stirling for his question. On this side of the House - and I think we reflect the views of many Australians, after all the difficulties there have been in Iraq - we are heartened by the Petraeus and Crocker reports to the US congress. They paint an encouraging picture, but they do make the point that there is very hard work ahead. General Petraeus has reported that progress has been made on security and the military objectives of the surge are gradually being met. He said that attacks in Iraq are now at their lowest level since April 2006; since December 2006 civilian deaths have declined by 45 per cent and sectarian deaths are down by 55 per cent; and the Al-Qaeda operation in Al-Anbar, which was not only particularly dangerous in and of itself but also designed to provoke sectarian violence, has been substantially routed - not just as a result, General Petraeus says, of America's intervention but as a result of a change of view of local people in the Al-Anbar province.On the political challenges, Ambassador Crocker welcomed recent improvements, including the commitment of Iraqi leaders to work together on hard issues, but he also highlighted, interestingly enough, gains at grassroots and provincial government level. The point to add to this is that neither General Petraeus nor Ambassador Crocker are walking away from the scale of the ongoing challenges in Iraq. They are, of course, very significant. As General Petraeus said, there are no easy answers or quick solutions. But one thing General Petraeus did say - and, after all, I think we can safely assume he is a great authority on this issue and is not a political player of any kind - was that premature withdrawal will have devastating consequences and that political progress can happen only if sufficient security exists.Today is 11 September; it is the sixth anniversary of the dreadful events of 9/11. In our country we have made a big contribution to attacking and dealing with the problems of terrorism. We have had good success in South-East Asia. There are great challenges still in the Middle East. If a country like Australia were to adopt the policy of the Labor Party, which is essentially a defeatist policy on Iraq -  -  - Those opposite scoff, because a defeatist policy apparently does not include withdrawal and signalling withdrawal to terrorists. I think that is a defeatist policy. To signal a defeatist policy is to encourage our enemies in Iraq and in other places around the world.As I have said in this House once before, the simple fact is that it is very important that people think about what they wish for in Iraq. They may have a view about opinion polls, but they should think about what they wish for. On this side of the House, we wish for the success of democracy in Iraq. We wish for the success of the people of Iraq in their struggle against terrorism and against those who would incite sectarian conflict. That is what we wish for. The Labor Party oppose the surge - they said they were opposed to the surge - and I draw the Australian public's attention to the fact that the Labor Party, as these events have demonstrated, are not driven by good judgement and wisdom but driven by public relations companies and nothing more and nothing less.</DOC>

 - We do not have any proposal to draw down the forces in Iraq. Unlike the Labor Party, we do not propose to reduce Australia's forces in Iraq. So far as the Americans are concerned, I would remind the Leader of the Opposition that prior to the surge there were about 130,000 American combat troops in Iraq and the surge has added approximately 30,000 and, as I read Petraeus, he is talking about a possible phase down to the pre-surge levels. I remind the Leader of the Opposition that the force levels that Australia had prior to the surge are exactly the same as the force levels we now have. We think the battle group in southern Iraq is doing good work. We think it is a good thing to provide humanitarian assist-ance. We think it is a good thing to provide training. We think it is a good thing to provide backup security for the local forces. We think it is a bad thing to say to our closest ally in her hour of need in Iraq, 'We are going to partially walk away from you.' Because that really is what is happening. I know there are those opposite who tend to denigrate the role of our forces in Iraq. They say -  - Oh yes, they have. They have talked about them just being symbolically present. They have talked about them not doing very much at all. The reality is that they are doing good things for the people of Iraq and, while they continue to do good things for the people of Iraq, and until the Iraqi people can look after themselves, I believe they should stay. That is our policy. I know that when you ask Hawker Britton, 'Is it a popular policy?' they come back to you and say, 'No, it is not a popular policy,' and that of course is the basis on which the Leader of the Opposition has made his policy on Iraq. It is a Hawker Britton policy. It is not a Rudd-Gillard policy. I just say to the Leader of the Opposition that this is too serious a group of matters to be determined by a public relations firm; they ought to be determined by the national interest of our country.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dobell for his question. I thank him for all his support for better health services on the Central Coast, including the support that he has given to the North Wyong primary health care practice. I do note that since December 2003 the GP bulk-billing rate in Dobell has increased by 12 percentage points, thanks to the policies of the Howard government. In the June quarter, the GP bulk-billing rate increased to 78.2 per cent. This is the 14th consecutive quarterly increase in the bulk-billing rate. The overall bulk-billing rate - that is, for specialists and GPs - hit 73.4 per cent. That is an all-time record for bulk-billing in this country and it is 2.3 percentage points higher than in March 1996. Bulk-billing is not the be all and end all of Medicare, but it is important. It should be widely available, particularly for children and pensioners. I can advise the House that in the June quarter the bulk-billing rate for children under 16 was at a record, the bulk-billing rate for people over 65 was at a record and the bulk-billing rate for people in country areas was again at an all-time record, which is why the people of Australia know that the Howard government is clearly and indisputably the best friend that Medicare has ever had.But not everyone is the best friend that Medicare has ever had. Part of Strengthening Medicare was a new safety net. In 2006 the safety net benefited 1.5 million people to the tune of $270 million, but members opposite still want to get rid of it - they want to get rid of this safety net that stood to help 1½ million Australians. Three times the shadow minister was asked about the safety net; three times she said that Labor was 'considering its position'. I think I might have heard a cock crowing as she was doing that. Stop considering and start deciding - that is what the Australian people want of members opposite. The only political party in this parliament that is considering a cut to Medicare is the Australian Labor Party, which just goes to show that you cannot trust Labor with health.</DOC>

 - With respect to the member for Barton, I do not think an argument about precisely what General Petraeus says bears on the question of whether or not we have a proposal to wind down the forces. The reality is that whether it is 130,000 or 140,000, the force level the United States had in Iraq prior to the surge was something close to 100 times the forces that we have had in Iraq - that we had then and that we have now. It does not automatically follow that if there is a reduction in the United States force commitment to around the pre-surge level that mandates or requires some kind of commensurate reduction in Australian forces, particularly when, as the member will know, the battle group is about 550. The idea that you could have a proportionate reduction in that battle group and still retain a critical mass is absolutely absurd. The implication that in some way if they come down by X per cent, we at 1/100th of their commitment have to come down by the same amount is, from a military point of view, potentially dangerous and, from an exercise in logic point of view, completely unacceptable.Our position is this: we are not going to pull our forces out of Iraq while they continue to make a contribution to enabling the Iraqi people to look after themselves. We think it is good for the Iraqis that they are doing humanitarian work; we think it is good for the Iraqis that they are doing training; we think it is good for the Iraqis that they are providing security overwatch. We also think it is the right and decent thing for an ally to do, when clearly the United States is under pressure in Iraq, not to behave in a way that looks as though one of your closest allies is withdrawing some of its support. That is what the Labor Party is proposing. Cut out all the propaganda and all the PR, and what you are really proposing is something that will be represented to the world as a stepping back from the United States by one of her closest allies - namely, Australia. Any government I lead will not be part of that.</DOC>

 - I thank the hardworking member for Deakin for his question and note that he is an illustration of exactly what is at stake at the next election. We have someone who has real-life experience in the workplace, having worked in the private sector, and his Labor opponent running against him is an ETU official -  -  - That is right, like Dean Mighell - with no real-life experience. As the member for Deakin knows, 417,900 jobs have been created since we introduced our reforms to the workplace relations system - 417,000 jobs have been created since the introduction of Work Choices, 84 per cent of which are full-time jobs. The Labor Party predicted that real wages would fall with the introduction of Work Choices. In fact, there has been a three per cent increase in real wages - that is, after inflation - since the so-called industrial relations Armageddon, and unemployment is at its lowest rate for 33 years, since 1974, at around 4.3 per cent.During the break we had the Labor Party release Forward with Fairness mark 2. This is the Labor Party's second industrial relations policy - they could not get the first one right. They made such a hash of it that they had to have a second policy within six months. When they released the policy, isn't it interesting that not one credible person claimed that the Labor Party's industrial relations policy would create more jobs or deliver higher wages. There was not one person. Not even the Leader of the Opposition in announcing his policy claimed that the Labor Party's policy was going to be good for the economy and good for workers, delivering high real wages and more jobs. They did not claim that at all. Instead, what they are trying to do is swing their so-called pendulum back and putting it in odd places, as the Deputy Leader of the Opposition started to allude to.Ultimately we must ask ourselves: 'What is the motivation of the Labor Party in delivering a workplace relations policy that ultimately appeases the union bosses?' We have done a little bit of analysis of the Labor Party candidates in the upcoming federal election. We have found that over 50 per cent of the candidates that the Labor Party is fielding in existing Labor seats are ex-union officials; 95 per cent of their Senate candidates are ex-union officials or Labor Party staffers; and 70 per cent of their front bench are former union officials. Just to add to the rich mix of the Labor Party front bench, they are bringing in Bill Shorten, Greg Combet, Richard Marles, and our old mate Dougie Cameron! There are four union bosses coming into the Labor Party to enrich its ranks with diversity by expanding the union officialdom! The bottom line is this: does anyone really think that a Labor Party dominated by union bosses would ever have the courage to stand up to those union bosses in government? Does anyone really believe that? They can run all the rhetoric they want today, they can run all the rhetoric they want tomorrow, but ultimately you have to look within their own ranks and identify that the Labor Party is full of union bosses. They want a union run agenda and the only people that will benefit are the union bosses; the people that will pay the price are the workers of Australia.</DOC>

 - Because our policies have delivered higher real wages, more jobs and the lowest level of unemployment in 33 years. We wanted to remove the unfair dismissal laws from small business on 44 separate occasions and the Labor Party voted against it on each occasion. They would have you believe that suddenly they are converted and care about small business. We wanted to remove the unfair dismissal law from small business because, although we have always been concerned about people losing their jobs, we are more concerned about people getting jobs in the first place. The unfair dismissal law was one of the single greatest impediments to small business employing people, particularly those people who were long-term unemployed. It was the OECD, and not some paid-up union hack writing an academic report for the Labor Party, that said that the people who are most vulnerable in the community are the greatest beneficiaries of the removal of the unfair dismissal law from small business. That is because small business is now prepared to take a punt and employ someone with a chequered employment history or someone who has been out of work for a long period of time. AWAs have been around since 1996 and there has been no secret about the government's commitment to creating a flexible workplace environment that increases productivity and creates more jobs that deliver higher real wages.</DOC>

 - I assure the member for Cowper and all honourable members that APEC last week was an extraordinary success, perhaps the most successful APEC ever. Sydney and the other APEC cities around Australia certainly did our country proud in the way in which they hosted these events. There were a wide range of really important outcomes for the future of our country and, perhaps just as importantly, Australia's wonderful hospitality was shown off to the rest of the world and so were the tremendous opportunities we can offer.Australia is a trading nation and so APEC is particularly important to us. Eight out of our top 10 trading partners are APEC members and they account for around 70 per cent of our trade. The growth in trade within the APEC region has created a lot of jobs within Australia and provided tremendous opportunities for Australian industry. Our exporters are doing a sterling job, but they need a government that will continue to fight to liberalise the multilateral trade and investment environment and will make it easier for them to do business. Trade ministers and country leaders demonstrated their firm commitment to the Doha Round with a very strong statement committing the political will to achieving a successful outcome for those discussions.At the regional level there was further discussion about how we could cooperate amongst the 21 members of APEC to break down trade barriers. We spoke about the prospect of a free trade area within our own region as a long-term objective but set about dealing with practical measures which could achieve outcomes immediately. The report on strengthening regional economic integration identified more than 50 agreed actions and included a whole range of initiatives we can enact immediately to further break down barriers and reduce the cost of doing business for our trading companies.Through APEC, doing business has become a lot easier. Businesspeople from 20 APEC economies have priority immigration clearance through the APEC business card scheme. Business transaction costs were reduced by five per cent between 2002 and 2006 and we have committed ourselves to a further five per cent reduction by 2010. There will be codes of conduct for business and public officials. We agreed to fight corruption through improved legal cooperation, improved customs processes, common standards, paperless electronic systems and the like. APEC developed a very strong agenda of positive action to help build on our trading performance.Labor, which opposes bilateral trade deals and has never negotiated a bilateral trade deal, can contribute nothing to this kind of environment. We need a government that cares about building trading opportunities, opens up new markets, creates jobs and gives Australian business a chance to grow and prosper.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kalgoorlie for his question and for his ongoing support and promotion of resources not only in Western Australia but, in fact, right around Australia. Those of us on this side of the House have long recognised Australia's potential as an energy superpower. Last week at APEC our vision was confirmed by delivering record gains to the Australian resource sector. In the space of a few days, Australia secured, collectively, contracts worth in excess of $60 billion in export income. These unprecedented results included Australia's single largest export deal - a $45 billion agreement between Woodside and PetroChina to supply two to three million tonnes of LNG to China each year. As well, an agreement was signed between Shell and PetroChina to supply one million tonnes of LNG from the Gorgon field. Also, there was an agreement to allow the supply of Australian uranium for use in Russia's civil nuclear power industry which will be worth hundreds of millions of dollars and save millions and millions of tonnes of CO emissions.These contracts are tangible, practical outcomes from APEC. They underscore the high level of international confidence in Australia's resource sector, a confidence that has been richly earned through our reputation for reliability, security and efficiency. While those opposite continue to forecast the end of the resources boom and have in fact promised to abolish one of the key components of the resources boom's success - AWAs - the coalition is getting on with the job. We are working with industry, we are working with our trading partners and we are delivering new jobs, new investment and new opportunities for all Australians.</DOC>

 - I will start my answer to that question by confirming that the policy enunciated by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition provides for flexibility clauses in awards that will allow the trading away of penalty rates and overtime without any guarantee of compensation in return. - I have read it. That is your problem - I have read it. Work Choices was a big change and it was a very desirable change. It was the subject of a ferocious fear campaign by the unions. I notice that that ad that represents a board meeting with businessmen talking about penalty rates and overtime says that it is perfectly legal to take those away without anything in return. That is untrue. It is not legal to do that and it has not been legal to do that, as a result of the fairness test. That does not trouble the trade union movement of Australia. It does not trouble the Labor Party.What really matter are outcomes. If I look at the Australian labour market now and back when Work Choices was introduced, what do I find? I find that there are 370,000 more people in jobs. I find that 85 per cent of those additional 370,000 jobs are full time. I find that wages have risen and continue to rise, so much so that they are now 21 per cent higher in real terms - that is, 21 per cent above the rate of inflation. In other words, their wages have gone up with inflation and they have got 21 per cent on top of that since March 1996. The other thing I also find is that strikes are at their lowest level since 1913.If the Leader of the Opposition had watched my interview on The 7.30 Report last night, which apparently he did - or maybe Hawker Britton watched it and gave him a briefing paper on it - then he would have seen, or Hawker Britton would have seen, that I said that one of the goals of the coalition in the next term of government, if we are returned by the Australian people, is that for the first time we might be able to have a full employment economy.The Canadian Prime Minister mentioned at lunchtime today - or it might have been in his speech; I forget which - an anecdote involving one of my predecessors in this office, Joseph Benedict Chifley. A true Labor man was Joseph Benedict Chifley - he was a very true Labor man. - Yes, he tried to nationalise the banks. One of the things that Chifley made after the end of the Second World War was a full employment pledge to the workers of Australia. He believed in the social justice of full employment. It strikes me as passing strange that a party, one of whose former prime ministers, Ben Chifley, believed in full employment, is the party that has an industrial relations policy that is going to destroy the potential of this country to be a nation of full employment over the next three years.One of the great advantages of our policy has been to drive down unemployment. One of the consequences of the policy of the Leader of the Opposition would be that unemployment, so far from remaining at a 33-year low, will rise, because if you bring back the unfair dismissal laws you will rob small business of the incentive to take on more staff. That will have a deleterious effect on unemployment. Far from full employment being a social justice goal of the Australian Labor Party, it will be something that only a coalition government can deliver.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Wakefield for his question and his tireless work for the people of his community and, prior to that, his distinguished service in the Australian Army.No Australian should forget that, in 1942, the United States, in the Pacific, the Coral Sea and Guadalcanal, made significant sacrifices in support of Australian troops to secure the freedom of this country. Last week the Prime Minister and the President of the United States made two significant announcements and signed a document which will further enhance our alliance.The Australia-US alliance is essentially about capability. It is about making sure that Australia has access to the most technologically advanced and sophisticated military equipment. It is also about intelligence, and the exchanges between the US and Australia now are approaching seamlessness. It is about interoperability - making sure that every piece of equipment that we purchase for Australian troops can be used and works with that of the United States. The US and the alliance of course play a key role in the architecture of security in our region and for Australia.Over the last six months, the Australian government, and I and my department, have been negotiating with the United States on two issues. The Prime Minister last week, on our behalf, signed the US-Australia Defence Trade Cooperation Treaty. What this means, in plain language, is that, for the 300 small and medium enterprises in the defence industry here in Australia - which employ about 20,000 Australians and include Australian Aerospace, Tenix Aerospace, Raytheon and BAE Systems in the electorate of Wakefield, and which provide real jobs for real Australians - an enormous amount of the red tape and difficulty which they encounter in accessing US military technology will now be overcome. Last year we had about 2,700 licence applications for which the average delay was 90 days; 240,000 days were wasted last year by Australian companies trying to get access to US technology and military data. Now we will be able to cut through all of that.The other announcement which the Prime Minister made with the President is that we will increase the presence of the United States in terms of its military equipment and capability here in Australia. There will be an increased presence here of US military capability for disaster relief and humanitarian assistance. We will also work more closely on, and have an increased presence in, intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance, and we will also increase our joint training with the United States here in Australia.It is worth reminding the Australian community that the Leader of the Opposition is very fond of saying that he and his party believe very much in the Australia-US alliance. We may choose to accept that assertion at face value, but, prior to the 2004 election, the Australian National University conducted a scientific survey of Labor Party candidates. It was very interesting that 22 per cent - in other words, almost one in four - of members standing for election in 2004 for the Aust-ralian Labor Party believed that the United States was a threat to Australian security. Furthermore, only 40 per cent agreed with the proposition that the alliance was very important for Australia's security. No-one should forget that the people sitting on the other side behind the Leader of the Opposition are the same people who put Mr Latham out in front.It is absolutely essential that we, under any circumstances, do not move away from our alliance. This government believes in it. This government supports it. And the announcements made last week not only increase the security of our nation but also increase the security of Australian jobs.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I fully appreciate the hardship being caused to the horse industries of North Queensland, and elsewhere in New South Wales and Queensland, as the indefinite ban on the movement of horses continues. The core of the honourable member's question will be addressed by former High Court Judge Ian Callinan as he conducts his inquiry into the source of the equine influenza outbreak and makes an assessment of the quarantine system. All going well, tomorrow I will be introducing into the House the powers needed for him to subpoena persons and documents. He has signalled he will conduct public hearings on a needs basis. I will also be releasing the terms of reference which he has agreed upon.The honourable member has asked me a number of questions about state DPIs. I should simply say that I think they are doing brilliant work on the ground tracing the number of horses and identifying the infected premises in an attempt to contain and eradicate the infection. I cannot say the same for the state governments of New South Wales and Queensland which have done nothing in any way to mitigate the economic loss of thousands of businesses and individuals. - Mr Speaker, it is fascinating. They always jump to their feet to defend a Labor government that has done nothing to assist the industries or people within their borders. The New South Wales and Queensland governments earn hundreds of millions of dollars a year in gaming and waging revenue and not a cent has gone towards the affected people. I will conclude my answer by offering the honourable member a briefing. He has made a number of assumptions regarding vaccination and zoning that, respectfully, are not quite right. I would be very happy to talk to him before much longer.</DOC>

 - The Australian people face both challenges and choices. The challenge they face is to make sure that the prosperity generated over the last decade is not only preserved but expanded to the benefit of all of the Australian people. That will not be achieved by rolling back essential reforms. It will not be achieved by re-embracing a doctrine of higher unemployment. I spoke yesterday of the possibility that this nation could become, in the next three years, a full employment society. The only threat to this country becoming a full employment society is the election of a Rudd led Labor government. That is the only threat. I would say to the Leader of the Opposition: yes, this country does face challenges; they are the challenges that have been met over the last decade by the government I lead and they will be met over the years ahead by the coalition if it is re-elected. The Australian people will face a choice. They will decide, first and foremost, their future and the future of their country. In the course of making that decision they will decide not only my future but the future of the Leader of the Opposition.</DOC>

 - It remains the goal of this government, and it remains within the capacity of this government if it is re-elected, to keep the Australian economy strong and growing. Only the government has a plan to create a full-employment Australian society. Only the government has a plan to deal long term with the great water challenges of this nation. Only the government has a plan to deal in a balanced and sustainable way with the environmental challenges that this country has. Only the government has the capacity to deliver in the future what we have delivered in the past - that is, continued reductions in the taxation burden within the Australian community.There is a threat to the implementation of those goals and that threat lies in the election of a government that would re-embrace higher unemployment. I never thought I would face a Labor leader who believed in higher unemployment. There was once a time when the proudest boast of Labor was that it believed in the workers of Australia and in delivering to them the opportunity that if they wanted a job they could have a job. That is what Ben Chifley believed in; that is what John Curtin believed in; that is what Bob Hawke believed in. But plainly it is not what the current Leader of the Opposition believes in, because the Leader of the Opposition wants to re-embrace higher unemployment by bringing back the unfair dismissal law burden on the backs of Australian small business.We have seen a massive decline in unemployment in this country. I remind the Leader of the Opposition that since March 2006, when the industrial relations changes were made, 417,000 new jobs have been created. Ninety-one per cent of them have been full-time jobs. That is partly due - I do not say 'totally due' - to the removal of the unfair dismissal laws. They are laws that would be brought back by the Labor Party. Bringing them back would lead to higher levels of unemployment in the Australian community.</DOC>

 - Yesterday the Leader of the Opposition asked me to name the election date. Today he has asked me another question and I remind him of part of the answer I gave to an earlier question - that is, when the election comes along, the Australian people will decide first and foremost their future, because their future is more important than mine or more important than the future of the Leader of the Opposition. But in the process of deciding their future they will also decide the future of the Leader of the Opposition and my future as well. I might say to the Leader of the Opposition that after what I have seen from Peter Beattie and Steve Bracks, I would have thought that time-specific pledges about how long people are going to serve are at tatty discount in Australian politics.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Kingston for his question - the best member for Kingston Australia has ever had. In the years to come I hope that he will continue to give the people of Kingston the first-class representation that they all deserve. This morning the Westpac Melbourne Institute consumer sentiment survey rose by 4.2 per cent for the month of September. This comes after a fall in August on the back of movements in monetary policy. But today the recovery in that sentiment index takes sentiment to a very high level, up 14.3 per cent over the last year. This is a very strong result, and it shows that consumers are confident in Australia with consumer sentiment above the long-term average. One thing that is driving strong consumer sentiment in Australia is jobs. This is the lowest rate of unemployment we have seen in Australia for a generation. It illustrates that good strong economic policy gives people an opportunity in life. That is why it is important that good strong economic policy continue. Also, business profitability is strong, investment is strong and the Australian economy continues to grow.I want to make the point that the government is now in the process of investing for Australia's future. We have our Future Fund, which is investing for the long-term ageing of the population; we have the Higher Education Endowment Fund, which is going to build first-class facilities in first-class institutions; we have the health and medical infrastructure fund, which is going to bring to Australia cutting edge technology and facilities; and we have the largest investment in road and rail under AusLink that we have ever had in Australian history. We are now beginning to save for the future. It was different under Labor. Under Labor all we did was drive future generations into debt - a form of financial child abuse where you run up debts against future generations that future generations have to service.Let me complete my answer by referring to a report by the Comptroller General of the United States of America. He said:America is on a path toward an explosion of debt and that debt threatens our country, our children's and our grandchildren's futures.He said:Other countries with similar challenges have already acted. The best two examples are Australia and New Zealand. Like the United States, they have ageing population. Unlike the United States, these two countries have stepped up to the plate and dealt with some of their serious long-term challenges.That is the Comptroller General of the United States of America commenting on Australia. We are stepping up to the plate, we are dealing with our problems and we are investing for generations of future Australians.</DOC>

But here is a question: does the member for Lilley think that Kevin Rudd is the best person to lead Labor into the next election? We can answer this question, because when the time came for Mr Kevin Rudd to run for the leadership of the Labor Party, which rooster voted against him? Me thinks the rooster crowed the wrong way! - I was referring to the member for Lilley when I used the word 'rooster'. It was not the Leader of the Opposition.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Cowper for his question. The member for Cowper, representing the particular area of the mid north coast of New South Wales that he does, would recognise that regional communities in some parts of Australia are experiencing growth as a result of the sea change and tree change phenomenon. Other areas are experiencing growth because of the economic prosperity in Australia: for example, those regions that contain emerging mining industries. That growth is putting significant pressure on social, economic and community infrastructure across Australia. We recognise that. Part of the coalition government's plan for regional Australia is to try to assist those communities in accommodating the growth and the pressure that is building on community infrastructure.I have announced today that we will establish a new Growing Regions program, which will invest in major projects that help communities respond to the pressure of change, the changes in demography across Australia and the changing economic circumstances. The government will invest $200 million in the program over four years for major projects that help regions address issues like the effects of rapid growth, structural change, population migration and the ageing of the population in particular regions across Australia. Businesses, local governments, institutions and communities will be able to apply for funding of between $1 million and $3 million per project in growing regions. Projects could involve the development or expansion of major businesses or they could involve the development of smarter ways of delivering services to communities.By contrast, the member for Cowper asked: are there any alternatives? We know what the Leader of the Opposition thinks about regional Australia. In an interview that he did with the Daily Telegraph on 19 December last year, he insinuated that road funding that we were delivering to regional Australia was favouring the bush instead of cities. He does not want to provide any funding for the bush. He does not want to provide any funding for the regions across Australia. There is proof positive in his form in a previous government of what he has done to regional Australia and of the absolute disregard the Leader of the Opposition has for regional Australia. Anyone who lived in Queensland during the time of the Goss government would remember what happened. When the Leader of the Opposition was the right-hand man for Premier Goss, he disbanded 96 local ambulance boards and 81 community fire boards. He forcibly amalgamated councils - does that sound familiar? He sacked 600 people from the department of primary industries in Queensland and he replaced local hospital boards with great state government bureaucracies.Labor has no plan for working families in regional Australia. We are adding to our policy initiatives that respond to the pressures of the time, particularly as the regions within our nation change and as our country grows. Under the new Growing Regions program, the coalition government will help local communities deliver the services that they are entitled to.</DOC>

 - The Australian people will decide who is the next Prime Minister of this country and, in the process of deciding their future, they will decide the future of the Leader of the Opposition and my future. Let me say again: particularly a Queensland member of parliament from the Labor Party has a bit of a nerve trying to extract time-specific pledges from me, given what Peter Beattie did. Peter Beattie misled the people of Queensland. Let me remind the member for Lilley what Peter Beattie said on 15 August 2006. - What is sauce for the goose ought to be sauce for the gander or indeed the rooster. - What he had to say is this:Kerry, my intention is to stay -  - What I am pointing out to the member for Lilley is that his friend Mr Beattie has dishonoured time-specific commitments. Unlike Mr Beattie and Mr Bracks, I will not mislead the Australian people.</DOC>

 - First, can I thank the honourable member for Hughes for her question and say how much I appreciate her interest in the issue, particularly her interest in APEC. I do not think there is any doubt that the APEC meeting in Sydney was one of the most successful APEC meetings ever. It was an extraordinary success, and that is certainly the feedback I have had from the delegations that were there.At the centre of that APEC meeting was the Sydney APEC Leaders Declaration on Climate Change, Energy Security and Clean Development, which was the first time that developed and developing countries together have agreed to a commitment to stabilise and eventually reduce CO2 emissions. That was an extraordinary feat of diplomacy. The House might be interested to know that, at the outset of the week, a majority of economies were opposed to the Sydney climate change draft and, through the course of that week, we gradually managed to negotiate a successful outcome. How could we do that? We were able to do that because, amongst other things, we have very strong relations with two key countries: the United States of America and China. Because of the strong position we have in dealing with those countries, we were able to get a good outcome. This was a commitment not just with a bold agenda but with an agenda for practical action to reduce energy intensity - that is, to increase energy efficiency, if you like - by at least 25 per cent by 2030 and to increase forest cover by 20 million hectares by 2020, storing 1.4 billion tonnes, or 11 per cent, of annual global carbon emissions.This may not be of any interest to the opposition, which apparently thinks this is not important, but this is the difference between the government and the opposition. We are able to leverage our very strong relations with countries like the United States, China, Japan and so on to achieve real and practical results. The Leader of the Opposition, in his speech to the Labor Party national conference on 27 April, called climate change 'the great moral, economic and environmental challenge of our time'. Last week, the Leader of the Opposition had 45 minutes with the world's most powerful person, the President of the United States of America. During a 45-minute meeting with the world's most powerful person, you would expect there to be a lively discussion about the great moral, economic and environmental challenge of our time. If the Leader of the Opposition were doing not just what PR companies told him to do but what his heart told him was a great challenge that we had to deal with, wouldn't he use 45 minutes with the President of the United States to make that case? Wouldn't he spend time urging the President of the United States to ratify the Kyoto protocol, which is so much the heart of the Labor Party's position?If there has been anything revealing in recent times about the Leader of the Opposition and his insincerity and weakness, it is his failure to discuss an issue that he thought was the most important moral, economic and environmental challenge of our time with the President of the United States in a 45-minute period. It may be that he was too frightened to argue with the President. He may not have had the courage to do that. But if that is not the case then I think the Australian people deserve an explanation.</DOC>

 - I certainly thank the member for Braddon for his question. I can inform him and the House that the Howard government wants to make the Mersey hospital in Tasmania a Commonwealth funded, community controlled public hospital because the state government is proposing to withdraw acute services from that hospital and, in so doing, leave a catchment of up to 70,000 people without general hospital services. Let me say for the benefit of all members of this House, including the people who are chattering away and the person who is turning his back: taking over a public hospital is not an easy thing. There are the financial arrangements to be considered, there is the future of staff to be considered, but most of all there is the continuity of care of patients which needs to be considered, because that cannot be interrupted for a single hour if people are serious about health policy and health service delivery.I can inform the House that, after a somewhat rocky start, discussions between the Commonwealth and the state of Tasmania are now progressing well and a binding agreement should be signed within a week. I was interested to note that the Tasmanian government is already spending some of the extra money that it will receive as a result of this agreement. Taking over one hospital is no walk in the park. Taking over the 750 public hospitals of Australia would be the largest financial and logistical undertaking this country has ever seen, involving billions of dollars in assets, $24 billion a year in recurrent funding and the futures of hundreds of thousands of staff, including 200,000 nurses. If members opposite are elected, this deal will be in the hands of the member for Griffith, whose previous experience is of closing 2,200 public hospital beds in Queensland, thereby earning him the nickname 'Dr Death'. - I will withdraw that if it is an offensive term, but it cannot alter the reality. I say to the Leader of the Opposition, who seems to be attending now to the proceedings of the parliament: you cannot promise to take over 750 public hospitals and say, 'Trust me; it will all come right on the night.' You have to answer some specific questions. Who will be in charge of this health reform commission that will make recommendations about the process? What precise criteria will the state governments have to meet in order to avoid having their hospitals taken over? - How will the Commonwealth claw back the $14 billion -  - every year that it will need to run public hospitals? What legal power does the Commonwealth have to coerce the states, as it will assuredly need to do when they refuse to cooperate? Most importantly, how much money does the Leader of the Opposition expect to save by ending duplication? How much money will he save and how many staff does he expect will be made redundant? These are serious questions and the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow minister cannot be taken seriously unless they answer them.They were asked some of these questions the other day by Rhianna King of the West Australian newspaper, who said in her subsequent report of the member for Lalor:She was unable to answer the questions, with a spokesman saying only that a range of factors would be considered.Labor was also unable to say what would happen if some States signed up to the plan but others refused. And there were no details on the plan for regional and local authorities to manage hospitals in the event of a Federal takeover, with a spokesman saying only that the landscape would be reexamined in 2009.The Australian people deserve better than that. They are talking about 750 institutions vital to the health and welfare of the Australian people. These are real hospitals, serving real patients, employing real staff, and those people need some answers. Maybe they can contract Barry Jones to provide a few answers, because 'noodle nation' will be a model of simplicity compared to the complexity of trying to take over 750 public hospitals. I know what I am talking about because I have thought this through in a way that members opposite have not. Unless they can come up with the detail on how this might happen, they will be exposed as complete and utter frauds, phoneys and charlatans who are more interested in a headline than a health service.</DOC>

 - I am delighted that the good name and reputation of the member for Moreton has been established as a result of the announcement made by the Director of Public Prosecutions. I extend the same expression of delight to the member for Bonner, a person of complete integrity and great decency. Both of these gentlemen bring to their constituencies of Moreton and Bonner, in the city of Brisbane, high-quality, energetic and far-sighted representation. I take the opportunity afforded to me by the member for Brisbane to say those things about them.I would point out to the member for Brisbane that in relation to this matter I do not intend to take a leaf out of the book of the Queensland Premier and use parliamentary privilege to make prejudicial comments on charges -  - When the possibility of these investigations was first raised, no charges had been laid. Yet the Queensland Premier, under parliamentary privilege, made an attack on the character of the member for Moreton, the member for Bowman, the member for Bonner and the entire Queensland division of the Liberal Party. I remember what Peter Beattie did. He got up and traduced, under parliamentary privilege, the reputation of my three colleagues and the reputation of my party in Queensland. - In those circumstances, the member for Brisbane has the nerve to ask me to rebuke a man who has waited for six months to have this matter dealt with - you have an absolute nerve to ask a question like that. - Let me make this clear: at no stage while these investigations were going on did I use parliamentary privilege to say anything about the matter. In fact, I told all of my colleagues that under no circumstances should any pressure be placed on the Australian Federal Police. - I told my colleagues that the Federal Police should be allowed to carry out this investigation without let or hindrance from me or anybody in the federal government. While I was doing that, your mate Beattie was using parliamentary privilege to try and destroy the reputation of my colleagues. And you have the nerve to ask me to repudiate my colleagues. It shows the standards of the Queensland Labor Party. - </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Grey for his question. I know that he welcomes the Abrams tanks and the 1,000 Australian diggers in his electorate at the moment, training at the Cultana range. Yesterday marked the sixth anniversary of the heinous attacks by al-Qaeda, driven by Osama bin Laden, on innocent civilians in New York and Washington, where more than 3,000 people lost their lives, including Australians. The ongoing struggle in Iraq - which principally is to bring security and peace to the people of Iraq, supported by the United Nations Security Council; to see that the Iraqi security forces are in a position to provide for that country's own security; and for Australia to stand by its key allies, the United States, Britain and other countries - continues.Two weeks ago today I was in Baghdad, and General Petraeus briefed me and the Chief of the Australian Defence Force on the progress that is being made with the surge in Baghdad. As has been reported in testimony to the joint sitting of the US congress and Senate, notwithstanding continuing violence there has been significant progress over the last six months in Iraq. Attack levels are the lowest they have been in 18 months. We have seen a 50 per cent reduction in ethno-sectarian violence across the country and an 80 per cent reduction in Bagdad. In Anbar province, for example, whereas last year al-Qaeda conducted in one month 1,300 attacks on innocent Iraqis, in this past month there have been 200. Similarly, in Ramadi, Baquba, Baghdad and other areas of Iraq there has been a significant improvement, but there is a long way to go.Australia currently has just under 1,700 troops across the theatre of Iraq. That includes a battle group which is in Tallil to provide very important training to the Iraqi security forces in Dhi Qar and Al Muthanna provinces and also to provide backup security to the Iraqis themselves, who so far have performed extraordinarily well. Australia has trained some 16,000 troops at this stage. In addition to that, our troops are engaged in very important engineering projects, including schools, hospitals, bridges and roads. On the advice of the Chief of the Australian Defence Force in September last year and the advice of the Chief of Army, Lieutenant General Peter Leahy, the government was advised by me that, in order to provide an acceptable level of risk to our forces, that battle group should be increased in size. On the advice of our military advisers, in order to protect our own troops we increased the size of that group by 38 soldiers and we added another four Bushmaster infantry mobility vehicles to the battle group. In other words, the advice I was given by our military commanders was that in order for our diggers to do their job they needed more people and they needed more equipment. We provided that.I am asked about alternative policies. On 5 September this year the Leader of the Opposition said this in a doorstop interview in north Melbourne:... Labor has a policy which supports the negotiated, staged withdrawal of Australian combat forces. It's a policy we would pursue in Government.Yesterday, I noticed that the spokesman for foreign affairs for the Labor Party said:We intend to commence a phased withdrawal of Australian troops from Iraq in the middle of next year ...There are extraordinarily important points here. The first is that, having rid Iraq and the world of Saddam Hussein after the September 11 attacks, the Australian government and the Australian troops are supporting the Americans, the Iraqis, the British and other countries to bring security to Iraq, endorsed by the United Nations Security Council. Our troops in the south - those combat troops which the Labor Party says it will withdraw in a negotiated, phased way - have been increased in size for their own protection as they provide training and protection to the Iraqis and support our key allies. The ignorant naivete of the Leader of the Opposition, in an act of political opportunism to the Australian people, is such that he will have a negotiated, phased withdrawal of those troops.The Americans have 165,000 troops in Iraq. They will, at some point - and we have already seen indications of it - have a phased, managed withdrawal. To have a phased withdrawal - which Australians are being led to believe by the Leader of the Opposition - will place in danger the lives of Australian troops. That battle group is either there or not. It will also place in danger struggling Iraqis who have shown enormous courage to build their own democracy. Troops help those Iraqis build their own schools and hospitals, and a withdrawal would abandon the Iraqis in the process of training them. This is the same Leader of the Opposition who was very happy to deploy 300 troops to Afghanistan on the basis of a television report. It is absolutely essential that the decisions made about Australian troops - who wear our uniform, in our name, under our flag - in countries protect them and their critical mass for their own security. The naivete and opportunism of the Leader of the Opposition is such that, if he does what he proposes to do, he will place at risk the very safety of our own people.We have a responsibility to see this job through. Al-Qaeda is, in the words of General Petraeus, the No. 1 enemy in Iraq. We have a responsibility to Iraq, the Middle East and the free world to see the job through and make sure that our own troops are as safe as they possibly can be in the process.</DOC>

 - I am not directly aware of that. I would not, in the normal course of events, have that information across my desk on a daily basis. I will talk to my colleague and, if there is anything that I can advise the House of, I would be very happy to do so. This is a serious matter and I have been asked a question about it. I know that the honourable member has a keen interest in these matters, and that is why he has asked me the question. We have taken this issue very seriously.I do want to take this opportunity to congratulate the minister on the way he has handled a difficult issue. He understands the racing industry certainly better than I do and better than, I think, many, but not all, members. I think the member for O'Connor might know a little bit more about the racing industry than most, and he brings all the colour and flair of the racing industry to his contribution in parliament. Seriously, this equine flu outbreak is a very big challenge to a wonderful industry. I am delighted that the Australian government, the Commonwealth government, has been able to provide a very big package of help to the industry. There are many -  -  - Have you finished? You asked me the question. I thought you were interested in the horse-racing industry. Your colleague asked me a question, and all you can do is natter away to your mate the Leader of the Opposition. - No - I do. I actually take this issue quite seriously - I do - far more seriously than you do. I think it is quite important to tens of thousands of people. We have brought in not only an emergency relief package but also a very significant financial package to help the industry. I have to say that I am extremely disappointed that the New South Wales and Queensland governments, both of which collect hundreds of millions of dollars a year in gambling taxes, have not seen fit to provide any real assistance to the battlers in this industry.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Bonner for his question. I acknowledge that he is a man of great integrity. The member for Bonner is a fine representative of a beautiful seat. He knows that, by undertaking workplace reform, this government has been able to help to deliver more jobs and higher wages for working Australians. The unemployment rate today is 4.3, the lowest level in 33 years. More than 10½ million Australians are in jobs. Participation in the workforce is at an all-time high and real wages - meaning the wages that go into people's pockets after inflation - have increased by more than 21 per cent since we came into government; whereas under 13 years of Labor real wages actually fell by 1.8 per cent.This comes about not by accident but by real reform and introducing a more flexible workplace - for example, in 1996, by introducing AWAs. If you believe the rhetoric of the Labor Party, they have been around for only 18 months, but, in fact, they have been around since 1996. Of course, abolishing the unfair dismissal laws on small business means that small business now has the courage to employ people with no employment history.I am asked about the threat to the success of the economy, the threat to our workplace relations system. The greatest threat is the Australian Labor Party. You only need to ask yourself one question, and I ask the Australian people to ask themselves this question: do you really believe that the Labor Party would have the courage to stand up to the union bosses, when 70 per cent of their front bench are former union officials? Do you really believe that the Labor Party would have the courage to stand up to the union bosses, when every member of the parliamentary Labor Party is a member of a trade union movement? Do you really believe that the Labor Party in government would have the courage to stand up to the union bosses, when they are spending tens of millions of dollars trying to get the Leader of the Opposition elected at the next election?When you look at Labor's front bench, starting from the left, you have the member for Watson, the member for Hotham and the member for Batman - former union officials. There is the member for Fraser, a former union official. There is a former lawyer to union officials in the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. If you go right down their front bench, what you find is a great history of total engagement with and absolute sycophancy to the trade union movement. And do you know what? You have to judge the Labor Party not on what they say, not on what the PR firm tells them to say, but on what they do. Greg Combet let the cat out of the bag last year - Greg Combet, the man who is coming in with Bill Shorten, Richard Miles and Dougie Cameron, the Scottish union official who is an expert on the interests of the Australian workers. Greg Combet, who is coming on to the front bench of the Labor Party, said, 'I recall we used to run the country, and it would not be a bad thing if we did it again.' Do you know what? He will have no problems with that under a Rudd Labor government.</DOC>

 - I continue to believe that the member for Hotham is serious about this matter. I participated in the announcement of a full inquiry with the powers of a royal commission to be carried out by the former Justice of the High Court Ian Callinan QC. I would have thought that was done in a completely transparent manner with no holds barred. People are required to give evidence and people are required to put documents before the inquiry to get to the bottom of it.When you establish an inquiry, you do not double-guess the inquiry. You let the inquirer get on with his job. If Mr Callinan finds that there has been some failure by the Commonwealth or by some officer of the Commonwealth, in his fearless, independent way, he will report. Given the fact that we have appointed him so quickly and given him the powers we have, I am astonished at the member for Hotham. What are you getting at? I am quite astonished at what the member for Hotham has asked. Here we have a minister doing his job. He understands the industry. He looks after the strappers, the jockeys' assistants and the bookies' -  - Not the bookies, no. But the bookies' clerks have got a bit of a worry. Will you have a look at them? - He looks after all of those people. And here we have the member for Hotham asking: 'Why don't you have an inquiry?' Really, you ought to read your brief.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Boothby for his question. I recognise the very great concern he and his constituents have about the way in which water has been managed in Adelaide. The Australian government, in 2004, established the $2 billion Australian government water fund and this year established the $10 billion National Plan for Water Security, supported by the historic Water Act 2007.The Australian government water fund has invested in the better management of more than 75 billion litres of South Australian water through projects worth, in total, $620 million. They include $38 million for Waterproofing Northern Adelaide, $2.3 million for the metropolitan Adelaide stormwater reuse project, $34 million for Waterproofing the South and $20 million for a statewide waste water recycling project, among others.I note that in 2004 the Prime Minister offered to fund half the cost of the Glenelg waste water recycling project to save 3.8 billion litres. Three years on, the National Water Commission is still waiting on written confirmation of co-funding from the South Australian government. The problem that Adelaide faces is that it has in its Mount Lofty dam storage capacity for only about a year's worth of water - a little less, in fact. It is dependent on the Murray every year, and in dry years dependent on the Murray for up to 80 - sometimes 90 - per cent of its water.Last year we got a wake-up call in terms of the Murray River. Inflows were a little more than 50 per cent of the previous all-time low. Those inflows were literally off the charts. It became obvious then that Adelaide needs a non-climate-dependent water source and, plainly, desalination must be part of that solution.When the Prime Minister called for iconic water projects last July from state and territory leaders, South Australia did not put forward an option to secure Adelaide's water future. While a year later no such proposal has been put forward to us, in the five years of the Rann government, they have managed to take over $800 million of dividends out of SA Water - $800 million that should have been invested.I was asked whether there are any alternative policies. The alternative policy is this, and it is one which is vital to the water security of Adelaide: Adelaide needs a new, non-climate-dependent water source. It needs a desalination plant, and it needs it now. I have been calling for the South Australian government to act on this for more than a year. Yesterday, Premier Rann issued a statement titled 'Future directions in water security', which did no more than say that it is likely that a desalination plant will be built, and that he hopes his government will make a decision before the end of the year. There is a Labor track record in water neglect. The best example of that was the Labor government in Queensland - in which the Leader of the Opposition played a leading role in 1989 - which cancelled a new dam proposal for south-east Queensland, the Wolffdene Dam, crossed its fingers and prayed for rain. It rained for a few years and everything was fine. And what has happened? We find that, lacking that long-term investment, south-east Queensland is running out of water, and it is building infrastructure in a great rush and a great panic.The lesson is clear: to secure the water supplies of Australia's cities, we need to plan a long way ahead. All of these projects take a long time to plan and to build. We learnt this last year; Adelaide got its wake-up call last year when it saw how low those inflows from the Murray were, and they are not very good this year either. The fact is that Adelaide was given a signal from those inflows that it had to act, and Premier Rann is dragging his feet. I fear that that Labor complacency, no doubt copied from the complacency of the Leader of the Opposition when he was involved in state government, will put Adelaide in the same position in years ahead as Brisbane is in today. We need action; we need vision. We have set the example at the federal level, and the South Australian government should get on with it.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dobell for his question. I can confirm that, after four rounds of the Australian government's $1.2 billion Investing in Our Schools Program, the electorate of Dobell has received over $4 million for 38 government schools for much-needed maintenance and repair work for those schools. I congratulate him on that outcome. The single most important investment that a nation can make is in a quality education for its young people. - That is why the Australian government has delivered record levels of funding to schools across Australia -  - particularly to state government schools, in every year since 1996. That is why the Australian government established the Investing in Our Schools Program. Now, after four rounds, virtually every state government school in Australia has received funding - almost $800 million in funding for over 6,850 government schools. That is why this government has announced that the Investing in Our Schools Program will continue.The fact is that investment in education is important, and this government cares about the future of young people. That is why we have boosted Australian apprenticeships to over 400,000. That is why we have created over 50,000 new Commonwealth supported university places. - That means that virtually every eligible student in this country -  - can now access a Commonwealth supported place at university. This is what this government cares about. We want to see better maintained schools; we want to see better training opportunities; we want to make sure that eligible students can access a place at university.I ask the Australian people to compare the legacy of the Labor Party. When Labor were in power, they left schools to run down. There was no Investing in Our Schools Program under Labor. Labor governments around the country closed technical colleges, and apprenticeships declined to record lows. In the last three years of the Labor government, 300,000 eligible young students were turned away from university because there were not enough Commonwealth supported places. This was at a time when Labor reigned over record unemployment. You could not get a job; you could not get an apprenticeship; you could not get a place at university. This government has not only cleaned up the economic mess left by Labor's $96 billion debt; it is cleaning up the mess they left in education when they failed to support education and training opportunities to meet the skills needs of this country.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. At 9 am, I introduced a bill into the House to give Judge Callinan powers akin to a royal commission: powers to subpoena documents and witnesses and to hold public hearings. Those issues surrounding the past and current operations of the quarantine system as it applies to the importation of horses, including the facility at Eastern Creek, fall within the province of his inquiry. It is not for me to either condone or exonerate any aspect of the quarantine system or the handling of the equine influenza outbreak. We should let Judge Callinan conduct his inquiry without commentary from the sidelines that may hinder or prejudice any aspect of his hearing and his final recommendations. In regard to coming back with information in answer to your earlier question: I will provide information in due course.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hasluck for his question. The member for Hasluck and his Labor opponent in the forthcoming election really present a microcosm of what the policy debate is all about. The member for Hasluck employed people when he was in business before he came into this parliament. He was an extremely successful small business man. He was somebody who actually worked hard to give people jobs. His Labor opponent is a former trade union official. Need I say any more? She is committed to a policy which will result in higher unemployment. My colleague from Hasluck lived a life before he came into this parliament that actually gave jobs to people and reduced unemployment.I might remind the House that in 1996 the unemployment rate in Hasluck was 7.4 per cent. In March of this year it had fallen to a mere 3.1 per cent. I might also inform the House that figures that came out today on the long-term unemployment levels in this country show that in the time that this government has been in office the level of long-term unemployment has fallen by 66.3 per cent. It was in excess of 330,000 in 1996. It is now a bare 66,700. But it can get lower and we can have in reality in this country a full-employment society. When I talk about a full-employment society I talk about one where every person who wants a job and is able to have a job, gets the job, but also a society where not only do they get the job but they get the job of their choice. We have it within our grasp if we do the right thing economically over the years ahead to create a genuine full-employment society in Australia. We will not create it if we wind back industrial relations reform. We will not create it by driving up unemployment, which would be the result of Labor's policies. The long-term unemployment list would begin to climb again, because Labor's returning of the unfair dismissal laws would result in unemployment rising once again because small business would be intimidated out of taking on the staff that they plainly have been doing over the last 16 months when the new industrial relations laws have been in operation.So I say in reply to the member for Hasluck that the greatest human dividend of good economic policy is reduced unemployment. The greatest goal any government can have is to create a society where people have the jobs not only that they are able to do but the jobs that they want - that we have a society where every Australian who wants to work and can work is able to get a job and is able to get a job of their choice. That is the society that we want. It is a society that could never be achieved under the Australian Labor Party.</DOC>

 - I think the first and most important thing that we can do for the four-year-olds of this country is to make sure their parents have a job. That is the most important thing we can do and that is the best policy any government can offer - to ensure that every child in this country grows up in a household where their parents are in work. I am very proud of the fact that the number of jobless households in Australia has declined markedly during the time that this government has been in office and I am distressed at the prospect that, under Labor's high-unemployment policy, the number of jobless households would rise yet again.</DOC>

 - My answer is addressed to our first-class member for Solomon and, I think I can say, the best member that Solomon has ever had in the history of Australia. - I am glad the member for Batman understood what I was saying. He is really on top of his game today. There are some union officials that are really quick. Today the International Monetary Fund released its annual assessment of the Australian economy. The IMF does a report on every one of the members of the IMF - some 150 to 160 nations around the world - on an annual basis. This is done by the independent IMF, which is Washington based and is the premier economic institution of the world.The report which was released in relation to Australia notes that we are now in our 15th year of continuous economic growth, this government having presided over nearly 12 of those years. That growth is strong at about four per cent and inflation is low at about 2½ per cent. This is what the IMF said in its report today. I ask the House to listen to this quote of the IMF:[Executive directors] commended Australian authorities for their 'exemplary' macroeconomic management, which is widely recognised as being at the forefront of international best practice.That is not me, that is not the Prime Minister, that is not the Liberal Party - that is the IMF, which describes Australia's economic management as 'at the forefront of international best practice'. The IMF noted that we have improved our fiscal sustainability by accumulating surpluses, eliminating net debt and establishing the Future Fund to provide for future liabilities. If Labor had had its way we would never have been able to do that. Labor opposed balancing the budget; Labor opposed paying off debt; Labor opposed making sure that the Future Fund was locked up for future generations of Australians.There is only one area that the IMF raised for concern in relation to the fiscal situation in Australia. Bear in mind that this is not me and it is not the Australian Treasury. It is the Washington based IMF. The IMF sounded a note of caution in this international report on Australia in relation to spending by state governments. This is what the IMF said:Another stimulus that raises concern comes from the States. The States are collectively forecasting a fiscal deficit of around ½ percent of GDP in 2007/08. This constitutes a reversal of the surplus position that the States have been in until 2005/06. _       _            _The catch up in infrastructure spending comes at a time when there is already strong competition for human and capital resources from the private sector. As a result, this is putting more pressure on resources and could begin to bid up prices.That is what the IMF said. The point that the IMF is making is that when you have a huge investment surge going on in this country - an investment surge that is being led by the private sector - for a level of government to come in, to run a deficit and to put pressure on that capacity could have an effect on prices.As I have said in this House before, there is nothing wrong with building infrastructure. The Australian government is engaged in the biggest infrastructure program in Australian history. What we do is fund our infrastructure program and add to savings with a surplus. What the states do is they do not fund their infrastructure program and they borrow savings, running deficits.If the Australian Labor Party were courageous and really wanted to show that it understood economic policy, it would take the opportunity to condemn those Labor state governments, who have moved their budgets from surpluses into deficits. If Mr Rudd, the Leader of the Opposition, wanted to show that he had the bottle to stand up to a state premier, he would come right out and make it entirely clear -  - The member for Lilley then left the chamber. - If the Leader of the Opposition wanted to show any bottle whatsoever on economic policy, he would have the guts to stand up and say to the state premiers of Australia that it is against Australian interests in running a deficit -  -  - Let me make it entirely clear. It is in Australia's interests that both levels of government work together at a time like this to fund their budgets. If this Leader of the Opposition wants to pretend he is an economic conservative, he ought to take the decision, stand up to those state premiers and make it clear that he can take them on and stand up for Australia's interests.</DOC>

 - Let me deal first of all with Labor's alleged plan. At no stage has the Leader of the Opposition outlined to the Australian people what the funding arrangements might be. It remains the case that, if the Commonwealth takes over every public hospital in this country, there will need to be a massive realignment of Commonwealth-state financials. You are looking at 40 per cent of the money that flows from the Commonwealth to the states and, if the Leader of the Opposition is to have any credibility on this policy, he has to either tell the states that he will take that money away from them or tell the Australian people that, in government, he would unite with state Labor premiers to increase the level of the goods and services tax. - That is the choice that the Leader of the Opposition has to face. He pretends that he has a policy. - It is no more than a flimsy press release. You cannot have a credible policy unless you explain to the Australian people how it will be funded. If you raise the possibility of taking over public hospitals, you have to tell the Australian people how you are going to fund that takeover. Are you going to take the money back from the states or are you going to increase the GST? You have a choice. I would say to those who sit opposite -  - The Leader of the Opposition prefaced his question by reference to Labor's policy -  - and I said that I would first deal with Labor's policy and then I would deal with the government's. The question I put, rhetorically, to the Leader of the Opposition is: if you are going to take over 762 public hospitals, you have to explain to the Australian public how you are going to fund that takeover. Either you must take billions of dollars away from the states - and I know that you would not have the guts to take a penny away from a state Labor Premier - or, alternatively, you should concede that, in government, you might unite with Labor premiers to increase the level of the GST. It has been calculated that you would need a 40 per cent rise in the GST in order to fund this takeover. The Leader of the Opposition cannot slide away from public scrutiny on this policy. It is not enough - The member for Parramatta then left the chamber. - The Leader of the Opposition asked me about government health policy. Let me start by invoking the words of my friend and colleague the Minister for Health and Ageing: the Howard government is the best friend that Medicare has ever had. Under this government's changes to bulk-billing arrangements - and I remember when those who sat opposite only talked about bulk-billing levels; it was their constant mantra that bulk-billing has fallen under this government - the truth is that, for people over the age of 65, for children under the age of 16 and for people living in remote and regional areas of Australia, bulk-billing levels are higher than they have ever been since the introduction of Medicare.I then move from bulk-billing to the Medicare safety net. The Medicare safety net is going to be abolished by the Labor Party. The Medicare safety net guarantees that, for average families, after your out-of-pocket expenses go beyond $500 a year, you get an 80 per cent refund under Medicare. That was a policy that we introduced. It was a policy that was voted against by the Labor Party. It is a policy that they are still pledged to repeal. The Leader of the Opposition asked me about our policies. I am very, very happy to go on. That is our policy. Our policy is to keep the safety net; Labor's policy is to abolish the safety net. Our policy is to drive bulk-billing levels in the areas I have mentioned to record highs; Labor is now left silent on the issue of bulk-billing. We have continued to maintain a world-class pharmaceutical benefits scheme. We have invested more money, year after year, in medical research in this country. I am proud of the medical research credentials of this government. - We put $486 million in the 2007-08 budget on top of the $905 million in the 2006-07 budget. We provided an additional $380 million for dental services under Medicare in the last budget. We are contributing in many areas in cooperation with the states. For example, we have established the National Health Call Centre Network. We have provided $94 million a year for after-hours care, supporting over 160 after-hours GP practices, and substantially increased the Medicare rebate for GP attendances after hours. We have funded over 20 co-located general practice after-hours clinics. And, of course, importantly - The member for Swan then left the chamber. - Perhaps as significant as any of the policies that we have introduced and that we are guaranteed to maintain is, of course, the private health insurance rebate. One of the first things the Leader of the Opposition did when he entered the parliament after the 1998 election was to vote against the private health insurance rebate. The election was held in October 1998. The introduction of the 30 per cent rebate was part of our election policy, and it was passed through the parliament, only with the help of the then Senator Brian Harradine. The Labor Party, including the newly elected member for Griffith - virtually his first act in this parliament - voted against tax help for private health insurance. - I just remind the House that the first significant vote in which the Leader of the Opposition participated was to vote against the introduction of the private health insurance rebate. He did it within weeks of being elected to parliament. Of course, he was to exceed himself some months later when he voted against the tax package and declared that we were approaching a day of fundamental injustice - fundamental injustice day. Could I just say to the Leader of the Opposition: if he would like to ask me another question on health, I would be delighted to continue outlining the government's record.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Wakefield for his question and recognise that, in his former life before becoming a member of the federal parliament, as a member of the Australian Defence Force he has had the opportunity of travelling around many regions across Australia and experiencing life outside of the capital cities, which is in stark contrast to his Labor opponent in the upcoming election, whose main claim to fame is as an official from the SDA union. -  - I do not know; you tell me. The member for Wakefield at least has real-life experiences, out there in the real world, that he brings into this parliament as the member representing a constituency in South Australia. I thank the member for his question. He asks about the policies that the coalition government has put in place to help strengthen the economic and social fabric in regional Australia. I added to those policies yesterday when I announced the $200 million Growing Regions program, which was put in place to help those growing regions across Australia deal with the demands of rapid population growth in many parts of Australia. Of course, that has been significantly welcomed across regional Australia. It goes along with the broad suite of policies that are part of our plan in strengthening regional Australia.The Treasurer earlier referred to the largest investment in land transport in Australia's history that we are currently in the middle of - a $38 billion investment over 10 years in road and rail infrastructure. A lot of that is strengthening regional economies. There are our health programs, which are encouraging more doctors in rural areas. And there is almost $1 billion to improve broadband services, under Australia Connected, across Australia. These are things that are happening, not things that are out there in the ether and being promised by the Australian Labor Party.Regional communities recognise the need and they appreciate the response of the coalition government, particularly with this particular policy focusing on growing regions. It was interesting: I saw a press release, and it was not from the member for Hotham; it was from the National Sea Change Taskforce - it came out yesterday - led by Councillor Joe Natoli. He said: 'It is clear the Deputy Prime Minister, who represents a coastal electorate, understands the sort of pressure this growth has on coastal communities, and we are delighted with the initiative he has announced today.' So regional communities do appreciate what we are doing. They do appreciate that it is targeted help. They also know that all the Labor Party can do is criticise these programs. If you want to know what Labor in government would do federally, you only have to look at what they do in government at a state level.Look at state Labor governments and what they do to regional Australia. In New South Wales, Labor have closed nearly half of all country maternity units. In Victoria, they are draining much needed water out of the Goulburn Valley to get it down to Melbourne because they have not planned for and invested in infrastructure in Melbourne. In Queensland, the federal government has had to step in and protect the democratic rights of local authorities, where the Queensland government wants to wipe out local government with tactics that former Premier Beattie introduced. There is a challenge to the new Premier, Anna Bligh, in Queensland: reverse this decision and let the people of Queensland have a say.We go back a bit beyond that to the Goss-Rudd team in the last Labor government in Queensland. What did the Goss-Rudd team do in Queensland? They cut 600 jobs in the department of primary industries and shut down four regional DPI offices; they closed 13 regional railway lines and three rail workshops - 457 jobs were lost in that one move; they shut down small country schools and cut 403 teaching positions. If the people of Australia want to know what a Rudd led Labor government will do in power in Canberra, they only have to look at what state Labor does and what state Labor did when the opposition leader was in charge of the reins in Queensland.</DOC>

 - I feel duly rebuked! The difference between the Leader of the Opposition and the policy he enunciates in relation to hospitals is to be found not only in relation to the things that I have mentioned but also in relation to the determination of this government through the measures that it has already introduced and will continue into the future, measures that are designed to deal with some of the issues of bed blocking, measures that are designed to take the load off the emergency departments by introducing more after-hours services, measures which are designed to provide the co-location of GP clinics with public hospitals, measures which are designed to ensure that by having a strong private hospital system you take the load off the public hospital system. The great problem that the Leader of the Opposition has is the inherent contradiction in that, in having opposed the development of a strong private hospital system, he in effect has placed much greater pressure on the public hospital system of this country.Our view is that if you promise the Australian people that you will take over public hospitals you have an obligation to explain how you are going to fund that takeover. The Leader of the Opposition so far has failed to tell the Australian people how, if he does take over public hospitals, he will fund that takeover. Will he take money from the states? Will he stand up to the state Labor premiers? Or will he, as we believe, in government join with state Labor premiers to increase the GST? - Let me say very directly to the member for Gellibrand: our plan is to keep the GST at 10 per cent. That is our plan. We do not intend to increase the GST by 40 per cent to fund a takeover of public hospitals.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Cowper, Australia's greatest member for Cowper. I understand he is under attack from another trade union official at the next election. -  - It is a fair bet, if you are asked who your local Labor candidate is, that it is a union official. I think there is about a 70 per cent chance that it is a union official. I will chance my arm here and say there is a union official running for Labor in Cowper. Is that right?Government members - Yes. - Surprise, surprise! One of the measures which the government has just introduced to this parliament is a very practical measure to respond to the challenge of climate change and to ensure that we have appropriate incentives, particularly through our tax system, to respond to those issues which will reduce carbon emissions and also contribute to the greening of our country and improve our environment. Australia has a wonderful but fragile environment. We are one of the hottest and driest continents on earth. As a result of that we all have an interest in forestation. We all have an interest in encouraging the plantation industry in a way which will deal with those issues and deal with carbon emissions.This morning the government introduced legislation into parliament which will allow a full tax deduction to carbon sink forest operators for the cost of establishing trees in a qualifying carbon sink forest. This is full deductability. Those people who are planting in a recognised qualifying carbon sink forest will be able to deduct the full cost of that and expense it in full. As a consequence of that, we believe that there will be many operators who will take the opportunity to plant trees, including planting trees in agricultural areas, where farmers will be able to make land available, maybe even in between crops, and get a payment for their land, which will be matched by the tax deduction of those that are planting the qualifying trees.This is a kick-start for carbon sink forests. It is intended by the government that this will apply until 2012-13, when the immediate deduction will be replaced with a write-off under the general horticultural plant provisions. To qualify for this tax deductability, operators will have to comply with environmental and natural resource management guidelines.This is a practical response to the issue of climate change. This is an important measure which will be consistent with a growing economy. This will put in place an opportunity for investors to do their bit. These are the kinds of initiatives which are important to front up to the future challenges of climate change and the environment, and this is the government that is putting them into place.</DOC>

 - The Leader of the Opposition has asked me a question about a policy that he says is the great moral challenge of the age, but he almost forgot to mention it when he saw the most powerful man in the world in Sydney last week. He totally forgot to mention it. It is a measure of the leader's moral fervour on these matters that it is not on the agenda for such an important meeting.I say in reply to the Leader of the Opposition that we are very proud of the balanced approach we have to climate change. We believe in tackling climate change without undermining the strength of the Australian economy. With respect to the Sydney declaration - and I know the Leader of the Opposition was rather disappointed -  - that it was achieved last week - for the first time it united the United States, China and Russia, the three greatest emitters in the world, in a commitment to an aspirational target for a reduction in greenhouse gases. It does represent a new international consensus on climate change. If the world can agree on a common emissions goal, with all countries contributing, reflecting their own capacities, then indeed there is some hope for a balanced approach.I remind the Leader of the Opposition, with his references to 11½ years, of the $2 billion to $3 billion that the government has committed to various measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. I remind him that the emissions trading system to which the government is committed is a world's best in terms of an emissions trading system. It has more comprehensive coverage. It covers some 70 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions -  - which is vastly higher than the European and other models long championed by the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Kingsford Smith. So I would say in reply to the Leader of the Opposition that I do not regard his plan as comprehensive. He is so ashamed of it or lacks fervour and commitment to it that he does not mention it when he meets the President of the United States. It is such a moral crusade for the Leader of the Opposition that he did not mention it in the most important meeting he had last week. It is a measure of the way in which the performance of the Leader of the Opposition in these matters falls a long way short of his rhetoric. I think the government's approach to climate change, which balances the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions with the overwhelming need to preserve the strength of the Australian economy, is the approach that is right for Australia's future and an approach that the great majority of Australians will support.</DOC>

 - First, can I thank the honourable member for Fadden for his question. This will be, for certain, one of the last questions, if not the last question, that he asks in the House of Representatives. I know we on this side of the House, and no doubt many on the other side, believe he has been a great member of parliament. He will be very much missed. I know in the electorate of Fadden the Labor Party has put up a candidate who is an official for the Liquor, Hospitality and Miscellaneous Union. Imagine asking the people of Fadden to put a union hack in place of a great man like Jully!Let me make this pretty clear: the government of Australia supports a democratic Iraq, an Iraq free from dictatorship and an Iraq free from terrorists. But this requires hard work. As the US Ambassador to Iraq, Ambassador Crocker, has said, the process will not be quick. It requires security. General Petraeus has said that political progress will take place only if security exists, which of course is the whole point of the surge. I would say that it is encouraging that the surge has been working and that some of the political signs, albeit rather early signs, are more positive than has been the case for a long time.The honourable member asked whether there were any alternative views. I think it is well known that the opposition policy is to abandon Iraq. I noticed, going through the records, that the Leader of the Opposition said on the Sunday program on 18 August: 'Labor has argued consistently against the surge.' The member for Barton, who is the shadow minister, has often said that the surge was a mistake and has been opposed to the surge.Let me make this clear about the surge: since December 2006, there has been a 45 per cent decline in civilian deaths and a 55 per cent decline in sectarian deaths, and al-Anbar province, which was a hotbed of al-Qaeda, has been cleared of al-Qaeda. Those things have been achieved because of the surge - a surge which was completely opposed by the Leader of the Opposition, which, if I may say so, says something about his judgement.The Labor Party also argues that troops should be withdrawn from Iraq and that if foreign troops were withdrawn from Iraq there would be political progress. Somehow this is the way to achieve some kind of political reconciliation in Iraq - to rip out from underneath the people of Iraq their security. Very few people who know anything about the issues think that makes even the slightest sense. That is simply a policy built on the back of some opinion polling which has been worked by Hawker Britton. It is nothing else.Let me tell the House what Ambassador Crocker, who I suspect knows more about this issue than the Leader of the Opposition or the member for Barton, said to the US congress on 11 September, in response to a question which happened to be about Labor's policy - that is, whether withdrawing the troops would increase political pressure for reconciliation. Ambassador Crocker said:I think we have to be very careful with that, frankly, and I'd be concerned at an approach that says we're going to start pulling out troops regardless of the objective conditions on the ground. And what might happen in consequence of that could actually push the Iraqis in the wrong direction, to make them less likely to compromise rather than more likely.The fact is that the Labor Party have never shared the government's position. Our position is that we support democracy in Iraq. Labor were happy to allow Iraq to remain a dictatorship. After all, they tried to raise half a million dollars for their 1975 election campaign from that dictatorship. Do not let anybody forget the Blues Point Tower meeting between Gough Whitlam, a great Labor hero, and Ba'ath Socialist Party officials from Iraq - a great affiliation under the socialist international flag, no doubt. - The Labor Party seems to think that the terrorists can just hack it out in Iraq and establish a base there and that that does not matter. At the end of the day, that matters to our national security. For terrorists to succeed in Iraq is for terrorism to win internationally. That, in turn, undermines our own national security. This government is not about populism; it is about standing up for our national security. -  - The trade union officials on the frontbench laugh, even though they know they have a leader who is totally driven by opinion polls. Probably, intellectually, there are few people on the Labor side who think we are wrong, but all of them have decided to adopt a narrow, populist approach which will reduce our national security and not enhance it.</DOC>

 - In listening to this question and the last answer given by the foreign minister, I thought to myself: what is it about the member for North Sydney's electorate? It has the Blues Point Tower on McMahon's Point, which was the location of the infamous deal that was meant to raise half a million dollars for Gough Whitlam's campaign from the Ba'ath Socialist Party, and it has another residence that people are very familiar with - namely, Kirribilli House. It should be remembered that in 1989 a secret deal was made -  - I am very happy to remind those who sit opposite, given the question that has been asked of me and its implications, that in 1989 a secret deal was made by my two immediate predecessors in this great office. As a result of that deal, those two men lived a lie through the whole of the 1990 election campaign. It ill behoves anybody in the Australian Labor Party to start lecturing me or the Treasurer and Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party. Let me make it clear: there are no secret deals. We will not be living any lie like Bob Hawke and Paul Keating did. We will level with the Australian people, as I did last night when I made it very plain that if the people of Australia are kind enough to return me and my government at the next election -  The member for Lyons then left the chamber. 
 - I made my position very clear last night; there are no secret deals. - Unlike Bob Hawke and Paul Keating, John Howard and Peter Costello will not be living any lie through the next election campaign.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Lindsay for her question. As every parent in this House knows, when your child is sick in the middle of the night, you want health care straight away. You do not want to have to wait until the doctor's surgery opens at eight o'clock the following morning. I can inform the House that, thanks to the indefatigable work of three great local members of parliament - the member for Lindsay, the member for Macquarie and the member for Greenway - 450,000 people in Western Sydney will soon have access to after-hours house calls from a GP. That is more evidence that the Howard government solves problems. It does not talk about these issues; it solves them. This is further proof that the Howard government is truly the best friend that Medicare has ever had.I have been asked about alternative policies. Labor have just committed $220 million of their $2 billion public hospital power grab towards a series of what they call 'GP super clinics'. This $2 billion that they are always referring to is actually just half a million dollars a year. That is less than two per cent of the cost of running public hospitals, which is about the same as the efficiency dividend that some state governments rip out of public hospitals. They are already raiding their own piggy bank. Not only did they raid it for this $220 million for GP clinics, but just the other day they raided it for PET scanning in Newcastle. Pretty soon, there will be absolutely none of it left.The point about their latest policy on GPs is that there are a lot of words but no real detail on precisely what extra services are going to be delivered. Here are some perfectly reasonable questions for the Leader of the Opposition and his health spokesman. Who will own and run these new GP clinics? How will these new GP clinics treat chronic disease differently? Will they be able to charge a fee for service in a way which is central to the operation of Medicare? Most importantly, will these clinics further strip medical services from small rural, regional and remote communities? Unless Labor can spell out the details of this so-called policy, it is not a policy; it is just a PR stunt. There is a strong suspicion in this so-called policy that what is really happening is that Labor is setting up government funded, salaried doctors to compete with the private profession.But what becomes more and more obvious every time it puts out these shallow press releases is that the Labor Party does not know what it is talking about on health. The Leader of the Opposition knows that his shadow health minister does not know what she is talking about. I will quote from an article by Gerard McManus in the Herald Sun earlier this month:Mr Rudd is a hard task master and is known to be unhappy with the performance of some frontbenchers. The body language at the recent launch of Labor's health policy said a great deal when Mr Rudd explained everything and took every follow-up question, and has given some inside Labor to question whether Nicola Roxon will have the same role after the election.One Labor MP suggested that the launch was a setback -  The member for Gellibrand then left the chamber.  - I am disappointed that the member for Gellibrand is leaving, because I was about to tell her what her colleagues really think of her. I am quoting Gerard McManus. He said:One Labor MP suggested that the launch was a setback for Mr Roxon, who was made to look like a barrel girl standing beside game show host Rudd.That is what Labor MPs think of the shadow minister and their leader. - Health is not a political game. It is about real patients -  The member for Cunningham then left the chamber. The member for Calwell then left the chamber. 
 - I am just quoting a very respected journalist, Gerard McManus, who said one Labor MP suggested that the whole launch had made Ms Roxon 'look like a barrel girl standing beside game show host Rudd'. If this is 'disgraceful', as members opposite are now suggesting, they should have a leak inquiry; they should find out which of their number said this to Gerard McManus. Let me repeat that health is too important to be treated like a political game by members opposite. Health is about real patients who need real services. Until Labor can come up with the real details of their policy, it is clear that they just cannot be trusted with the health care of the Australian people.</DOC>

 - He averaged 72 in his last test series, Daryl - better than anyone else! I thank the member for Corangamite for his question and note that he was a farmer before coming into this place. I bet he has a union official running against him on behalf of the Labor Party. Is that right? I bet that union official does not even live in his seat - just like North Sydney, where the Labor candidate does not live in the seat. It is true that the government remains absolutely committed to putting in place policies that help to deliver higher real wages, more jobs and fewer strikes. The government is committed to the goal that every Australian who wants to get a job can get a job, because that is what full employment is. It is amazing that we are the only government - certainly in the last 33 years and perhaps even since that Blues Point Tower deal - that could ever talk about full employment. Policies such as workplace relations reform and Welfare to Work have helped to deliver the infrastructure that has allowed business to employ more people and head towards full employment.The fact of the matter is that Australia is running out of workers. We are not replacing ourselves as a nation. Our birthrate is not high enough to replace ourselves, so we need to have policies that are innovative - and even, some would say, courageous - that actually encourage people to get into work and to get off welfare. There are only three places you can get the workers of tomorrow: firstly, you can have more children -  - Have one for mum, one for dad and one for Australia. The $5,000 baby bonus is a great incentive to do that. - That is right; I have one more to go. I do not have much say in it, unfortunately. Secondly, we can massively increase immigration. We do not agree with that. We actually think we have the immigration levels about right. The third area where we can get the workers is to get some of those two million Australians who are on welfare and not working into work. They are of working age. We have to try to access that pool. This government had the courage to introduce Welfare to Work initiatives that moved people from welfare into work. Of course the Labor Party opposed it all the way and said that we were heartless. The bottom line is that having a 4.3 per cent unemployment rate and having higher real wages is not heartless; it is actually the greatest form of welfare you could possibly deliver.Today I am releasing a report entitled Building stronger families: the benefits of moving from welfare to work. It gives a snapshot of the success of the initiative. Why do we undertake these policies? It is because we are about the future welfare of the Australian people. We are about helping Australians to have more jobs and higher real wages. Of course when the Labor Party released its workplace relations policy it did not say anything about jobs. It did not say anything about higher real wages. It did not say anything about economic prosperity. It was just a deal between the union bosses, who make up 70 per cent of the Labor frontbench - and others are coming in like Combet, Shorten and Dougie Cameron - and the Labor Party. That sort of deal is bad for Australian workers and it is bad for Australian families. If you ever want to think carefully about what the implications will be of electing a Rudd Labor government then look no further than the fact that 70 per cent of his frontbench are former union officials. Does anyone really believe for a second that in government he would have the courage to stand up to his entire frontbench and a union movement that is spending millions of dollars to get him elected? Does anyone believe that for a second? No. The reason is that the Labor Party will always put the jobs of the union bosses ahead of the jobs of Australian working families.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Macquarie for his question and acknowledge his deep interest in and commitment to education in his electorate. This government believes that quality education is directly linked to quality teaching. That is why we have invested over $100 million to establish Australian government summer schools for teachers. Over the four years 4,000 teachers will have the opportunity to undertake a high-quality professional learning experience in five summer schools that will be established across Australia. They will be in maths, science, English, literacy and numeracy, and Australian history. Today I announced the successful university consortia that will hold these summer schools, the first beginning in January next year.What is the Labor Party's response to this initiative that is so welcomed by the education sector and by individual teachers? The Labor Party will close down these summer schools. They will deny 4,000 teachers the opportunity to be leaders for greater educational standards in their schools. You have to ask yourself: why would the Labor Party do that? It is because the Australian Education Union told them to. The Labor Party is in lockstep with the unions, and these unions are out of control. The Australian Education Union and the New South Wales Teachers Federation have been running a dishonest and misleading campaign against this government. There is nothing new in that - that is their stock-in-trade.But the unions are now using children as young as six years old to carry their propaganda. Over the last two days unions in New South Wales have been forcing young children to carry home this pamphlet, which contains lies, to their parents - and parents are outraged. And what was the response of the Labor government in New South Wales? The Labor Minister for Education and Training, a former union official, did not have the courage to stand up for the parents against the union, so he sent his Director-General of Education out to tell them to stop. The unions defied the instruction - they ignored him - and they continued their tactics. Talkback radio and members of parliament have been swamped with calls from outraged parents complaining about their children being exploited by union members. One parent complained that a six-year-old girl in year 1 at Cherrybrook Public School was given a leaflet by the acting deputy principal and told that she had to take it home to give to her parents. Children in a class at Normanhurst Public School were instructed to boo at any mention of our Prime Minister, John Howard, or the coalition government.These sorts of tactics are taking place at Oakhill Drive primary school. Similar tactics are taking place across New South Wales - Oakhill Drive primary school, Cobbitty primary school, Macksville primary school, Braddock Public Primary School; primary schools across New South Wales - and parents are outraged. And what has been the response of federal Labor? What has been the response of the ex-union officials sitting on the front bench? The deafening silence that we have come to expect from people who owe their very existence in this place to the patronage of the unions. The Labor Party does not have the courage to stand up for parents. The Labor Party does not have the courage to stand up against the unions. The unions own every single one of them lock, stock and barrel.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kingston for his question. He has been a powerhouse in making the technical college in his area a great success. In raising the status of the trades and technical training, the Australian technical colleges are already an unqualified success. When you go and meet the young people at these colleges, time and again they tell you that for the first time in their lives they feel motivated, they feel understood and they feel valued. We are restoring with these Australian technical colleges a great sense of pride and confidence in these young people. And it is resonating in local communities. Over the last few weeks hundreds of parents and prospective students have attended information nights at individual colleges around the country. Even parents of primary age students are approaching colleges around the country seeking to book their kids into years 11 and 12 at technical colleges some six or eight years hence.Yet the members opposite continue to denigrate these colleges for their own selfish political purposes. To make matters worse, the opposition is promoting a totally inadequate alternative. Labor promised between $500,000 and $1.5 million to all of the 2,650 academic secondary schools around Australia to set up so-called trade centres in all of these Australian secondary colleges. This is a policy that is being ridiculed in education circles - and for good reasons. About four weeks ago I reopened a renovated toilet block in a local primary school in my electorate. It is a small primary school and the renovation of this small toilet block -  -  - You might laugh - they were worried about the health of their kids. This was not funded by the Labor Party; this was funded by the Australian government and the parents because the Labor government did not do anything about the health of these young kids. This renovation for a very small primary school cost $200,000. My point is that it highlights the total inadequacy of $500,000 - or, for that matter, $1.5 million - to create a trade centre in every secondary school in the country. That sort of money will not touch the sides - it is a total con. It will see no more than an oven or a lathe in a classroom down the back end of every secondary school. More disturbingly, it will serve only to further perpetuate in every secondary college the second-class view of a trade career. Can't you see it now - every Wednesday afternoon the kids who are not up with it academically will go down the back and do some cooking. That is all you will achieve with this. You will perpetuate what you have been doing for 20 years - talking down the trades. It will do nothing to raise the status of the trades.The Leader of the Opposition, your leader, knows this and he is becoming increasingly embarrassed by it - so much so that he is starting to fudge this policy. Just last week the Leader of the Opposition said to a gathering at Geelong:Here in Corangamite - an electorate very well served by the local member, I might add - there are some 13 secondary schools _ That means 13 times $1.5 million to come to this community to make sure that we've got these trades training centres.He went on:Corio next door, some 20 secondary schools _That, he said, is 20 times $1.5 million. What the Leader of the Opposition is now saying is that every school across the country will get $1.5 million. But that is not Labor's policy. Under Labor's policy, only one-third of all the schools get $1.5 million, one-third get $1 million and one-third get $500,000. So we saw emerge last week just a little matter of a $1.5 billion gap in Labor's costings. I know that maths is not Labor's strong point, but this was not a simple mathematical oversight. The Leader of the Opposition has been selling this policy all over the country since the budget. In fact, apart from IR, which has been an absolute debacle for them, this has been the only policy where they have released any detail. And he has been selling it for months. If he does not know the detail, I'll go he. He knew what he was doing when he misrepresented his own embarrassing policy. He did not want to be ridiculed, so he told his audience what he thought they would prefer to hear. This was deception plain and simple. Mark my words: under pressure, the Leader of the Opposition reverts to type.</DOC>

 - What I have said is that when I do, well into the next term if we are re-elected - and can I make the observation that we have had five questions about one job, not five questions about millions of jobs, and quite honestly I think that the Australian people are more interested in jobs for their children than they are in whether Kevin Rudd or John Howard occupies the Prime Ministership; it behoves everybody in this parliament to understand that we are here to serve the Australian people, not to serve our own personal egos, and there is a complete obsession -  - Here's the humble member for Lilley. - It is very clear. When I cease to be the leader of the Liberal Party it would be my expectation, and my belief, that I should be succeeded by the deputy leader and Treasurer, Peter Costello. But I have also acknowledged that that is not my gift; it is the gift of the federal parliamentary Liberal Party - as, indeed, the position I hold was not the gift of my predecessor; it was the gift of the federal parliamentary Liberal Party. I will add one thing. I remind those who sit opposite: we will not live the lie of 1990. Let it always be remembered that my two predecessors entered into a secret conclave and they lived a lie to the Australian people through the entirety of the 1990 election campaign. And it will ever be to the shame of the Australian Labor Party that they were part of that miserable deception and that miserable conspiracy.Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Riverina for her question. Of course she, along with many other members in the Liberal and National parties, constantly has the interests of Australian farmers and rural Australia at heart. The Australian Labor Party are busy getting rid of the one and only farmer they did have and replacing him with another trade union official. I say to the member for Riverina, as I have been able to say to farmers around Australia already, that earlier today I announced an additional $430 million in drought assistance measures to provide security to farmers in the grip of the worst drought on record, many of whom face a very unhappy and uncertain situation over the coming spring.Today's announcement will extend the 38 areas of agricultural production currently EC declared until March 2008 through until September 2008. That will provide plenty of advance warning and assurance to those farmers who are sorely in need of both our understanding and our assistance, although that understanding and assistance and the need for it falls far short of their desperate need for Mother Nature to provide some rain. This particular extension alone will cost some $340 million.I might also inform the House that there are many farmers in Western Australian agricultural zones and in Tasmania outside already declared areas that have experienced low rainfall for the past 18 months and have a less than 50 per cent chance of receiving average rainfall in the next three months. However, they are not currently covered by EC declarations. These farmers are facing the very grim prospect of a second consecutive failed season, so today I have announced interim EC assistance for those further areas of Western Australia and Tasmania. This will provide access to income support to approximately an additional 4,000 farmers in these two states and it will allow the state governments to focus their efforts on completing applications for full exceptional circumstances assistance, which includes interest rate subsidy payments. Importantly, this will mean there is no delay in payments to farmers while state governments prepare their paperwork. The estimated cost of this additional measure is some $90 million.The government continues, and I thank my colleague the minister for agriculture on this matter, to have under consideration some other proposals that have been put to it by the National Farmers Federation and others to see whether there should be some further alterations to those already announced by the government to the operation of the exceptional circumstances assistance. Let me say to the farmers of Australia: we will stand, as a government, shoulder to shoulder with you through this terrible drought. Fortunately, this nation is strong enough fiscally and strong enough economically to give help to our fellow Australians so desperately affected by this terrible drought.</DOC>

 - First, can I thank the honourable member for her question. I can confirm, as I think everyone in the House knows, that a One-Two-Go Airlines flight from Bangkok to Phuket tragically crashed on its arrival in Phuket yesterday afternoon. The details of the crash and the cause of the crash remain unclear and the number of those killed has not yet been confirmed, though there are estimates coming from the Thais that 87 people have been killed and perhaps somewhere in the vicinity of 43 injured and that quite a number of those who have been killed are foreigners.The Thai authorities have now provisionally identified one of the victims as an Australian. But, because of the uncertainty about the identification process, the Thai authorities are proceeding with further disaster victim identification methodology, in particular DNA assessment, so this process could take quite some time. Obviously, both under international protocols and for perfectly understandable other reasons, it is important that they get this process right.The Australian Federal Police are willing to provide a disaster victim identification team to assist the Thais with all of the disaster victim identification work that they have to do. The Federal Police have good experience of working with the Thais in this area: they did so during late 2004 and early 2005 in response to the tsunami. So my department is now putting the offer to the Thais and the AFP team is at the ready to go.I can also confirm that an Australian has been hospitalised with non-life-threatening injuries and our honorary consul in Phuket is providing consular assistance. Also, a consular officer has arrived in Phuket from Bangkok and another consular officer from Bangkok is on his way there. It is possible that other Australians may have been on the flight but at this stage we are not able to confirm that, and consular officials are seeking to confirm the nationality of the passengers unaccounted for. The manifest does not detail the nationality of the passengers because this was a domestic flight, not an international flight, so reconciling our passport and immigration records with names is obviously an insufficient way of establishing someone's nationality and the appropriate identification and a good deal more work will need to be done. But at this stage we are not able to confirm that any other Australian has been deleteriously affected or has been killed.As I have said, we are reinforcing our consular presence in Phuket. We are very conscious of the fact that there are a large number of Australians living in Thailand. Well over 3,000 of those people are registered with our embassy, and about 300 of them live in Phuket. There are probably more than 300 Australians living in Phuket but 300 of them are registered with our embassy. So this is a very tragic event, we are very happy to provide assistance to the Thai authorities as best we can, which is through the provision of a disaster victim identification team, and we will continue to provide extensive consular assistance to those Australians affected.</DOC>

 - I do not really have a lot to add to the answer I have previously given but since the Leader of the Opposition asked me the second question and before he asks me the third question I happened to come across in my files a very colourful - no, I won't say it is colourful; it is not very colourful as it is rather dully written - booklet that says, 'Queensland the smart state: water for the future'. Now this is a very expensive booklet that was widely publicised by the Queensland government. It puts me in mind of the Labor Party's three-mines uranium policy, which really said that there was good uranium - that is the uranium you get out of the three mines that were opened under Labor governments - and there is bad uranium - and that is all the other - so I suppose that, if you sort of plagiarised that description to government advertising, this is good government advertising, because it is Labor government advertising, and any other government advertising is bad advertising because it is not Labor government advertising. I rest my case. - Yes, Mr Speaker.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Greenway for asking me a question regarding the practical response to the shortage of nurses in Australia which I announced on Friday at the St George Private Hospital, along with the Minister for Health and Ageing. What this very practical policy does not involve is the establishment of a committee or an agency; it just involves doing something.I saw the Leader of the Opposition with his pseudo-American, ersatz launch of the campaign on Saturday. There he was, complete with - what do you call them? - teleprompters, rear vision mirrors, those things that have your words printed on them. I thought to myself, 'Here is American politics, arrived in Australia big-time.' I thought I was the bloke who was too close to the Americans! You could have fooled me, Mr Speaker.Anyway, let me return to something that is far more important than the Leader of the Opposition's meeting in Penrith, and that is the practical announcement I made on Friday, along with the health minister, to establish 25 Australian hospital nursing schools at a cost of $170 million over five years. What this will do is allow young men and women to leave school and start working as a nurse immediately. So, far from it being a return to the old days, it is an embrace of a common-sense approach. I have been greatly encouraged by the positive reaction to this proposal from so many men and women in the nursing profession. This will provide enrolled nurse hospital based training within major public and private hospitals at diploma or advanced diploma level.What the government will do is fund infrastructure for on-site educational facilities and pay for up to four clinical training staff at each participating hospital. Over five years we will provide $20 million in wage subsidies to provide incentives to students. It will be $500 a student per week to hospital nursing schools for the first three months that the young man or woman is undertaking the training, recognising that in those first three months the hospital will need some financial help in order to engage them. We will pay a tax-free $1,500 commencement bonus and a $2,500 completion bonus per student, paid to each hospital nursing school, plus the direct payment to students - the tax-free bonus - of $2,000 after six months and a further tax-free bonus of $3,000 on completion.We expect more than 500 students undertaking training alone in those 25 schools each year. These places, let me stress, are over and above the places provided through the university system. They include the 3,700 new commencing nursing places since 2005, which will grow to over 10,100 by 2011. It also includes the 395 new commencing university places announced by the Minister for Education, Science and Training last week. We have increased funding for nursing clinical training from $690 to $1,045 per nursing unit of study and we have increased the per student funding for university based nursing courses next year by $109 per student. Therefore, in total last week we increased nursing training places by some 900 - and that, incidentally, is broadly consistent with the call by the Australian Nursing Federation and other peak nursing groups for 1,000 initial nursing places for training from 2009.I mention that because the Leader of the Opposition, in a negative way, was bagging this proposal, saying it was wrong, saying it was a lurch back to the 1950s. Yet I have in my possession a letter dated 13 August 2007, over the joint signatures of Jill Iliffe, the Federal Secretary of the Australian Nursing Federation; Rosemary Bryant, the Executive Director of the Royal College of Nursing; Karen Cook, the Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Nursing and Midwifery Council; Sally Goold, the Chairperson of the Congress of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Nurses; John Daly, Chair of the Council of Deans of Nursing and Midwifery; and Barbara Vernon, the Executive Officer of the Australian College of Midwives. All of these organisations together wrote to the minister and said what they wanted was an additional 1,000 fully funded places each year beginning in 2009. The combined announcements I made and the minister made last week provide 900 of that 1,000. So for the life of me I do not know what the Leader of the Opposition was getting at last week when he attacked this proposal.This is a practical response to a difficult issue. It will encourage people to go straight from school. People who want to be nurses can become nurses from day one. They will have the opportunity of experiencing what it is like from the very beginning. If they do not like it, they will give it away, but they will not have to spend some 18 months to two years at university before having any real interaction with a hospital for a sustained period of time. It makes common sense to provide an additional stream, and I want to commend the minister for working up this proposal. He has brought his customary energy to it and I think it is going to be widely accepted in the Australian community. I do not for the life of me know what the Leader of the Opposition was getting at last Friday.</DOC>

 - It is quite obvious that the Leader of the Opposition did not listen to the last answer I gave. I actually announced something. I did not announce the establishment of 'Infrastructure Australia'. I did not announce the establishment of a 'National Health and Hospitals Reform Commission'. Can I say to the Leader of the Opposition that spin and process is no substitute for substance.I have done a little bit of homework and I have gone through some of these lists. Every time the Leader of the Opposition opens his mouth he establishes a new committee or a new inquiry. We have got, for example, the new 'Department of Homeland Security'; we have got the new 'Department of Innovation, Industry, Science and Research'; we have got the new 'Minister for Housing and Urban Development'; we have got 'Coast Guard'; we have got 'FairWork Australia' -  - We have got the 'Office of Climate Change'; we have got the 'Office of National Security'; we have got the 'Office of Work and Family'; we have got the 'Office of Early Childhood Education'. And, as for inquiries, we have got a cost of living, pressures for older Australians inquiry; we have got a grocery inquiry; we have got the Garnaut climate change inquiry; we have got the federal and state relations review -  - The opposition leader asked me about the structure of government - so I go on. We have got a review of federal and state relations; we have a review of defence bases; we have got a review of ADF pay and conditions; we have got a review of government innovation and industry assistance programs -  - Instead of announcing inquiries, we actually announced proposals - we actually announced a plan or a policy. If the Leader of the Opposition had been thinking about nurses, he would have announced another inquiry, and he would no doubt have had that spokesman from the Nursing Federation that attacked our proposal as the first person to fill a position on the inquiry so he would know what was the result. I do not want to bore the House, but this list goes on and on. Can I say that in Australian politics at the present time there is only one list longer than this and that is the list of the former trade union officials that will constitute the federal parliamentary Labor Party, irrespective of the result, after the next federal election.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Boothby for his question. I can tell him that today Standard and Poor's reaffirmed Australia's foreign currency sovereign credit rating at AAA, which is the top credit rating that can be given. Why does it matter what a sovereign credit rating is? It matters for this reason: if the sovereign rating is the ceiling, all private borrowers work back from that. If the sovereigns are downgraded in credit ratings, banks and other financial institutions that borrow are also downgraded. They do not go higher than the sovereign. At AAA for foreign currency, Australia is now at the top of the international ratings agencies. Standard and Poor's said:Australia has one of the best fiscal positions globally, distinguished by high funding of government pension liabilities and low gross debt estimated to be 4.4 per cent of GDP.Of course, in net terms we have no debt. That is because the government has paid off Labor's $96 billion of net debt. The high funding of government pension liabilities is a consequence of this government establishing the Future Fund, which is now funding liabilities into the future.It was not always the case that Australia had a AAA credit rating on foreign currency sovereign issues. We were first downgraded in 1986 when the then Labor Treasurer talked of this country becoming a 'banana republic'. And it bears remembering back to those days - I do not think anybody would suggest that Australia is a banana republic today. -  - I did hear a voice from the past, the member for Brand, out of his Rip van Winkle-like sleep from the back, interjecting in support of the Labor Party and its downgrading of Australia's credit rating in 1986. Who today would describe Australia as a banana republic? Yet that is the way the Treasurer of the country was describing Australia under Labor in 1986. We were downgraded a second time, incidentally, in 1989. In 1989 Australia was downgraded a second time when the Treasurer of the country then told us we were heading for 'the recession we had to have'. We were downgraded in 1986, we were downgraded in 1989, and it was the election of the Liberal and National parties that determined to do something about it. We recovered that first downgrading in 1999 after we had balanced Australia's budgets and we recovered that second downgrading in 2003 after we had paid off Labor debt. This took hard work. When we decided to restore Australia's credit ratings we did not set up a committee; we did not say we would set up a committee to have inquiry or an investigation into what had to be done here in Australia. We set about hard work, balancing our budget, repaying debt, setting up the Future Fund, getting this country back on the footing that it deserves to be on so we can have opportunities in the future.The one person who had no part at all in any of the great economic reforms in this country was the Leader of the Opposition - standing in the way, opposing every hard step that had to be taken. He had no part in the work that got Australia to where it is now, and there would be no reason to trust him to do the hard work which is required to get us to where we want to be in the future. We want to be a positive, prosperous country with room for all and on a strong financial footing. The Leader of the Opposition has no part in that vision for Australia's future.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Moreton for his question. I recognise what a great job he has done in representing the constituents of Moreton for many years, particularly given his 37-year history as a local in the area. He knows the people he represents - he is in sync with their aspirations and, having worked in the private sector, he knows what it is like to make a quid. That obviously cannot be said of his Labor opponent, who is another former union boss. His opponent has been put up in the electorate of Moreton. He does not know the constituency - the people in the electorate of Moreton. The member for Moreton has done a fantastic job over the years in advocating their interests.The member for Moreton asked about our national road and rail plan. In this year's budget we announced a further $22.3 billion to add to the existing $15 billion that is currently being spent on road and rail infrastructure across Australia. As a result of good economic management and running budget surpluses over the past 10 years, we can afford to spend money on infrastructure in Australia. We are in the process of investing $38 billion in infrastructure across Australia, including on relatively small projects such as the level crossing in Moreton between Beaudesert Road and the main north-south rail link at Acacia Ridge. It is only $25 million, but it is a piece of infrastructure that the member for Moreton has fought to achieve for a number of years to remove a major safety issue on Beaudesert Road. Those are the sorts of things you can achieve in office, particularly when you run a strong economy - you have the ability to spend money, without having to borrow it, on infrastructure that is very much needed across Australia.The government's plan goes right across all categories of roads and rail. It is about improving highways, making them safer, making them more efficient, driving the Australian economy and making it more prosperous. It also improves safety conditions on local roads for mums and dads taking their kids to school. Those are the sorts of things we are doing as a result of a well-run economy.The alternative that has been proposed by the Australian Labor Party, if they happen to win office later on this year, is another bureaucracy - another inquiry. Instead of making decisions, they will have an inquiry for 15 months to find out what the priorities are. And the member for Batman will probably chair it! There will be a 15-month freeze on decisions, when costs are escalating and when there is a demand for investment to be made right across Australia. So, along with the 50 or so other committees, inquiries and bureaucracies that the Leader of the Opposition has announced, Labor will do the same with infrastructure investment: they will freeze decision-making so they can have a further inquiry. What Labor is offering is the establishment of committees and further inquiries to look at the options. Establishing committees in order to put off decisions is weak leadership. It is not strong leadership; it is weak leadership. - That is what the Leader of the Opposition is offering Australia. The coalition government is offering strong, decisive leadership and investment - investment that we are proving we can do as a result of running a strong economy in Australia.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Bass for his question, and I wish him well in the election. I assume that he is running against a union official in the forthcoming election; there is a 70 per cent chance that he will be, and I wish him very well. - The member for Bass asked me about steps the government has taken to reform Australia's tax system. The government has cut tax in the 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007 budgets. As a consequence of that, if you are on an annual income of $30,00 today you will be paying a top marginal tax rate of 15 per cent. Under the Labor Party, if you were earning $30,000, you were paying a top marginal tax rate of 34 per cent - which is more than double. If you are on $50,000 today, you will be paying a top marginal tax rate of 30c in the dollar. Under the Labor Party you were paying a top marginal tax rate of 47c in the dollar.In addition to that, the government introduced GST to abolish wholesale sales tax and nine other state taxes. The government cut company tax. The government halved capital gains tax for individuals. The government cut petrol excise and abolished indexation. The government has introduced the childcare tax rebate, the mature age workers tax offset and the senior Australians tax offset; and the government has abolished all taxes for people over 60 who take superannuation from a taxed fund. This is light years from the tax system that the Labor Party used to run. Strangely enough, we did not implement those tax reforms by setting up a committee. We did not sit around and say we would have a council. What this government actually did was: we took some decisions and we fought for reductions in tax.When we were fighting to reduce taxes, I did not notice anybody in the Labor Party assisting. In fact, we heard the Leader of the Opposition - with surely one of the more inane speeches ever delivered in this parliament - calling tax reform a day of fundamental injustice which would live in infamy throughout the centenary of the Australian parliament. - That is a very good question, because I have been asked if I am aware of any alternative policies, and the answer is: I am not. Certainly the Labor Party have no tax policy, and judging from what the Deputy Leader of the Opposition was asked on Sunday, and the way she floundered around in answering it, they have still not decided whether or not they will have a tax policy at the next election.The member for Lilley, who is charged with being Treasurer in a future Labor government, said this to the National Press Club on 16 May:I am not anticipating taking forward any significant change to the personal income tax system at this stage.We have a Labor Party which has opposed every tax reform in the last 10 years, we have a Labor Party which has not even made up its mind whether or not to have a tax policy, and we have a Leader of the Opposition who has no economic credentials whatsoever. Let me remind the House that when this government introduced the $600 annual payment for the family tax benefit, the member for Lilley - the shadow Treasurer - went around Australia saying that it was not real money. This payment was paid to every eligible family in Australia and, rather than have to admit that he wanted to abolish it, he walked around Australia saying that it was not real. This is what you get from a political apparatchik: somebody who repeats a rhetorical line over and over again rather than engaging in substance. The people of Australia are interested in substance. They are interested in $600 payments that go into bank accounts and can pay bills for their children. They are interested in getting taxes lower. They are interested in tax reform, they know that the heavy economic lifting in this country has always been done by this government, and they will not trust a policy or a party that does not have any answer whatsoever to that policy.</DOC>

 - The member for Braddon was a champion local footballer and now he is the champion fighter for health services in north-western Tasmania - the best fighter for health services in north-western Tasmania that they have ever had in that area.I say to the member for Braddon and to the House that the Commonwealth's proposal for the Mersey hospital is certainly not about swapping one lot of public servants for another lot of public servants. This is about a better way of running public hospitals - a way of running them in response to local patients and local clinicians rather than in response to distant bureaucrats. People do not really care who runs public hospitals; they just want them better run, and that is what this Commonwealth proposal is all about - a better run public hospital at the Mersey in Tasmania.I should point out to the House that the Tasmanian government is already spending the money that it will no longer need to spend on the Mersey hospital. I am pleased to inform the House that negotiations between Commonwealth and state officials are progressing well. But I do say to the Tasmanians that they should not hold up this agreement. They should not delay this agreement, because the Leader of the Opposition has opposed it from the start and, if he ever gets into government, there is no guarantee of any additional health funding for north-west Tasmania.I have been asked about alternative policies. Funnily enough, it is another talkfest. If you look at Labor's policy, you see that they have announced a national health reform commission, a health and hospital advisory group, a national preventative healthcare strategy supported by a task force, a national commissioner for elderly people and a preventative healthcare partnership with the states and territories, and they have called for a review of regulatory regimes for complementary medicines, a review of the Medicare schedule for midwives, a review of Medicare psychiatric consultations and a review of medical research ethics guidelines. But all the reviews in the world do not make a single policy. And you can have any number of talkfests, but all the talkfests in the world do not deliver a single extra doctor, a single extra nurse or a single extra hospital bed.The Leader of the Opposition did, however, come up with one concrete policy. He said the other day that Labor would establish a $2 billion fund to improve public hospitals. He also said on that day:We either have a solution for the total health system or we are simply cherry picking bits out of it to make a political point.Since then he has done nothing but cherry pick. This fund has been raided on at least three separate occasions since then. He raided the fund to the tune of $220 million to set up alleged super clinics; he raided the fund for PET at Newcastle; he raided the fund for an MRI at Cairns; and I presume he is going to spend $450 million on aged care by raising the fund. When the Leader of the Opposition stands up and says that he has a $2 billion fund for public hospitals, that is a lie. It is an outright lie. What he has is a $1.3 billion health slush fund that is falling fast. - Whenever he stands up and says he has a $2 billion public hospital fund, it is a lie, because he has already raided that fund - $220 million for GP clinics, $450 million for aged care as well as sundry other electorally specific announcements. It is a $1.3 billion health slush fund and it is falling fast. - Mr Speaker, let me just make the point that these claims from the Leader of the Opposition are typical of the kind of slipperiness we get from this bloke, who never says quite what he means and is never exactly what he seems. The more people see and hear of this man, the more obvious it is that he is a phoney. That is why he can never be trusted with Australia's great Medicare system.</DOC>

 - The first part of the honourable member's question has a false premise in it because the statement he has made about spending on climate change is simply wrong. The government has committed $3.5 billion -  - We have spent and committed $3 billion to $3½ billion directly on climate change mitigation and a gigantic amount of money in addition to that to climate change adaptation. The $10 billion National Plan for Water Security alone can be viewed as the single largest climate change adaptation measure of its kind anywhere in the world. - As far as the 'climate clever' campaign is concerned, the honourable member asked what was the cost between inception and cancellation. I do not know whether the honourable member in his efforts to minimise energy usage has sold his television set, but the campaign is underway now and it is on television. - The brochures will be mailed out to people who request them and they will be distributed in newspapers. We have made a decision to get the maximum coverage of these important issues. We are all committed, I thought, on both sides of the House to energy efficiency, but apparently not on the Labor side of the House. - How else can we encourage households to be efficient in their use of energy without telling them what options are available to them? Both the first and second parts of his answer are built on a false premise.</DOC>

 - In response to the member for Solomon, in simple terms we did this because it is in Australia's interest. It is in the interest of all Australians that we all get treated equally under the law and under the Constitution - that we are one under the national flag. In fact, the rights that would have been conferred upon some Australians over others as a result of the Draft Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples would have done more to split Australians, to damage reconciliation and to put one group of Australians in a privileged position over and above others.Let me demonstrate, Mr Speaker: this declaration would provide a particular group with the right to veto decisions of a democratically elected parliament. This is not something that the Howard government would countenance. Secondly, it would provide rights over land that could override legitimate interests in land held by others and open up the question of compensation. Thirdly, it would place customary law in a superior position to national law. This is the very reason that New Zealand's Maori Affairs Minister also said that the declaration was not compatible with New Zealand law. Nor is it compatible with Australian law.I was asked if there were any alternative approaches to this issue. There clearly have been many alternative approaches to this position by the Leader of the Opposition and by his spokesperson, the member for Jagajaga. In the Weekend Australian on Saturday we saw that the member for Jagajaga committed a Rudd government to making Australia the 144th signatory to the protocol. In other words, Labor supports these very divisive measures that would split and provide one set of rights for one group of Australians against others. I thought at the time 'How long would it take before the member for Jagajaga was again pulled back into line and that we would see a lack of leadership on the Labor Party's side as they went backwards and forwards - flipped and flopped - between one position and another?' I did not have to wait long because here on Monday the Australian newspaper reported that the member for Jagajaga said that Labor, if elected, would probably not draft the laws needed to support the declaration - more they were aspirational.What does that actually mean? It means that you are trying to be all things to all people. Real leadership, not new leadership, is when you have a position, you take it and you argue it in the nation's interest - in the interest of all Australians. You do not form a committee. You do not form a task force to report some time later. You do not have one position on Saturday and another one on Monday. You have a position, you stand by it and you argue it in the nation's interest. Labor seems incapable of doing it. New leadership is not weak leadership; it is not indecisive leadership. What we have from the other side is no leadership - no leadership whatsoever on the issue of Indigenous affairs. Over the last 12 months, we have seen the Labor Party in one instance vote against the government's legislation in the House. They opposed the crimes amendment bill which removed customary law as a mitigating factor in bail and sentencing hearings in Commonwealth matters. That was just one year ago. Last month they reversed that position by supporting the Northern Territory intervention legislation, which included the ruling out of customary law as a mitigating factor.Then on Saturday, we had the member for Jagajaga saying on behalf of the federal Labor Party that the Labor Party would endorse this UN declaration and ratify the rights of Indigenous people, which would have put customary law above the law for all other Australians. Then today, Monday, we have yet again a different position being cast. They are casting around trying to be all things to all men and walking both sides of the street. Real leadership is something that only the Howard government has demonstrated when it comes to Indigenous affairs.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dobell for his question. It is always a delight to visit the member for Dobell in his electorate. He is one of the hardworking members on this side and a very good member of parliament. I note in passing, of course, that his opponent, once again, as we expect from the Labor Party each time now, is yet another union hack. These people want to turn the House of Representatives into the Trades Hall Council.Today I had the pleasure of launching the new Australian citizenship test. It was appropriate to do today because this is Australian Citizenship Day. Most Australians, I believe, would agree with the proposition that Australian citizenship is a privilege, not a right, that citizenship of this country requires an overriding commitment to Australia, to our values, to our laws and to our community. It is important therefore that people who wish to become Australian citizens understand and demonstrate a commitment to the values that guide us and how our society works.These values, which are in the new Australian citizenship resource material, are, I believe, common and unite Australians - values such as respect for the freedom and dignity of the individual, support for Western liberal democracy, and commitment to the rule of law, parliamentary democracy and equality of men and women, among other things. The Australian government has also decided that applicants for permanent visas and provisional visas which lead to permanent visas will be expected in future to sign a statement that they will respect certain values, including the ones I have outlined, and obey Australian laws before being granted a visa.The honourable member for Dobell asked me whether there are any alternative policies. When the citizenship test was announced, the Leader of the Opposition ducked that issue and said on 13 December 2006:... on Mr Howard's precise list of values, we'll spend some time working our way through those and also his list of rights and responsibilities, I want to subject those to some careful examination as well.Here we are nine months later and we are yet to hear what the Leader of the Opposition values in this regard. No doubt if he gets asked a question about it today he will say, 'I'll set up a committee to tell me what they should be.' We know that, while the Leader of the Opposition ducked the question, some people in the Labor Party were setting out what the Labor Party really thinks. I see that the member for Banks said in parliament on 21 May:This test that is being introduced by this government is a disgrace. - Absolutely a disgrace! Good to hear it again from the member for Banks. He believes in something, unlike the Leader of the Opposition. He went on to say on 21 May:The test is the first thing that should be repealed when there is a change of government; it should not decide who becomes an Australian citizen.Here we have the real voice of the Labor Party - the member for Banks who actually believes in something and has the guts to come out and say what he believes in, rather than the Leader of the Opposition, who is simply dodging the question once again. What we have here is one more example of the distinct pattern which is emerging so far as the opposition is concerned. Once again we see Mr Rudd, the Leader of the Opposition, say one thing, or in this case not say anything, while his colleagues give voice to the real views of the Labor Party. The Leader of the Opposition dodges issues. He has dodged the issue. If he does not dodge issues, he says, 'We'll set up a committee,' or, 'We'll set up a review.' The Australian people deserver better. - The honourable member knows that the test is confidential. He fully well knows that. -  - I was quoting from a confidential document but, on a point of order, the honourable member fully well knows that the values are set out in the resource booklet, which is available.</DOC>

 - My position is this - and I will say it very slowly so that the member for Fraser might take it in; I will start at the very beginning while the member for Fraser can take it in: if I am re-elected and my government is re-elected I will serve my full term. - I know you do not like that. I would also remind the member for Fraser that the answer to which he referred -  - was given in interview on Wednesday, not on Thursday. Your original question was wrong.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hinkler not only for the question but for his tireless work for the veterans' community. He is a terrific advocate for the veterans not only in this parliament but within the Howard government. Last week at the RSL National Congress in Melbourne the Prime Minister announced a comprehensive $330 million package to assist veterans. This package said that, from March 2008, all veterans' affairs disability pensions will be referenced to both CPI and male total average weekly earnings in the same manner that the service pension is currently indexed. In addition, the general rate table, the table of compensation that is paid for pain and suffering and loss of function, will be increased by five per cent for all of the table from March 2008, and that will benefit some 140,000 disability pensioners. In addition, more than 13½ thousand veterans who receive the extreme disablement adjustment payment, which is for people with profound lifestyle impacts from their service related conditions after their working life, will also receive a fortnightly increase of $15 from March 2008. These are real, substantial benefits for the veterans' community. Not only were these announcements extremely well received on the night; the veterans' community has acknowledged and recognised what a terrific package it is, including 'Blue' Ryan from the TPI Association. 'Blue' is not well at the moment; we wish him well with his recovery.What we also saw at the RSL National Congress was the spectacle of how Labor is developing its policies. Whilst the Prime Minister was making this substantial $330 million commitment, the Leader of the Opposition and his shadow spokesman were carving out swathes of the Leader of the Opposition's speech, realising that the package that the Prime Minister had offered was infinitely superior and infinitely more principled and would deliver real benefits beyond the policy that Labor had announced only hours earlier. To hang out the shadow spokesman in the way the Leader of the Opposition did, who was spruiking the ALP policy three hours earlier, only to see the Leader of the Opposition junk half his speech, junk the fourth effort Labor had at veterans' affairs disability pension policy, to embrace what the government had done was quite a spectacle. Then, some three days later, I found a request to my office from the opposition saying, 'Can you share with us the detail of the package and the costings and how it actually works - and the projections?' Is that the action of an economic conservative? I do not think so. They are reckless actions. At least, to the credit of the Leader of the Opposition, he has decided that 'me too' is the right way to go when it comes to veterans' affairs policy. - To so fulsomely embrace what the Prime Minister announced and then ditch the fourth effort of the ALP policy on the run was quite a spectacle to see. I understand why the opposition are unsettled by this. Their $55 million policy lasted a handful of hours - their fourth go at it. But, more particularly, what became clear was just how unprincipled the Labor Party is in going about its policy development. It got it wrong four times, ditched its own policy, less than a day old, embraced what the government was doing and then wondered what it had actually embraced. Is it the kind of 'echonomics' we are going to see more of as we go towards the election? Contrast this: the sound, principled leadership of the government; the sound policies; the substantial benefits that are forthcoming; and the costed, credible, committed action agenda of the government versus the reaction and the political spin of the Leader of the Opposition. I think the veterans' community has every right to be completely sceptical of all that Labor says about this subject - promises on the run. It is not even clear what the policy represents, and that builds on the terrible track record of Labor in veterans' affairs. We cannot be certain that Labor is not going to change again.What we can be certain about, as the Treasurer has outlined, is that MTAWE wage related benefits are most beneficial when the economy is strong, when there is strong real wages growth. We do not have to think back very far to remember the period of negative real wages growth under the former Labor government. MTAWE is not worth anything when you have negative real wages growth, as we had under the former government. So my message to the veterans' community is clear: if you want principled leadership, sound policy, substantial benefits and, above all, costed, credible and committed policy, stick with the coalition; MTAWE benefits will be there, the economy will continue to grow and you will not risk what Labor did to the veterans' affairs portfolio when they were last in office.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, in reply to the Leader of the Opposition, I refute, reject and repudiate his claim about the axing. I also deny absolutely that the long waiting lists are the fault of my government. They are the fault of state governments. Ever since the Leader of the Opposition -  -  - Ever since the member for Griffith assumed his current position, he has been talking about ending the blame game. His definition of the blame game is that it is okay to blame the Commonwealth but never the states, because they are all Labor. So when he talks about ending the blame game, what he is really saying is: 'Never attack a Labor government, but it is perfectly okay to attack a federal Liberal government.' If he imagines that by using that kind of invocation I am going to be restrained from legitimately pointing out the failures of eight state and territory Labor administrations around this country, he has got another think coming. Public dental health has from time immemorial been a responsibility of the states. The 600,000 people on the waiting lists are the fault of the state governments. -  - The Leader of the Opposition asked me whether we will pick up Labor's plan. The answer is no because we have a better plan than Labor has, and that is the plan that was announced in the budget. Of course, what the Leader of the Opposition did not acknowledge in his question is that his plan will cost $290 million and that he will fund it through the abolition of a coalition plan worth $384 million. In other words, he is going to rip $100 million out of dental care. What a phoney!</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. Today the Commonwealth government, the Howard government, gave an unequivocal guarantee to the people of the Northern Territory of our commitment to do all that we can to protect the Indigenous children of the Northern Territory by committing to a $1.33 billion program over the next four years to change the circumstances in which they currently live and give them a brighter and safer future.There are five elements to this plan that the Howard government is totally committed to. First of all, there is policing. There is simply no substitute for giving people security in knowing that there are adequate numbers of police in their midst. The women in particular in the Northern Territory have said long and loud to magistrate Dr Sue Gordon, who is chairing our task force, since she has been up there that nothing else will suffice other than giving them adequate police protection. To that end the Prime Minister has announced that the Commonwealth, beyond this initial phase in which we currently have AFP and Queensland police now on the ground, will provide 66 Australian Federal Police so that we can give a more permanent policing solution to these communities. They will work with the Northern Territory government but they will provide policing and security on the ground in the communities where needed. I want to take this opportunity to thank the AFP, who are doing a great job up there now, and the Queensland police who recently deployed. I would ask that the New South Wales, Tasmanian, Victorian and South Australian governments hasten the deployment of their own forces in the interests of these children. Those forces are desperately needed.In relation to housing, the Commonwealth government is making the single largest expenditure of additional money for housing to the Northern Territory to change once and for all the circumstances in which these children and families grow up. It is simply not good enough that people grow up in what cannot be described as anything other than abject squalor. We are committing $800 million to the Northern Territory alone so that people can be provided not just enough homes but the right types of homes. We are looking at involving local Indigenous people in all aspects of the housing construction. First of all, those people who destroy their own homes will be part of rebuilding their own homes, people who are currently renting will have the opportunity to buy and people who are not paying rent at the moment will be expected to do so under new circumstances in which everyone will be treated the same. This is a growth from $279 million to some $800 million from the Commonwealth government.In the area of jobs, the Commonwealth government has abolished CDEP but has replaced it with $90 million over the next three years to convert what were 'pretend jobs', CDEP jobs, into real jobs - jobs where people in those communities will have respect and where they will be able to do such things as we have now rolled out in Finke and Imanpa: home and community care workers, child-care workers, night patrolmen and municipal services. In addition, we are working with the NT government on a dollar-for-dollar basis to say, 'We will put an additional $30 million on the table if the NT matches it dollar for dollar and takes those NT government services and provides real job opportunities for Indigenous people.' We are talking about 2,000 jobs.In relation to education, the Chief Minister told the Prime Minister and me just recently that there are some 2,000 school-age Aboriginal children in the NT who have never been enrolled in school. What they have now committed to, as they should, is ensuring that there are classrooms, books, desks and teachers for each of those students, and we will hold them to account in this matter. We cannot set some arbitrary figure; we must ensure that every Australian child has the opportunity for an education - English, numeracy and literacy - and that is what we are determined to do.Turning now to the area of health, in my joint announcement today with the Minister for Health and Ageing, he announced an additional $100 million for more doctors, nurses, allied health professionals and specialist services as part of this emergency response. It is not good enough for us to simply acknowledge that there are ear, nose and throat problems, skin problems and nutritional problems. We as the Howard government are committed to recruiting and supporting the doctors and the allied specialists so that we overcome these problems and give these children the sort of future they deserve.The people of the Northern Territory, and the Australian population in general, can be assured that this is an unequivocal commitment from the Howard government. There is no two bob each way, no saying one thing to one group of Australians and something else to others. It is not sending mixed messages about things such as cultural law. 
A government member - No inquiries. - We are determined, as just mentioned by one of my colleagues, to not have an inquiry to look into it. We are committed to action on behalf of securing the future, the health, the wellbeing and the success of Aboriginal communities throughout the Territory.</DOC>

 - The program was introduced by the Keating government to reduce the waiting lists; the waiting lists were reduced and therefore the program had served its purpose. I think what this side of the House would like to know is: what has the Leader of the Opposition done with the missing $100 million? Last night this measure was debated in the House - and be it recorded that the Labor Party voted against a measure providing $384.6 million over four years -  - to assist about 200,000 Australians who are amongst the sickest and most needy in our community, to provide $4,250 worth -  - of Medicare funded dental treatment at a dentist every two years to people with chronic and complex conditions like diabetes, heart disease or cancer who are referred by their GP to a dentist under a care plan. It includes dental assessments, preventative services, extractions, fillings and other restorative work and dentures. It was estimated to cost $384 million over four years.That program is due to start in a few weeks time, and the Labor Party have promised to abolish it and they are going to rip almost $100 million out of dental care for older Australians. They are not going to replace it with their program; they are going to give $290 million to the states. If you look at the way in which public health is managed in this country, why would anybody give Morris Iemma or Anna Bligh or what's-his-name, John Brumby - they change so fast these days I lose track - or Mike Rann, and so it goes on, Commonwealth dollars and take those dollars away from Australians in need of dental assistance?Here is another example of how the Leader of the Opposition operates. He says: 'We won't have a program - that's too hard. We'll abolish our program. We'll take $100 million out of it and we'll hand $290 million to the states.' Let me say: that is no way to run this country. It is no way to run this country to abolish a Commonwealth program, take $100 million along the way and then hand $290 million to the states with no guarantee that the states will spend the money wisely, with no guarantee that waiting lists will be reduced and with no guarantee that the dental health of older Australians will be improved. I think it is a disgrace that the Labor Party voted against a program that is going to bring improved dental health to hundreds of thousands of older Australians, and the Labor Party stands condemned for such a policy.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for McMillan for that question. I note in passing that in 1996 the unemployment rate in the electorate of McMillan was 7.7 per cent; in March of 2007 the unemployment rate in McMillan had fallen to 4.3 per cent. I also note in passing that the honourable member's Labor opponent in the forthcoming election is somebody who balances her current career as an organiser with the shop assistants union with being a heritage officer with the Labor Party. At least there is no conflict of interest in relation to that, but it is typical that so many people who are union officials are candidates for the Australian Labor Party.The member for McMillan asked me: how has our economic policy benefited the Australian economy? The benefits to the Australian economy are strong and evident: the lowest unemployment level in 33 years; the very strong financial position; the esteem and the regard in which this country is held around the world; the capacity of the Australian economy to withstand international economic shocks - and that has been demonstrated on a number of occasions over the last 10 years. What we have in September 2007 is a situation where the best years of Australia will be ahead of this country if we make wise decisions not only about our governments but also about the sorts of policies that ought to be introduced into the future and the way in which we use our current prosperity. The way in which to guarantee that the years ahead of us will be better than the years that have passed is to embrace a government and an approach that are willing to put substance in place of spin and process. If there is one thing that distinguishes this government from the opposition it is our capacity to actually make decisions and to implement them.The member for McMillan asked me about alternative plans. I have in my spare time been doing a little research, thumbing through the files, and I have come across the fact that the Labor Party has announced that it will establish 67 new departments, ministries, commissions, task forces, councils and offices. In case you think I am exaggerating, I will give you some of the detail. There are going to be five in the Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs portfolio. There are going to be four in the Department of Education, Science and Training. There are going to be six in the Department of Health and Ageing. There are going to be five in the Prime Minister's department. There are going to be four - Joe, you do not escape - in the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations. For the man sitting next to Joe, Ian Macfarlane, the Industry, Tourism and Resources portfolio is going to have 10. There are going to be three in the Transport and Regional Services portfolio and there are going to be 11 in the Treasury portfolio. There is going to be one in the Defence portfolio, five in Foreign Affairs and Trade, five in the Environment and Water Resources, one in Immigration and Citizenship, two in the Attorney-General's portfolio, one in the communications portfolio and one in Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry.They are going to establish a whole-of-government body called 'Infrastructure Australia' and they are going to establish a coast-guard - or a 'coastguide', as it was so appropriately called by the foreign minister. Of course, they are going to have a new department of homeland security, which I have to record has been an abysmal failure in the United States. Of course, it is the American example. They keep saying that I am too close to the Yanks but they keep copying the Americans when they want to announce a new portfolio.In addition to that, the Labor Party has announced that, if elected to government, it will establish 96 separate reviews, audits, inquiries and investigations. That is in addition to the 67 new agencies and departments. There will be six in Employment, two in the Environment, 11 in Defence, two in Veterans' Affairs, nine in Industry, two in Agriculture, two in Finance, six in Transport, nine in the Treasury, one in Education, four in Health, seven in Families and Community Services, 10 in the Attorney-General's, nine in Foreign Affairs, nine in Immigration and 12 in Communications, IT and the Arts - including, might I say, 11 in the arts area announced in one go by the member for Kingsford Smith over one weekend. That was probably the weekend he was not allowed to go to Tasmania, when the environment policy was being announced! Then of course there is going to be an omnibus review of federal-state relations. I say to the Leader of the Opposition: that is not how you govern a country.I was reminded in a discussion that I had with the Treasurer a few moments ago that, when we redesigned the Australian taxation system, we did not ask a committee to tell us how to do it. The committee comprised me, the Treasurer, the finance minister, the head of the Treasury and senior officials in the Taxation Office and the Treasury. Day after day, week after week, month after month, we sat in the cabinet room and we made the decisions, we restructured the Australian taxation system, because we happen to take the view that, if you are elected to government, it is the responsibility of the ministers, and not others, to make the decisions about the future of our nation.</DOC>

 - I can inform the member for Gellibrand that there were some flaws in the scheme as it was originally put forward; that is why we have completely restructured it. The problem with the scheme as it was originally put into place was that it only funded consultations. The scheme as it has been revised will fund no fewer than 450 separate dental procedures. The difference between our scheme and Labor's scheme is that our scheme covers everything; Labor's scheme only covers consultations.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Moreton for his question and I certainly appreciate his concerns about the dental clinic at the Queen Elizabeth hospital in his electorate. That dental clinic was all but shut when the Leader of the Opposition was the Director-General of the Cabinet Office in Queensland. I am confident that the member for Moreton's concerns are not shared by the Labor candidate in Moreton, a former union official who is almost certain to be, as the Leader of the Opposition is, a patsy for the ACTU and a patsy for the state Premier.Let me inform the House, for those members who are not aware of it, that legislation is currently going through this parliament to give people with serious dental problems up to $4,250 worth of Medicare funded dental treatment, in a $385 million dental plan that will cover some 450 specific dental items. This is the best news that people with dental problems have had in many a long year, yet I regret to say that the member for Gellibrand got up in this House last night and said that Labor would oppose it. This is a $385 million plan which will start in just a few weeks and Labor want to stop it. Labor want to stop $385 million of dental treatment starting almost immediately. - Today, the member for Gellibrand, along with the Leader of the Opposition, launched what she said is Labor's dental policy, but it was not today's dental policy. What she actually did was relaunch the Keating dental scheme of the mid-1990s, which helped state governments much more than it helped dental patients.This government has a $385 million plan; Labor have just a $290 million plan. Every dollar of this government's plan will be spent on services; much of Labor's money will be spent on state public servants. The government's scheme covers some 450 separate dental items and Labor's scheme will cover just one thing - consultations. - In fact, Labor has been telling us for the last three years that any scheme that just covers consultations does not work, and they have not even learnt from their own critique. In fact, the member for Gellibrand went so far as to mislead the House last night. I do not say she did it deliberately but she certainly misled the House, because she said that by abolishing this scheme she would part fund Labor's dental scheme. Well, $385 million more than funds $290 million, and I want to know: where is the missing $100 million that Labor obviously wants to rip out of dental services?The government's proposal has been on the table since May. You would think Labor would have tried to trump the government's proposal. Any serious opposition does not come in with a smaller scheme; it comes in with a bigger scheme, but the proposal announced today involves less money and fewer services and lasts for a shorter time. I make this prediction very confidently: Labor's decision to vote against $385 million worth of new dental funding will come to be seen as just as silly as the former Leader of the Opposition's decision to vote against tax cuts. Voting against dental treatments is as silly, as perverse and as politically counterproductive as voting against tax cuts. That is what Labor are doing. They are voting against more dental services.The Leader of the Opposition cannot blame the member for Gellibrand for the mess he has got himself into. He knows just how hopeless the states are in this area. He thinks the states are so hopeless that they cannot even be trusted to run public hospitals properly. He wants to rip the public hospitals off the states, but somehow he is going to give them more money to further mismanage state public dental schemes. The Leader of the Opposition, of all people, ought to know that you can do a lot better than the Keating scheme. In 1995, when he was the director-general of the cabinet office and the Keating scheme had been in place for two years, public dental waiting lists in Queensland were still three years long and there were press reports of pensioners on the Gold Coast having to do their own teeth extractions with pliers. That is what they were doing when he was the director-general in Queensland and the Keating scheme was in place. The fact that he wants to put in place today something that he knew was gravely flawed then shows just what a fake and a phoney this Leader of the Opposition is.Leave granted.</DOC>

 - Can I say in reply to the Leader of the Opposition that, whatever delusions of grandeur he may have, prime ministers, or indeed putative prime ministers, cannot suspend the Constitution of this country. Nothing in the reading of a section from the Constitution alters the fact that, to borrow my phrase, for time immemorial the states have provided for public dental treatment. And it was because there were long waiting lists at state dental hospitals that the Keating government introduced a one-off plan. When we inherited a parlous fiscal position in 1996 we took advice. We found that those waiting lists had been reduced and the program, having fulfilled its goals, was therefore terminated.I simply ask: why is the Leader of the Opposition stealing $100 million from a dental program designed to help the elderly, the sick and the chronically ill in this country? Our program is worth $384 million. It will assist 200,000 people. It was opposed in the parliament last night. The shadow minister made it very clear in her speech that the Labor Party would use the $384 million to fund their own plan, and their own plan is only going to cost $290 million. I simply ask: where is the $100 million? How can it be good public policy to take that $100 million from a dental program that is due to start in a few weeks time and replace it with an inferior program that merely gives $290 million to the states? I do not think the quality of public health administration in the states warrants them getting $290 million out of a Commonwealth program worth $384 million. No government in this country is perfect but, when it comes to public health, the most imperfect governments of all are state Labor governments. I would not give them another $290 million. I would keep the $384 million in the Abbott program, which is going through the parliament at the present time, which will benefit 200,000 Australians.I advise the Leader of the Opposition to put away the Constitution and to exercise a bit of common sense. I was fascinated by the lecture I received from Rudd J on the meaning of the Constitution. The truth is that, for time immemorial, states have been looking after public dental clinics. And for time immemorial those state Labor governments have been failing in their responsibilities. Our program will do something practical about it and ought to be supported - it ought not be short-changed. - The Labor Party should be ashamed of itself for taking $100 million away from the dental care needs of older Australians.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Fisher for his question and recognise the important job he does in representing that electorate on the Sunshine Coast in Queensland, a very important tourism destination. Having been a lawyer in private practice and a small business man, he knows how important it is that governments continue to generate growth and prosperity in the economy through investing in infrastructure, which would be lost on his political opponent in the upcoming federal election. If you go to the ALP website to have a look at who the ALP candidate in the electorate of Fisher is, it is a very interesting read. It actually changed. The Labor Party have had the airbrush out again. On 1 September, if you had a look at who the Labor Party opponent to the member for Fisher was, it was Darrell. The website said:He later worked for many years in psychiatric institutions prior to becoming a full-time union official.Of course he was a full-time union official. - So that was on 1 September. Today, if you read the website, it says of Darrell:... starting his working life as a shop assistant, later trying a number of jobs including labourer and telegram boy.Full stop! The bit about being a union official has been airbrushed off the website. I wonder how many other candidates who have that background, which the Labor Party have become quite sensitive about, have had that changed on their website. That is the candidate standing against a former small business person in the electorate of Fisher. - I am just identifying the point that the background of members on this side is overwhelmingly from the private sector and from small business. We understand how important tourism is to the Sunshine Coast in Queensland and how important the investment we are making in infrastructure is to tourism on the Sunshine Coast. I am making the point that that is critical to good representation.The member for Fisher has been a great supporter of the $38 billion program we have undertaken to invest in infrastructure across Australia. He has also been a great supporter of encouraging and facilitating private sector investment in infrastructure across Australia, particularly that which is going to benefit the tourism industry. Today I know that he supported the announcement I made on behalf of the government to approve a $1 billion investment in the Brisbane airport of the new parallel runway, which needs to be started today so it is ready in eight years time, when that airport reaches its capacity as far as inbound tourism is concerned. We need to be able to take these tough decisions when they come along.Brisbane airport is currently managing 17 million passenger movements per year. In 2015, when the new parallel runway is completed, it will be carrying 25 million passenger movements, and in 2035 it is forecast to carry 50 million passenger movements. The economic activity generated by that airport is worth about $17 billion in south-east Queensland. The point I am making is that it takes a small businessman to recognise its value, and that it generates jobs in the community - not union hacks that are going to come into this parliament, if they are elected to represent the Labor Party.In making the decision about the new parallel runway in Brisbane, we have taken into consideration a lot of the environmental and economic concerns in the community: the consultation process that has been undertaken and the design of what is going to be a very significant piece of infrastructure in Brisbane. The draft EIS indicates that there will be 185,000 fewer people affected by aircraft noise as a result of this development compared to what there would be if the current circumstances were allowed to continue with the growth that is forecast. Having parallel runways allows the airport to operate simultaneous opposite direction operations at night on those two runways so that all air traffic is out over Moreton Bay and not over the suburbs of Brisbane. This underpins the government's decision on this.We know the Leader of the Opposition has a position on this. Do you know what it is? It is to have another inquiry about a curfew at Brisbane airport - this is not No. 96 that we are speaking about; this is No. 97 - an inquiry about aircraft noise and a curfew at Brisbane airport. His colleagues in the Labor government in Queensland do not agree with him. They do not want a curfew at Brisbane airport. They see it driving the Queensland economy and want no curfew at Queensland airport. They want this development to go ahead and they want this parallel runway built because that is the way to mitigate aircraft noise around Brisbane.The Leader of the Opposition just wants to set up another inquiry. He is all about setting up reviews and inquiries and forming committees, and that is no recipe for good government. It is no substitute for making tough decisions and it is no substitute for good leadership - and he would not be a good leader of this country.</DOC>

 - The Leader of the Opposition refers to Labor's housing affordability plan. He refers me to it and asks me what I think of it. I can tell you one thing about our plan - it will not involve misleading Rosanna Harris. I do not intend to sit in the kitchen of some person who has been conned into doing an interview with somebody who has tried to sell a plan, look her straight in the face and say, 'You are going to be about 50 bucks a week better off,' when you know that you are lying through your teeth when you say that. The Leader of the Opposition, the alternative Prime Minister of this country, presumably - I think I know the pattern - got in touch with Stanhope's office and Stanhope lined up somebody -  - What happened was that the Leader of the Opposition, knowing that the policy would not benefit Rosanna Harris, told her that it would. That is what happened. He knew it would not benefit her, or, if he did not know it would not benefit, he did not even understand his own policy. He cannot have it both ways. He was either misleading this lady or he did not understand his own policy. He can take his pick. Either judgement condemns the Leader of the Opposition.I am asked about our approach to housing affordability. I am invited by the Leader of the Opposition, with his hand on his heart, not to blame the states. Let me say to the Leader of the Opposition that, where the states are to blame, I will blame them; where the Commonwealth must accept responsibility, I will accept that responsibility.In relation to housing affordability, the overall state of the economy is something for which the Commonwealth is responsible. I am very pleased to say that the thing the overall state of the economy affects more than anything else when it comes to housing affordability is the level of interest rates. I am pleased to report to the House that interest rates under this government have, on average, been 4½ per cent lower than they were under the former government.I am pleased to report to the House that people still remember that interest rates hit 17 per cent under the former government. If anybody thought I was the only person who remembers that, I met a lot of people last weekend and a lot of them mentioned 17 per cent. They remember it.It is our responsibility to look after the general level of economic activity - we accept responsibility for that - but it is not our responsibility to preside over general land releases. It is not our responsibility to set policy in relation to development charges. It is not our responsibility to set stamp duty imposts. It is not our responsibility to impose land tax. Federal land tax in this country was abolished about 40 or 50 years ago.The Leader of the Opposition asks me about rental affordability. One of the reasons we retain negative gearing is to encourage people to invest in rental properties. There is only one side of politics that has ever tinkered with abolishing negative gearing. That was the Keating government. They abolished it for 12 months between 1986 and 1987 and it resulted in a very rapid escalation in rent. That policy was hastily reversed. So I say to the Leader of the Opposition, 'Yes, I will engage in the blame game where blame ought to be apportioned: to those governments that are to blame.' State governments carry a great deal of the responsibility, and the Leader of the Opposition need not imagine that, by some constant reference to the blame game, he is going to discourage us from reminding the Australian people of the failures of state governments in this area.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Deakin for his question. I wish him well in the forthcoming election as he battles another trade union official - an ETU official running for the Labor Party in Deakin.Yesterday the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics tabled a report on home loan lending practices and the processes used to deal with people in financial difficulty. The report said that there should be better protection against inappropriate lending practices and guidance on lending obligations to borrowers facing financial hardship. This government would agree with this. We believe that this is an area where there should be better regulation. In fact, although consumer credit is the responsibility of the states, and the states run the law that governs how much money can be lent and the terms and conditions on which it can be lent, the Commonwealth has offered to take over from the states, on a reference, power in this area if it would help them to deal with the matters. But the states have declined and have set about putting their own improved legislation into place in this area.This has been a long and tortuous process, however, and it has been going on at the state level for about 4½ years. It was in May 2003 that the states' Standing Committee of Officials on Consumer Affairs first established a working group to work in this area. It was in August 2003 that they approved a work proposal. In November 2004 they released a regulation impact statement. In July 2005 they approved, in an out-of-session paper, that they would incorporate changes. In February 2006 they cleared the decision-making RIS and in September 2006 they asked the New South Wales government to draft a bill.That has been going on since May 2003. So you can imagine my surprise this morning to hear the member for Lilley wander up to his doorstop and complain that the Commonwealth had been dilatory in relation to this matter. This has been in the hands of state governments since May 2003. Talk about the blame game! Here is the blame game: the Labor Party looks around for any failure of a state government and then tries to blame the Commonwealth for it. And when you are looking around for failures of state governments you do not have a shortage of material. You have the Queensland government, with its health scandals and water crisis; you have the New South Wales government, which cannot manage a public transport system; you have the Victorian government that has done nothing about water for years; and you have the South Australian government, which is dithering about its desalination plant. These all have one thing in common: they are all Labor governments.If there is anybody in Australia who thinks that you could improve administration in Australia by taking incompetent Labor from a state level to incompetent Labor at a federal level, they need their head read. A bigger point here is - let me tell you - that state Labor, bad as it is, is the First XI of the Labor Party. Federal Labor are more incompetent. It would be hard to believe, but I think the member for Lilley would pale in competence beside such luminaries as Morris Iemma and Anna Bligh.Can I say, regulation of insurance brokers is an important thing. Can I say, again, the Commonwealth stands ready to take the area over on a reference. If the state governments do not want to give the Commonwealth a reference in this area, they should get on with their regulation. This has now been going for 4½ years, and we would like to see some outcome.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kingston for his question and, in the presence of the gallery, say he is undoubtedly the best member for Kingston that this parliament has ever seen. And so says the gallery, Mr Speaker - carried by acclamation!It is well known that the Liberal and National parties believe in keeping taxes low. That is why we have cut income tax. It is why we have cut company tax. It is why we have cut capital gains tax. It is why we got the abolition of financial institutions duty, bank account debits tax, and stamp duty on shares. It is why we abolished all exit taxes on superannuation for people over 60. That was a great breakthrough. As I said to the House yesterday, if you are on $30,000, your top marginal tax rate under the coalition government is 15c, whereas, under the Labor Party, on $30,000 your top marginal tax rate was 34c, which is more than double the coalition rate.There has been a very interesting guessing game going on as to whether or not Labor has a tax policy. There has been a very, very interesting guessing game going on. We had the member for Perth yesterday suggesting that Labor does have a tax policy. He said it has all been prepared and it is ready to go. It is in the hands of the member for Lilley; it is in the coop. He was asked about it by David Speers yesterday:SPEERS: ... you're talking about let's bring on the campaign.  Time's up you said today and yet we haven't seen things like your tax policy.SMITH: Well, and there'll be a whole range of areas both in my portfolio and others where there'll be announcements in the days and weeks_So there is a tax policy! This sent me looking. - Where else would you find a tax policy but in Labor's arts policy! In New directions for the arts, you find on page 6, under the heading 'Supporting Australian Artists', that Labor will review the current state of artists' incomes - add that one to the review! That is No. 68, I think! It says that Labor 'will review the current state of artists' incomes and introduce initiatives that enable artists currently on welfare greater opportunity to produce work'. I will repeat that: artists who are on welfare need greater opportunity to produce work. You might say to yourself, 'If you're on welfare, you would have a lot of time to produce work if you were an artist.' - The member for Kingsford Smith said that I would never have thought of something like this. Well, blow me down! I never have thought of something like this: that somebody on welfare needs more time to produce art! What are the responsibilities of someone who is on welfare? Do they have to turn up at the office at 8 am and take them away from their easel? What exactly is keeping them from producing their art? Here we have the classic rock star turned tax adviser: 'Poor old artists - they are on welfare and they do not have enough time to paint. We had better intervene.'Let me tell you what you do have to do if you are on welfare. Here are your obligations: you have to keep a job diary, which would ask you to record 10 job search efforts every fortnight. I do not think that would get in the way of the next Mona Lisa. I do not think that is so onerous that somebody who is on welfare needs more time to produce their art. Listen to this:Labor will develop a 'Social Security and the Arts' policy that harmonises current Australia Council, Centrelink and Australian Tax Office rules and determines the most equitable way to treat earnings and royalty payments for artists currently receiving welfare.Here we have another major problem in the tax system: if you are on welfare, you have difficulty receiving your royalty payments and they have to be harmonised between Centrelink and the ATO!A lot of people out there who are working hard and paying their taxes think that this is not the No. 1 problem of the Australian taxation system. There are a lot of families that are raising kids that do not think harmonising royalty payments with welfare for artists is the No. 1 priority of an incoming government, and that is because there are a lot of people that think Labor rock stars are not the people who understand where the Australian taxation system has to go in the future. Let me tell you where it has to go: it has to go to looking after families, getting income tax down, making sure people can have jobs and making sure that welfare is available for those that need a helping hand. That is where Australia is and that is where the coalition is.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I know that at the next election he has a trade union official running against him for the Labor Party, and that, I guess, will not come as any surprise to anybody in this House. I think it is fair to say that Australia has an unparalleled record in responding -  - to disasters. Our defence forces, police, aid workers and consular officials are recognised across the Asia-Pacific region as being decisive, professional and compassionate. In April 2007, when the tsunami struck the Solomon Islands and displaced 36,000 people, Australia immediately sent a C130 aircraft, medical supplies, health workers, water, blankets and tents. In May 2006, when the Jogjakarta earthquake struck, we sent surgeons, nurses and other workers, as well as tonnes and tonnes of equipment, to assist. After the Boxing Day tsunami in 2004, Australia's response, coordinated with the United States and Japan, I think could only be described as outstanding, as magnificent.What is impressive is not just the capabilities but the way our agencies are so well coordinated. That is why it comes as a surprise to me, when we have a system which is admired around the world, that the Leader of the Opposition apparently has an alternative policy. It not being sufficient for him to congratulate all of those people who work in this area for the outstanding work they do, he announced in January the establishment of a regional disaster management coordination authority to coordinate national defence and emergency responses - which are extremely well coordinated and work with exceptional efficiency.The Leader of the Opposition - and this is characteristic of him - wants a stunt. He wants something to say. He wants to get a run in the media. So what does he do? He says that he would establish an authority. Let it be repeated that this particular stunt adds to the 67 new departments, committees, boards and councils that the Leader of the Opposition wants to establish, which is on top of the 96 bureaucratic audits and reviews. In all of that, there will be many, many jobs for trade union officials, which, presumably, is the real objective of the exercise over and above the stunt that it involves.This is characteristic of what we are seeing from the Leader of the Opposition. The Leader of the Opposition is not about substance; he is about stunts. I do not think there is any debate about that. He says he wants to have three debates with the Prime Minister, including one on YouTube. We have four days this week in our national parliament - the most important democratic institution in this country. We have gone past 1½ days, and the Leader of the Opposition has so far not proposed any debate in our national parliament whatsoever. Of course, he can ask questions; he can move a censure motion; and he can have MPIs; but there is no debate from the Leader of the Opposition - just on YouTube. YouTube is more important to the Leader of the Opposition than our national parliament.A lot of this comes from California, and America generally. We have Kevin07 replacing Obama'08. That is where that idea came from. I noticed on the weekend - and I think many of you would have - the 'New Leadership' slogan. I thought I had seen that somewhere before. Some honourable members might remember in 1984, in the US presidential election, that Walter Mondale ran 'New Leadership' against Ronald Reagan. That was it - Walter Mondale. That is where the idea comes from. We are California-ising - to avoid the wrong word there - Australian politics on behalf of the Leader of the Opposition.Government in Australia is actually about decisions and substance, not stunts. The Leader of the Opposition offers the Australian public nothing more but phoney stunts, and I think in time the public will become only too aware of it.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Deakin for his question. I ask the Leader of the Opposition to turn around and face the front, please, whilst I give this answer. Those who are watching -  -  - The Leader of the Opposition has turned his back rather than listen to the answer, and I think it would be just as well if he did listen to the answer because I am asked what the tax rates and the tax thresholds are in Australia. As a result of this government's reforms, the tax rates are 15 per cent, 30 per cent, 40 per cent and 45 per cent. Those tax rates apply from $6,000, $30,000, $75,000 and $150,000. So the proper tax rate of 45c applies to your first dollar of earnings over $150,000. That is a much improved tax scale on the one Labor left the country with.On AM this morning the Leader of the Opposition was asked about his tax policy - this elusive tax policy which cannot be published and is not known. He said that the Australian public would be let into the secret of what Labor's tax policy is. I think that the Australian public would like to be let into the secret on what Labor's tax policy is. Since the Labor Party demands on a daily basis that an election be held, they might have the decency to actually release a policy so that people could know what it is.If AM went badly for the Leader of the Opposition, he had one of those 'I wish the ground would open up and just swallow me' days when he went out to Eden-Monaro. After boasting about his tax plan, he was asked a very simple question at his doorstop interview today. He was asked this question: 'The government's tax plan, the tax policy in the budget: can you name for me the rates and the thresholds where those rates kick in?' It was a pretty straightforward question: what are the tax rates and where do they kick in? The journalist said they were of this year, from 1 July.The Leader of the Opposition will keep his back turned throughout this answer because he does not want to front up to his own ignorance on economic policy. This is the answer that the Leader of the Opposition gave when he was asked a very simply question to name the tax rates and the tax thresholds. He said:Well, as of July 1, if you went through the four thresholds, I think the high threshold kicks in I think at $175,000 then I think it cascades down the spectrum.He could not name a single rate, he could not name a single threshold, and the one threshold that he named of $175,000 does not exist. - He could not name a single rate, he could not name a single threshold, and the one that he named of $175,000 does not exist. And then he said:... I think at $175,000 then I think it cascades down the spectrum.Tax thresholds do not cascade. Cascade is a form of beer. It is not a form of tax threshold. This would be amusing if it were not serious. The Leader of the Opposition does not know what the Australian taxation system is. He does not understand it and he should never be put in charge of people's mortgages, their businesses or their jobs.Underneath the glib responses, underneath the media stunts and underneath the practised indifference - where he still has his back turned as if he is in deep conversation about nothing so that he does not have to front up to this ignorance - there is no economic substance. He has never cared about economic policy. He has no interest in it. He has never understood economic policy. He was exposed as a fraud on productivity and we do not hear him talking about productivity very much anymore. And now he has been exposed as being naked when it comes to understanding the tax system.The income tax system raises over $100 billion for government services in this country. If you do not understand the income tax system, you cannot understand the Australian economy. He is a Leader of the Opposition on trainer wheels - not coming to grips with economic policy, not understanding it and not being able to look the Australian people in the eye and say that he has an economic plan. He has no plan because he has no understanding.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Bass for his question. I note, incidentally, that in March 1996 the unemployment rate in Bass was 9.9 per cent. I am now happy to report that it has fallen to six per cent. I also note that the Labor candidate in the seat of Bass in the forthcoming federal election is a former organiser with the Australian Services Union, taking her place inevitably and inexorably alongside all the other former trade union officials who are Labor candidates.Can I also say to the member for Bass that the policy I announced this morning in Queanbeyan - flanked by my colleagues the member for Eden-Monaro; the member for Gilmore, who has campaigned very, very hard on this issue, and to whom I want to pay tribute for her work; and the Minister for Local Government, Territories and Roads, the member for Robertson - was devised without reference to a committee. We actually decided to adopt the policy and we decided to implement it. It means that, from today, we are going to make available some $40 million over a period of four years to fund, up to a cap of $25,000 a bus, the installation of seatbelts in new or retrofitted buses that are used in country and regional Australia. This will be a wonderful addition that will provide additional safety for schoolchildren and additional peace of mind to the parents of those schoolchildren. As we all know, school buses in rural and regional areas travel over longer distances and at higher speeds. Therefore, the risk of accident, the risk of injury and even the risk of death is higher with country school buses than with those in metropolitan areas. This will be available in such a way that at least 375 school buses a year, and at least 1,500 over the four-year period, will get the benefit of this measure. It will provide improved safety for 7.5 million school student bus trips each year.Can I say to the state and territory governments, whose responsibility this really is: please get on with fixing the situation in metropolitan areas. I know that in some parts of Australian cities these seatbelts have been fitted; in other parts, they have not. Where they have been fitted, I say: 'Good on the state governments.' Where they have not been fitted, I say to the state government: 'Provide a basic service to the children under your charge.' I think this is a practical initiative which will result in safer travel for our schoolchildren as they go to school on country roads. It is one of those practical measures immediately operating that this government is very committed to.I want to record my thanks again to the member for Gilmore; the Government Whip; the minister, the member for Robertson; the member for Eden-Monaro; and indeed many other members who have worked very, very hard and have persuaded the government to introduce this long-overdue measure.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Bonner for his question. What a great member he has been for the seat of Bonner. In March 1996, unemployment was 6.7 per cent in Bonner; today it is 3.6 per cent. He has been a great member. He came from a small business background, and I understand that he is up against a Labor candidate who would know nothing about small business because, of course, she has been a Labor staffer - not a union member; a Labor staffer.The Howard government has provided record levels of funding for schools in every year since 1996. I repeat: there have been record levels of funding since 1996 for our schools. This year there will be around $10 billion for our schools. Funding for state government schools particularly has increased by 70 per cent in real terms, even though there has only been a one per cent increase in enrolments over that time. The facts are that 65 per cent of students in state government schools receive 75 per cent of total public funding, 35 per cent of our students attend Catholic and independent schools and those schools receive a total of 25 per cent of public funds.We believe in supporting parental choice. We do not believe in punishing parents for choosing to send their children -  -  - The Howard government believes in supporting parental choice. We do not believe in punishing parents who choose to send their children to a Catholic or independent school.The member for Bonner has asked if there are any threats to this fair support that we provide for parents. I have to tell the member for Bonner: yes, there is a threat, in the form of Labor in lock-step with the Australian education unions. Labor and the unions are ideologically opposed to funding Catholic and independent schools. When they were in government, they had a 'no new schools' policy, which was designed to prevent new Catholic and independent schools from being established. In opposition they had a hit list which was designed to rip money out of particular Catholic and independent schools.After decades of bias against Catholic and independent schools, all of a sudden the Leader of the Opposition pops up and says, 'You must believe that Labor has suddenly changed. It has suddenly changed its spots.' It has not. The unions' unrelenting attacks on Catholic and independent schools -  -  -  -  - As I said, after decades of ideological bias against Catholic and independent school, Labor want us to believe that they have changed their spots. They have not, and I will go on to prove it. - I will tell you what was grossly offensive: the hit list that was going to take money away from Catholic and independent schools. - That was grossly offensive to the parents of the 1.1 million students who attend Catholic and independent schools in this country. The unions' unrelenting attacks on Catholic and independent schools, as demonstrated by the advertisements that they are running, totally misleading advertisements, are also borne out by what the unions say. In a submission to the Senate inquiry into Commonwealth funding for schools, they state this:The Australian Education Union has long opposed any funding to private schools.That is what the Australian Education Union says. In March this year, a press release from the New South Wales Teachers Federation said:The New South Wales Teachers Federation will continue to campaign for_            _            _a redistribution of funds from private schools to public schools.The Australian Education Union is working in lock-step with the Labor Party. Just a few weeks ago the Labor Party adopted the union position on education funding - again this year - and it is now up on their website. The Labor Party's national platform restates the hit list formula. We know it, you know it and the public knows it. I call upon the Leader of the Opposition to publish the list of schools that the Labor Party will take money away from.

 - In reply to the Leader of the Opposition, the OECD report is based on old data and therefore is wrong. The new data shows the very healthy financial position of the university sector. I ask the Leader of the Opposition, who clearly can accumulate a few more facts about things, to bear this in mind: the OECD analysis excludes HECS and other Australian government public subsidies to students. It leaves HECS out. I would have thought that was a fairly fundamental omission, and I would have thought there would be bipartisan agreement that it was a fundamental omission - not a fundamental injustice but a fundamental omission - because HECS was introduced by a Labor government in the 1980s, with the support of the opposition. The report leaves out 75 per cent of our vocational education expenditure, it leaves out our childcare subsidies which support early childhood education, and it also leaves out all new education expenditure since 2004. These facts would have been available to the Leader of the Opposition. He either knew this when he asked the question and was nonetheless prepared to mislead the parliament and the Australian people or, alternatively, he was not adequately briefed by his staff before he raised the matter in parliament. The truth is that this government's record of supporting both public and private education is second to none not only around the world but also in the history of this country. - Let me echo the words of the Minister for Education, Science and Training, seeing that the Leader of the Opposition referred to her remark, and let me endorse emphatically what she said about the bias in the Australian Labor Party, the bias in the trade union movement - the chief bankers of Labor - and the bias in the education unions against government support for Catholic and independent schools in this country. It was Australia's great Prime Minister Robert Gordon Menzies who led the breakthrough for the first time in the history of this country, more than 40 years ago, to give direct financial assistance to Catholic and independent schools. And it will ever be to the credit of this side of politics that we have stood, through those years, shoulder to shoulder with Catholic and independent schools and shoulder to shoulder with Australian parents in their right to choose the school they want to educate their children.We have never had a hit list. There has never been any doubt as to where we stand in supporting local Catholic parish schools. There has never been any double as to where we stand in relation to low-fee independent schools. I remind the Leader of the Opposition, and I remind the member for Perth that, if it had not been for the vote of Senator Brian Harradine in the Senate way back in 1996, the new schools policy of the coalition would never have become law and scores of low-fee independent schools, which are now the schools of choice for thousands of parents in the outer suburbs of the cities of this nation, would never have come into existence. That policy, which we introduced in 1996, was opposed by the Australian Labor Party. They tried to pass a resolution in the Senate to sink the policy and it was only with the support of Brian Harradine - and I record again my thanks to him - that we were able to get that policy through.The Leader of the Opposition, in a rhetorical flourish, held aloft the flawed OECD report, and he said it represented 'fail, fail, fail' on the part of the government. Let me borrow the rhetoric of the Leader of the Opposition and let me say that, when you test him on a knowledge of economics, it represents 'fail, fail, fail and fail again.' His first failure was: he does not understand anything about productivity. A government member - Fail! - That's a fail. His second failure was that he mislead Rosanna Harris about his own rental policy. Thirdly, he misled the electors of Corangamite and all the people of Australia on his trade skills proposal -  
Government members - Fail! - Fail - and now he does not understand the barest fundamentals of the Australian taxation system. So I would say, in relation to the Leader of the Opposition, when it comes to economics, he has four Fs against his name - failures on all of those counts - and I can assure him we are closely counting.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Blair for his question. The member for Blair in his local area is a local hero as far as transport infrastructure is concerned, getting into his area one of the largest investments in road infrastructure that was badly needed because of the lack of attention of the state Labor government in Queensland in looking after the people in the Ipswich area. But the member for Blair has done it. Not only that: under his watch while he has been the member for Blair, we have seen unemployment in that electorate fall from 9.4 per cent to 4.7 per cent. That is a great achievement by the member for Blair. He supports every government decision to invest in infrastructure across Australia and not just in his own electorate.Yesterday, when I announced the approval of a billion dollar investment for a new parallel runway for the Brisbane airport, the member for Blair supported that decision wholeheartedly because he knows what it means for south-east Queensland - it means a boost to the economy in south-east Queensland of $17.2 billion by 2023. He supports economic development and growth because that delivers job opportunities to Australians. We thank him for his support. During the construction phase alone of the new parallel runway at Brisbane airport, 2,700 jobs will be created in Brisbane. That is a significant benefit. But the most significant benefit of this new runway is that it provides the flexibility for the Brisbane Airport Corporation to better manage air traffic in the area. It means that a lot more aircraft will be taking off and landing over Moreton Bay and not overflying the suburbs of Brisbane. That has been stated right through the EIS.Yesterday I predicted that the Leader of the Opposition, off the back of this decision, would immediately announce another inquiry. Guess what: No. 97 is on its way - it was No. 96 yesterday - another inquiry into a possible curfew at Brisbane airport. That was last night and that was from the Leader of the Opposition. He said he would investigate the need for a night curfew at Brisbane airport. But come this morning, when the member for Lilley was being interviewed on Brisbane radio, he announced another new iteration of Labor's policy. When he was interviewed and put under a bit of pressure on this issue on ABC radio to answer whether or not he supported a job-destroying curfew and the inquiry that the Leader of the Opposition had announced, the shadow Treasurer said, 'Labor's curfew policy would not apply if the majority of flights took off and landed over Moreton Bay.' That is a bit of a revelation, given the EIS clearly states that, when the new parallel runway operation starts operating, 85 to 95 per cent of all night-time flights will operate over Moreton Bay. There you have your answer. Your answer is in the EIS, so there is no need for the inquiry. But what it indicates to us is that the Leader of the Opposition cannot make decisions. If he cannot make a decision, you cannot lead this country. If you cannot make a decision, you cannot manage a $1.1 trillion economy. - But I will leave the last comment about leadership and the ability to make a decision to the member for Griffith. He is quoted in an interview that he did with the Courier Mail with Peter Morley. This is a direct quote about him and his ability to lead this nation. The article reads, 'With the increasing influence of the Queensland right on federal politics, the ministry may well be within his reach.' But as for the top job, Mr Rudd said, 'I don't believe I have the goods to be Prime Minister.' We agree.</DOC>

 - I know that at the beginning of question time the Leader of the Opposition is given a script by the tactics committee. But, when you are confronted with the reality that the report on which the script is based is fundamentally wrong and does not contain any of the policy announcements that have been made, initiatives since 2004 - can I just remind him again that the report leaves out -  - 75 per cent of our vocational education expenditure.The member for Gorton then left the chamber. - </DOC>

 - The answer to the Leader of the Opposition is that I have familiarised myself with the Treasurer's statement. I thought it was a very accurate statement that the Treasurer made. What the Treasurer said was that you have a crisis when house prices fall. -  - We are witnessing the beginnings of a housing crisis in sections of the United States. Those who sit opposite would be well to treat this issue more seriously than they are, because what is occurring in the United States does have the potential to cast a long shadow around the world. It does have the potential to have unintended consequences on credit levels in this country, and I think that at a time like this it behoves everybody to choose their language very carefully. It behoves those who sit opposite not to wish for a crisis that does not exist. I think that a lot of Australians who are wanting to buy their first home are finding it very difficult to do so. The reason they are finding it difficult to do so is that the cost of buying a first home has risen out of proportion to the increase in their wages. That is the fundamental reason why we have got a problem at the present time. Whereas with most other things that people buy the cost of them has not risen out of proportion to the rise in incomes, in the case of housing the cost of buying the first home has risen out of proportion to the increase in incomes. Therefore, in addressing this matter, it is important that we do not aggravate that gap, it is important that we do not widen that gap, and some of the remedies that are simply going to further push up the price of housing are not adequate responses. We need to tackle the supply side, and that is why the Treasurer is focused on having an audit of land. - We need to look at local government development charges, we need to look at state government taxes, but the last thing we need is to resort to cheap language which is designed to scare people and to create a situation that is worse than the situation that is facing some young Australians. I would say to the Leader of the Opposition that a true housing crisis in this country is when there is a sustained fall in the value of our homes and in house prices. For the Leader of the Opposition to use careless language is only aggravating rather than helping the situation.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Wakefield for his question. I am very sorry to inform the House that the fourth Murray-Darling Basin contingency planning report confirms the very parlous state of water in the southern Murray-Darling. Water availability is at seriously low levels and is deteriorating further. Irrigation allocations are still at either zero or extremely low, the inflows into storages are at record low levels, and there is significantly less water stored today than at an equivalent time last year.The horticultural and other water dependent industries are, needless to say, the hardest hit of all; and there is now, tragically, a high risk of losses of permanent plantings. This contingency planning report, which has come from the Murray-Darling Basin Commission, recommends that governments in the basin states and, of course, the federal government consider additional measures. One of the measures recommended in the latest report is the possibility of a reserve for critical needs. I have sought the agreement of the relevant state premiers - the premiers of New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia - and the Chief Minister of the Australian Capital Territory to a joint statement releasing the report. I am pleased to say that the Premier of New South Wales, Mr Iemma, the Premier of South Australia, Mr Rann, and the Chief Minister of the ACT, Mr Stanhope, have all agreed to the release of that report under a joint statement. To date, the Victorian Premier has indicated he is not willing to agree, despite the fact that I gave him assurances on the reserve, including that the officials of the relevant jurisdictions would be fully consulted about the implementation of any recommendations.I would like to appeal to the Victorian Premier: I would like to ask him to adopt the same attitude as has been adopted by Mr Iemma, Mr Rann and Mr Stanhope. This is not a case of a Liberal Prime Minister attacking a Labor state Premier because, on this occasion, the Liberal Prime Minister and the Labor premiers of New South Wales and South Australia and the Labor Chief Minister of the Australian Capital Territory are all singing from the same hymn sheet. This is not an occasion for state parochialism; this is an occasion for total cooperation.We are dealing here with a genuine crisis. There is a water shortage crisis in the Murray-Darling Basin. Crisis is not an exaggerated word to use in relation to this water situation, and those of my colleagues who represent horticultural districts of Australia, people like the minister for employment services, the member for Mallee - I could give you a great long list - the member for Riverina and the member for Farrer understand the parlous state of people whose livelihoods are derived from the Murray-Darling Basin.If it is not the inappropriate word to use, I plead with the Victorian Premier to take the national approach that has been taken by Mr Iemma, Mr Rann and Mr Stanhope. I would like to ask him to reconsider. I would like to invite him to talk to me, to Mr Iemma, to Mr Rann and to Mr Stanhope. The situation is far worse than any of us would have hoped a few months ago. We all thought when there was some rain in June that the drought might break and the Murray-Darling might be saved. Tragically, that has not occurred and the last thing we should have at the moment is any kind of selfish state parochialism. We will solve this only as Australians and we have to share the pain as Australians and not behave like Victorians, South Australians, Queenslanders or New South Welshmen. It is too important for that, and I would ask the Victorian Premier to reconsider his position.I am going to release the contingency report immediately so that the Australian people and, most particularly, those of our fellow Australians who are most sorely afflicted by this crisis can make judgements for themselves as to what is required in a cooperative spirit to tackle a very real crisis faced by the food bowl of the nation.</DOC>

 - I will take that question in two parts. Firstly, do I believe there is overallocation? Yes, I do, and that is why we proposed a $10 billion plan. The whole purpose of that plan was twofold. It was to reduce loss of water by piping and lining the irrigation channels, and that was going to account for about $6 billion, and about $3.5 billion was going to be used to fund the buyback of overallocated water. If we had received the cooperation we should have received from the Victorian government, then we would be further advanced towards that goal today than what we are. In relation to the second question, the decision as to whether an auction will go ahead in relation to the Warrego is ultimately a decision of the Queensland government. I have indicated to the Queensland Premier that she should not go ahead with the auction in light of the recommendations contained in the CSIRO report, and I drew her attention to that report two weeks ago.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Moreton for his question and I can tell him that the Australian government is concerned about the spread of poker machines in Australia. In fact, we were so concerned about it that we commissioned an inquiry by the Productivity Commission, which reported in 1999 that there are 130,000 problem gamblers in Australia, 160,000 at risk and another 500,000 to 1,000,000 people affected by problem gamblers.Problem gamblers account for 33 per cent of the industry revenue in relation to poker machines. Let me say that again: problem gamblers account for one-third of the revenue that comes through Australia's poker machines. On a per capita basis, Australia has roughly five times as many gaming machines as the United States, and those who are losing money tend to be those with lower incomes. The Productivity Commission found there is an inverse relationship between income levels and the density of gaming machines - that is, the higher the income, the less the density of gaming machines in a particular neighbourhood, and the converse applies. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, in 2004-05 all gambling activity was estimated to be at $15.4 billion, but poker machines in clubs and pubs accounted for $8.7 billion or 56.3 per cent of gambling revenues in Australia.I noticed that recently the Leader of the Opposition also expressed his concern about poker machines and his regret at being part of the Queensland government's decision to introduce them when he was working for the Queensland government. It is a matter of concern the way in which state governments in the late eighties-early nineties embraced poker machines, seeing them as an easy way of generating tax revenue and not looking at the social consequences that were involved. So I welcome the fact that the Leader of the Opposition has changed his position in relation to poker machines and I look forward to getting bipartisan support for the government's position in relation to this social ill.As a consequence of the Productivity Commission inquiry, the Australian government set up a Commonwealth-state ministerial forum to deal with those areas recommended by the Productivity Commission on consumer protection, counselling and research, and reform to regulatory governance. The Ministerial Council on Gambling comprises both the Commonwealth and the states and, at the Commonwealth leadership, has now agreed on a national framework to respond to problem gambling. We look forward to cooperation from the states in relation to that matter.In some areas there have been positive steps, such as warnings in relation to gambling for people who might be problem gamblers and an increase in counselling services for those who suffer from this addiction. It is the Commonwealth's view that more can be done, particularly in restricting the availability of ATMs in venues where there are poker machines. The ATM represents a real temptation for a problem gambler who may have come with a fixed sum of money, gone through it, and now finds it easy to go to the ATM to continue their addiction. We would ask all of the states to cooperate with the Commonwealth in its active program to deal with this scourge, an area where the Commonwealth has taken leadership even though it has no legislative power. We would ask all of the states to cooperate in dealing with this matter.Let me say, in conclusion, there is no reason why Australia would need more poker machines. At the moment we have high level of poker machines in this country. There is no reason why we need any more and no reason for any state government whatsoever to believe that the introduction of keno or other forms of interactive gambling could actually add to the social cohesion in our country. We ask those state governments that are contemplating such a move not to go ahead with it.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. The Deputy Prime Minister's announcement on 3 September to contribute $6½ million to the Chaffey Dam augmentation project will improve water supply security for Tamworth and Peel Valley irrigators. It is important for the honourable member to remember that the funding is provided through the Australian government water fund, which is administered by the National Water Commission. It is contingent, as is all funding through the water fund, on the National Water Commission being satisfied with the business plan and being satisfied that the project is shown to be consistent with the National Plan for Water Security, the National Water Initiative and the Australian government's environmental standards.The dam expansion will undoubtedly be referred for consideration as a controlled action under the EPBC Act, so that is an environmental permitting hurdle that it has to meet. The funding is also contingent on the New South Wales government and other stakeholders meeting their agreed funding shares. I am optimistic that those conditions can be met, but they are in large measure in the hands of other people. The honourable member must understand that all water funding out of the Australian government water fund has to meet these or similar conditions.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Cowper for his question. I wish him well in the forthcoming election against the trade union candidate that the Labor Party is running against him. - I thank the honourable member for Cowper. There is a 70 per cent chance that, if you are running in the next election, the Labor Party candidate will be a trade union official of one kind or another. I wish him all the best in his election activity.Australia's tax scales are 15 per cent, 30 per cent, 40 per cent and 45 per cent. They compare to the Labor Party's tax scales when it left office of 20 per cent, 34 per cent, 43 per cent and 47 per cent. Not only have all the tax rates come down but, because thresholds have increased - for example, under Labor -  - The member for Melbourne Ports asks me: 'What were they?' Under Labor, your first dollar over $50,000 was taxed at 47c in the dollar. No wonder the member for Melbourne Ports interjects. Yes, it is true. It was taxed at 47c in the dollar for each dollar -  - The member for Melbourne Ports interjects again. Let me remind him: under the Labor Party, you were taxed at 47c in the dollar for each dollar over $50,000. Under the coalition, once you go over $50,000 you will not be taxed at a marginal tax rate higher than 30 per cent. That is real tax reform, and it is real tax reduction.Yesterday, the Leader of the Opposition was asked to name the tax rates and the tax thresholds. He was unable to name a single tax rate. He was unable to name the 15 per cent rate. Was he able to name the 30 per cent rate? Government members - No! - Was he able to name the 40 per cent rate? Government members - No! - Was he able to name the 45 per cent rate? Government members - No! - Was he able to name any rate? 
Government members - No! - What he named was a threshold that does not exist. The spin merchants of the Labor Party yesterday were saying: 'Mr Rudd's office said he had made a mistake. He was just $5,000 out, not the $25,000 the government claimed.' He was $25,000 out - but that is not the point. The point is that he did not know a single rate, let alone a threshold.Enter stage right, the member for Lilley. The member for Lilley had another explanation as to why the Leader of the Opposition should be excused. Have a listen to this: the member for Lilley was asked this morning:... don't you need to know where you're going from to where you're going to?That is not bad. The member for Lilley said:We absolutely know where we're going to, because you see, we authored the current tax cuts that are in the system.Listen to this:Eighty-five cents in every dollar of tax cuts in this year's Budget were authored by the Labor Party.Blow me down! When I wrote that budget speech, I did not realise my hand had been overcome by the Labor Party. It is getting pretty spooky, isn't it? My budgets are now being authored by the Labor Party. If I really believed that, I would stand down.But it gets even spookier. Members will know that the Leader of the Opposition specialises in asking himself questions and giving the answers. The reason he specialises in asking himself questions is that they are the only ones he can answer. He got on Today Tonight last night and he said:'Someone asked me the other day 'Who do you model yourself on?'' And I said, 'Ah... Kevin'. I'm just me.'That is pretty spooky because now he is modelling himself on himself. Last year he was modelling himself on Dietrich Bonhoeffer. But he has found an even better role model now. 'Move aside Dietrich. I am now modelling myself on myself,' he says. He is now authoring tax rates that he does not know exist. He is now auditioning for a job that he is not up to. That is the most important point: he is authoring, auditioning, for a job that he is not up to. He has not done the work, he does not understand the economy and he is not ready to be a leader in Australia.</DOC>

 - I am very happy to answer the question. I can provide an absolute assurance of a number of things that I certainly had nothing to do with. I was not aware of these things. I can provide an absolute assurance to the House that I had absolutely nothing to do with this. I am not aware of where it came from. I am not aware of any suggestion that it came from any member of my party. I am not aware of any suggestion that it came from any member of my government. I regard the question as contemptible. I believe that the member for Jagajaga has deliberately asked this question to generate a false view that my party and my government are responsible for smearing the Leader of the Opposition.Let me make a couple of things very clear to the member for Jagajaga. The first thing I would make clear is that I wish the Leader of the Opposition a long and healthy life in his current job. That is the first thing that I wish the Leader of the Opposition. I have never observed, in the Leader of the Opposition's demeanour, any suggestion that he has other than robust health. My argument with the Leader of the Opposition is not in relation to matters of individual physical fitness. I have no doubt about his physical fitness, any more than he should have any doubt about my physical fitness. My argument with the Leader of the Opposition is about his lack of credibility for the job he aspires to concerning matters quite unrelated to his health. I have never raised his health. I have never asked anybody to raise his health. I think it is a piece of contemptible smearing by the member for Jagajaga to raise this.Everyone knows a question is not asked in this House without the authority of the leader. I regard this question as Kevin Rudd's question. I do not regard this question as Jenny Macklin's. This question was authored by the Leader of the Opposition. I know exactly what has happened. The Leader of the Opposition had a bad day at the office yesterday. They have decided that the retaliation is to spear my party.Can I say very directly, through you, Mr Speaker, that there has been no engagement of private investigators. That is an absolute, contemptible falsehood. There has been no engagement of private investigators. At no stage has any conduct of any kind designed to smear the Leader of the Opposition on the basis of his lack of good health been encouraged, counselled, sought or in any way procured by me. I would reject any attempt to do so. I can beat the Leader of the Opposition without resorting to smears. -  - </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Blair for his question - a real question about a real issue that is of interest to Australians, particularly in regional Australia. That is, what the government is doing in terms of the deployment of the prosperity in this country to improve infrastructure, particularly in regional Australia, to the benefit of all Australians. The member for Blair would be well aware of the significant commitment of, and the appropriate decisions that are being taken by, the government in investing in that infrastructure. In the budget this year $22.3 billion was allocated across a range of infrastructure programs, many of which are helping the constituents in the electorate of Blair, ably represented by the current member for Blair and the interest he takes in their wellbeing.I mentioned yesterday one major piece of infrastructure that the government took a very long-term strategic view about. It took leadership to take a decision to invest $2.3 billion in the Goodna bypass. There are other very important roads that we are funding across the nation. We took a decision to go straight to local government to provide funding to local roads because the states were failing in their responsibility to support local roads.Under the very popular Roads to Recovery program, we are delivering significant amounts of money to local government and helping local people in their local communities to make their roads safer and more efficient. To one project in particular in the member's electorate, we have contributed $1 million towards the replacement of the Three Mile Bridge, which provides very important access to Amberley RAAF base in the member's electorate. It might be a small project but it is a very important project to that local community. That circumstance is replicated right across Australia. We took a decision in 2001 - and something that this government has always been able to do is take decisions when they are required - to allocate $307 million a year to local government across Australia. As of 2009, going through till 2014, that will grow to $350 million a year in the Roads to Recovery program.Since we were elected in 1996, we have maintained the roads funding Black Spot Program, which was axed by the Labor Party, the former Labor government, and which has been incredibly important to local communities, like those in the electorate of Blair, across Australia. That Black Spot Program over that period of time is estimated to have saved at least 130 Australian lives on the roads and saved 6,000 serious accidents, and it has upgraded 4,200 dangerous sites on local roads in every small community across Australia. It has been funded at $45 million a year and we are going to increase it to $60 million a year directed into local communities across Australia.The member asked about any threats to this and alternative policies. We know that the member for Batman has said: 'We support the AusLink funding. We want to see it go ahead.' Well, that is a good thing, but that is contrary to what the Leader of the Opposition has announced, in that he wants to have another inquiry. He wants to set up another bureaucracy. It is actually review No. 37 out of 97, the national infrastructure audit. We have been through all of this process. We have identified what needs to be done in Australia. We are getting on with doing it. We have got the wherewithal to do it. We are funding it out of budget surpluses, not out of debt and deficit in this country, and that is the hallmark of our government.We are a government of action; the Labor government would be a government of inaction, choked up with reviews and inquiries into what needs to be done in the country. Strong leadership is about making decisions where and when they are needed. Weak leadership is about having more inquiries and more reviews.</DOC>

I can also inform the House that, since the question authored by the Leader of the Opposition was asked by the member for Jagajaga, I have been informed by the Federal Director of the Liberal Party that he is not aware of, nor has he been in any way responsible for, the appointment of any private investigators to investigate the affairs of the Leader of the Opposition.
