  In answer to the Leader of the Opposition's question: it is clear that he means to go on as he did in 2011, with misleading claims and continued negativity, as we ready our economy for the future, including for a clean energy future. The figures referred to in the Leader of the Opposition's question are another attempt by the opposition to mislead the Australian people. Treasury modelling shows - and the opposition is aware of this - that, under a carbon price, our economy will continue to grow. Jobs will grow, with employment to increase by 1.6 million jobs by 2020. Real wages will grow by 20 per cent by 2020 and 50 per cent by 2050. Incomes will grow. Gross national income per person will be $9,000 higher in today's dollars in 2020 with a carbon price in place. Vitally, carbon pollution will fall. By 2050, carbon pricing is expected to reduce Australia's domestic emissions by nearly half of what they would have been projected to be without a carbon price. The price impacts will be modest - a one-off increase of 0.7 per cent in CPI - and of course we also know that the carbon-pricing package comes with the benefit of tax cuts for working people earning less than $80,000 a year, many of them receiving a tax cut of $300.                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    Then of course there will be Australians around the nation who no longer pay tax anymore as a result of us increasing the tax-free threshold. There will be increases in pensions and there will be increases in family payments. Behind this debate, Mr Speaker, is the essential question of whether or not you want our nation to stand still or be ready for the future. It is a fundamental choice. We have made it. We are getting our nation ready for the future and that future will require us to have a cleaner energy economy. In getting that cleaner energy economy, we are determined to do it at the lowest possible cost and the lowest possible price. The Leader of the Opposition stands for a policy which would impose a burden of $1,300 on working families - a policy that will not work. He stands for ripping tax cuts, family payment increases and pension increases out of the hands of Australians who need that money. This is more of the reckless approach we have seen the opposition take to all of its economic settings. Whenever it faces a choice between getting ready for the future or standing still, it says: stand still. Whenever it faces a choice about running the economy in the interests of working Australians, it says: let's help the privileged few. Whenever it faces a choice about making sure our economy is clean and ready for the future it spreads fear and distortion, and today's question is just more of that.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Oxley for his question. His region suffered flooding last year, and I have had the opportunity to attend with him and also with the member for Blair some commemorative events marking the suffering and loss that we saw last summer. Unfortunately, it is a sombre ritual that whenever this parliament comes back together at the start of a year we have something to reflect on that has harmed our nation in the time in between. Three years ago we came together and this House was devastated by the Victorian bushfires. We felt the pain of Victorians and the pain of Australians in those dramatic and destructive events. And then last year we paused to reflect on all that we had lost in the summer of natural disasters as it had hit so hard in Queensland and in other parts of the nation, including Victoria. Coming back to the parliament today, we actually meet at a time when, in Queensland and northern New South Wales, people are struggling with floodwaters and are seeing those floodwaters rising with all of the implications that that has for their communities.                              I spoke last night to Senator Barnaby Joyce about circumstances in St George - a very beloved place for him. I have visited St George myself. I visited last time during the flooding. For many of the families there, this is the third time that they faced flooding. Last year, when I visited there, I met people who were worried about flooding then who had only just got their homes back together following the earlier flood, and now of course those same individuals are seeing floodwaters threaten. So we know that right around those parts of Queensland and into northern New South Wales there are people who are doing it very tough indeed, and our thoughts are with them.                              In these circumstances, we have made available the resources of the ADF. They did such remarkable work last summer and some of those resources have been deployed again, including fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters. I think people would be well aware of the work that both can do in times of natural disaster and some of the very dramatic, indeed, heroic things that helicopter crews did last summer.                              We have been asked by Premier Bligh in respect of Queensland and Premier O'Farrell in respect of New South Wales to join with them under our natural disaster arrangements in making available category C assistance. That means that there will be assistance for small businesses and primary producers. The triggering of that category C assistance also means for those areas we have triggered the Australian government disaster relief payment, which is an emergency payment of $1,000 per adult and $400 per child. These are being triggered in various shires in Queensland and New South Wales. So, for anyone who is interested in very specific information about their own circumstances, I would advise them to ring 1802266 to get help and advice. I am sure, as we sit this week, we will be thinking about our fellow Australians who are in those circumstances - some in evacuation centres, some very anxious indeed. Our thoughts will be with them.              </DOC>

  In answer to the member's question, let me say this: we will bring to the parliament the biggest package of changes for problem gambling ever enacted by a national parliament in our nation's history. I also say in respect of the member's question that, yes, of course, the government looked to bring mandatory precommitment legislation to the parliament and it was apparent to me that that legislation would not pass the parliament because -                                                                     Ms GILLARD:                    I would have thought that every member in this parliament would think problem gambling is a serious issue worthy of consideration and the bringing to that consideration of a serious demeanour given the number of Australians who actually suffer, sometimes with the cost of their lives through suicide, as a result of problem gambling. We will bring to this parliament the biggest package of change a national government has ever brought to problem gambling.                              Yes, the government worked with Mr Wilkie on mandatory precommitment. It became apparent that such legislation would not get through this chamber, in part because the opposition would not vote for it. It seems to me quite remarkable indeed that any member of the opposition who would have come in here and voted against such legislation now comes into the parliament to raise the issue of that legislation. The opposition was opposed to it. We will bring to this parliament changes that can secure parliamentary support because, when faced with a choice of doing nothing or getting something done that will matter to families around the nation, I am for getting something done. What we will get done will make a practical difference in the lives of Australians who struggle with problem gambling.                              I know, due to its relentless negativity, due to the leadership of the Leader of the Opposition, that the demeanour of the opposition on any proposition for change is to say no. They do not want our nation ready for the future, they do not want working families to get a package of policies that benefit them, they do not want to support jobs, they do not want to build the new economy of the future and they certainly do not want to do anything to support Australians in need as a result of problem gambling. The test that will face the opposition, when we do bring this legislation to the parliament, will be where they will vote and what they will do, or will we see the same kind of hypocrisy on display then that we are seeing on display now?              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Parramatta for her question. The single biggest debate that we will have in this parliament over this 12 months will be about the economy. It is a debate that requires you to make some fundamental choices and a debate that requires you to define who you stand for, who you stand with and who you seek to benefit. We as a government have made our choices. We are determined to stand up for the interests of working people. We are determined to add to the package of policies we have already enacted to support working families. Those policies include the Paid Parental Leave scheme that the government brought into existence. They include putting more money into supporting families with the costs of child care than ever before. They include our focus on early childhood education and schools and making sure that people can get better healthcare services. They include the tax cuts that we have delivered so far. They include the changes that we have made in various payments, including through the pension, to support families at all stages of life, whether it be from the birth of a new child or from when mum or dad or grand mum or grandad requires the assistance of the pension.                               This year we will add to that package of policies: new family payment arrangements for families with teenagers, tax cuts, pension increases, family payment increases and an expanded education tax rebate. Until this government enacted it, there was not assistance with the cost of getting kids to school. Now we will broaden that assistance. At the same time, we will be acting to build the new economy of the future. We delivered the foundation stones last year and it was not easy but it has been done. We will seize a clean energy future. We will get for working people a fair share of the resources boom that is underway in our nation. We will understand the changes happening in the global economy in the aftermath of the global financial crisis and as we see spectacular growth in our region and we will seize those opportunities for Australia's future. I want us to come out as a winner in this time of change in the global economy and in our region. We will deliver a new skills package and we will build on our education reforms because the economy of the future will require higher and higher and higher levels of skills. We will continue to roll out the National Broadband Network because yesterday's infrastructure is not good enough to build the new economy - and we will ensure that it is a diversified economy, one where mining is not the only source of strength, where we still have a manufacturing industry, where we still have people making cars in this country, where we still have a vibrant tourism industry and where we have a vibrant services sector. That is the debate of this year. It is about the employment of Australians. It is about their ability to get a job. It is about their ability to do that today and in the economy we will build for the future.                              On the other side of politics, we understand that in this debate they are for standing still. They are for the privileged interests of a few rather than for the many working families who need to benefit from our resources boom. They are for not moving to a clean energy future in any way that makes sense. They are for ripping the National Broadband Network out of the ground. They are for education cuts in schools, cuts to apprenticeships and beyond. This is the debate of 2012, and I am very happy to say to the Leader of the Opposition: bring it on.              </DOC>

  The answer to the member's question is yes. I would also make the observation to the member that sometimes the opposition wants to criticise the government because it says it has interfered in the Fair Work Australia investigation - obviously that allegation is untrue, but sometimes the opposition decides to criticise on that basis - and then today they walk into this parliament and say, 'Get right in there and interfere and hurry Fair Work Australia up.'                              You cannot have it both ways. Independent is independent, and Fair Work Australia is independent. The real motivation behind this question I think is clear for all to see: the Liberal Party, the National Party and the current Leader of the Opposition have always hated the industrial umpire because they have always hated fairness for working people - and it is more of the same.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Melbourne for his question. Can I say to the member for Melbourne that I do share his concerns about the circumstances of Australians who find dental care beyond their reach. I think all of us in this chamber know, just from practical, real-world experience, how expensive it can be to go to the dentist, and we know that there are hundreds of thousands of Australians who find themselves unable to meet the cost, with all of the pain and the degeneration of their teeth that that can cause for them. The medical evidence shows that, if you have chronic problems with your teeth, that can affect the rest of your body and your health care in general. So I do share the member's concern.                              Because the Labor Party has had a longstanding concern in this area, of course we campaigned against the closure of the Commonwealth's dental program by the Howard government. We thought that was the wrong thing to do then. It is still wrong today to make those kinds of choices and the kinds of cutbacks which the Leader of the Opposition was famous for when he was the Minister for Health and Ageing. We have taken an approach of building capacity in dentistry both by providing new capital and by providing new investments in workforce. I remind the House that we have delivered practical improvements like subsidising around 1.5 million dental check-ups for teenagers. We have provided $125 million for eight dental projects from the Health and Hospitals Fund, delivering 220 new dental chairs. We have recently opened a $2.1 million 10-chair teaching dental clinic at the Adelaide Dental Hospital, which will mean an extra 52,500 hours of clinical training over the next five years for undergraduate dental and oral health students. We will invest $52.6 million over four years to support the dental workforce of the future, through a voluntary dental intern program. I believe that the member who asked the question understands the constraints in the provision of dentistry. They are not only the resources in the system but also the workforce, which is why these workforce investments are so important. I say to the member for Melbourne that I want to see us do more. But as we weigh what we can do in the budget process we will of course make the appropriate fiscal decisions for the nation. I understand that that has caused those opposite, who have got a $70 billion plan to cut the services government provides working families, to roll their eyes. They have never understood what it is like to do the hard work to get a budget to add up. They would take $70 billion out of the services that working families need.                              We will keep working on proposals for dental care. In that regard, as the member for Melbourne knows, we have commissioned an expert body to provide us with advice and we have received a report from the National Advisory Council on Dental Health, which we established. We are waiting for them to present their final report. They have been working on that and we have received some advice from them, but obviously we want their final report to government. I conclude by saying to the member for Melbourne that we are certainly concerned about this problem. We have demonstrated that concern not only through our campaigning against the cuts of previous governments but through practical action during the life of this government, and we will continue to take that kind of approach.              </DOC>

  I thank the Deputy Leader of the Opposition for her question. This side of the House stands for putting a price on carbon; those on that side of the House stand for putting their heads in the sand and ignoring their national and global responsibilities. We are about preparing Australia for the future; you are about burying Australia in the past. On the pricing of carbon, we should look to the multiple statements on his commitment to an emissions trading scheme or a tax made at various stages by the Leader of the Opposition. He has had so many positions that he makes the Kama Sutra redundant.                              On the question raised by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, multiple jurisdictions around the world have different forms of carbon pricing. She should look at each of those jurisdictions and examine the differences. We are about putting a price on carbon. Get with the international project.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for his very important question. Today, the independent Reserve Bank left the official cash rate on hold. This follows cuts to the cash rate of 25 basis points in both November and December. In leaving the cash rate on hold today, the Reserve Bank has struck a balance between global uncertainty on the one hand and Australia's strong economic fundamentals on the other. We understand that families are doing it tough, but mortgage rates are significantly below the level that we inherited from those opposite. If you have a $300,000 mortgage at the moment and you are paying the standard variable rate, you are paying $3,000 a year less than you would have paid under the coalition.                              It is very important that we have continued sound economic management to deliver strong growth on the one hand and contained inflation on the other. The strength of the fundamentals was pointed to today by the Reserve Bank. They talked about the fact that China is still robust and the challenging conditions in Europe - although those conditions have got a little better. But they also pointed to the fact that domestic growth is strong and that we are expecting through this year trend growth of 3¼ per cent, trend growth which will support job creation in this country. We have seen 700,000 jobs created in Australia over the past four years. But a balance needs to be struck. As the Reserve Bank has said today, should demand conditions weaken materially, the inflation outlook would provide scope for easier monetary policy because the Reserve Bank is acutely aware of the challenges to our economy from the global situation. Thankfully, here we have unemployment at 5.2 per cent, half what we see today in Europe, and we are building on the strengths of our economy. Fundamental to that strength is our determination to deliver a surplus in 2012-13. We have seen the slapstick farce of those opposite today on the question of surplus. Yesterday the finance spokesperson was out there running away from a surplus at a hundred million miles an hour. The deputy leader joined him. Then of course we have the farce on television last night of the shadow Treasurer.                                                                    Mr SWAN:                    Most certainly, Mr Speaker, because we on this side of the House are determined to deliver a surplus because it goes to the very fundamentals of our economic wellbeing. Last night we saw on Q&amp;A the biggest political bellyflop in a long time from the shadow Treasurer, denying that he had said there was a $70 billion crater in their budget bottom line.                                                                    Mr SWAN:                    I was talking about the strength of our economic fundamentals. We have the AAA credit rating - the sovereign, gold plated AAA credit rating - from the three major global credit rating agencies for the first time in our history, something which was not ever achieved by those on that side of House who every day of the week go around the place talking down our economy. We are determined to deliver tax reform to keep our economy strong. Those on that side of the House want to give a tax cut to Gina Rinehart and Clive Palmer and they want to stop a tax cut to 2.7 million small businesses around our country. To keep our economy strong, we need good budget policy, we need tax reform and we need people who are serious about good economic policy. What we have on the other side is simply a rabble.                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    The opposition understood that would be the position.                                                                  The member for North Sydney then left the chamber.                              </DOC>

  What I would say to the Leader of the Opposition is that at a time when there are workers in some sections of the economy who are losing jobs it is incumbent upon us to understand why that is happening and to respond, not to make up reasons in the way that the Leader of the Opposition is making up reasons.                              Can I particularly say I was disgusted this morning to see the opposition trying to use job losses at Alcoa to continue its fear campaign on carbon pricing when the CEO of Alcoa made it absolutely clear that this was not to do with carbon pricing. What sort of people would use the distress of working people, on hearing about job losses, for their own political ends? And we saw that done by the opposition this morning. We are in economic times when our economy is strong. We came out of the global financial crisis strong. We came out of it strong because of the way in which we invested in the economy, an investment that was opposed by those opposite, who did not care about jobs then. We saved 200,000 jobs and have unemployment at just over five per cent.                              Yes, there is structural change occurring in our economy because of the strength of the Australian dollar and because economic weight is moving into our region, which will drive a different pattern of demand for Australian goods and services. Then there are the structural changes that are necessary to take us to a clean energy future and to get us the best of technology. And where does the Leader of the Opposition sit as we go through this period of change? Opposed to jobs.                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    The Leader of the Opposition is referring to a speech that I gave on the economy. He is trying to twist words and take them out of context. Every time I hear about job losses in this country, I am concerned; every time the Leader of the Opposition hears about job losses, he works out how he can use that to his political advantage - just like he did this morning with Alcoa, a disgusting approach at a time when working people are in need and under pressure. It is a disgusting approach.                              The Leader of the Opposition's plan for the economy is to not support jobs in car manufacturing, to not support jobs across the economy and to keep our economy at a standstill so that we miss out on the opportunities of the future. We on this side of this parliament are determined to make sure that we support working people today and get them great opportunities in the new economy that we are building for our nation's future.              </DOC>

  I had the great privilege this morning of meeting people who work in the car industry, and they are present in the gallery now. I welcome them to this parliament. They came to parliament to talk about the future of their industry and its importance to the Australian economy. There is a lot of nonsense talked about the car industry in the public domain, some of it in the pages of our newspapers and some of it in this parliament. There is a lot of nonsense suggesting that the car industry is somehow part of our past. It needs to be part of our future. The member for Wakefield, who asked me this question, knows that very well from his local experience in his electorate, where car marking is very important.                              Australians want to see us continue to make cars. They want to see the iconic brands like Holden and Ford still in this nation. In order for that to happen, we need to recognise that the car industry is at the forefront of innovation. The car industry is a high-productivity, high-skill industry. It needs to compete in the world and with the dollar as strong as it is at the moment that is a very difficult thing to do. It needs government to work in partnership with the industry to make sure not that there is no change - because we cannot guarantee no change and we cannot guarantee every job, either - but that we are a country that still makes cars. I am determined to do that, not only because 46,000 Australians rely on the car industry for their employment but because, when you go through the supply chain, around 200,000 Australians rely on that industry. When you look more broadly, a million Australians work in manufacturing, and what is done in the car industry is important to manufacturing around the nation. Whether it is technology such as robotics going elsewhere or whether it is skill sets going elsewhere, this industry is important to the jobs of a million Australians.                              Yesterday, the Leader of the Opposition was channelling Dirty Harry. Perhaps he should recognise today that Clint Eastwood, who gave Dirty Harry to the world, is out there supporting the American car industry. What the Leader of the Opposition should be saying -                                                                     Ms GILLARD:                    I was asked about the future of the car industry. Let me conclude by saying that we stand for a future for the car industry in this country. The Leader of the Opposition stands for doing the dirty on the car industry and ending car manufacturing jobs.              </DOC>

                                                      I thank the shadow Treasurer for his question because there is nothing more central to the Labor Party purpose than jobs. They go to the very core of the quality of life and the security of families. We understand that and, because it is based on our values, we put in place the response to the global financial crisis and the global recession which protected jobs in this country. On this side of the House, we understand how damaging high unemployment can be, what it does to our skills base and how it destroys communities. There is nothing more central to us, as a Labor government, than creating prosperity, which generates jobs and spreads opportunity to every corner of our country.                                                There is nothing we are more proud of than the fact that we have unemployment at 5.2 per cent. If those opposite had been in power three years ago, it would have gone through the roof and great parts of this country would have experienced very high unemployment. Because of our concern for jobs, we acted swiftly. We got the big economic calls right and now we are entering a new phase in our economy, as the Prime Minister was saying before. We have low unemployment but there is pressure on our economy. A higher dollar is causing stresses and strains across a numberof sectors of our economy. We understand it is our responsibility to work with industry, to work with local communities, to work our way through these issues. We are committed to an auto industry in this country but we also understandthatit faces great challenges in terms of global demand, challenges in terms of competitivenessbecause of a higher dollar. We also understandthatthere are challenges in tourism, education export and so on, but we are planning for the future. We are putting in place the reforms which will make our industries competitive.                                                                   One of the things I cannot understand when we get this question                                                      from the shadow Treasurer is that                                                      we are about to bring                   in a substantial                   tax cut for 2.7 million small businesses to make them more competitive                                                      and they want to stop it. But it is worse than that. They want                   to give a tax cut to Clive                   Palmer and Gina Rinehart                   - just one example of the twisted priorities of those opposite.                                                                                  We on this side of the House are committed to a competitive                                                      Australia, one                   which creates jobs                   with decent and fair working conditions                   and one which provides                   opportunities                   to our children and our grandchildren                  .                              </DOC>

                                                      I thank the member for Cunningham for her question. In this parliament she represents a community which knows what it is like to undergo structural change, a community that is working together understand                  ing that there are some                   job                   losses                   in steelmaking which they need to confront but a community which                                                      is fighting back and making sure it has a plan                   for                   its                   economic                   future                  . Making steel will be part of that economic future but I know her community is looking forward to the benefits that                                                      the                                                      National                   Broadband Net                  work can and will bring to businesses                                                      in her electorate, increasing their productivity. T                  hat is                   because people                   in her                   electorate                   and                   people right                   around the country                   get the commonsense proposition that                                                      we as a nation cannot compete                   if we are using yesterday                  '                  s                   technology. We have a great resources sector, but imagine if it were t                  rying to compete                   in the world                   using picks and shovels                   instead of forefront technology. Imagine if manufacturing                                                      were                   using hand tools instead of robotics                   in                   the forefront                   of technology. Of course                   they would not be able to compete                  .                                                                                  What is true for an individual business                                                      is true for our whole nation. We need to have                   the best of technology                                                      to be able to compete in the world, which                                                      is why we are determined to roll out the National Broadband Network to ensure Australians                                                      get the benefits of the best of that                                                      technology                                                      and that                                                      we do not fall behind the standards of the world. The 100-year-old copper wire network                                                      has done very well indeed but it will hold us back in the future. It does not have the capacity to do what we will need to do in the future. If anyone doubts the benefits to productivity of having the kind of ICT which                                                      broadband can bring, what we know from international experience                                                      is that                                                      70 per cent of product innovation is linked to ICT and 73 per cent of process innovation in manufacturing                                                      is linked to ICT. We need those benefits here.                                                                                   Today we have made an important                                                      announcement about how Australians                                                      who live in the most remote parts of our country will get benefits too in terms of                                                      faster technology. We have announced that                                                      we will join with NBN Co. and Space Systems/Loral in putting up two satellites which                                                      will improve services                                                      for Australians                                                      who live in the most remote places. We do not want to see them left behind. We want them to get a better service and to pay the same uniform wholesale price as Australians                                                      in other parts of the country. This is a vital step in moving us to the new technology                                                      we will need for our future economy.                                                                                     </DOC>

  I thank the Deputy Leader of the Opposition for her question. This EU policy has been around for some time. The same issue is one in which I, the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport, the Minister for Trade and other ministers of the government have robustly engaged the Europeans on. We will continue to make those representations. We are acutely mindful of the dependency of this country and its tourism industry on long haul civil aviation. We will be out there defending the Australian national interest.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Deakin for his question. This side of the House does understand the challenges that we face in this country from what is going on in the global economy. We have acted in the face of global uncertainty to get the big economic calls right. As a consequence, we have supported growth and jobs and we are putting in place all of the tough measures that are required to ensure that continues, including bringing our budget back to surplus. Indeed, today we introduced the mid-year budget review bills into the House to achieve that purpose. We on this side of the House are putting in place the important reforms to secure future prosperity; for example, investment in skills and infrastructure and investment in the NBN, which the Prime Minister was talking about today. These are opposed by those opposite. We are introducing a carbon price because we understand that no first-class First World economy can continue to be like that unless they are substantially powered by clean energy. That is, once again, opposed by those opposite. We are spreading the benefits of the mining boom and, in particular, giving some tax relief to small business and other corporates because we understand the pressures in the economy. Most importantly, we are bringing our budget back to surplus because we expect growth at trend.                              Today, and in the past week, I think we have seen the worst we could possibly see from the Leader of the Opposition, the shadow Treasurer and the shadow finance spokesman. They are the 'Three Stooges' of opposition economic policy. Today we have had the classic -                                                                     Mr SWAN:                    Certainly, Mr Speaker. Bringing the budget back to surplus is absolutely important.                                                                    Mr SWAN:                    I do withdraw. Bringing the budget back to surplus is critical. We have a commitment to bringing the budget back to surplus. But the opposition leader today walked away from that idea and scrapped his commitment to returning to surplus. We had the opposition finance spokesman do the same a couple of days ago.                               What is more extraordinary is that we have found out why. Why are they walking away from that commitment to surplus? They are doing it because the shadow Treasurer said there is a $70 billion crater in their budget bottom line. It is that big. We have had some progress from the shadow Treasurer on this today. He has been running around the country insisting he never said it was $70 billion, despite the fact that it was there on Sunrise. It is there for everybody to see, but he has been running around the country saying that he never said it. Today on radio, this is what he said: 'Okay, I shouldn't have said it.' The extraordinary thing about that is he does not know that that is not the problem. The problem is: how did they get to $70 billion in the first place? How many commitments have they made that cannot be funded? The truth is that their numbers do not -                </DOC>

  What I would say in response to the question is that no amount of dramatic flourish is going to change the facts here. The facts are that the opposition are trying to reheat very old news because they have nothing to say about the economy. They have nothing to say about jobs. They do not want to talk to these car industry workers and explain how they are going to destroy their jobs. They cannot explain their $70 billion black hole. They cannot explain when the budget would come back to surplus under them.                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    They have walked away from their promises of tax cuts. I refer the House to -                                                                     Ms GILLARD:                    Thank you very much, Mr Speaker, and in relation to what was a question with a very broad range of adjectives in it, I would refer the House to Hansard of Wednesday, 19 October last year where this matter was fully canvassed and fully answered by Senator Chris Evans. I would also say to those members opposite who want to deal with these matters - I say this because they are incapable of dealing with any of the public policy challenges that our nation faces - that, as I said yesterday, they can hardly come into -                                                                     Ms GILLARD:                    The opposition can hardly come into this place one day saying to direct Fair Work Australia to get this inquiry done and then the rest of the time complain about its fanciful allegations that the government is somehow intervening in this Fair Work Australia investigation. Fair Work Australia is an independent authority going about an independent investigation. It is time that the opposition stopped this muckraking, particularly when they are unable in the court of public opinion to answer basic questions like when a budget would come to surplus under them. Five years away, according to the shadow minister for finance. How big is their black hole: $70 billion. What is it going to cost working people when they slash services to try and fill it?                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    Mr Speaker, I would suggest to the opposition that they spend some time doing those things instead of this pathetic muckraking.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Kennedy for that very important question, because he, like me, is a great fan of the late Ted Theodore, who was one of the early Keynesian advocates in this country and was indeed a former Treasurer of this country. Ted Theodore believed in appropriate fiscal and monetary policies that worked together to support employment and to support jobs and to support economic prosperity. One of the reasons we moved like we did through the global financial crisis and the global recession was to stimulate our economy through appropriate fiscal policy and appropriate monetary policy through the independent Reserve Bank. The consequence of that is that Australia is one of the strongest developed economies in the world, if not the strongest, according to the IMF. But you cannot be Keynesians on the way down and not be Keynesians on the way up, and our current policy settings, our fiscal policy settings and our monetary policy settings, reflect the strength of our economy relative to the rest of the world.                               As for those countries that the member for Kennedy referred to, where he talked about low interest rates, those are countries which have very, very high levels of unemployment and they have very big problems in terms of sovereign debt. We do not want those problems in this country. We have not got those problems in this country because we have deployed fiscal and monetary policy in an appropriate way. Indeed, if you look at the reports from the IMF, the OECD and the World Bank, they have all made the point that in Australia the deployment of monetary and fiscal policy has been the most effective in the Western world. The consequence of that is a rate of interest that some people may feel uncomfortable with, but could I make this point. The cash rate in this country is currently 4.25 per cent and when we came to office it was 6.75 per cent. And, of course, if you take a $300,000 mortgage, that is a saving of $3,000 per year for a family with that mortgage.                               What we must do is dedicate ourselves to taking every responsible step to keep pressure off inflation so we can keep rates down. The most important thing that we have got to do to generate jobs in this country, to generate wealth and to spread the opportunities around the country is to deploy our fiscal policy appropriately, and that is what the government is doing by bringing the budget back to surplus, and the independent Reserve Bank will take its judgments from time to time on monetary policy. We had two rate cuts at the end of last year and they were welcomed. Yesterday the Reserve Bank decided they would hold, but they did make the point that if further cuts were required there was room. Why? Because of the appropriate fiscal policy that the government has in place right now, which has received a big tick from the IMF.               </DOC>

  I thank the member for Throsby for his question and, indeed, he understands that in a changing world we do have to prepare for the economy of the future. In recent months I have made a number of visits to the Illawarra, one to open the SMART Infrastructure Facility at the University of Wollongong - a world class facility that is attracting international attention, making sure that we are at the forefront of innovation when it comes to manufacturing and when it comes to ensuring that we remain a country that makes things.                              In recent months also, I was with the Prime Minister when she announced the rollout of the National Broadband Network to the suburbs of the Illawarra, in the electorates of Cunningham and Throsby and also down to the electorate of Gilmore. The fact is that we do need to innovate. That is what the National Broadband Network is doing, replacing the old copper wire network of a hundred years ago with the technology of the future.                              Today we have with us an important sector of the manufacturing sector, the people who are involved in the auto industry. These people are ensuring we are able to innovate, not just stay as we are but move forward and produce the cars of the future - cars that are cleaner, cars that are greener, cars that are more efficient.                              We know that the auto sector is so important in terms of driving manufacturing innovation right across the economy. It reaches a tipping point - just as it has in shipping, which is why the government is acting there - whereby if you do not have a certain level of industry it disappears completely. That is something this government understands and it is why we are determined to stand with those communities when it comes to the auto sector. That is why we have the New Car Plan for a Greener Future. It produces some 46,000 jobs in auto manufacturing but, as a result of that, it has a multiplier effect on the millions of jobs that exist in manufacturing across the system.                              We understand that. That is why we are voting for our plan. We understood that when it came to steel manufacturing, when we voted for the $300 million Steel Transformation Plan. Remember that night, the late Tuesday night sitting, when those opposite voted 'no' 32 times to the MRRT, including the support for the steel industry. We have on this side a group of people committed to maintaining jobs and maintaining a future for manufacturing. Those opposite have nothing but cuts. We know the shadow minister offered up the cuts -                </DOC>

  In response to the member for Hasluck's question, as he would be aware, I dealt with these matters at the time. Following Australia Day, I obviously dealt with these matters publicly and what I said then is what I will say now, which is, a member of my staff made a very grave error. He acted alone. His conduct was unauthorised. Both he and Ms Sattler - the participants in the conversation - have been very clear that Mr Hodges relayed to Ms Sattler the words of the Leader of the Opposition from that morning, that he did not relay any other version and, of course, the rest has been reported publicly. To the member for Hasluck I say, as I said at a press conference on the Saturday after these events, Mr Hodges did make a very bad mistake. He has paid a very severe price for it. He relayed the words of the Leader of the Opposition accurately on the question of the tent embassy to Ms Sattler.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Calwell for that question because she is a real champion of jobs in her area of Melbourne. As I was saying before, there have been something like 700,000 jobs created in this country over the past four years. Just compare that with what has gone on in other developed economies around the world. This has been perhaps the most difficult time in the global economy since the Great Depression. For our country to create 700,000 jobs in that environment is something that we are all proud of.                              But we on this side of the House do understand that there are stresses and strains in our economy and that some sectors are coming under enormous pressure. The rise of Asia, the growth in the region, the fundamental strength of our commodities sector is putting upward pressure on our dollar, and that demands a responsible approach by all political parties in this House. Until now it had been a matter of bipartisan agreement that we would have support for the auto industry, for all of the reasons that the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport explained before and, as the Prime Minister indicated before, it is absolutely essential to our skills and technological base. We come to this problem with goodwill, wanting to work with the industry and with local communities. It is important that we put in place the investment we need, particularly in skills, training and innovation, but it is also important that we have a very strict fiscal policy in this environment. As I explained before to the member for Kennedy, despite all of these pressures in particular sectors we have an economy where growth is still at trend. As a consequence of having an economy where growth is at trend we have to bring our budget back to surplus because we do not want to add to inflationary pressures in the economy.                              We know that this is something those opposite do not get, because when they were last in power there were 10 interest rate rises in a row. That was despite the fact that they promised in 2004 to keep them at record lows. When it comes to the employment of fiscal policy they are a complete shambles. That is why they have a $70 billion hole. That is why they have thrown a surplus commitment out the window and that is why they are now threatening the auto industry.                                                                    Mr SWAN:                    We on this side of the House know what we must do to successfully manage our economy in this period of great change. Those opposite are simply in shambles.              </DOC>

  On the member's question, it is true to form that we see the opposition throwing around allegations for which they can produce no proof. I have dealt with these matters on the public record and I will deal with them again. Mr Hodges made a very grave error in judgment. He has paid a price for that error in judgment.                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    I would have thought if the opposition were truly interested then it would wait for the details of the matter - and the details do matter - and making things up does not work. What happened, as I have said publicly, is that Mr Hodges acted alone. He was not authorised in his actions. It was a bad error of judgment and he has paid a price for that. No-one was more angry than me that something to honour people who had done remarkable things in times of natural disaster and other circumstances when Australians needed aid was disrupted. In terms of what Mr Hodges and Ms Sattler said in their telephone conversation, I would refer the opposition to Ms Sattler's statements, which verify that Mr Hodges told Ms Sattler that Mr Abbott, the Leader of the Opposition, had said that people should move on from the tent embassy -                                                                     Ms GILLARD:                    The comments of the Leader of the Opposition from earlier that morning were accurately relayed from Mr Hodges to Ms Sattler. In the aftermath of the incident, what my staff did was first and foremost ascertain the whereabouts of each of my staff members because I was concerned about their safety. I also personally ascertained the whereabouts of Senator Lundy and Minister McClelland because they were at the Lobby restaurant and, as television cameras spectacularly recorded, we left them behind. So I wanted to know that they were okay. In the aftermath of the incident, that was our first and foremost concern. The allegation that I or anybody on my behalf -                                                                     Ms GILLARD:                    In terms of anything that I have said about this incident, I do not today and I never have believed, said or thought that this incident arose because of the words of Mr Abbott, the Leader of the Opposition, and that somehow this was his fault. That has never been my belief. The conduct of the individuals involved, which was violent conduct, is the responsibility of those individuals.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Kingston for her question. I know she knows the fundamental importance of getting broadband into her community because I was with her earlier this year and we were talking about the benefits for the residents of Willunga in her electorate.                              Today the Prime Minister has already indicated the important announcement that the government has made about the contract with NBN Co. to launch the satellites that will bring faster, more reliable broadband access to the remotest parts of our country. Why is this important? It is because we want every part of this patchwork economy to have the opportunity to take advantage of the enormous growth potential this nation has.                              We have already indicated that this government in its four years has created 700,000 jobs, the fastest rate of employment growth ever in the history of this country. Treasury estimates indicate that by the year 2020 there will be another 1.6 million jobs - in other words, more than double what we have already achieved as the greatest achievement. We want to make sure those benefits are spread. We can do that only if we invest in the essential infrastructure that enables communities and regions to take advantage of an economy in transition and to diversify their economic base. They can do that only if they can get access to the infrastructure that enables it, and fast-speed broadband is one essential element of it.                              Anyone who doubts the benefits of what this will do for regional Australia should have a look at Tasmania for a start and the Launceston hospital's ability to deliver health services to regional parts or have a look in Smithton at what the two schools are doing to access the opportunities for training kids in their region through world-class activities and e-education opportunities. Those who doubt it should go to Armidale, for example, and talk to the photographic company that is using fast speed broadband to establish its business in the region because it can upload as well as download activity. These are the benefits that exist out there now for those who have access to fast speed broadband. We want to ensure that the whole of the country gets it to maximise its potential. The only party that is committed to achieving this is the Labor Party. Those opposite think this can be done for a pittance and they want to give people vouchers to try and find it. They seem to think that those living in the regions should not have the same access as those who live in the cities.               </DOC>

  I thank the member for Blair, who happens to have the Ipswich Trade Training Centre in his electorate. At that trade training centre, high school kids get the opportunity to go up to a Certificate III in automotive. That is an important message that I want to emphasise as I answer the question that the member asked me. The fact is that this government is strongly committed to making sure that young Australians have the right education and the right skills training so that they can get good jobs for the future, jobs in the new economy. We recognise that the link between education and skills and future productivity and the link between education and skills and job certainty is a very, very direct one.                               That evidence can be seen in the commitment in spending on education by the Gillard Labor government, which has nearly doubled the spending of the Howard years. In particular, the evidence can be seen by looking at the commitment that we have made to kids learning the basic skills of literacy, numeracy and mathematics under NAPLAN testing. The evidence can be seen in the very welcome figures that we saw about the numbers of young women who are going on to university to learn, which show that we are ahead of the target that we as a government have set. The evidence can be seen in the commitment that we have to invest in trade training centres, and we already have funded projects benefiting over 1,000 schools around Australia. They are terrific facilities, as members behind me know very well, because they are places where students can get hands-on experience and good vocational learning that sets them up for life with skills in that career path. It is evidence too that those people who might want to work in industries like automotive can start getting on that skills pathway in those trade training centres.                               Before the last election, the opposition promised to cut over $1 billion from the Trade Training Centres in Schools Program. That would have meant that tens of thousands of young kids who might have chosen not to go to university but who might have wanted to get those skills under their belt would have been denied that opportunity. That is not an opportunity that this government is going to deny them. In particular, I make this simple point: Mr Abbott does not seem to get it about what we are doing for young people in schools. When we made the announcement that we would help eligible families with teenagers aged 16 to 19 to have a boost in family payments so that they could stay at school or in vocational training he said on 2UE on 28 November:                              I guess I would want to carefully study this and make sure that the right kids are getting the money and that we really were keeping the right kids at school.                                                                    Mr GARRETT:                    Mr Abbott then said 'occupational therapy, basically'. The fact is that on this side of the house we do not distinguish between the right and the wrong kids.               </DOC>

  I say again: if the opposition is genuinely interested then it should try following the details of this, not making spurious accusations. What I said at the time, what I said in answer to the last question, what I will say now and what I will always say because it is the truth is that Mr Hodges contacted Ms Kim Sattler of Unions ACT. The Manager of Opposition Business is putting a label on her. It is not for him to label people. She is an officer of Unions ACT. Mr Hodges has relayed and she has relayed the contents of their conversation. I refer to the public statement that Ms Kim Sattler released regarding the contents of that conversation. The contents are:                              I would like to make a statement about my involvement in the events of Thursday.                              Tony Hodges spoke to me by phone on Thursday afternoon. He told me what Tony Abbott had said - that people should 'move on' from the Tent Embassy.                              He also said that Abbott would be at an event at the Lobby that afternoon.                              Other people knew that already as Tony Abbott had been spotted at the Lobby already by other people walking back from the cafe next door.                              I merely passed on that information to the organisers at the Embassy in case they wished to make a statement to the media.                              Following media reports, Ms Sattler issued a further statement -                                                                     Ms GILLARD:                    I will answer that question, but I will not have stand on the record of this parliament the inaccuracies that the Manager of Opposition Business put in his question. That ought not to stand on the record. The record should say this: Ms Sattler's second statement that I would refer the Manager of Opposition Business to -                                                                     Ms GILLARD:                    They say they are interested in the details, yet they are not prepared to listen. Ms Sattler said in her second statement:                              Reports in today's newspapers are inaccurate.                              As I said in my statement yesterday, Tony Hodges from the Prime Minister's office told me what Tony Abbott had said - that people should move on from the tent embassy.                              Yesterday the Prime Minister gave an accurate account of my role.                              On why I accepted Mr Hodges' resignation after it had been offered: I accepted it because I viewed his conduct as making a grave error of judgment, particularly seeking to introduce a note of partisanship into what should be a bipartisan event on a bipartisan day. That was inappropriate conduct and, as a result, I accepted his resignation. If my standards are too high for the opposition, well so be it.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Wills for his question. His electorate and mine border Essendon and Tullamarine airports and we know that, when we talk about prioritising for workers now and in their retirement, under this government Australia is still passing the airport test. We know in this country that when Australians come back from overseas, wherever they have travelled all over the world, this country is passing the airport test because people who come back to Australia are happy to be back in Australia. We know this country is doing all right. It does not mean that our future is guaranteed, but we know that compared to the rest of the world we are doing okay.                              We have 5.2 per cent unemployment. Every job loss is a shame, but we are doing relatively better than the eurozone and we are doing better than North America. We know we have low net Commonwealth government debt compared to foreign governments in terms of their net debt. We also know that we are engaging in the fastest fiscal consolidation in Australian history. We know why this is the case. It is because this government is interested in jobs, in skills and in making sure that people do not retire poor. The way we are doing that with jobs - and you can look at the record of the last four years because we have been consistent - is by guaranteeing the banks. Unlike the financial sectors in other parts of the world during the global financial crisis, that saw jobs saved then that would otherwise have been lost. Not only did we do that but we spent more money on the educational infrastructure of our school system than in Australian history. That also retained hundreds of thousands of jobs.                              We also know that, unlike the rest of the OECD, which has seen a contraction of 30 million jobs throughout the world, we have still created 750,000 jobs. This is a good record. We are also very committed to the car industry, which puts us about 20 miles ahead of the opposition. We actually believe this is a country that should be making things and we can look at the car workers of Australia and say, 'We are on your side.'                                                                    Mr SHORTEN:                    Looks like I touched a sore spot. The more they shout, the more they cannot hear it.                                                                    Mr SHORTEN:                    We also know that the best job security in the future is making sure that all Australians are well trained so that they can change jobs and they can find the new opportunities that are created as our economy adjusts to the rise of Asia and the creation of services industries.                              Finally, it is not just people at work that this government is motivated by; it is not just the current jobs; it is not just the skills development of the future. We are the only party in Australian politics who want to make sure we can lift super from nine to 12 per cent so people do not work hard their whole life and retire poor. Those are our priorities. Where are the opposition's?              </DOC>

  I have answered these questions before and let me answer them again. I answered them on the Saturday following Australia Day and I refer the Leader of the Opposition to my transcripts, seeing that he has obviously missed it somehow. When I answered these questions on that day, what I said is what is accurate, which is that I went to Flowerdale on the morning after Australia Day, I returned to my office in Melbourne and I was subsequently briefed in full by my staff on their investigations of what by then were a wide set of allegations that were circulating through the media - not one allegation but a wide set of allegations. When I received that briefing in full I was also briefed that Mr Hodges had offered his resignation to my chief of staff. In those circumstances I met with Mr Hodges, he offered his resignation to me and I accepted it for what I viewed to be a grave error of judgment by Mr Hodges. Mr Hodges acted alone; his conduct was not authorised; it was not the right thing to do and he has paid the price for it.              </DOC>

                    I am aware of those comments and, as the Leader of the Opposition ought to be aware, our Jobs and Competitiveness Program is expected to provide over $3.5 billion of assistance to the aluminium and alumina industries over the next three years to support their competitiveness and to improve their efficiency. The Rusal comments also go to the fact that there are existing policies in China already imposing an effective carbon price, and that is before you take into account the fact that China is in the process of taking further action on climate change and to limit carbon pollution, including agreeing at the international conference in Durban to be part of a global emissions reduction regime which is to be developed for both developed and developing countries and would be agreed by 2015. China has also announced that in 2013 it will introduce pilot emissions trading schemes across major cities and regions covering over 200 million people and China aims to scale this up to a nationwide scheme.                                                                                  What I would say to the Leader of the Opposition                                                      is that we know that the opposition has been out there for a long period of time now trying to sell fear about carbon pricing. I am pleased that the Leader of the Opposition has taken one step back today from playing direct politics with announced job losses and is not maintaining his false assertions from yesterday. But the Leader of the Opposition is still in the fear business. What the Leader of the Opposition should be recognising -                                                                                                       Ms GILLARD:                                                                        Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. My answer to that direct question is that it is more of the fear that we have seen from the opposition. Let us go through the claims they have made to date. The first claim was that the coal industry would close down - proven to be absolute nonsense. Then the Leader of the Opposition was out saying Whyalla would be wiped off the map - absolute nonsense. Then he was out claiming that the government's statements that there would be benefits to nine out of 10 households was untrue. The only untruth in that was coming out of the mouth of the Leader of the Opposition when he tried to declare that those benefits would not be going through to pensioners and to working families. And now the Leader of the Opposition, against that track record of always getting it wrong, of always preferring fear over facts, is going back to the same well and inviting people to believe fear over facts again. The truth is that this is a tough time for the aluminium industry, as has been made clear by Alcoa. The pressures on them include the pressures of the Australian dollar. That is why we are working to support jobs today and will continue doing it tomorrow. The opposition, of course, have got absolutely no plans for jobs.                                                                                     </DOC>

  I thank the member for Robertson for her question. It is an important question because she is inviting me to explain why it is important to working people that we return the budget to surplus, why that is important to our economy and to jobs and growth.                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    To the opposition, which obviously is yelling about all of this at the moment because they have got no economic plans so all they can do is scream abuse, maybe they might learn something if they listened. Why is it important to working people that we return the budget to surplus? First and foremost, events in Europe basically prove to us and prove to the world that there has never been a more important time to stick to your fiscal plans and to stick to fiscal discipline. That is a clear lesson out of Europe. Secondly, having strong public finances is important to our banks, it is important to underwriting and underpinning our banking system, and our banking system being there to provide loans and to enable investment means jobs. Thirdly, our economy is growing solidly, and when your economy is growing solidly it is the right thing to do to retreat the footprint of government and to allow the private sector to do more. Fourthly, a disciplined budget creates the space for the Reserve Bank should it choose to move on monetary policy, that is, should it choose to lower interest rates. That is why it is important for working people that the government return a surplus. The government has a clear determination to do so, and we will do so in 2012-13, as promised.                              It is not easy to return to surplus. It means you have to work hard, contain spending and make savings. And we have worked hard to keep spending at 1.5 per cent in terms of -                                                                     Ms GILLARD:                    You have to contain spending, and we are doing that. You have to match spending with savings, and we are doing that. Compare that to where the opposition's -                                                                     Ms GILLARD:                    Compare that to the opposition's approach. They started with a commitment to surplus from the Leader of the Opposition. That has gone down to doing it 'as quickly as possible' from the leader. Then, 'as soon as possible' from the shadow Treasurer. Then it is an 'aim' from the deputy leader. Then it is a 'hope' from the Leader of the Opposition. Then it is an 'aspiration' from the Leader of the Opposition. Then it is 'let's wait and see' from the deputy leader. Then it is 'well, it just depends' from the shadow finance minister. Then it is 'we have to be measured' from the shadow Treasurer. Then it is 'we have to see the books' from the Manager of Opposition Business. Then, today, from Senator Abetz, an 'extravagant promise'. That is the sinking commitment to any form of surplus by the opposition. Unlike their shambles, we are very clear about a return to surplus and we will deliver it.               </DOC>

  I thank the Deputy Leader of the Opposition for her question. I did notice that once the question had been asked there was an interjection, by the Leader of the Opposition, I understand, mockingly saying 'Tuvalu, but it is sinking.' On the question of climate change, for the people of Tuvalu, the people of Kiribati, for the people in the climate change small island states, this is not a joke.                                                                    Mr RUDD:                    I was simply reflecting upon the impact of that interjection on people who are facing the hard edge of climate change realities around the world: the disappearance of their countries. On the question posed by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition I make the following observations. I am advised that a number of countries have carbon prices higher than Australia's - a proposed price. For example, Norway's carbon tax on petrol is up to A$60; Switzerland's carbon tax on certain fossil fuels is around A$36; and in Canada the province of British Columbia has a carbon tax that will increase to around $28 per tonne in July 2012.                              I find it remarkable that those opposite have difficulty confronting facts in response to a question. I can repeat those three if they wish, but I will go on. The United Kingdom has introduced a price -                                                                     Mr RUDD:                    Thank you for your guidance and assistance, Mr Speaker. In this generally shared response, let me go on to the next point I was going to make, which is that the United Kingdom has introduced a price floor for the electricity generating sector to provide incentives for investment. Their target price floor is around $24 for the year 2013-14. Furthermore, I advise the House that we have previously seen the EU price sit above 20 euros for extended periods of time for most of the period between 2005 and 2008, and the price has rarely dropped between -                                                                     Mr RUDD:                    The price has rarely dropped below 20 euros and at times it has gone above 30 euros. But I say to honourable members opposite that, given that they supposedly represent the party of business and markets, if they were to begin to look at the projections forward from market advisory services, for example, the Bloomberg New Energy Finance report of December last year, that report estimated that the EU carbon price is likely to be around 24.7 euros by the year 2015. I say to those opposite that if they are asking questions about carbon price, they in fact represent the realities of what is occurring around the world. It contrasts with a $48 billion plan, the so-called 'direct action plan', unfunded and uncosted, by those opposite.               </DOC>

  I thank the member from Canberra for that very important question, because we on this side of the House understand the importance of policies that promote growth and support jobs. The dignity of work and the opportunities that come from earning a decent living are absolutely fundamental to what we on this side of the House believe. We are not called the Australian Labor Party for nothing, because we believe in the dignity of work and we believe in the importance of supporting jobs, and that is why we acted so decisively during the global financial crisis and the global recession. And that is why we are proud of the fact that unemployment is at 5.2 per cent and that is why we are so engaged in working with those sectors of the economy that are impacted by a higher dollar, because we understand the importance of supporting employment and making sure that we have got modern industry which is both productive and competitive because we understand the importance of jobs to the security and wellbeing of our population. That is why we are so committed to delivering a surplus in 2012-13. We will deliver a surplus in 2012-13 because that is the appropriate thing to do when you have got an economy growing at trend. But that is not a belief which is shared by those opposite. We have got the three stooges of their economic team -                                                                     Mr SWAN:                    Yes, I withdraw, Mr Speaker. We have got the Leader of the Opposition and we have got the shadow Treasurer and the shadow finance spokesman, who have all abandoned their commitment to a surplus. Despite all of the time asserting that deficits produce higher interest rates and they are going to mean the end of the world, they have now abandoned their commitment to a surplus not just in 2012-13 but in the years that follow that as well, Mr Speaker. And what is one of the reasons why they have done that? Well, I can tell you one of them: so that they can give a big fat tax cut to Gina Rinehart and Clive Palmer. That is one of their objectives. That is why their budget is completely out of control. We also know it is out of control because the shadow Treasurer has now confessed that he really did say there was a $70 billion crater in their budget bottom line.                                                                    Mr SWAN:                    Most certainly, because I am talking about the importance of a surplus, and there is the attitude of the member for Wentworth the other night on The 730 Report as there was a really wry smile when he was asked about the shadow Treasurer. We on this side of the House are committed to delivering a surplus to support jobs. We can do that to make sure that the people of this country are secure. Those opposite simply want to wreck our economy.                                                                   -                                </DOC>

  I want to thank the member for Denison for his very serious question. I also acknowledge the former member for Denison; it is great to see him here. Like the member for Denison, I was very disappointed to hear about the Tasmanian government's cut to elective surgery, which I think he is referring to here. I was particularly disappointed because the Commonwealth government will contribute $2½ billion to the Tasmanian health system over the next decade. It is a very significant investment, and I know that the member for Denison and the members for Braddon, Bass, Franklin and Lyons expected much more from the Tasmanian government than what they have got in recent times.                              I can inform the House and those members who are interested that we will be requiring much closer oversight of the Tasmanian government's management of the health system in Tasmania. I think the saying might be 'we will be all over them like a rash' because this withdrawal of effort in elective surgery is very bad for the people of Tasmania. But we are not contemplating a Commonwealth takeover of the Tasmanian hospital system or indeed of the hospital system in any state or territory. What we will continue to do is make our investments, under close scrutiny, in areas like the Royal Hobart Hospital in the electorate of the member for Denison; the Mersey Community Hospital; and extra funding through the national partnership agreement to improve public hospitals in Tasmania, including extra funding into emergency departments, elective surgery, subacute beds, more radiation oncology services, more GP superclinics, better surgical services and so on. We are disappointed with the actions of the Tasmanian government. I know the member for Denison and my colleagues are concerned about those changes.                                                                    Ms PLIBERSEK:                    What I can say is that we will continue to be all over them like a rash. I hear the shadow minister interjecting. He is the guy who comes from the side that ripped a billion dollars out of public hospitals.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Capricornia for her genuine interest, particularly in the Bruce Highway and the roads of Central Queensland. Indeed, her electorate has benefited from the doubling of the roads budget that has been undertaken by this government - up to some $28 billion - and, indeed, our much greater investment is delivering results. Andrew McKellar of the Australian Automobile Association backed it in, describing it as good news that there are now, in their report recently released, fewer high risk roads than five years ago.                              The Bruce Highway has been a major beneficiary. We have invested in the Bruce Highway - and you do not have to believe those on this side of the House. This is what the member for Herbert had to say:                              I will give Labor a pat on the back and say they have spent more in their four or five years on the Bruce Highway than we did before.                              And he is right. More in four years than they did in 12, even though the Leader of the National Party was the Minister for Transport and Regional Services at the time: $1.2 billion over 12 years. You know the neglect, Mr Speaker, because you are one of the people who has made representations to me about this. If only they had a plan. They run around and speak about specific projects but they say sometimes that they have a plan. The member for Dawson said they had a plan. He has a website and it had on it 'Fix the Bruce'. It went up in June last year - the date is on the website: 28 June - and it said 'Coming soon'. Blank page - a blank page for their plan.                              I clicked on again before question time. Guess what? It is still 'Coming soon'. Not a word, still coming soon, still blank, because they do not really have a plan. If you are going to have a responsible plan in infrastructure, you also have to have a plan to return the budget to surplus.                                                                    Mr ALBANESE:                    Indeed, Mr Speaker. To have a plan to build roads you have to have a responsible fiscal position. You have to get the budget back to surplus. We have done it. The Leader of the 'Noalition' says no to a budget surplus. Senator Abetz in a doorstop this morning has called it an extravagant promise. More and more, when you ask them what they are going to do about infrastructure and roads they no longer make promises. These are now just aspirations. You cannot drive on an aspiration. You cannot catch a train on an aspiration and you cannot have a port that is just an aspiration. You need to have real plans, properly funded. We have it, you have not.               </DOC>

  I refer the House to the answer I gave to these sorts of questions yesterday. I said yesterday that to my knowledge no such briefing was given to the press gallery on the assertions and allegations made by the member who asked the question, I point out that Mr Hodges has left my employ because of what I thought was a grave error of judgment. If the member has very specific other allegations then she should put them.

  I thank the member for Hindmarsh for that question. For most Australians, nothing is more important than the health and wellbeing of our families. In the event of illness, people want access to the most appropriate care where they need it and when they need it. That is why, after inheriting a system that the Leader of the Opposition had cut by a billion dollars and inheriting shortages of doctors and shortages of nurses, we are training 1,000 extra nurses a year and 6,000 extra doctors over 10 years and we are putting new investments into cutting waiting times and cutting the length of emergency department waits as well. We are making sure that people can get GP care where they need it and when they need it.                               We are able to make these investments by carefully considering where every dollar goes. That is why we are introducing the means test on private health insurance. This is a means test which will not affect 20 million Australians. It will affect no-one who earns under $83,000 a year - not a dollar lost if you earn less than $83,000 a year. As your pay increases the subsidy decreases, but you have to be, as a family, earning a quarter of a million dollars a year before you lose the subsidy entirely. These modest changes will save $2.4 billion over the next three years. That is a whole year's pay for 13,000 extra doctors or 26,500 extra nurses. Why are we doing this? We are doing this because we do not want a situation where the people who sit on this front bench or that front bench have their private health insurance subsidised by the people who clean this chamber at night.                               As health minister, every day I hear about the needs in our health system. I hear about the diagnostic imaging which is needed in one community, I hear about the GP shortage in another community and I hear about the brilliant new medicines which are being discovered all the time by our medical researchers. I know that people on this side of the chamber want to fund those new investments. They want to see that better health care.                               But to do that we need to spend every dollar well. Yes, we do want to do better on dental care. We have made huge improvements in dental care, with 1½ million checkups for teenagers, with 220 new dental chairs and with projects like the $2.1 million 10-chair teaching clinic at Adelaide Dental Hospital, which serves the constituents of Adelaide, including those in the member for Hindmarsh's electorate. He has been a huge advocate for better dental care. But to do those things, we need measures like the means testing of private health insurance.               </DOC>

  Heavens above! It has really come to this - nothing to say about the economy, no commitment to a surplus. When the member walked to the dispatch box, I thought she might be asking a question about child care, which would have enabled me to inform the House that there is more childcare support for working families than ever before. But, no, of course the muckraking continues because this is an opposition with -                                                                     Ms GILLARD:                    I will, Mr Speaker. But this is an opposition with no plans for the economy, no plans for working families, no plans for a surplus - and it is written all over their tactics.                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    On the question, I have made it perfectly clear that these matters are for the independent umpire, Fair Work Australia. I know the opposition has no regard for the independence of Fair Work Australia or the police -                                                                     Ms GILLARD:                    I say again that this matter is being investigated by Fair Work -                                                                     Ms GILLARD:                    The matter is being investigated by Fair Work Australia, an independent body. That is proper. It should reach its own conclusions in the way it best sees fit and the opposition should stop this campaign of trying to stand over the independent umpire, just as we saw them try to stand over the police last year.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for La Trobe for her question. Families everywhere recognise how important education is. They focus on it because they know that if we are a well-educated nation we will be a successful nation. We will be a nation that is capable of meeting the challenges of the future. Our kids, as they go through school, will have the skills and the learning that will enable them to take up the jobs of the future. That is particularly important. Just as it is absolutely essential that our future prosperity is linked to having world-class schools, our future prosperity also rests very much on managing the national economy. Labor is committed to returning the budget to surplus and we are determined to deliver that, just as we have delivered record investment in education, whether it has been in facilities in schools or in providing computers for kids in years nine to 12 right around Australia.                               I am asked what community support exists for the government's investments. It is widespread. In fact it is so widespread that when I looked at the site of the shadow finance minister, www.andrewrobb.com.au, I found that he was instructing his constituents to congratulate everyone who has approached either the coalition government or the Labor government over the last six years to secure this funding. The shadow minister for finance has very conveniently produced a list for his constituents on his website, and when I went to that list, I suddenly found all those investments that the Gillard government had made in education. Whether it was St Paul's Primary School, with the refurbishment of classrooms and corridors, whether it was Our Lady of the Sacred Heart College with the National Secondary School Computer Fund, whether it was Bentleigh West Primary School with the 2009 National School Pride Program sporting ground upgrade - how incredible that the very shadow finance minister who argued against this government taking the right steps to stimulate this economy in the global financial crisis is now producing a list on his own website commending this government for doing the very same thing. If you ever wanted a clearer indication of the opposition's confusion over economic policy and the commitment to education that exists in this parliament, the member for Goldstein's website shows it clearly.               </DOC>

  To the Deputy Leader of the Opposition I say that question is misleading people in this parliament. She is raising allegations against others that she must know are not sustained by the facts. I do not believe it is an appropriate standard for the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to come into this place and use a question to make allegations which she must know are contrary to the facts.                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    In relation to Ben Hubbard, which she has raised - and if she stops yelling and starts listening then she might hear the facts - these are the facts. They are on the record from 13 May 2010 and fully available to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition if she wants facts rather than muckraking. The facts on the public record are: the industrial registrar telephoned my chief of staff, Ben Hubbard - not the other way around, as the Deputy Leader of the Opposition alleges.                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    The Leader of the Opposition is yelling, 'And then he rang back!' Heavens above, how pathetic!                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. The deputy leader's question was full of allegations and imputations. They are unworthy of her and unworthy of this place. The facts are on the record from 13 May last year showing the industrial registrar initiating contact and the nature of the contact. I invite people to look at the facts, not to listen to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition's question, which has been brought to this place to mislead people. I then invite them to look at the facts which are on the public record from 19 October 2011 regarding contact between a media advisor in Senator Evans's office and Fair Work Australia. The facts are there for all to see. It is apparent that the kind of terminology used by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is uncalled for and unwarranted. This muckraking by the opposition brings it little credit and does it no good. Ultimately working families in this country want to know whether you stand for something: whether you stand for them, whether you stand for their interests, whether you stand for a strong economy, whether you worry about their jobs, and whether you worry about the government's finances. The opposition is incapable of doing that. They just want to shovel money at some of their rich mates and all of this is a cover-up of those intentions.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Hunter for the question because it enables me to address the underlying fundamental strength of the Australian economy. Over the summer period, key resource investments have again reinforced the fact that Australia is a world-leading destination for investment in the mining industry. ABARES estimates that at the moment we have planned and committed capital investment of a total of $455 billion. This is in essence about investment, which in turn creates jobs - something the coalition never wants to speak about. More importantly, most of this investment has occurred since the government's announcements of the MRRT and the refinement of the PRRT.                               There has been a 34 per cent increase in committed and planned capital investment in Australia since April 2011 and a 74 per cent increase from October 2010. Perhaps more importantly, it is also very much focused on key commodity sectors such as oil and gas, iron ore and coal. Perhaps the most recent investment was announced yesterday by Rio Tinto of an additional $3.4 billion expansion of the iron ore sector in north-west Western Australia. Perhaps the most pleasing was the Ichthys announcement in Darwin, a $34 billion investment, which is going to be a game-changer for Northern Australia. This effectively represents one of the largest ever investments in Australia. It represents 3,000 additional construction jobs but, perhaps more importantly, it represents 700 long-term, highly-skilled, well-paying jobs in operations. It is estimated that it is going to add 20 per cent to the Northern Territory's gross state product. It is a very significant long-term economic opportunity for Australia. But already, yesterday we had a major announcement, for example, by Clough engineering of a $140 million contract for construction related to the Ichthys project, this added to an announcement last week of a further $350 million commitment for construction activities for Clough engineering relating to the $39 billion Wheatstone project.                               I simply want to reinforce that our fundamentals are very strong from an economic perspective. This commitment represents in the LNG sector alone $175 billion. This is going to create major jobs in construction, big Australian content, and long-term well-paid jobs for construction workers. I simply say it is about time the coalition stop talking down the Australian economy because the record speaks for itself.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Petrie for her question. The greatest security all Australians can have is to be able to work in a strong economy. The Gillard government will continue the economic policies that have made our economy the envy of the world. The Gillard government are taking a determined and strategic approach to improve women's economic security over the course of their lives. We want to create the flexibility for more women to join the workforce and to work as long as they want. That is why we have introduced the first paid parental leave scheme in the history of this country. More than 130,000 Australian families have claimed paid parental leave since it was first started. That is why we have also increased the childcare rebate for out-of-pocket expenses from 30 to 50 per cent. That is why we are also committed to reforming the Equal Opportunity for Women in the Workplace Act, and the agency, and improving women's participation on government boards.                              Of course, there is no greater boost to working women's economic security than our removal of the coalition's Work Choices. We want to help women make the most of their working lives, and we are also making significant reforms to superannuation to help achieve that goal. It is of great concern to this government that, while women live longer than men, their superannuation balances are on average 40 per cent lower. We will increase the superannuation guarantee from nine to 12 per cent. A 30-year-old woman earning around $70,000 will have an extra $108,000 in retirement savings thanks to this increase in superannuation. We will also deliver $830 million in tax concessions to low-income workers with salaries of up to $37,000. There are 3.6 million Australians on low incomes, and 2.1 million of them are working women, who will receive these tax concessions.                              The Gillard government is delivering fairness for all Australians, including women, by returning the budget to surplus next financial year. But we know that the coalition are willing to sacrifice Australian families, women and some of the most vulnerable in our community to fund their $70 billion black hole. We know they want to cut back pensions, and 70 per cent of single age-pensioners are women. They want to cut child care - 'the dead hand of government', the member for Mayo called it. They want higher taxes on superannuation for low-income working Australians, and 60 per cent of them are women. For them, a fairer Australia is not a priority but just another of their 'maybes', perhaps an aspiration. It is only Labor that will deliver improved economic security for women in the workplace.              </DOC>

  Now we are into absurdity upon absurdity. Of course, Fair Work Australia is independent. Of course, it therefore would be quite wrong for me to reflect on the conduct of Fair Work Australia, because those comments could be read as trying to get Fair Work Australia to do something and therefore seeking to impinge on its independence. So I will not do what the Manager of Opposition Business is inviting me to do, because to do so would be quite wrong, to do so would be to impinge on the independence of Fair Work Australia, to do so would actually be to do what the Manager of Opposition Business the rest of the time says that the government should not do.                              You are in the depths of a logical absurdity, because your muckraking is so without content that you twist and you turn and you scratch and you claw to try and see if you can find another little bit of mud to throw. Well, I will tell you this about Fair Work Australia. It is independent. It is unbiased. It is the umpire we created because the Howard government, in the embrace of Work Choices, had gutted the industrial umpire. It is there to make sure we have an appropriate balance between the interests of employees and employers. And it is of no surprise to me that the very existence of Fair Work Australia offends those opposite, because they are still so in love with Work Choices that anything that treats working people fairly is an offence in their eyes. That is actually, at base, what most of this is about. They love trashing the industrial umpire because they think at some point they might politically profit from it, because they want the industrial umpire gone and they want Work Choices back. They want working people ripped off. That is what they have always stood for. That is what they will always stand for.                              This government is determined to get things done. We are delivering. On that side of this House, they might huff and puff and deal with matters like this, but this government is determined to get things done and we will continue to do so, managing the economy in the interests of working people, providing the Fair Work system so employees get a decent go -                                                                     Ms GILLARD:                    investing in skills so people have an opportunity in life, returning the budget to surplus because it is the right economic call. We know you are against all of those things. We will just keep getting on with the job.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Page for her question. I know that, unfortunately, she and the community that she represents are no strangers to dealing with flood situations. I have had the opportunity to talk to the member and to members of her community about flooding there in the past.                              On the weekend, I travelled to the townships of St George and Roma in Queensland and Moree in New South Wales to visit communities affected by flooding. I was accompanied by the members for Maranoa and Parkes and by Senator Barnaby Joyce for different pieces of the journey. Whilst we travelled, we had the opportunity to meet with people directly affected by flooding.                              Flood waters in Queensland were starting to subside but of course there were people who were returning to their homes and seeing the damage that had been done. Many of the people that we met had actually seen their homes on this occasion flooded for the second time, and some of them for the third time. It is understandable that when people have to turn around and turn around, and sometimes turn around again, to restore their homes to liveability after a flood, it strains patience and it strains people's emotional reserves. We saw that on display in these communities. In Moree, to take just one example, I visited with Kent and Julie Harris, who invited me into their home. It was Julie's birthday and she said the best present she was going to get was to sleep in her own bed after being away from her home for 10 days.                              As we have seen in other natural disasters, on this occasion we saw the best of Australia on display - the magnificent response of the volunteers, the SES and the emergency personnel, and of course the ADF, who were out in these communities helping with the clean-up. We also have Centrelink staff out there helping people get payments processed.                              We are in the course of dispersing more than $5 billion to Queensland for flood recovery from the natural disasters that we lived through last year. In this set of floods, we are making assistance available. In the Australian government disaster recovery payments, we have already granted 12,473 claims that have totalled $14 million so far. The journey of recovery for these communities will continue and we will be with them as they go through that journey of recovery. Many of them also raised with me the need to look at flood mitigation and of course we will be working with those communities and the Queensland government on that. For now, our thoughts are with them as they get about cleaning up the community and their homes, and restarting their lives.              </DOC>

  Let me point out the following facts. The Leader of the National Party is misusing the modelling completely. He is ascribing a cause and effect here which the modelling does not - a continuing part of the opposition's fear campaign on carbon pricing. The one thing you always know about the opposition when it comes to carbon pricing is that whatever they say is not the truth. Let us just look at the scoreboard. They said the coal industry would be shut down. Not true. They said Whyalla would be wiped off the map. Not true. The Leader of the Opposition wrote to the Auditor-General disputing the government's claims that nine out of 10 households were receiving assistance and he was repudiated because his approach was not true. At every stage in every way, the Leader of the Opposition and the team he leads have been out there spreading fear and not telling people the truth. It is time that the Leader of the National Party and the opposition generally actually respected working people enough to say to them what the truth is for their industry. The truth for this industry is that we are seeing a high Australian dollar with all of the pressure that that brings to bear. The Manager of Opposition Business might be bored by that, but the one million Australians who work in manufacturing are not bored by it. They understand the pressure of the high Australian dollar on their shoulders. Those working in the aluminium industry also understand that we have seen the price of aluminium fall by over 20 per cent since May last year. We are seeing reduced global prices. Those who work in the aluminium industry -                                                                     Ms GILLARD:                    In response to both the original question I was asked and what the Leader of the Opposition has just said, let me use the words of Alcoa. They would know about aluminium, you would think. Their review of their own industry, their own business, says:                              The review has not been prompted by a future price on carbon. The present situation is a result of low metal prices, a high Australian dollar and input costs.                              That is what Alcoa have said. No amount of twisting and turning and spreading of fear actually changes those facts. To the Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the National Party, who are keen to quote modelling here, let me quote this part of the modelling:                              For aluminium to 2020 output is expected to remain at about current levels with or without a carbon price.                              Try telling Australians the truth.                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    Mr Speaker, I was relying on notes which have confidential sections. If the Leader of the Opposition has not done his homework on this issue before coming into this parliament, that is not my problem. He pretends to care about jobs and he cannot even be bothered about reading Alcoa's statement before he comes in, apparently.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Corangamite for his question and I also thank him and the member for Corio for meeting with me and other ministers this morning so that we could receive the workers from Alcoa. I wonder what they would make of the political use of their potential job losses by the opposition when they understand what is happening in their industry. I think they would find that a fairly dismaying tactic from the opposition.                              The member for Corangamite has asked me about circumstances in the global economy, and I expect to hear interjections from the opposition because, as we know, they could not care less about circumstances in either the global economy or the Australian economy. But on this side of the parliament we have been monitoring the situation in Europe and we welcome the fact that the Greek parliament passed a package of restrictive budget measures today. It was not easy, but it had to be done. That is one step in what is a long journey of recovery for the economy of Greece, but it was a necessary step. Unless they took that step, the circumstances of a disorderly default could have been upon Greece with all of the implications for that nation and for the Eurozone and Europe in general.                              This highlights the ongoing financial problems we are seeing in Europe which are reflected by credit downgrades last month to nine of the Euro area's 17 members. The ultimate proof of all of the problems there is that 23 per cent of men and women are unemployed. When Australians look at those scenes from Greece, including some of the violence that happened outside the parliament, they can rest assured that the economy of Australia is in a very different shape. We have low unemployment; we have created 700,000 since coming to office. In the same period the US economy has lost six million jobs. If the US had been creating jobs at the same rate as us, 15 million more Americans would be employed today. We have low debt - less than one-tenth of the debt of other major advanced economies - and we have a clear plan to return the budget to surplus in 2012-13, exactly as promised. That is the right thing to do for an economy growing at trend, it is the right thing to do to create space for private sector growth, it is the right signal to send to international markets that Australia is a great place to invest in and it is the right thing to do in managing the economy in the interests of working people, because at the end of the day the purpose of the economy is to serve the interests of working people and particularly give them great job opportunities and the opportunity to start their own business. We are clear on our intentions about the surplus, and that is in very stark contrast to the continuing muddle on the other side of politics.              </DOC>

  To the shadow Treasurer I would say: do not verbal me. If he wants to quote one of my speeches then bring it in and quote it in full, because the idea that I have ever exhibited anything other than concern for Australians who have lost their jobs is completely untrue and I am not having the shadow Treasurer come in, as part of the campaign of fear and misrepresentation by the opposition, and pretend that is true. The people who have used workers and their jobs as political playthings in this parliament sit on the opposition front benches. They are very, very happy to walk into a steel-manufacturing business to stand alongside a steelworker while the cameras are rolling and then, as soon as the cameras have gone, they come into this place and they vote against the future of that industry by voting against the Steel Transformation Plan. They are very, very happy to go and stand in a car-manufacturing plant and look at the cars being made with the very highly skilled workers who make them, but when it comes to being counted in supporting the car industry they stand for a half a billion dollar cutback now and the end of assistance in 2015. They want every worker in the car industry to be out of a job. Of course, we know too that, whilst they pretend to be the friend of small businesses and to care about the people who work in small businesses, in this parliament they voted against tax breaks for small businesses and an instant asset write-off which would have put them into a better position and enabled them to employ people and to continue to generate jobs. They did that because they would prefer to give more money to some of the most profitable mining companies in the world.                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    So to the shadow Treasurer I would say that as Prime Minister I have been explaining to the Australian people and the Australian community the nature of the structural change in our economy today. Our economy is strong. The strength of our economy is driving further changes: the strong Aussie dollar, the opportunities that will come in the region of the world in which we live which is continuing to grow. That is bringing changes - painful changes - in parts of the economy and we are working with those sections of the economy and those working people in these days of change, working to increase their skills because that will be so important for the jobs of the future, working to give them the best of technology because they cannot compete if they do not have the NBN, working to get business tax right including tax breaks for small businesses, working with manufacturing through my manufacturing task force and the assistance we are providing industries like the car industry. We will never treat working people with the kind of contempt that is routine for the opposition.                               Leave not granted.              </DOC>

I see Premier Barnett frequently. I am always available to speak to him should he want to speak to me and he has never raised this issue with me personally, not once. Should he choose to do so then, of course, I will have the discussion with him.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Capricornia for this question, because I think the government understands just how difficult the international economic environment is and you can see that in terms of the pictures that are coming out of Greece as I speak. But the fact is progress does need to be made in Europe and that progress needs to be made despite the fact that whatever happens there will be a very long and painful adjustment in that community. We do feel the impact of these global events particularly in Europe on our own economy and on our budget and we were upfront about that in our mid-year budget update. But here fortunately our economy is seven per cent larger than it was prior to the global financial crisis, because the government acted decisively to support jobs and growth. And, of course, we have seen something like 700,000 jobs created in this country since the government came to power. If those opposite had had their way, Australia would have gone into recession and we would have seen hundreds of thousands of Australians who were unemployed and we would have seen tens of thousands of small businesses hit the wall.                              But our economic fundamentals here are strong. We have got solid growth, we have got low unemployment, we have got contained inflation, we have got strong public finances and we have got a record pipeline of investment. But our revenues have been hit by these events in Europe and around the world. We have lost something like $140 billion, ripped from government revenues because of global instability. And that would have happened to those opposite had they been in power during this period. And, of course, the budget went into deficit. If they had been here, because of their failure to act they would have seen even bigger deficits. But, given that our economy is now growing at trend, we are absolutely determined to bring our budget back to surplus in 2012-13. We are determined to bring it back and that we deliver it. We have seen over the past week or so the slapstick farce of those opposite as they have, one-by-one, walked away from their commitment to bring the budget back to surplus -                                                                     Mr SWAN:                    We are bringing the budget back to surplus. Those opposite have walked away from that commitment and we have found out why: because they have a $70 billion crater in their budget bottom line put together by the three stooges over there.                                                                    Mr SWAN:                    I withdraw - the Leader of the Opposition, the shadow minister for finance and the shadow Treasurer. We have now found out why and how this $70 billion figure got into the public arena - the shadow Treasurer decided to play a trick on the other two stooges, a really difficult trick.                                                                    Mr SWAN:                    Certainly, Mr Speaker, because we found out -                                                                     Mr SWAN:                    I withdraw. We found out on the weekend from Laurie Oakes the type of trick that was played by the shadow Treasurer.               </DOC>

  I thank the member for his question because here we have a typical example of what comes from the opposition on a daily basis. What we have is the opposition constantly talking down our economy.                                                                    Mr SWAN:                    Yes, Mr Speaker, the opposition is constantly talking down our economy by exaggerating the impact of public debt in this country, by repeatedly misrepresenting the budget bottom line.                                                The member for Flinders then left the chamber.                                                                    Mr SWAN:                    When it comes to public debt, our position is the envy of the world. When it comes to the level of unemployment in this developed economy, our position is the envy of the world. When we look at the investment pipeline, our position is the envy of the world. When we look at our experience during the global financial crisis and the global recession, our position was the envy of the world. Those opposite are now in a shambles when it comes to fiscal policy. If they were in power, they would blow a $70 billion hole in our budget bottom line.                              The level of public debt in this country is very low by international standards - less than one-tenth of major advanced economies. We are being held up as a perfect example of what to do by the International Monetary Fund, by the OECD and by the World Bank, yet the opposition come into this House day in, day out and talk down our economy. They know that our revenues have been written down by $140 billion. Despite all of that, because of the application of our very strict fiscal policy, we will be coming back to surplus in 2012-13.                                                                    Mr SWAN:                    The reason they laugh like hyenas is that they know their position is a shambles - a $70 billion crater in their budget bottom line before they make any other commitments to the people of Australia before the next election. The Leader of the Opposition, the shadow Treasurer and the shadow finance spokesman simply cannot make their numbers add up. We have the farcical situation where the shadow Treasurer told Laurie Oakes that he is going to give a figure to the shadow cabinet and, depending which figure it is, he will know who is the leaker on the opposition front bench. I think we know today. He gave Moe over there the $50 billion figure but it was Curly over there he gave the $70 billion figure to.               </DOC>

  I would like to thank the member for his question. In his electorate, courtesy of this government's reform of superannuation, 31,000 of his constituents can expect to increase their superannuation entitlements from nine per cent to 12 per cent.                              There are three ways in which this government is assisting Australians to deal with the future and making sure that people can make ends meet. The first way is by achieving a surplus, the second way is by supporting jobs and the third way is by having a view about the future and a positive plan for the future. We are achieving surplus. In the last budget -                                                                     Mr SHORTEN:                    I like getting a lecture from the other side about surplus - they have seven different positions on it! This lot opposite remind me of the bar scene out of Star Wars.                                                                    Mr SHORTEN:                    In the last budget we had $22.6 billion in savings, and we are engaging in the fastest fiscal consolidation on record -                                                                     Mr SHORTEN:                    When you look at Australia's position compared to the rest of the world and you have a look at the Commonwealth net debt, you will see that we are doing far better. We are at 8.5 per cent. The Canadians are at 36 per cent. The Germans are at 57 per cent. The United Kingdom is at 77 per cent. Italy is at 100 per cent. Our net debt, courtesy of this budget and this government, is far lower than the debts of other nations.                              But it is not just about the surplus; we are supporting jobs. That is why we have a manufacturing policy which stands up for the automotive industry.                                                                    Mr SHORTEN:                    Those opposite may laugh, but their policy is to buy a white flag and a European car. We are also standing up for apprenticeships - 130,000 new places next year. We are also standing up for industry and jobs by using the mining tax to help provide a tax cut for small business. This is the contrast when we talk about supporting jobs. The difference between Labor and Liberal could be no starker or clearer than when it comes to the mining tax. We want to use the mining tax to lift people's retirement savings. We want to use the mining tax to help small business. They want to use the mining tax to give a multibillion dollar tax break to billionaires.                              We are the ones who have a plan for the future. We are the ones who are putting forward the National Broadband Network. We are the ones who are investing in innovation. We are the ones who are investing in superannuation. Indeed, we are the ones who are willing to challenge the banks when we do not agree with what they are doing.                              The member for North Sydney made some comments today. He accused the government of being out of touch with the banks' funding profiles. We on this side note that he is out of touch with the funding profiles of working families.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Reid for his question and his ongoing interest in the economy and jobs. We on this side of the House are determined to ensure that working families enjoy employment and that they enjoy the benefits that come from a job. That is why we acted in the global financial crisis.                              One of the things we did was create the infrastructure employment program. Last Friday I was in the electorate of Wentworth at the opening of Rugby League Central, a great new five-star building on the SCG-SFS site, the construction of which created 443 jobs. Not just that but there will be ongoing economic benefit, with some 5,000 young people every year going through, getting access to training and facilities in an interactive relationship, encouraging them to participate in junior rugby league. Under the Indigenous Employment Program operating out of there, we saw the Indigenous All Stars game begin the rugby league season, as it does, engaging with Indigenous people, helping to close the gap not just in a cultural way but also in a very real economic way. I am asked how it has been received. I was amazed that the day after the opening the Leader of the Nationals described it as 'This is just one example of waste.' Those opposite presided over regional rorts, they had an ethanol plant which was never built, they had a cheese factory which went out of business and they had a railway line that burnt down. None of that happened under this government's program. More than 5,000 projects, all extremely positive, all creating jobs have been condemned by those opposite as 'just waste'.                              Just yesterday I was with the member for Watson at the Back to Belmore game, the first Canterbury home game since 1998, creating not only jobs in the construction and redevelopment of Belmore Oval but also ongoing jobs - young people were selling hotdogs and pies, providing security and doing ongoing construction jobs. Indeed, as a result of our community infrastructure programs more than 700 sportsgrounds right around the country will benefit.                                                                    Mr ALBANESE:                    It is good for jobs, good for employment, good for health outcomes and good for engagement in our community. It is all positive, dismissed by those opposite as 'just waste,' because they just do not get what real positive investment achieves, compared with what they did when they were in office.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Makin for his question. It is a fact that Labor always puts jobs and economic growth as a priority in its economic policy settings. It must never be forgotten that Labor managed the economy to support jobs during the global financial crisis and, as a result, our economy is outperforming most industrialised economies. Since we came to office we have, in fact, created 750,000 jobs.                              This government will continue to manage the economy, to deliver prosperity for all Australians. We have low unemployment, low debt, solid growth, moderate inflation and massive business investment. The government is focused on making the economic circumstances in the future good for business investment and boosting jobs. We are making record investments in skills, education and infrastructure. We are improving productivity, boosting savings, cutting the company tax rate and assisting small business. All of these elements will support jobs growth in the economy. But given the scaremongering by the opposition it is important to point out, mindful of some of the recent announcements, that it is always important not to be talking down the economy but to be pointing to some areas where we also have strong jobs creation in our economy.                              Last week the job advertisement survey, which is published, and the NAB business survey showed an improvement in the employment outlook, with over 190,000 jobs being advertised each week. When the other side talks down the economy they conveniently ignore a number of very important jobs announcements that have been made by particular companies. What might they include? Woolworths plans to open dozens of new stores this year, which will create more than 10,000 jobs; the investment go-ahead that has been given for the Ichthys LNG project, which will create 4,000 jobs at its peak - four major projects in the Queensland LNG industry that have the potential to create 18,000 direct and indirect jobs; and GlaxoSmithKline's announcement earlier this month of a $60 million investment at its Boronia site, which will create 58 jobs.                              You have here people on the other side who undermine confidence. They talk down the economy, they want to directly slash jobs, with their $70 billion in budget cuts. Those on that side want to put up company tax; on this side, we want to bring down company tax. We want to stimulate investment. Those on that side want to destroy the auto industry and destroy the steel industry; on this side, we support people's jobs.               </DOC>

  In answer to the member's question, he would be aware that, in this House, I have answered these questions before. I have referred to Ms Sattler's statements before. Indeed, I read two of her statements onto the public record. I would say to the opposition generally that of course we know what this is about. They have nothing to say about jobs -                                                                     Ms GILLARD:                    Thank you, Mr Speaker. I was directly relevant to the question when I referred the member who asked the question to questions asked of me in this place last week, where I referred to statements by Kim Sattler and read them on to the Hansard. That is my answer.                              As for the rest, this is a cheap attempt to distract from the fact that those opposite have no economic plan for jobs. They are in a complete muddle about a surplus -                                                                     Ms GILLARD:                    they cannot defend their plans to take money off working people and small businesses and give it to big mining companies, and their carbon pricing plan is an expensive shambles. That is why this is -               </DOC>

  I thank the member for his question because it enables me to explain something he clearly has missed. There are elections in Australia generally once every three years. We had one in 2007 and we had one in 2010. I am surprised the member does not have any recollection of the 2010 election; it is the one where he was scrambling for a new seat. In that election we took to the Australian people a policy on private health insurance, and the legislation that is in this parliament reflects that policy which we took to the Australian people. Let us not have any of this absurdity from the opposition. We, in 2010, took to the Australian people a very simple proposition about fairness. We said with the growth in health costs and with the need to keep finding more money to meet the needs of health care in our nation as our population ages and as health treatments get more sophisticated - which is a great thing, but they also get more expensive - that we would need to make sure -                                                                     Ms GILLARD:                    We went to the 2010 election saying that with these healthcare costs - as a simple proposition of fairness - someone who is earning $300,000 a year does not need a young apprentice, a worker in a shop or a worker in a factory to subsidise his or her health insurance.                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    That is the fairness proposition we are bringing to this parliament. Those opposite are full of huff and puff now about private health insurance, but I wonder what is going to be their policy going to the 2013 election, because not one of them has said that they will put this private health insurance rebate back if this parliament changes it. Huff and puff now and then come the election, because they are in such a desperate fiscal mess with the incompetence of their economic team - they know they are $7 billion behind the starting line for surplus -                                                                   The m                  ember                   for Dawson then left the chamber.                                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    They will give it a very big tick. If we want to go back to the 2007 election and compare the record, that is the one in which the Leader of the Opposition was campaigning on an emissions trading scheme and carbon price. Who is not telling the truth now?                                                                  The member for North Sydney then left the chamber                              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Shortland for her question and also for her advocacy for working families, which is certainly very much appreciated in her electorate. It is the case that this government will deliver a surplus so that we can continue to deliver for working families. We understand how important it is to make sure that we help families balance their household budgets. That is why this government said that we would increase support for childcare costs, and we have delivered it. It is why this government said we would help working families with the cost of education, and we have delivered it and we are now extending that assistance to help with the cost of school uniforms. It is why this government has decided and is delivering increased help for those families who have older teenagers - never done by those opposite, but delivered this year from 1 January to those families with teenagers aged between 16 and 19 years who are still at school. Those families are getting up to $4,200 extra a year as a result of this Labor government that is determined to help working families and make sure their children get a great education. And it was this Labor government that decided to introduce the country's first national Paid Parental Leave Scheme. It is this government that has made sure that families do not have to make difficult choice that they had to make under the previous government about whether or not they had to go back to work or could spend time with their newborn baby.                              What we have seen from those opposite is, first of all, that they are not any longer determined to deliver a surplus. What we saw from the Leader of the Opposition yesterday is that he is still determined to spend $4.5 billion a year on his version of paid parental leave and at the same time whack a great big new tax on companies to pay for it. That is what this Leader of the Opposition is all about - whacking at a great big new tax on companies to find $4.5 billion, and not deliver a surplus. And while he is at it he is going to take money out of the pockets of pensioners and families to help cover the $7 billion black hole.              </DOC>

                                                      About a week ago the Leader of the Opposition was channelling Dirty Harry, saying 'make my day' regarding a debate about the economy. Since then we have seen a lot of 'dirty', and I am sure we will see more of that today from the henchmen sent in by the Leader of the Opposition. What we will not see is a responsible debate about the economy. The only thing the Leader of the Opposition has to say about Australia's economy and the global economy are the misrepresentations he peddles about carbon pricing. It truly is a disgrace that the Leader of the Opposition would come into this place and try to pretend to Australian workers that the only thing -                                                                                                       Ms GILLARD:                                                                        The Leader of the Opposition, in asking this question, is continuing to peddle his mistruths to the Australian people: that the only thing that explains change in the Australian economy is carbon pricing. Anyone who has done high school economics would be able to tell you that long-term changes are underway in the Australian economy, and they are being accelerated by the structural transition in our economy now. Anybody who has done high school economics would be able to tell you that the percentage of the Australian economy deployed in manufacturing has been in a long-term decline, but it continues to be a very important industry segment to Australia, employing, as it does, one million                   Australians. The Leader of the Opposition seeks to deny that economic truth and pretend that all structural change in our economy is about carbon pricing. That is a falsehood. It is peddled to the Australian people for political advantage, in a manner calculated to raise concern amongst the Australian community.                                                                                  I say to the Leader of the Opposition that he should do the right thing and listen to the workers at Alcoa, who have a very sophisticated understanding of what is driving change in their business, a very sophisticated understanding of the global market they relate to and a very sophisticated understanding of the business structures in their own business and in the global business they relate to. It insults their intelligence and demeans their capacity when the Leader of the Opposition comes in to this place and peddles this nonsense that would get a fail in high school economics. It certainly demeans anyone who is putting themself forward for consideration as Prime Minister. You cannot do the job by making up facts.                              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Deakin for his question. I know that the member for Deakin, like other Labor members here, is concerned about structural change in our economy and concerned about the impact on working Australians. Labor members understand that our economy is strong by the standards of the world. We can hold our heads up proudly, having worked together during the global financial crisis - government working with employers, employers working with unions, and unions working with representatives of civil society, including those who provide emergency relief to those in difficult circumstances to bring our nation through so that we can now present with a growing economy, low unemployment, strong public finances and strong banks.                              To chart the course for the future, we need to understand what has been achieved and understand the dynamics of change. Those dynamics will be driven in part by the aftershocks from the global financial crisis, including what is happening in Europe. Those changes will in part be driven by the rise of our region and the spectacular growth in countries like China, India and Indonesia. Those changes will be driven by the strong Australian dollar and will be fed by a huge pipeline investment - more than $400 billion into resources alone. That is driving jobs and prosperity not just in the mining sector but also in businesses in other sectors that serve the mining industry - in construction, in services and in highly skilled jobs working with mining. So there is this opportunity for our nation. But it will be joined by other opportunities as we see a growing middle class in our region that will want to buy the things we have: great food, good wine, good tourism, international education, the best of legal services and beyond. We can seize those opportunities, but these are days of change and days of pressure. That pressure is falling on the shoulders of workers in areas like manufacturing and we are determined, as we bend change to shape the future for working people, that we will not leave those workers behind.                              On the other side of politics, they want to put car industry workers on the scrap heap. On the other side of politics, they want to deny what is happening in the global economy. On the other side of politics, they want to pretend nothing is happening in our economy except a price on carbon coming on stream on 1 July. This lets the nation down. We are ready for the sophisticated economic debate this nation needs. Unfortunately, there is no one in this chamber across there to have it with.               </DOC>

  I would like to thank the member for his question in regard to what I said yesterday. He is referring to an interview where we were discussing the future of the Alcoa plant. Let us put the whole context in place.                                                                     Mr SHORTEN:                    It is all right for the opposition to selectively catcall, but if you want to bring on some of the discussion you have to have all of the discussion.                                                                    Mr SHORTEN:                    Alcoa announced last week that they intend to review their Point Henry operations. This is a serious development and a serious announcement.                                                                    Mr SHORTEN:                    I was asked by the Leader of the National Party about comments yesterday in the context of the future of Alcoa.                                                                    Mr SHORTEN:                    If you are too lazy to watch a whole interview, that is not my fault. The issue about carbon -                                                                     Mr SHORTEN:                    Alcoa made an announcement last week reviewing their Point Henry operations. This is a serious issue. I had the privilege of representing Alcoa smelter workers for 14 years before coming into this place. For 14 years I have had the opportunity to see the good work that is done at Alcoa Point Henry. Alcoa Point Henry have made a decision to review their operations -                                                                     Mr SHORTEN:                    They are raising this issue for a couple of reasons. First of all, the Point Henry smelter has been a terribly efficient smelter in terms of industrial relations - I bet you hate that.                                                                    Mr SHORTEN:                    The context of the interview, which I am being asked about, was about the future of Point Henry -                                                                     Mr SHORTEN:                    You are guilty of premature interjection over there. The whole interview was about the future of Point Henry and the use of carbon, and I certainly stand by the sentiments which I expressed in that interview. Carbon, and the price on carbon, which is a necessary reform for our economy, has nothing to do with the review on Point Henry.                                                                    Mr SHORTEN:                    Those Point Henry smelter workers did not come down in the last shower. They know they are getting a review because of the high dollar and the low price of aluminium on the London Metal Exchange. They know that Alcoa New York is reviewing their operations at Point Henry. They know they have a severe challenge in front of them and they also know that you lot do not care about their jobs. You know it is unrelated to carbon and all you are trying to do is make political hay.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Robertson for her question because there is no doubt there are very large challenges in the global economy. We have seen that demonstrated in the last 48 hours. Just as we should not hold out false optimism, we should not get carried away with false pessimism. Despite all of the global challenges, our economy does walk tall in the world. We have got solid growth. We have got low unemployment. We have got a very big investment pipeline. We have got strong public finances. What the government has for the future is a very big productivity agenda with investment in skills, investment in infrastructure through the NBN and fundamental tax reform. All of these are very important given our global circumstances.                              This government got the big economic calls right during the global recession. We did not experience a recession in this country because we got the big calls right. The consequence of that has been the creation of something like 700,000 jobs. Overnight we have just seen that Moody's has put the United Kingdom on negative watch. That means Australia is now among an elite group of eight countries with the stable, gold plated AAA rating from all three major agencies globally - the first time in our history and not something that was achieved under the previous government. We obviously do have job losses in parts of our economy, even in parts of our economy where the companies are extremely profitable, but we should not lose sight of the fact that unemployment in this country is 5.2 per cent, half the rate in Europe and substantially lower than just about every other developed economy.                              All of this global uncertainty just underscores why it is so important to bring our budget back to surplus in 2012-13. The global volatility makes that an imperative. Those opposite have been fumbling and bumbling around over the past week and running away from their commitment to a surplus, which is so important to Australia at this time of global volatility. We know they are running away from that because they have got a $70 billion crater in their budget bottom line. I do not think anyone on this side of the House would be too surprised by that because those on the other side of the House have got form. They were found by the Treasury to have covered up an $11 billion hole in their election costings. We have got further proof of that because the auditors in whom those opposite had great faith have been found guilty of professional misconduct. So they took a lie to the people of Australia -                </DOC>

  Yes, I do. I made that statement in order to give a sense of the context for the aluminium industry because of the complete misrepresentations we have seen coming from the other side. First and foremost the misrepresentations we have seen during the course of this week have been from those on the other side coming in here and trying to pretend that modelling that shows the long-term economic effects in our economy as well as -                                                                     Ms GILLARD:                    I was explaining why I made that statement. It was to give lie to the misrepresentations we are seeing from the opposition about impacts on the aluminium industry. What they are refusing to acknowledge is all of the economic forces that are on aluminium and on manufacturing. No amount of coming into this place and fearmongering changes those facts. Look at the statements put out at management level from Alcoa where they say the strong Australian dollar is causing difficulties for them, where they point to factors like low global prices. Talk to the workers, who have a very sophisticated understanding of what is happening in their business. When you have done those things - actually absorbed the information and talked to the workers - you realise how insulting this campaign is to the working people in the aluminium industry and how insulting this campaign is to workers in manufacturing generally.                              They understand that our economy is in a position of structural change and that it is structural change driven by strength and coming off a basis of strength. Let us remember that. When our nation has faced structural change in the past, often it has been off a basis of weakness when we have had economic downturns that have caused high unemployment and other weaknesses in the economy. We come to this period of structural change in a position of strength, but that does not mean there are not industries that are feeling that structural change in a painful way. Aluminium is one of them and we are determined to keep working with the industry and Alcoa during this period.                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. In conclusion I would say to the member who asked the question: the one thing he knows to be true is that the changes being wrought by our carbon pricing system will come at the least change to the economy, and the changes that he is seeking through their inefficient system will come at a higher cost per tonne of carbon - and, certainly, that will have greater economic impacts and effects. He should be honest about that, as should the Leader of the Opposition.              </DOC>

   I thank the member for his question. I think the member last asked me about this matter in August or September of last year and there have been some developments since then, in December and January, and also the development overnight that the member refers to namely, the presentation to the congress of the President's budget, which includes the United States Department of Defense proposed budget for 2013.                              The member refers to our national security interests, and it is absolutely essential that Australia continues to maintain its air combat capability, and that is the absolute focus that I have had in this area. Currently, of course, we have 71 Classic Hornets, we have 24 Super Hornets - 12 of which are wired up to potentially receive the electronic warfare capability, the 'Growler' - and we have the proposal to receive Joint Strike Fighters.                              Since July of last year, Mr Speaker, I have been saying the absolutely essential decision for this year is a judgment about whether we are at risk of a capability gap. What potentially causes that capability gap is a delay in the production of the Joint Strike Fighter and the ageing of our Classic Hornets, which have served us very well, and continue to service us well, but are currently the subject of a deep maintenance program. So that is the risk to our capability - that the Joint Strike Fighter is delivered later than was originally expected or anticipated. I have indicated that we will do an exhaustive review of that this year and make a judgment about any gap in capability this year.                              I have said that the Super Hornet is an obvious option so far as any filling of a gap in capability is concerned. We have made no decision about that, but the fact that we have 24 Super Hornets and the fact that 12 are wired for 'Growler' is a relevant, material consideration.                              What we saw in the course of December and of January this year was variously Secretary Panetta, Deputy Secretary Carter, Under Secretary Kendall, the Director of the Joint Strike Fighter Program, Admiral Venlet, and the Chief of the US Air Force, Norton Schwartz, indicate that we have to look to potential delay, that there was, as Admiral Venlet had said, a miscalculation about concurrency - which is, namely, seeking to produce while development issues are still in hand, and what we have seen overnight is confirmation of that - 179 fewer planes to be purchased by the United States, or produced by the program, over the 2013-2017 period. I have said we are committed to receiving two for test and trial purposes in the United States in 2014. That is still on-track. We have publicly said we will take another 12. The schedule for that is now under consideration, just as the United States's schedule is under consideration. What we will not allow is a gap in our capability, and the decision about gap in capability will be made in the course of this year. We will not leave it to the last minute, and Super Hornets fall directly into consideration in that respect.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Lyons for his question. He, like all Tasmanian members in this House, has been working to ensure that the Tasmanian economy does diversify and does it in a sustainable way. The truth is that the Tasmanian economy, like all of Australia, is an economy in transition, but the Tasmanian economy has a hugely strong future, and members on this side of the House know it.                              Think of the comparative advantages that Tasmania has: clean air, clean energy, clean water, sustainable industries. Given that they, like so many other parts of the economy, are being impacted by a high dollar that takes competitiveness away, we need to find ways in which to make those industries and those comparative advantages more competitive.                              We are in the circumstance of the greatest economic transformation the world has known. It is not just coming from China; it is coming from Asia; it is coming from India. Those on the other side want to stick their heads in the sand and do not think they need to play a role in it. We do.                              The Prime Minister and the Premier of Tasmania signed a partnership agreement. I have been to Tasmania more than half-a-dozen times since that framework was put in place to talk about the detail. Forestry is an important part of this equation. We have the opportunity for the first time, through that agreement, to move to a forest products industry based on a sustainable resource. If we are able to move to a sustainable resource, why wouldn't we want to value-add to it? And that is what we want to do.                              The trouble is that we have people down there seeking to run the industry down, while those who are in the Liberal Party in Tasmania sit silent. I say that when you enter an agreement you have to honour it. The agreement that was entered was to ensure that there would be wood supply - and that is what we say the Greens and all of the NGOs need to do. I say, and we know, that if this agreement falls over there will be no increase in reserves, no social licence and no ballast to underpin the industry. But listen -                                                                                       Mr CREAN:                    If the circumstances are that the Greens want to oppose this, there is the opportunity for the Liberal Party to get behind this forward-looking agenda, not stick their head in the sand, as Tony Abbott does, and say, 'In the opposition we can't fix things, so don't even get bogged down with them.' That is the opposition approach here. It should not be the opposition's approach in Tasmania.               </DOC>

  This is the third or fourth day that the opposition has come in and misrepresented what I said in my speech about the economy because they cannot debate the economy. Their days are filled with falsehoods, and we are seeing more of that from the member today in his question.                              I say to the member, regarding the impact of carbon pricing on small business, that it is no surprise to me that small businesses are concerned given the nature of the fear campaign that the opposition has run with no facts. We know that opposition members have been out there trying to scare small business, but the one thing that they never say to small businesses when they walk through their doors is that they are committed to taking away $1 billion in tax breaks from small business. They are committed to taking away from 2.7 million small businesses the benefits that come with tax breaks financed by the minerals resource rent tax.                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    Thank you very much. I was asked about anxiety in small businesses and I am answering what they should be anxious about. Let us be very clear about this: every member of the opposition, if they were being honest, should walk into the milk bar down the road from their electorate office, the local fish and chip shop and the shops of the small retailers in their high street shopping centres and say to them: 'What we believe is that money should come off you, and it should go to some of the most profitable mining companies on earth. What we believe is that the Australians who are more important than you and your families are Gina Rinehart and Clive Palmer. That is what we believe. That is what we voted for in the parliament and that is what we will do if we are ever elected.'                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. Let me be clear: the difference between me and the member for Sturt is that I could walk into any small business in this country and say Labor are providing them with a tax break, while he would have to walk into a small business and say the coalition is ripping it back off them. In terms of small business anxiety, I say to the opposition the following -                                                                     Ms GILLARD:                    I say to them: stop your fear campaign; stop your idiot interjections; get out there and tell people the truth - that is, you stand for profitable big mining rather than small business.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Banks for his important question and his ongoing contribution to policy in the areas of employment and education. Indeed, this is a very pertinent question because it is really about what matters in this country. Education matters and employment matters. I am very happy to say that when the Prime Minister asked me to assist the Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth, Peter Garrett, in a very important area of public policy I was very happy to engage with educators around this country because of the importance of the reforms we have put in place.                              The government's investment in school infrastructure is the largest in our history. This government has doubled Commonwealth expenditure on school education in only four years. We have transformed many schools, creating 21st century infrastructure, including 3,100 interactive libraries, 4,500 classrooms and much more. It is an investment to enable our future workers and our future leaders to prepare for the challenges ahead for this nation. It is a recognition that we must ensure the best possible education in a very competitive region and, indeed, a very competitive world.                              Beyond the educational benefits, the assistance to our economy, insofar as the BER and other initiatives go, cannot be overstated. It should not surprise anyone in this place, or indeed anyone in this country, that it took a Labor government responding to the global financial crisis to invest in education and create employment. This education initiative has supported around 120,000 jobs. Tradies like carpenters, plumbers, electricians, bricklayers, plasterers, labourers - you name it - and other workers would be unemployed if it were not for the initiatives of this government. As a result of this action Australia's economy and employment figures are the envy of the world. You have only to look around: 8.4 per cent unemployment in the United States; 8.3 per cent unemployment in the United Kingdom; and elsewhere 10.4 per cent - double the 5.2 per cent figure in this country. That is a direct result of the effort of this government to put in place the stimulus package during the global financial crisis. In regard to the opposition we know that the Leader of the Opposition literally slept through the legislation to support thousands of Australian workers.                                                                    Mr BRENDAN O'CONNOR:                    In the end he does not support jobs in this country and does not support employment.              </DOC>

  To the shadow Treasurer I say yet again: here we have the opposition using the loss of workers' jobs as a political play thing. The only job in this country they are interested in is the office of Prime Minister. That is all the Leader of the Opposition cares about. All that they care about on the front bench of the opposition is getting themselves a pay rise by moving over onto the government benches. They exhibit no concern for the jobs of working Australians. For them, working Australians are a convenient prop for a media interview; they are nothing else. Contempt for working Australians is bred deep into their bones, and it came out when they engaged in Work Choices.                              I say to the shadow Treasurer - and it is what he of all people should understand - that we are seeing changes in our economy and we are seeing changes in our banks. Let me make it very clear how I feel about the changes that have been announced by the ANZ. I think the combination of putting up your interest rates, then announcing job losses and then seeking to blame both of those decisions on someone else is reprehensible. That is what I feel about it, and I am very happy to state that very clearly in here. So, in relation to these job losses, of course I am very worried about those Australians and the pressures on them.                              I also say to the shadow Treasurer, 'Let's recognise the opportunities that come with change in our region.' Our region is growing in economic power. Its middle class is growing - and we see literally hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of millions of people in our region joining the middle classes - and as the middle classes grow they will demand services just as we demand services. Amongst the services they will demand will be cutting-edge financial services, and Australia can play a major role in providing them. That is an opportunity. That is why I am optimistic about the future of financial services. It requires us to understand our economy, our region, and to stop talking the simplistic protest nonsense that the opposition walks in here with every day.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Chisholm for her question. Labor governments represent working families. We manage the economy to look after working families and in particular to create jobs and stimulate economic growth. As a result of the sound economic management of this government, Australia stands out amongst the industrialised world. We have low unemployment, solid growth, moderate inflation, very significant levels of business investment and low public debt.                              As the Leader of the Opposition said late last year in London, when perhaps he did not think anyone here was listening:                              On the face of this comparative performance, Australia has serious bragging rights. Compared to most developed countries, our economic circumstances are enviable.                              One of the rare moments of truth from the Leader of the Opposition.                              While our economic performance is enviable, Labor of course also understands the challenges that our economy faces. That is why we are introducing important reforms that will boost productivity, lift workforce skills and improve the competitiveness of the economy. How are we doing it? Labor wants to help companies invest, and one of the important ways of doing that is to cut the company tax rate to 29 per cent. What is the position of those on the other side? They are opposed to it. In fact, they want to increase company tax.                              Also, Labor is helping small businesses by increasing the instant asset write-off to $6,500, and $5,000 for the purchase of a motor vehicle. What is the position of the coalition? They are opposed to all of it. They are opposed to assistance for small business.                              For small business people who are unincorporated, many will benefit from the trebling of the tax-free threshold, which is part of the Clean Energy Future package. It will treble to $18,000, a move the coalition has opposed - another measure for small business that the coalition opposes.                              We are boosting research and development in our economy through an improvement to the R&amp;D tax incentive. They tore down the R&amp;D tax concession when they were in government, reduced its effectiveness. We are improving skills by investing in things like trades training centres in secondary schools, another measure that the coalition opposed. We are doing the NBN, one of the greatest productivity-boosting initiatives in our economy for many decades. They oppose it. Everything constructive on the economy the opposition opposes. The government is working hard to ensure that working families benefit from -                </DOC>

  As I have said in this parliament before, Fair Work Australia is independent. It may be the political culture of members of the Liberal Party to go and try and stand over independent bodies, to go and try and stand over the police, as we saw Senator Abetz flirting with last year, but that is not the culture of our political party, because we understand that, when you set up an independent umpire, you have got to let it do its job. So, to the Manager of Opposition Business, who asked the question, I say, as I have said before in this place and beyond it, the opposition continuously invites me to do something grossly improper in relation to Fair Work Australia, and that is to bully the industrial umpire on how and in what time frame it will conduct an investigation. Well, I will not do the grossly improper thing that the opposition so clearly believes in.              </DOC>

  I am receiving unwarranted encouragement from my colleagues, but I do thank the member for her question.                                                                    Dr EMERSON:                    The Gillard government is continuing to do what Labor governments do in that great reforming tradition, and that is fashion and shape the open, competitive economy. There is a very clear reason why we are committed to the open, competitive economy: it is good for jobs; it is good for working Australians. That is why we are investing in a high-skill, high-wage future for our country. Indeed, some of the figures are coming in to confirm the benefits that are flowing from those economic policies. In calendar year 2011, exports reached $313 billion. That is a record in calendar year terms. I refer to the Statement on monetary policy, which comments on our trade surplus and indicates:                              Australia's trade surplus reached a 40-year high as a ratio to GDP in the September quarter _                              That is a very important achievement in this quest for an open, competitive economy. I commend the Treasurer, I commend the former trade minister but I commend mostly the businesses of Australia who have responded to those challenges. The Statement on monetary policy also says:                              _ it is likely that over the next year the level of business investment in the economy will reach its highest level, relative to GDP, in at least half a century.                              That is good news for future jobs, for high-skill, high-wage jobs.                               There is further positive commentary from the three ratings agencies. All the gold-plated AAA ratings that have been given to Australia by the three ratings agencies were never given to a government in Australia led by the coalition but have been given to a government led by the Prime Minister, Julia Gillard. These are great achievements. There have been other reviews of Australia's economic performance in the context of the Statement on monetary policy from the Reserve Bank. We have got the International Monetary Fund, the OECD and even this statement:                              This year, Australia's economic growth is expected to be 1 3/4 per cent; our unemployment rate about 5 1/4 per cent; our net government debt, Commonwealth and state, about 8 per cent of GDP; our collective budget deficits just under 4 per cent of GDP and net interest payments just under 2 per cent of government outlays.                              That is an accolade. That is certainly a glowing endorsement of the economic performance of this government - from none other than the Leader of the Opposition. He is the very same leader who, when he is overseas, says that the Australian economy is the envy of the world and, when he comes back here, is into trash-talking the Australian economy. It is Labor that supports jobs in this country.               </DOC>

  In fact, the last time I was asked a serious question on foreign policy by the shadow minister for foreign affairs, I do not think Wyatt Roy was even of drinking age. And maybe he is still not of legal drinking age.                                                                    Mr RUDD:                    The honourable member for Longman was not of legal drinking age and perhaps he is still not of legal drinking age.                                The Deputy Leader of the Opposition asks about events in the Maldives. Can I say this: I spoke to the former President of the Maldives only three nights ago -                                                                     Mr RUDD:                    Those opposite seem to think that this is a trivial matter, when hundreds of people are being beaten in the streets, when we have had -                                                                     Mr RUDD:                    On 7 February, President Nasheed, who attended the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Perth only last October-November, was removed from office. I, on 9 February, telephoned the Secretary-General of the Commonwealth, as Australia is currently Chair of the Commonwealth and I therefore, as a result, am Chair of the Commonwealth Foreign Ministers conference. As a result of that, the Commonwealth foreign ministers who make up the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group conducted a teleconference on Saturday evening about what measures to take against what is alleged to have been a fundamental undermining of Commonwealth values in the removal of this democratically elected head of state.                                                                    Mr RUDD:                    Those opposite trivialise the fact that hundreds of people have been arrested, that hundreds of people have been subjected to violence in the streets of the capital city of Male and, on top of that, that we are likely to have seen the forced removal, under threat of armed violence with guns, of a democratically elected head of state. Those opposite regard these matters as being trivial. As foreign minister of Australia I do not regard them as trivial.                               As a consequence of the meeting conducted on Saturday evening on the telephone with seven participating foreign ministers around the world, a ministerial delegation of three foreign ministers or their representatives will now be dispatched to Male to establish whether in fact this coup has occurred through violent means and, if so, the necessary course of action would be suspension from the Commonwealth. We take these matters seriously.               </DOC>

  Thank you very much, Mr Speaker, and I wish you a happy birthday. Can I thank the member for Throsby both for his question but also for the hard work that he does in his electorate for working families.                               With this government's focus firmly on jobs and on boosting workforce participation, we recognise just how important it is that we have childcare solutions in place for families. We know that accessible, affordable and quality childcare options must be available to enable parents to be able to return to the workforce, and we are proud of the progress that this government has made towards delivering this.                               I am pleased to be able to inform the House that the latest figures show that there has been a massive 36 per cent increase in the number of approved childcare centres in this nation in just the four years that we have been in government - a 36 per cent increase in the number of centres. This of course plays a major role in ensuring that families can find care where and when they need it. But further than this, no government in the history of this nation has done more to assist families when it comes to affordability of care. We have increased the childcare rebate from 30 per cent, as it was under those opposite, to 50 per cent of parents' costs under this government. We have increased the cap on this rebate from $4,354 under the coalition government to $7,500 per child under this government. We know that this is having a significant impact for working families. In fact, since 2004, when those opposite were in office, childcare costs for families earning $75,000 a year have reduced from 13 per cent of their disposable income under the coalition government to 7. 5 per cent of their disposable income in 2011 under us. In fact, over the next four years this government will provide over $21 billion to the early childhood education and care sector, a figure which is almost triple that which it was under the Howard government in its last four years in office. But as important as accessible and affordable child care may be, we know that parents want to have peace of mind when they drop their children off in the morning that they are going to be safe, well supervised and cared for in a quality environment. We are proud to be leading the national reform process in partnership with every state and territory government to ensure that Australian kids get the best start in life. We are helping families, we are helping kids and, importantly, we are also boosting workforce participation. That is a record I am incredibly proud to stand alongside. In contrast, we know that those opposite stand alongside the member for Mayo, who states that childcare payments create a cycle of dependency. I say: you can stand alongside him; we stand side-by-side with Australian families.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Fowler for his question. He will know that the investment into the electorate he faithfully represents is in excess of $100 million. He will know that schools in Fowler are benefiting from the investments we have made in trade training centres in schools. The Bonnyrigg trade training centre received approximately $1.5 million from the Gillard government to enable young Australians undertaking certificate III and certificate II qualifications in hospitality to look at areas around the commercial kitchen experience that those kids need before they go off into that area in the future.                              The fact is that this government has provided substantial investment in school education at a level unparalleled in this country's history. We heard my colleague the Minister for Human Services refer to that earlier on, and he was absolutely spot on. We are investing significantly in helping schools to teach kids well so that they have the skills they need for jobs of the future. It is not only through delivering bricks and mortar - the new classrooms, the new laboratories, the covered outdoor learning areas - it is also through the national partnerships, where we are focusing on improving teacher quality because we know that the teacher is the single most important person inside the school gate when the kids come to school. We also know that with that investment those kids will get the best education they can to be the best students they can as they go through their school career. This is a significant investment - some $65 billion - on the part of this government, with national partnerships worth over $2 billion as well.                              Of course, there is also the national curriculum. The national curriculum provides a solid foundation for kids, wherever they are learning in Australia, in basic skills in literacy and numeracy. It is the sort of solid foundation they need, to go with their education into the future. We want Aussie kids and young people to measure up to be the best in the world and we want to help families have access to high-quality education and training for their kids. That is why it is so disappointing that the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Abbott, thinks only the right kids should stay at school after year 10. I was very distressed -                                                                                       Mr GARRETT:                    Mr Speaker, the relevance is here: this government has a commitment to providing eligible families with support of over $4,000 to help with the costs of keeping kids at school between the ages of 16 and 19 if they are studying. The Leader of the Opposition says that sounds like some kind of occupational program of the government's. But helping all those kids is what this government is all about.               </DOC>

  To the Leader of the Opposition's question I say that every assertion he has made in that question is wrong, wrong and wrong. First of all, let us go to the announcement by Alcoa that its Wagerup investment is to be delayed. Let us see what Alcoa says and let us get the facts on the table, rather than the Leader of the Opposition's consistent misrepresentations. Let us be very clear about this. Back in 2008, Alcoa delayed this investment due to the impact of the global financial crisis. Alcoa has said that, since a peak in 2011, aluminium prices have fallen by over 27 per cent worldwide. This morning an Alcoa spokesperson said that the Wagerup expansion would not be back on the agenda until the company secured a long-term competitive gas supply. The statement on the Alcoa website - the words of Alcoa, not the Leader of the Opposition's misrepresentation - says:                              Alcoa's Wagerup Refinery (Wagerup Unit 3) expansion plans are currently on hold because of the challenging economic environment and the need to secure energy supplies.                              So the misrepresentation engaged in by the Leader of the Opposition is once again calculated to spread false information to the Australian people. Not only is he content to come into this place and use workers as a football to kick around the chamber in pursuit of the opposition's political interests but now today he is making a misrepresentation to the whole nation about this investment.                              On the rest of the Leader of the Opposition's assertions, the question of the modelling I have answered before and no amount of re-asking it will change the Leader of the Opposition's misrepresentations as to the truth. Then there is Alcoa and Point Henry. I have dealt with this before in parliament. Once again, repeating a misrepresentation does not make it true. Alcoa has said very clearly that their current review:                              _ has not been prompted by a future price on carbon. The present situation is the result of low metal prices, a high Australian dollar, and import costs.                              During the course of this week and every day the Leader of the Opposition has come into this place and misrepresented the situation of Alcoa. I say to the Leader of the Opposition that that is a shame. It is a shame he is treating workers with that calculated disrespect and today he is spreading that calculated disrespect to the rest of Australia.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for La Trobe for her question. Earlier today the House of Representatives passed the government's changes to the private health insurance rebate and there is every reason to believe that these changes will pass through the Senate. These changes were first brought to the parliament in 2009. We sought to secure these changes then and took this plan to the 2010 election and said, as the government, that we wanted to work to change the private health insurance rebate in the interest of fairness and in the interest of sustainability. Today the House of Representatives has given a tick to fairness and a tick to sustainability. It is clearly unfair to ask low-income Australians who cannot afford private health insurance themselves to subsidise the private health insurance of people who are many times better off than they are - clearly unfair.                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    It is the proposition of the opposition that Australians who own so little that they cannot afford private health insurance for themselves should be subsidising the private health insurance of millionaires or billionaires. There is no surprise in that because the opposition have never seen a tax dollar they did not want to give to a billionaire if they possibly could.                              This is also about sustainability. We all know that health costs are growing. We are investing more and more in health and that is appropriate because Australians want to see more doctors, more nurses and more investment in public hospitals. They want to see better cancer treatment. They understand that with innovation and with the ageing -                                                                     Ms GILLARD:                    Thank you very much. I am talking about sustainability in the private health insurance rebate. They understand that with those health demands we have to wisely invest every health dollar, which is why engaging in this means-testing of the private health insurance rebate is appropriate and without these changes it is estimated that it will cost $100 billion over the next 40 years.                              I note today that the Leader of the Opposition has committed himself to reversing these changes, adding to his $70 billion black hole - $70 billion now and counting. Well it is not right by sustainability and it is not right by fairness. The one thing we know is that the Leader of the Opposition cannot possibly make that budget add up.              </DOC>

  I remind the member who asked the question that this parliament was dealing with these matters before the 2010 election campaign. There would not have been anyone aware of that parliamentary debate, which of course got a lot of publicity, who would not have known that it was the intention of the government to have a means test on private health insurance. The Leader of the Opposition is saying, 'Well, it did not get through the parliament.' That is true: it did not get through the Senate as it was then configured. This government brought its policy intention to the House of Representatives and to the Senate and made it very, very clear that that was the policy of the government. I would say to the member opposite that during the election campaign -                                                                     Ms GILLARD:                    To the Leader of the Opposition's point of order: during the election campaign this government did something that the opposition did not. We filed our costings.                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    The opposition did not do that because they had at that stage an $11 billion black hole. They knew their figures could not add up, so they took their figures to an accountancy firm and they tried to say that that made it all add up. That accountancy firm has now been implicated in professional breaches. The one thing that they did not do is submit their costings to the Treasury, because they knew that they were engaged in the height of recklessness when it came to spending taxpayers' dollars. As a result -               </DOC>

I thank the member for Petrie for her question. She is a member who is passionately committed to seeing better health services for people in her electorate. She knows every taxpayers' dollar we raise has to be spent in the best and most effective way. I welcome the passing through the House of Representatives of the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill and cognate bills this morning. The passing of this legislation comes as new figures released by the Private Health Insurance Administration Council show that more Australians are covered by private health insurance now than at any other time in the past 36 years.                                                                    Ms PLIBERSEK:                    Since this government came to office, more than a million people -                                                                     Ms PLIBERSEK:                    Thank you, Mr Speaker. More than a million people have joined private health insurance since this government came to office. These new figures for last year show that the industry recorded a record profit of $461 million before tax for the December quarter and that the year's profit from December 2010 to December 2011 was a record $1.27 billion. The industry is strong and the industry is healthy and the industry will stay strong despite the scare campaign of those opposite.                              You would remember that the member for North Sydney said in 2008 that hundreds of thousands of people would drop out of private health insurance, when Labor took a decision that low-income earners should not be penalised for not having private health insurance. He said that hundreds of thousands would drop out. And what happened? 800,000 extra people have joined private health insurance since that time. He was wrong then and he is wrong now. This is a win for low- and middle-income earners.                                                                    Ms PLIBERSEK:                    It means that the bank teller on $50,000 a year will no longer subsidise the private health insurance -                                                                   The member for Dawson then left the chamber.                                                                                    Ms PLIBERSEK:                    It means that the bank teller on $50,000 a year will no longer subsidise the private health insurance of the bank executive on $500,000 and the bank's CEO on $5 million -                                                                   The member for Bowman then left the chamber.                                                                                    Ms PLIBERSEK:                    This government is investing record amounts into our health system. That record investment needs to be targeted in a way that makes the biggest difference. The private health insurance rebate would have sucked up $100 billion over the next 40 years. The Leader of the Opposition says that he is going to restore that, when he can, as an article of faith of the opposition. Is it really an article of faith to spend the hard-earned tax dollars of ordinary Australians subsidising his private health insurance and mine, or is it an aspiration?               </DOC>

  In answer to the Leader of the National Party, let us just go through the facts, because whenever you go through the facts the opposition's scare campaign falls apart. Fact No. 1: Qantas will not face any carbon price on their international operations in Australia. They will face a carbon price on their domestic operations, that is true. The carbon price will have a very moderate impact on ticket prices. Both Qantas and Virgin put it at around $3 to $3.50 per seat per sector. That is what Qantas and Virgin actually have said. Of course, those price effects have been modelled into the anticipated increase of 0.7 per cent in CPI and, of course, Australians are receiving assistance: tax cuts, family payment increases and pension increases. There are tax cuts for people earning less than $80,000, with many of them to receive a tax cut of around $300. There will be family payment increases for many families caring for children. There will be pension increases that will more than compensate people for the anticipated price effect. This means that there will be households around Australia that come out better off.                              The fear for those households is twofold: the Leader of the Opposition's plan to rip out of their hands the tax cuts, family payments and pension increases -                                                                     Ms GILLARD:                    Yes, Mr Speaker, I will deal with that. But, number one, I do think it is important to talk about the rip-off that will happen for working families. Then, on price effects for things like Qantas, let us not forget that the opposition is committed to a costly, shambolic plan that will cost Australians far more. So, to the Leader of the National Party's question, once again what the opposition is trying to do is mislead the Australian people.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Lyne for his question and for his commitment to his constituents, and other constituents, who use the Pacific Highway. We already have committed some $4.1 billion to the Pacific Highway. More than 1,600 workers are today working on site building the Pacific Highway. This is vital for productivity. It has been identified by Infrastructure Australia as a priority, but it is also vital for safety. Over the last 20 years some 809 people have lost their lives on the Pacific Highway, which is 809 too many. That is why we on this side of the House are absolutely committed to fulfilling the duplication by 2016, which was first promised by the Howard government in 2004. They promised it but did not put any dollars into it. They contributed $1.3 billion over 12 years and during that time the state government committed $2.5 billion.                              At that time - when they were in government - they said the Pacific Highway was a state road. They called upon the New South Wales Labor government to do more. The member for Cowper, for example, said in this place: 'It is a state road. New South Wales refused to commit one extra dollar of state government funding to a road they are responsible for.' The state member for Coffs Harbour, Andrew Fraser, who has had a bit to say - inaccurately - in recent months about funding on the Pacific Highway, said this when he was part of the opposition:                              The Pacific Highway is a state road. I pay credit to the federal government for increasing the funding arrangement. I damn and condemn this state government. The state government should pour the money in.                                                                    Mr ALBANESE:                    But now, when in government, only yesterday Mr Fraser was saying in the New South Wales parliament that they cannot afford to pay their share. We on this side of the House say: let's end the politics with this issue. Let's have 50-50 funding to deliver on the Pacific Highway. Let's see the member for Cowper and the Leader of the National Party talk to their National Party colleagues in New South Wales and get them to deliver on what they say is their joint commitment to fully duplicate the highway by 2016. That is what is required. We need to do more. We accept that that is the case. But it can only be done in partnership with the New South Wales government. That is the way forward and it is the way to ensure that the full duplication can be completed.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Cunningham for that question because sound fiscal management is more important than ever, particularly given the global uncertainty that we are seeing. We on this side of the House have got the big economic decisions right, because in the face of global uncertainty and a global recession we supported jobs, we supported small business and we avoided a recession in this country. While we have had some recent job losses, we should never lose sight of the fact that over 700,000 jobs have been created in this country over the past four years. But we are certainly not immune because we have seen something like $140 billion worth of revenue stripped from the budget. Those opposite pretend that somehow the global financial crisis and global recession were a hiccup. Well, it stripped $140 billion from our budget bottom line - a massive hit to the budget.                              The level of tax to GDP in the last year of the Howard government was 23.7 per cent of GDP - 2½ percentage points higher than it is now. If we still had the same level of GDP as those opposite had in their last year of office our revenues at the moment would be $20 billion higher in 2012-13 alone. So it has been a massive hit to our budget. That is why we are out there, coming back to surplus and conducting one of the most significant fiscal consolidations - that is, return to surplus - seen in our history, because we understand with global uncertainty you have to be serious about your fiscal policy and send a message to international markets. That is not attainable by those opposite. We have seen the Three Stooges type farce of the last week from those opposite -                                                                     Mr SWAN:                    I withdraw, Mr Speaker. They have been running around promising spending but they have been saying no to structural savings. They support spending on the one hand, but when we put up sensible proposals - ones which can build the strength of our financial system and direct more dollars to the health system - they say no. They have claimed in this House today that we did not put it before the Australian people. It was there for everyone to see in the pre-election fiscal outlook, which they did spend a lot of time studying until the Treasury discovered there was an $11 billion black hole in their estimates. Those opposite do not care about coming back to surplus because they are not up to running a $1.4 trillion economy. A $70 billion hole - but the only thing that Larry over there was concerned about was that Curly was going to leak the $70 billion figure.                                                                    Mr SWAN:                    I withdraw, Mr Speaker.              </DOC>

  I understand that in Senate estimates today some additional information has been provided by Fair Work Australia. I also understand that a statement has been provided by Fair Work Australia, which I think is very important. It comes from the General Manager, who directly deals with the opposition's oft repeated claims about political interference. It says very clearly that she sees absolutely no reason to conclude that there has been any such interference in the investigations.                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    I am determined to be directly relevant, Mr Speaker. I have been asked about contacts between the government and Fair Work Australia. I have been asked about those contacts before as part of the opposition's campaign to suggest that there has been political interference in the Fair Work Australia investigation. Consequently, I think it is directly relevant to point out that this opposition campaign came to a crashing halt today, when the General Manager of Fair Work Australia directly repudiated any suggestions of political interference in the Fair Work Australia investigation. From today it is clear, and should be clear to the opposition and all, that Fair Work Australia is doing what it is supposed to do - inquiring independently - and that there is no need in the world for continued imputations and muckraking by the opposition.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Bass for his question. I am very proud of the work this government has achieved. I am particularly proud to have the honour of being the Leader of the House of Representatives. It is a challenge from time to time. We started off with what used to be 71 votes but is now, Mr Speaker, 72 votes in order to get legislation through the parliament.                              This morning we saw yet another seminal reform - the private health insurance reform to make the system fairer - blocked by those opposite since 2009. It has been in our budget papers since 2009; we have had two attempts to get it through the parliament previously. This morning we got it through the parliament, in spite of the absurd amendment put forward by the Leader of the Opposition, which was resoundingly defeated. The biggest vote this morning was against his amendment that it be put off until the next parliament. It is not surprising: 266 bills have passed this parliament compared with 108 in the first year of the Howard government where they had a clear majority. This parliament is functioning well; this parliament is able to engage with the crossbenches to ensure outcomes have occurred in the national interest.                              These reforms join the carbon price, the minerals resource rent tax, the structural separation of Telstra and the National Broadband Network. This legislation joins our budget, which went through faster than ever last year. These reforms together will transform the economy for the benefit of average Australians. In particular, I have presented more than a dozen bills relating to the National Broadband Network, which will transform the way that our economy is able to compete with our neighbours in the region. The NBN, which we expect will create some 18,000 jobs in construction alone, will transform the great tyranny of distance that has disadvantaged those people living regionally. Those opposite play a hypocritical double game. Member after member writes to Senator Conroy, or sometimes it is forwarded on to me as the minister representing him in this place, asking for the NBN in their electorate. Yet last week they were in here arguing against community service obligations for regional Australia. Those opposite just say no to everything that comes before this House. This government is determined to continue to push on with our positive agenda.              </DOC>

  To the member who asked the question, I say: I did not say that. The reason the member is probably confused is that day after day the opposition has been pursuing two completely logically inconsistent lines of attack in relation to this Fair Work matter. That is not surprising because when you are the kind of people who always say no and are negative about anything, why would you worry about consistency?                              Some days they come into this parliament, and they are in the media too, asserting: 'The government has made contact with Fair Work Australia. This is a conspiracy. We need to know all about this. This is about improper influence.' Some days they say that, but that line of attack came to a shuddering halt today, repudiated in Senate estimates. The General Manager of Fair Work Australia, having properly looked at the matter, stated clearly on the record that there has been no interference. So whenever the opposition says that in the future, people will know that they are trying deliberately to mislead.                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I will do that. The reason the general manager of Fair Work Australia is in a position to say there has been no interference is that contacts between the government and Fair Work Australia have been about fact finding, as is now on the public record for all to see in Senate estimates. The opposition, in its completely logically inconsistent other line of attack, has invited me to ring up Fair Work Australia and direct them to do something. That is wrong. Every day the opposition says that it should be done they are out there saying something that would be wrong in our democracy - the wrong thing to do, the result of shoddy thinking by and the shoddy standards of people who are obviously used to standing over others and bullying them to get their way. This government is behaving entirely properly in relation to this matter. I refer the parliament to the statement of the general manager of Fair Work Australia today, and I say to the member opposite: what pathetic muckraking this is.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Hindmarsh for what is a very important question. This government has worked every single day for a very strong and stable banking sector in this country. It is why we took decisive action at the height of the global financial crisis. We did it for the country. We did it to secure the supply of credit. It is why we have introduced covered bonds into this House - to assist the banks with their long-term funding profile.                              My belief as Treasurer, and the belief of the government, is that the banking system should work for all Australians - for every customer, for every worker, for the shareholders, for the broader community and for the whole economy. We have heard the half-yearly profit of the Commonwealth Bank today: $3.7 billion. They have made that profit despite global volatility in financial markets. It shows that they are hugely profitable. That is why we on this side of the House are so committed to competition reforms, so that people who are unhappy with their bank can walk down the road and get a better deal. That is why we have put in place a range of comprehensive measures. One of those measures was to abolish mortgage exit fees.                                                                    Mr SWAN:                    That was ruled out by the shadow Treasurer. It was ruled out even quicker than Moe over here could say no. Their instant response to important competition reforms was to oppose them - and oppose them they did, in this House.                                                                    Mr SWAN:                    The Leader of the Opposition ruled it out very quickly, as did the shadow Treasurer. But we put in place a whole range of competition reforms, and they are delivering results. By the end of this year there will be one million households with mortgages that do not have mortgage exit fees - something that was opposed by those on the other side of the House, by their frontbench team. There are over 180,000 homeowners who have refinanced, more than $46 billion worth of home loans through 2011. That is something like 20 per cent. We have already seen the ME Bank, Credit Union of Australia and the Bank of Queensland out there offering competitive rates.                              We on this side of the House are absolutely determined to see greater competition in the banking system so that people who are unhappy with their financial institution can walk down the road and get a better deal. And when it comes to interest rates, those opposite and everyone else in this House should well remember that when they promised to keep interest rates at record lows they went up 10 times in a row. The cash rate is at 4.25. When they left office it was 6.75. Today, if you have a $300,000 mortgage it costs you $3,000 a year less than it did under the Liberals.              </DOC>

  I would like to thank the member for McEwen for his question. The fundamentals of our economy are very strong. It is important to maintain confidence in the face of the pressures from global forces. That is why it is very important that the increase in business confidence, reported in the latest NAB business survey, is very welcome. That confidence is based upon the fact that we have low unemployment, solid economic growth, a moderate inflationary environment and low public debt. Importantly, that confidence is reflected in massive business investment that will be coming into our economy this year and in years to come.                              According to ABS data, almost $150 billion of private investment this year is expected, with over $450 billion in the pipeline from the resources sector alone in coming years. All of this is very good news for jobs. One aspect of our economy that is perhaps less well understood is that performance of the economy in areas other than resources is also supporting jobs. For example, exports of services to China have grown at an annual rate of about 20 per cent over the last decade. In fact, China is Australia's biggest export market for services and it became so in 2009-10. Despite the big increases in coal exports and their prices over recent years, Australia in fact earned more from providing tourism, education and other services to China last year than it did from selling coal. That is something not well understood. It is evidence of the flexibility of the economy and the strength of the policymaking that has set the parameters right.                              But on the other side of politics we see constant talking down of the economy and an undermining of confidence. The opposition looks for any opportunity to undermine confidence and create uncertainty. We saw it here again in question time and we saw it earlier this morning, with the opposition claiming Alcoa's decision to delay a $3 billion expansion of their Western Australian alumina refinery was due to the carbon price. That is wrong. This dishonest claim was in tatters within hours. Alcoa have made it very clear that securing a gas supply was the principal driver of the delay in that project.                              Dishonest fear campaigns harm our economy and harm jobs. On this side we are building the foundations for a strong economic future, meeting the challenges and creating the opportunities for people, because that is what Labor does.              </DOC>

  Whilst it was by way of interjection, I think the Leader of the House made a very good point. It is not for me to correct the record of something said by someone else when I was not there. I have dealt with this matter in the House. I have dealt with this matter outside the House and I refer the member asking the question and all members to those statements. I would also say -                                                                   The member for Riverina then left the chamber.                                                                                  The member for Moreton then left the chamber.                                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I think we can tell from the display we have just witnessed what mode the opposition is in today: muckraking mode, ugly mode. The Manager of Opposition Business has just come to the dispatch box and in what I think was supposed to be a supplementary question used the word 'alibi'. I say to the opposition: if you have got an allegation about my conduct, put it; if you do not have an allegation about my conduct, get out of the gutter, because your conduct today is disgusting.                              Leave not granted.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Newcastle for her question. I know that she, like everybody in this place, is committed to closing the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. We want more Indigenous Australians to know the dignity and the benefits of work. That is why we are managing the economy to support jobs and that is why we are working to close the gap on Indigenous employment. Halving the gap on Indigenous employment means an additional 100,000 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in jobs by 2018.                              Despite the challenges, the current trends indicate we are making gains. In the last 2½ years over 100,000 placements were made by Job Services Australia for Indigenous jobseekers into work and training. We have committed over $650 million in four years to the reformed Indigenous Employment Program. In 2½ years this program has achieved 71,000 placements, 33,000 into employment and 38,000 into training. We are seeing businesses stepping up to the plate more than ever with unprecedented demand for Indigenous employees. We are working with employers to translate this into real and sustainable jobs. The government is also working with the corporate sector through the Australian Employment Covenant. Already the covenant has secured over 60,000 commitments from employers and this has seen more than 7,000 Indigenous jobseekers start in these jobs. Through the Indigenous Employment Program the government has also provided significant funding to the covenant and to employers with their own programs. The Indigenous Employment Program is flexible and responsive to the needs of employers, to Indigenous Australians and also their communities.                                                                    Ms COLLINS:                    We are also providing support to Indigenous businesses to support economic development. We are providing $3.7 million in funding for the Australian Indigenous Minority Supplier Council. The council seeks out contracts from the private and government sectors and matches them to Indigenous businesses to supply. Also this government has kicked off the Indigenous Youth Career Pathways Program - $50 million over four years to deliver 6,400 school-based traineeships, to provide flexible one-on-one support for students to help them finish school while completing their traineeship.                              Our job as a government is to make sure we give all Australians the opportunities they need to do well in life. No-one should be left behind because of their gender, their background or even where they live. As the Prime Minister said in her speech earlier today, Indigenous employment has increased sharply in recent decades but we are continuing to work to ensure that we close the gap.              </DOC>

  I think it really does say everything about the mode of the opposition today that there was a chant of 'boring' from the opposition backbench when Minister Collins was speaking about closing the gap and employment prospects for Indigenous Australians.                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    They are the kinds of achievements for our nation that the government is focused on while the opposition trawls through the gutter making things up, pursuing a logically inconsistent line of argument -                                                                   The member for Sturt then left the chamber.                                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    Despite the relentless negativity of the opposition, I and the government are focussed on the job of keeping the economy strong, of building a stronger economy for the future and of looking after working families. No amount of muckraking or trawling or irrelevancies will distract us from that path. The muckraking -                                                                     Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP:                    is that 'directly answering' it directly means addressing the substance of the question. The Prime Minister is refusing to answer by talking about muckraking -                                                                     Ms GILLARD:                    As to what very little substance the member's question had: first, there is a Fair Work Australia investigation in progress. That investigation is proceeding - as verified by the General Manager of Fair Work Australia today - independently and without political interference. End of that campaign by the opposition. Second, the opposition through their legal spokesperson wrote to the Australian Federal Police about matters associated with Australia Day, which they have raised in this parliament today. They wrote to the Australian Federal Police and as recently as last night, in Senate estimates, the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police said that they were responding to that correspondence. What the opposition wanted is actually occurring.                              In those two circumstances, they have what they wanted - the Australian Federal Police and a Fair Work Australia independent investigation, verified today as proceeding without political interference. I ask the opposition: what is all of this about except the cheapest of political point scoring from an opposition that day after day is unable to come into this House and spell out an economic plan. It cannot come into this House and spell out plans for working families and it cannot come into this House and spell out a budget that would have the vaguest hope of ever adding up.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Blair for his question and all the work he does for the families and pensioners in his electorate. It is the case that this Labor government is doing everything we possibly can to make sure that jobs are created. We are managing the economy in the interests of jobs. On this side of the House we know that the most important thing for any child is to see mum or dad, or both, going out to work every day and bringing home a pay packet every week. Those 700,000 extra jobs that have been created by this Labor government have meant so much to those families and to the children in them.                              We also recognise that there are many pensioners who want to work and it is this Labor government that has introduced a new work bonus to support those pensioners on the age pension who want to work. Just today, we have introduced changes that will encourage people who are on the disability support pension to take on work or do more hours. It is this Labor government that has made sure that we do everything we can to help those households make ends meet, whether it is with the cost of child care by increasing the childcare rebate from 30 per cent to 50 per cent to help with out-of-pocket costs. It is this Labor government that has helped with the cost of teenagers. Those on the other side of the House seem to think that the cost of teenagers goes down when they hit 16. Of course, those on the other side are totally out of touch with the real life of working families and it is this government that has made sure that we have provided additional assistance to families of teenagers, increasing family tax benefits by up to $4,200 a year per child, to help those families with the cost of children and to make sure that those children are encouraged to stay on at school. What a contrast we see from those opposite. What is it that we know that this Leader of the Opposition can absolutely be guaranteed to do? We know there is one thing he can be guaranteed to do, and that is to give a tax cut to some of the wealthiest people in Australia. The other thing he can be guaranteed to do is to claw back money from the pockets of pensioners and the pockets of families.                                                                    Ms MACKLIN:                    Thank you very much, Mr Speaker, I certainly will. I will once again go to one of the other big Labor reforms that we have introduced and that is benefiting so many families around Australia, and that is the introduction of our first national Paid Parental Leave scheme. We have 130,000 families that are now benefiting as a result of this Labor government's commitment.               </DOC>

  In answer to the Leader of the Opposition's question, first and foremost, as usual he has misrepresented what I have said to the Australian people because he knows if he tells the truth that he will not be able to sustain this fear campaign. On the Qantas job losses announced today, of course I am distressed to hear of any Australian worker losing their job. Of course I am. For those Qantas workers and their families this will be tough news indeed. As is clear from Qantas's announcement, this is about maintenance arrangements and particularly maintenance on different types of planes. For the Leader of the Opposition to say that these job losses today have been caused by putting a price on carbon is wholly untrue and once again contemptuous of the workers involved.                               When we as a Labor government hear of job losses we certainly share the pain of those involved and our motivation is then: what can we do to assist? What can we do to help? What can we do to get people a new opportunity in the economy? That is what we do as a Labor government. When the Leader of the Opposition hears of job losses, his reaction is to say: 'How can I use this as part of my political campaign? How can I make cheap politics with this?' It is entirely disrespectful to the workers involved.                              I would also say to the Leader of the Opposition that, perhaps because he is not interested in economics, not interested in facts and not interested in jobs, he has missed the employment statistics that came out today. I would say to the Leader of the Opposition that if he looked at those employment statistics what he would see is that the unemployment rate has fallen to 5.1 per cent. The economy has added over 46,000 jobs in January. That means there are more Australians in work today than at any time in our nation's history. On our side of the parliament, we are delighted when we hear that people are getting jobs as these statistics show.                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    Of course, we understand this has wrecked the Leader of the Opposition's media strategy for the day and of course he is bitter about that.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Parramatta for her question. She - like other Labor members in this place and like the members on the crossbenches - understands that the ability of working people to build their lives and support their family is defined by their ability to get a job. There is nothing more important to a family than making sure family members can access the benefits and dignity that come with work. As a Labor government we are determined and remain determined to run the economy in the interests of working Australians. That means you always focus on jobs.                              We focused on jobs during the global financial crisis and saved 200,000 jobs. As a government we are proud that since our election more than 700,000 jobs have been created. Today we see statistics that I believe that Australians will take pride in when they look around the world and see how many nations and how many working people - millions of them - are suffering with unemployment. Let me repeat: today the unemployment rate went down; 46,000 jobs were added to the economy in January. This is at a time when the number of people who were looking for work - the participation rate - went up. This means we saw over 15,000 people who were looking for work find a job. That is a remarkable thing. Just think about it: over 15,000 Australians who were without the benefits of work have found a job.                               This reinforces that our economy is in a very different position to economies around the world. We are determined to return the budget to surplus and we will, because that is the right thing to do by jobs and growth at this time. Our economy is backed up by a AAA credit rating and our nation can take pride in that. Yes, there are industries where people are feeling the pressures of change. Structural change is happening in our economy and it is particularly pressing on industries like manufacturing. However, we should note that today's figures show that the male unemployment rate has dropped below five per cent. That still means that we have to keep managing the economy for working people. That still means that we need to be working with those industries under pressure and we will. That means too that we need to be building tomorrow's economy so that working people can have opportunity in the future as well as the ability of finding a job today. That is our mission as a Labor government and it is what we will continue to do.               </DOC>

  In answer to the member's question I would remind him that there was a time when the Liberal Party was more honest with the Australian people about how to achieve change in our economy and how to deal with carbon pricing. I refer the member to the words of John Howard.                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    I presume that the modern-day Liberal Party will catcall through the words of John Howard, because they have repudiated him on the question of carbon pricing. Former Prime Minister Howard said:                              Significantly reducing emissions will mean higher costs for businesses and households, there is no escaping that and anyone who pretends to do otherwise is not a serious participant in this hugely important public policy debate.                              He has described the modern-day Liberal Party as not being serious participants in this public policy debate. As part of their fear campaign they pretend that you can address carbon pricing without costs.                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    I am directing my comments to the question on carbon pricing and jobs. I was quoting former Prime Minister Howard, because he was alerting the Australian nation to the fact that when you deal with these big public policy questions you have to be very clear about the best way to do it and be very honest about the costs. We have been very clear about the best way to do it, how to do it at the least possible cost to the economy and how that will mean that our economy continues to grow, that jobs continue to grow, that income per person continues to grow. As we go about this process of change we will be working to support those industries that are on a journey of change, including aluminium. In that regard I would point to today's media release of the relevant minister, the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency, announcing the terms and conditions of the way $1 billion will be used to help Australian manufacturing move to a clean energy future.                              In asking the question, the member is assuming that somehow there is some costless way of dealing with climate change. He should be honest about the fact that the coalition has selected the most costly way you can possibly go about it. If he was worried about aluminium, if he was worried about jobs, if he was worried about our economy he would be walking to the dispatch box and recanting the rubbish that is coalition policy today and re-endorsing the words of former Prime Minister Howard. But no-one in the modern Liberal Party will ever do that.                              Leave not granted.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Deakin for that very important question. On that side they do not care about jobs in Australia. They are out there licking their lips over job losses; that is the problem we have in this House.                                                                    Mr SWAN:                    Today's job numbers are a very encouraging start to the year. This is particularly so because of the news from Europe we have received overnight. The European economy contracted in the fourth quarter, and some economies went into recession. We know that some companies here are doing it tough because of events in the global economy and because of the high dollar. But just as we should not hold out false optimism, we should never get carried away with false pessimism - and those on that side of the House are continually talking down our economy.                              We welcome today's labour force figures. They have shown the creation of 46,000 jobs in January, and we have seen the unemployment rate fall to 5.1 per cent. This is the largest monthly increase in over 12 months, and there are now more Australians in work than at any time in our history. Everyone on this side of the House welcomes that. We celebrate the fact that there are more people in work than in any time of our history - another encouraging start to the year and a really stark contrast to the global turbulence in the international economy on one hand and the strong fundamentals and resilience of the Australian economy on the other. We on this side of the House put jobs as our No. 1 priority. If those people on the other side had had their way during the global financial crisis Australia would have gone into recession and tens of thousands of small businesses would have closed. But because we are so concerned with jobs we put in place the most effective response to the global recession of any developed economy in the world, and the outcome of that is 760,000 jobs over the past year.                              Here, the fundamentals are good. Unemployment remains low, we have solid growth, we have contained inflation, we have strong public finances and we have record investment. What that can bring to the Australian community is the security they crave from having a job in an economy that is growing, unlike any other developed economy. So these figures are welcomed. The only part of the country that does not welcome them is the people on the other side of the House.                              There was a disgraceful performance from the Leader of the Opposition this morning. He was out there on the doors, licking his lips at job losses. That is how far they have taken negativity in the economic debate in this country. The Three Stooges saga of their economic team -               </DOC>

  In working on climate change and in designing carbon pricing, of course we very centrally considered the future of the tourism industry. Imagine the future of the tourism industry without the Great Barrier Reef. Those opposite might believe that would be a desirable result for this country, but you ask tourism operators about the importance of those icons to the tourism industry.                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    I am used to the yelling of abuse about jobs in tourism and jobs in the economy generally. That is what the opposition does, but we are always motivated by jobs. We are motivated by jobs -                                                                   The member for Wide Bay then left the chamber.                                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    Only the coalition would think that the ability to scream abuse is an inherent part of leadership. Doesn't that say everything about them? On the question of tourism and jobs, about which they have no concern - their conduct whilst I have been delivering this answer has confirmed that - I say to the member who asked the question: we were centrally concerned about tourism and its future. We were centrally concerned about what we could do to tackle climate change - because of the threat it poses to icons like the Great Barrier Reef. We continue to be engaged with the tourism industry every step of the way.                                                                   The member for Moreton then left the chamber.                                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    Very recently, I personally met with the Transport and Tourism Forum the member referred to, because of my concerns about jobs in the tourism industry. I am therefore in a position to inform the member about what they raised with me as central to the tourism industry. They raised issues about skills. They raised workforce issues - there are job vacancies in some parts of Australia which they find difficult to fill, so questions like working-holiday-maker arrangements are important to them. They raised with me issues about capital - which goes to luxury hotel rooms - and the renewal of our capital stock. They raised -                                                                     Ms GILLARD:                    I am being very relevant to the specifics, Mr Speaker, and to the very general suggestion at the end of the question that somehow I or the government was unconcerned about tourism. I am specifically addressing that and specifically explaining to the House how I met with the tourism industry very recently and about the concerns that were at the top of their agenda at that meeting. As a result of having that meeting, I can say to the member that he is not in this place representing their concerns and that he is not in this place acting as an advocate for tourism. We will continue to directly engage with the tourism industry on the issues of real concern they identify. I presume that the opposition will continue to delight in job losses and the spreading of fear.              </DOC>

  I would like to thank the member for Melbourne for his question, and recognise his ongoing interests in the issues to do with industrial relations.                              As I have said before, I do consider that the actions of Qantas in grounding their whole air fleet and stranding tens of thousands of passengers and thousands of their workforce all over the world as an extreme action. I do agree with some of the member's question, or the implication in it, that this was a very, very extraordinary action. But I also recall last year that, courtesy of the Fair Work Act, the Gillard government moved swiftly to help Qantas and the parties involved in the dispute resume operations. We asked Fair Work Australia to intervene. Within 36 hours of the grounding of the air fleet Fair Work Australia had, in fact, terminated all industrial action.                              I can also update the member for Melbourne that, utilising the current Fair Work Act, Qantas and the Australian Licensed Aircraft Engineers Association have now reached an agreement - they have reached a workplace determination. I also know that the pilots and the Transport Workers Union are both working through their issues with Qantas. These processes are under the Fair Work Act, and they are working.                              On this side of the House we understand that people go to work and seek a mutuality of cooperation. They would seek that the enterprise is profitable and they would seek that they receive fair wages and safe work. We understand this. We understand, for instance, that in the last quarter - the September quarter of last year - there were 1,912 agreements reached, of which there was only any debate or disputation in 66 of them.                              We also understand that periodically parties may not agree. I do not believe that there is a spate of lockouts in this country. Also, I do not believe that there is a spate of industrial disputes and indefinite strike action in this country. I do reject the assumption in the member's question that somehow Qantas's action will be repeated by a range of other employers. We have not seen this to be the case.                              I believe that the current system does allow people to reach negotiation. We, on this side, believe in enterprise bargaining, as opposed to those on that side, who believe that the management is the enterprise and the workers are the bargain. We do believe that people should have the ability to have their point of view heard at work, and we do believe that employers have rights to pursue their agenda and to pursue their rights under the act.                              We also believe on this side in this place that, fundamentally, indefinite strike action and lockouts are absolutely the undesirable last resort. But we are not going to ban lockouts and we are not going to ban strikes in Australia because that is the slippery slope to dictatorship.                              I thank the member for Melbourne, and I know that whilst he is willing to raise industrial relations there are a lot of people opposite who have private views on workplace relations but they have not got the guts to admit what they really think.               </DOC>

  I thank the member for Chifley for his question and the interest he always shows in these issues.                              As I have stated before, this is a Labor government, and jobs and economic growth are top priorities for this government. Of course, that is why we welcome - as the Prime Minister has indicated - today's latest labour market figures showing 46,000 new jobs created in January. It is very good news, and we of course welcome it. But we understand, of course, that some companies are facing challenges in the current environment, and the government is managing the economy to assist in meeting those challenges.                              Part of that task, of course, is to promote cleaner technologies in industry to support jobs by promoting productivity, innovation and clean technologies, because that will support jobs. Today I launched the government's new Clean Technology Investment Programs. These will provide $1 billion to manufacturers to help them in the purchasing of new plant and equipment which will cut energy costs and reduce carbon pollution. Already, around 3,000 manufacturing businesses have expressed interest in the programs. Cutting energy costs, improving emissions intensity, innovation and cleaner technologies being applied in the workplace will all promote competitiveness and support jobs in those workplaces. And, of course, the announcement of these programs has been welcomed today by the Australian Industry Group.                              Today, we have also finalised the regulations for the government's Jobs and Competitiveness Program under the clean energy package. This program will provide more than $8 billion in assistance over the next three years to businesses in emissions-intensive industries that face competition internationally as we go about the task of reducing emissions in our economy. Under this program free carbon permits are allocated according to an industry average and according to historical emissions baselines. The importance of that is that because the permits are allocated against an industry average and those baselines, the fact of the matter is that firms that invest in efficiency measures will not only improve their productivity they may well receive more than 100 per cent of their carbon liability in free permits. That is an extremely important aspect of this program because, in other words, in providing that it provides a direct financial incentive for new investment that will support jobs, productivity and competitiveness in those industries.                              On that side, they want to tear all this down. On this side, we are building an economy for the future and putting in place the foundation stones for future jobs growth, and that is a key priority that they oppose.                                                                    Mr COMBET:                    Thank you.              </DOC>

  When you are engaged in major reform, when you accept the obligations which come with running your economy in the interests of working people, when you accept the obligations that come with needing to cost policies and work through your budget so that you can return it to surplus, you have to make choices. As a government we stand by the choices we have made. They have not all been easy choices, but there is no magic money tree; there is nothing that enables you to go around promising that you will make changes but then not have to make the figures add up. I understand that is the approach of the opposition, which is why they now need to cut $70 billion away from the services that families rely on. I ask the member for Herbert to contemplate what that would mean for families in his electorate.                              In terms of the government's policy decisions, we have made sure that carbon pricing will change our economy at the least possible cost. We have made sure that the Australians who need our assistance the most will get that assistance - people like pensioners, who will see increases in their pension that are above and beyond what they will need to deal with the average impact of carbon pricing. Workers who earn less than $80,000 a year will get a tax cut, many of them a cut of $300, and a million people will come out of the tax system as a result of changes in the tax-free threshold. We have made those choices because we think that is the fair way of implementing change. The alternative is to come up with a scheme, like the opposition has, which would impose on every Australian family a cost of $1,300 a year. I ask the member for Herbert to contemplate how the families in his electorate, particularly the ones who are doing it the most tough, could stump up $1,300 a year.                              In relation to the private health insurance rebate, we have made choices too. We have made the choice that, in making sure that there is fairness in the system, it is right to not ask people who are on lower incomes to subsidise the private health insurance of people on higher incomes. We have made a choice to ensure that we have money available to keep funding the healthcare costs which continue to grow in our nation while of course we return the budget to surplus. On the other side, unfairness is their policy watchword; blowing the budget is second on the list.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Newcastle for her question. She is intimately interested in jobs and I know she is aware of the good news in her own electorate, with 4,000 manufacturing jobs added in the Hunter. Today's Newcastle Herald, kindly provided to me by the Chief Government Whip, draws to our attention that in the Hunter there are going to be five new Woolies, a Coles and a BigW. Well done to those members of parliament involved; they are getting on and encouraging jobs.                               I am asked about how the government is managing the Australian economy. We on this side of the House understand that we live in difficult times globally. We understand there are problems in Europe; we understand that in North America recovery has been slower and longer than they would otherwise have liked. But we also know, therefore, that we should not automatically be trash talking the Australian economy every time a microphone is put in front of our face.                               Today we got the latest unemployment numbers, and they show a fall in the unemployment rate since last month, to 5.1 per cent. For those in the parliament interested in statistics, more Australians have a job today than ever before in our history. I do not say that these numbers are not volatile, because they are, and I do not say that the statistics and the news will always be positive, because they will not. I recognise, as everyone in this House does, that there are sections of the Australian economy and companies that are doing it very hard. The truth of the matter is that today we can report that employment has surged by 46,300 jobs. There are 760,000 more jobs than there were when the opposition was in charge of government. The numbers do move around but we do have strong fundamentals in this nation. We hear plenty of stories, and in fact the greatest risk to the Australian economy is the constant  negativity of the opposition. Let me put before the House three examples of that and why the opposition is wrong.                                                                     Mr SHORTEN:                    I am positive about everything except you, mate.                                                                    Mr SHORTEN:                    I was not reflecting on the Speaker; I was just trying to inject a note of friendliness into an otherwise adversarial situation. The Leader of the Opposition said this morning:                              We've had an avalanche of job losses since the beginning of the year.                              Yet IT firm Digital Reality is creating 220 jobs. I have a list of 20 success stories of jobs being created. What the Australian economy needs is a political debate which is not marked by the constant negativity of the opposition. Today's unemployment is good news and I just wish the opposition had the grace to recognise that good news for what it is.               </DOC>

   I thank the member for her question.                                                                    Mr CREAN:                    Thank you, Mr Speaker. I thank the member also for her question, because she has been a champion for job creation, and in the first round of the Regional Development Australia Fund, important initiatives were a gain for her electorate, particularly the Ballina airport and the Lismore cultural centre, which will see significant job opportunity.                               I am asked this question in a broader context, and today's figures are unequivocally good news on the employment front: 46,000 additional jobs created, 760,000 since this government was elected, with Treasury projections that say that, by 2020, we will more than double that - in other words, that amount twice over. Unemployment has come down and the participation rate has gone up. But the question that I am asked goes to  what we have been doing to facilitate this fantastic outcome, and that is, we have been investing in those things that drive economic growth and create jobs. We have been investing in the infrastructure of the nation, not the least of which is the broadband rollout for the nation which, at its peak, will be employing 37,000 people. In addition to that, we have invested heavily in the skills base and education base of this nation, with the biggest infrastructure investment ever in the history of the country, driven when the Prime Minister was the education minister, and that is a fantastic legacy upon which we have to build.                              We are in the middle of the greatest economic transformation the world has ever known. The opportunity that is growing in Asia - in India, in China, in South-East Asia - is what we have got to capitalise on. And the infrastructure that we put in place helps us do it.                                                                     Mr CREAN:                    But we also have to find the way in which the regions of the country, the patches in the patchwork economy, take advantage of those opportunities.                              Earlier this week I was responding to a question about development in Tasmania. I announced what we had done for the dairy industry. Let me just say what that means in job terms. With the Harcus River Road development, 200 jobs in construction, 135 ongoing in the dairy industry; and, in the aquaculture industry, 40 in construction, 160 ongoing, with the potential to double from 800 to 1,600 the number of jobs in the Huon Valley. That is what the Labor government is doing, by working with communities at the micro level as well as putting in the place the initiatives at the macro level. All we get is opposition from the other side. They should get on board if they believe in the future of this country.               </DOC>

  We meet on a day when more Australians are in work than ever before, and this is the kind of question we get from the opposition. Of course, they do not want to talk about jobs. The Leader of the Opposition said at the start of this sitting fortnight, in his best Dirty Harry, 'Make my day' and 'Let's talk about jobs,' and this is the question we get.                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    In relation to the member's question, I was asked about these matters yesterday and I indicated to the member then that the opposition, through its legal spokesperson, has written to the Federal Police about this matter. Having written to the Federal Police, I presume that they want the Federal Police to look at it. The Federal Police are doing that.                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    My point is this: having asked the Federal Police to deal with the matter, I think that is the appropriate course.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Calwell for that question, because this government has provided more investment in education, on an unprecedented scale, than we have ever seen in this parliament. We have more than doubled the funding that we saw under the previous coalition, and every dollar is intended to make sure that every kid in the country has the skills that they need for the new economy and the opportunity to fulfil their potential and to get jobs into the future. I was pleased to know that the member herself has seen significant investment from this government in projects in her electorate - some 16 libraries under Building the Education Revolution, and a range of other investments.                              These investments are all geared to making sure that kids in these schools have the skills that they need to succeed and to prosper in life, whether it is the national partnerships, where we are providing investment in teacher quality because we know that the teacher is the most important person in the classroom to help the kids; the investment in the facilities in Building the Education Revolution, because we know that they make a huge difference to the teacher and to the kids in the classroom; or the investment in computers in schools - some $2.4 billion.                              I am pleased to say that we can say now that we have a delivery of over 900,000 computers for kids in years 9 to 12 right around Australia, who will have access to those computers in this school year and, importantly, will be able to work in the new digital education environment, which will be absolutely central to their job prospects for the future. Previously kids would get into the latter years of high school but in many instances they would not have access to a computer. They might have had one at home, but when it came to the learning that they needed to do, when it came to accessing the information online, on the curriculum - our national curriculum, incidentally, is the first online curriculum of its kind in the world - they did not have the tools to do it. It was this government that provided them with the tools to do it.                              It is a matter of record that Mr Abbott and Mr Pyne wanted to cut money out of supporting computers for schools -                                                                     Mr GARRETT:                    and the Leader of the Opposition has made his position quite clear on these matters, because he wants to cut the investment in education.                              On the other hand, here we are saying that our future prospects as a nation absolutely depend on us investing in education. That is what we have done. That is what we will continue to do. Whether it is trades training centres so that kids can get the skills they need for jobs of the future, computers in schools so that they are able to work effectively in the new digital economy or making sure that everybody has access to a national curriculum and to good teaching, that is what this government is all about. We will deliver for kids in education for the 21st century. Those opposite have nothing to offer.              </DOC>

  I refer the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to my last answer. The opposition wanted to make this a matter for consideration by the Australian Federal Police. Having done so, I would have thought, if they were serious about that, they would then let the Australian Federal Police work through these matters. At no stage, from the tenor of these questions, has the opposition really been serious about it, and I really do wonder what is the opposition's alibi for being completely not interested in the jobs of Australian workers or the employment data that came out today.              </DOC>

  I want to thank the member for Bass for his question. He has a strong timber community in his electorate and a very passionate commitment to ongoing forestry in Tasmania. It has been recognised for some time that there are shifts going on in markets in Tasmania. It was recognised, in fact, by both sides of the House when even the opposition went to the last election with a promise for contract exit packages.                              The losses and job losses that have taken place in the forestry sector long preceded the intergovernmental agreement between the Commonwealth and Tasmania. In fact, in the three years prior to the agreement, forestry jobs fell from 6,920 to 3,460. In an economy the size of Tasmania's, this is a massive shift, and there is a need for us not to simply to pretend the shift is not happening but to help the Tasmanian economy to grow through this and thrive through this. It has been a combination of decisions in the market, the decision by Gunns to exit native forestry, a shift in international demand for woodchips and the shift in the Australian dollar that has helped drive this market change.                              Even though it has been this issue and the market change that brought the two governments to the table to help Tasmania with the changes that are going on, in recent weeks and months there have been impacts on Tasmania's industry that are not because of market changes. There have been a number of campaigns that have been run which have created a very real impact on the Tasmanian economy and which need to be dealt with directly. While the peak environmental groups have remained at the negotiating table working through future peace agreements, you cannot expect peace at a negotiating table while the battle intensifies in the marketplace. A minority of groups have been involved in these market campaigns but we have seen them as attacks on Harvey Norman, on our contracts with the London Olympics, and on the operations of Ta Ann and Britton Timbers at the precise time that these businesses have been at the table trying to work through a sustainable solution.                              These campaigns attack Tasmanian jobs and they jeopardise the opportunity for an enduring conservation outcome. If they were successful they would only result in increased demand for unsustainable rainforest timber from overseas. We came to the table to support jobs. We came to the table in the knowledge that because of the changes there may well be significant and one-off opportunities for enduring conservation outcomes. We support jobs and all efforts to end the conflict, but we are unreservedly opposed to the attacks on markets.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Sturt for his question, though I would have to say I am a little bit surprised by it, in circumstances where Niki Savva's op-ed earlier in the week in the Australian newspaper said:                              Abbott's chief of staff Peta Credlin sent an email to shadows and whips last week reminding them they had to get clearance in advance.                              The context of that in the previous sentence was:                              More difficult is keeping MPs away from major media, especially if they are not good at it, or their performances have the potential to cut across an agreed strategy.                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    I was asked a very broad question about leadership and political parties. I am making the very simple point that I presume the member is asking the question as a result of some game in the opposition because on his own test from what he said in his question the Leader of the Opposition is ruled out from being Prime Minister as a result of Peta Credlin's gag order.              </DOC>

  I say to the Leader of the Opposition that I always give him full marks for audacity, if not consistency. He comes into this parliament having survived his leadership issues by one vote. It is no wonder the Leader of the Opposition got some new suits after he became Leader of the Opposition. The rest of them were covered with blood!                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    Let me be very clear with the Leader of the Opposition and the Australian people about the circumstances of today. As I have just explained to the Australian people, we met this morning and I have the overwhelming support of my colleagues. As a united team, we will be there providing the government this nation needs. We will be ensuring that we are managing the economy today in the interests of working people while we build the economy they will need tomorrow, so that they will have opportunities and prospects for themselves and for their children. At the same time, we will be providing the benefits that working families need. Unlike the Leader of the Opposition, we will not be cowering in the face of the challenges of the future. We will be addressing those challenges and building a clean energy future, ensuring that we share the proceeds of the mining boom.                              To the Leader of the Opposition, who comes into this place to talk about trust and confidence, I say this. Australians can trust me to get the job done and they can have the confidence that, in the hardest of circumstances, I will win through in their interests, no matter how relentlessly negative the Leader of the Opposition is.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Robertson for her question. I know that she is determined that for the community she serves in this parliament she provides the benefits they need today but she also is shaping the future that they will live tomorrow. I am not surprised that whenever the word 'future' is used in this parliament we have uproar and laughter from those opposite because they have nothing to say about the nation's future. Unlike the opposition, the approach we take is that there is not a day to lose to build the future this nation needs; there is not a day to lose to build a future in which we fairly share the benefits of the mining boom and this becomes a boom for the many, not for the few; there is not a day to waste to make sure we make the right decisions now so we have the economy we will need in the future, a clean energy economy, a high-skill economy, a high-wage economy, offering people the benefits of jobs and then a better job and then the opportunity to start their own small business if they choose to do so.                              Here we see that there is not a day to waste to keep improving Australia's schools. They do not want the Leader of the Opposition's cutbacks; they want a continuation of a reform agenda that will get their children a better education. There is not a day to waste in continuing to roll out our health reforms, which will mean that there will be more doctors, more nurses and more ability for people to see a doctor in an emergency department, on time, or to get their elective surgery when they need it. There is not a day to waste to make sure that our nation is not at a standstill whilst the rest of the world moves on. We live in a remarkable age of opportunity as the global economy changes and as our regional economy changes, and there is not a day to waste as we go about seizing the benefits of those changes. That is what we are determined to do. As a Labor government, whilst we build that prosperity we are determined to look after those who need our care the most, particularly Australians with disabilities through the building of a national disability insurance scheme. There is not a day to waste and we are getting on with that job.              </DOC>

  The Deputy Leader of the Opposition raises carbon pricing. Yes, I am in favour of putting a price on carbon and we achieved it last year against the opposition of those shouting out now. It is a bit interesting that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition asked this question, because she was in favour of pricing carbon until she decided that instead of being deputy leader to Malcolm Turnbull she would be deputy leader to the current Leader of the Opposition. She was in favour of pricing carbon until the minute she was against it. Let the record show the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has a track record of working alongside the member for Wentworth in support of a price on carbon. This question is motivated by pure hypocrisy.                              On the question of problem gambling and making arrangements so that people are less likely to lose money that they cannot afford to lose and less likely to jeopardise their family's future, we faced a circumstance in which, because of the opposition of those who now seek to ask this question, there was not the support in this parliament for the scheme Mr Wilkie would have preferred. So instead we are bringing to the parliament the biggest package of reforms to address problem gambling the nation has ever seen. It remains to be whether or not the opposition will vote in favour of it or against it.                              On the question of asylum seekers, heavens above, the opposition were all in favour of stopping the boats until they decided their political interests meant there should be more boats. If the opposition ever decides to put the national interest in front of their political interests, just let us know.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for McEwen for that very important question. The reason so many of us on this side of the House went into public life in the first place is because we respect the dignity of work. We understand the importance of jobs - not just the number of jobs but the quality of jobs, the pay and working conditions that go with jobs and how important they are to the peace of mind of working families right around this country.                              We understood at the height of the global financial crisis and the global recession how important policies were to support economic growth and jobs. That is why in this country over the past four years 700,000-plus jobs have been created whilst around the world unemployment is at eight per cent and nine per cent. So the creation of jobs and support for economic growth go right to the core of this government's economic agenda. We now have low unemployment. We have a huge pipeline of investment. Unemployment is at 5.1 per cent. We have an economy which has grown by seven per cent since the start of the global financial crisis, whereas around the world economies have not got back to where they were. The legacy of that for them is double-digit unemployment, with whole sections of communities simply destroyed by massive unemployment and business closures.                              On this side of the House, we understand that jobs must be our No.1 priority to support economic growth and to meet the challenges which are posed by growth in our region. We also understand that there are patchwork areas of our economy where people are doing it tough. That is why we must put in place a range of policies which will support growth right across our region, particularly in small business. That is why we want to use the proceeds of the minerals resource rent tax to give a very big tax cut to 2.7 million small businesses right across our country to keep their doors open and to support employment - it is simply stunning that those opposite are opposing that tax cut for small business. It is why we want to invest in skills - $3 billion. It is why we are investing in infrastructure, particularly the NBN. It is why we are putting a price on carbon. Fundamentally, it is why we want to bring the budget back into surplus in 2012-13. Strict fiscal policy is the key to supporting employment.                              I heard the Leader of the Opposition say that he was committed to reducing expenditure. He has a $70 billion hole in his budget bottom line and he had the hide before question time to go before the journalists of Australia and somehow pretend that he was going to reduce public expenditure - with a $70 billion hole in his budget bottom line. We are committed to jobs. We are committed to strict fiscal management. We are committed to investing in the future.              </DOC>

  The member for Griffith has served this nation as Minister for Foreign Affairs with distinction, following many of the initiatives in foreign policy that he entered into for this nation when Prime Minister. Amongst those major achievements include the creation of the G20 - because of how important it was for our nation to be at the top table when the world came together to manage the global financial crisis - and include the work he did to see the creation of the East Asia Summit, so that we have in the one body all the right players around the one table that has a broad mandate, and enables us within our region to talk about security questions, political and strategic questions, as well as economic matters. These are important developments.                              Of course, as Minister for Foreign Affairs he has been advocating around the world our claim to be on the United Nations Security Council. He has also been centrally involved in events arising from what has happened in Egypt, Libya and Syria, as the world has come together both to make its voice heard on those events and to provide practical support. That answers the member's question. He has served with distinction as foreign minister. In all of that time, as he so served, of course the only thing that the opposition ever questioned him about in this parliament was when they were looking for cheap political advantage rather than engaging in the serious questions of foreign policy that are so important to our nation's future.              </DOC>

  I thank very much the member for Petrie for her question. In recent weeks, I have yet again been in her electorate looking at the Moreton Bay rail link - an important infrastructure proposal which we are delivering in her seat. When we came to office, we inherited an infrastructure deficit. More than 20 separate warnings from the Reserve Bank of Australia said that a failure to invest in infrastructure and skills was holding back our economic capacity. We set about addressing it. That was the case even though those opposite, when in government, had a $334 billion windfall in the budget in terms of additional receipts from what was anticipated in the budget papers.                              We set about getting the policy framework right through establishing Infrastructure Australia. We then set about on the big investment decisions. We have doubled the roads budget. We have increased the rail budget by more than 10 times. We have committed more in urban public transport since 2007 than was invested by all previous governments from Federation right through to 2007. They are the commitments that we have made. But it has not just been in investment. We also understand that you have to get the regulatory environment right, which is why we have moved from 23 transport regulators down to three - single regulators in rail, heavy vehicle and maritime - providing a boost to the economy of $30 billion over 20 years. But there is much more to be done. We also have a plan, and legislation will be introduced in coming weeks, to revitalise Australian shipping - an industry that is vital for our security, for our environment and for our economy. That industry was neglected and, indeed you can argue, consciously downtrodden by those opposite with a strategy to replace the Australian flag with flags of convenience on our coast, with all of the repercussions that that has. We on this side of the House will take action on these issues.                              We have also taken action on the issue of safe roads by making sure that those hard-working truck drivers who keep the country going can drive safely without pressure being put on them. Those opposite are not even sure if they will say yes to that - a fundamental reform that is so important for the safety of all those who drive on our roads, not just truck drivers but all those who share the roads with them. We on this side of the House are determined to get the big issues right. We are determined to continue to advance the reform agenda that we have been putting in place since 2007 in spite of the relentless negativity of those opposite.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for her question. The government brought to this parliament legislation for carbon pricing at the right price in order to drive a transformation in our economy to a clean energy future. At that time, we understood the circumstances of industries that trade with the world and trade at a world price, which is why we have created a multi-billion dollar Jobs and Competitiveness Program to support those industries and to support those jobs. It should disappoint all Australians that the opposition came into this parliament and not only voted against that, but they also voted against a $300 million support plan for the steel industry - that is, having gone round the country pretending that they are interested in blue-collar jobs, when it came to recording their vote in this parliament in favour of blue-collar jobs they refused to do so.                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    Our carbon pricing legislation has got it right. Through that legislation we will continue to support jobs, particularly blue-collar jobs. We will implement that legislation alongside our other major programs and policies to support blue-collar jobs and to support manufacturing. Unfortunately, the opposition has locked itself into cutting half a billion dollars out of that and then ending assistance to the car industry, putting at risk 46,000 blue-collar jobs. So I suggest to the member who asked this question she would be better off focusing her energy on working within her own political party to end this hypocrisy - they talk about blue-collar jobs but they never vote for them.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Kennedy for his question. I certainly understand the concerns that he has raised. The circumstances of the closure of the Philip family tomato farms are extremely unfortunate. The government will do all it can to help the employees who have been affected by it.                              Like the member for Kennedy, the government, of course, has been following very closely for some time now the developments in our supermarket sector in Australia and the competitive issues that are there. The government is extremely aware of concerns about the behaviour of some of the major players in the retail sector. It is the role of the independent commission and consumer watchdog, the ACCC, to monitor and ensure a competitive market. The ACCC has appropriate powers to undertake that task and the Chairman of the ACCC has made clear in a number of statements that the ACCC is focusing on conduct by the supermarkets and has been urging players to give him the evidence he needs to take the issues forward. He has said the following about this issue:                               We've been urging suppliers to give us some evidence to take things forward (in a prosecution) but we've been having trouble getting that. Too many of them are scared. At the moment all we've got is third-party hearsay.                              He said the ACCC 'urged suppliers to talk with the ACCC about these issues'.                                                                    Mr COMBET:                    I understand the member for Kennedy's concerns about this issue. We have to allow the Chairman of the ACCC the opportunity to do his job. I am sure that if the Chairman of the ACCC believes that he and the ACCC need further powers to deal with some of these competition issues in relation to the retail sector, he will come forward to the government and indicate that that is the case. At a broader level in the economy, the government are taking a number of steps to try to alleviate the pressure on small businesses in particular. We are endeavouring to distribute the benefits of the resources boom to assist small business through two key things. One of them is to reduce company tax and the other is to introduce an instant asset write-off of up to $6,500 for as many assets as small businesses can purchase within a financial year. We are doing constructive things to support jobs and small business in this economy, and all of it is opposed by the coalition.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Wakefield for his question. I understand it is his birthday today, so I acknowledge that. On this side of the House, we manage the economy to benefit the working people of this country and to grow jobs. Labor governments know how best to manage the economy for jobs growth. Australia does have low unemployment at 5.1 per cent. Real wages in this country have continued to grow. By contrast, unemployment in the United States is above eight per cent and real wage growth is stagnant.                              Our economic strength has been achieved while also delivering on Labor's values of fairness and equity. We removed Work Choices to improve fairness in Australian workplaces. We have introduced paid parental leave. We have doubled investment in school education. We have upgraded facilities at schools around the country. We have created 130,000 new training places. We are investing more than $36 billion in transport infrastructure projects around the country. This side of the parliament is making an historic investment in the National Broadband Network, which will drive productivity improvements, improve living standards and create new business opportunities for businesses all around the country. This side of the parliament understands the importance of introducing a carbon price so that we can separate our economic growth from growth in pollution. On this issue, anyone who argues that we as a nation can do nothing about climate change is betraying our future - our environmental future and our economic future. We are investing in the skills and training to give Australians a fair share of the mining boom. We are helping small business.                              Every single thing that the government is doing on the economy is opposed by the coalition. Falsehoods are constantly told. Let us not forget that not many months ago the Leader of the Opposition claimed the coal industry would be destroyed by a carbon price -                                                                     Mr COMBET:                    This is directly relevant because it is about jobs and industry. The fact of the matter is that, since the government introduced our carbon price plans and legislated our clean energy package, almost $20 billion of investment has been announced in the coal industry, and the Leader of the Opposition said the industry would be destroyed. There are falsehoods told.                              On this side of the parliament, we are managing the economy for the working people of this country.               </DOC>

  To the member, who knows a great deal about this: I ask why it is that, if he is genuinely interested in dealing with border security and stopping the boats, as he claims, when the government made a good faith offer to implement the solution that the opposition says was its preferred solution - that is, a detention centre on Nauru - and when the government made a good faith offer to do that in parallel with implementing our arrangement with Malaysia, the opposition instead decided that it would prefer to see more boats? The reason for that is absolutely clear. The opposition has taken a calculated, cynical decision that it is in its political interests to see more boats, no matter what the risks to human lives and safety.                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    I was very directly asked about implementing the policies of the opposition, and I am being very directly relevant to that. We entered into a good faith set of discussions to come to an understanding across this parliament on an issue of importance to the nation.                                                                  The member for Herbert then left the chamber.                                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    The opposition walked away because it decided it would rather see more boats and more risks to lives than work with the government towards a solution. I say to the member who asked the question: as he well knows, the stated policy of the opposition now about turning back boats is one that was not implemented by the Howard government in its later years and is one that would put at risk the lives of men and women who work in our Australian Defence Force - people who have committed their lives to serving our nation. It would put their lives at risk. I say to the member who asked the question, and I say it very proudly indeed: we will never join with the opposition in risking the lives of ADF personnel with such a policy. We will never do that. In answer to the member's question: we will never do what you ask. We will never risk those lives in the way that you want to for your cheap politics.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Blair for his question. He is interested in the future for his constituents in Ipswich. He knows the courtesy of a Labor government: 43½ thousand of his voters who are working at the moment will get an increase in superannuation. He also knows that economic change in Australia is inevitable. Unlike the flat earth society opposite, we do not argue that change can never happen. We do not mislead the Australian electorate and say to people, 'You don't have to change; you can stay as you are.' What he also knows is that only the Labor government are the people who are committed to helping people get through change. We are doing it in three ways. We are doing it through making sure people have jobs and fair conditions at work, we are doing it by making sure that we can help families make ends meet and we are also doing it by ensuring a good future for people in the areas of both social justice and their retirement.                              In terms of ensuring fairness, our credentials are second to none, because we repealed Work Choices and got the Fair Work Act. We stand for having modern awards and ensuring that whilst business can prosper people do not get ripped off in the workplace. In terms of jobs our credentials are, again, out there. Whilst this year will be a difficult year for employment in Australia as we weather the economic storms of Europe, there is no doubt that our unemployment numbers, most recently at 5.1 per cent, are the envy of the Western world. How did the opposition react when we heard that good economic news? They had that spanked-bottom look on their faces!                              We talk about skills. We are the government that is spending more on skills than any other government ever before. It is on our watch that we have seen more apprentices being trained and more people getting the training they need so they can adjust and find new jobs as the new economy rises. We are also helping families make ends meet. That is why we want to make sure that the corporate tax rate is reduced from 30 per cent to 29 per cent. That is why, on 1 July this year, as the carbon price is introduced, we will see the tax-free threshold go up to $18,000. Who would have believed it was possible to lift the threshold that high? Only a Labor government believes that. That is what we have managed to accomplish.                              I also said that we are helping people into the future by making sure that we have a fair raft of social justice measures. That is how we help deliver a strong economy, by making sure no-one gets left behind. Only one political party in Australia is supporting an increase in superannuation from nine per cent to 12 per cent. Only one side of Australian politics is abolishing the 15 per cent tax paid on superannuation under $37,000 and only one party in Australia is fair dinkum about the National Disability Insurance Scheme.              </DOC>

  A little bit earlier in question time I said that what the opposition would do today is concentrate on the Labor Party and what we would do is concentrate on the nation's future. So I say to the member who asked this question that he clearly has no interest at all in tackling climate change or seizing a clean energy future for our country. He is prepared to back the Leader of the Opposition as they wander around the nation on the one hand saying, 'Let's stand still; let's do nothing,' and then on the other hand saying, 'Let's have our own scheme and charge each family $1,300 for the scheme we have designed, which we know will not work.' Whereas the truth - and everybody in this parliament actually knows it - is that they will never -                                                                     Ms GILLARD:                    There were three policy issues raised in the question. I know, of course, that the opposition has got no interest in policies, no interest in the nation's future - just says no to everything. But when I am asked about three policies I am going to answer on the three policies. Unlike the opposition, we are focused on the nation's future. Unlike the opposition, we will not wander around pretending that it is good enough to stand still. We will not wander around pretending that there is a way of addressing climate change efficiently that does not involve putting a price on carbon - that is, we will be clear and accurate with the Australian people, the way the member for Wentworth was when he was Leader of the Opposition, the way former Prime Minister John Howard was when he took an emissions trading scheme to the 2007 election.                              The member also asks about other policy questions. If he wants to address problem gambling then he will vote with the government on the biggest package of reforms ever to be brought to this nation's parliament to address problem gambling. If he genuinely cares, if this is anything other than cheap politics, then he will be honour bound to do that having raised the issue.                              More generally, I say this to those members opposite as they continue their negativity, their denial of the nation's needs and of building the nation's future. Whilst they stay stuck in that cheap negativity we will be getting on with the job: not a day to lose to build the prosperous future that our nation wants; not a day to lose to make sure that children have the best education, that we have the best health care, that we have a national disability insurance scheme; and not a day to lose as we address the pressing challenges as our economy restructures, as our regional economy restructures. We understand that those opposite will carp and whinge and moan and say no. We will just get on with the job.

  To the Leader of the Opposition's question: last year this parliament put a price on carbon. It did that because we want our nation to seize a clean energy future. The Leader of the Opposition himself has been in favour of putting a price on carbon. He went to the 2007 election on a platform of introducing an emissions trading scheme. On this side of the parliament, we have always said that the best way of tackling climate change - the cheapest, the most effective way - was to put a price on carbon -                                                                     Ms GILLARD:                    and we have achieved that.                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    Putting a price on carbon was the right thing to do, and I stand by it. It was the right thing to do to seize a clean energy future. The Leader of the Opposition is on the public record saying that.                                                                     Ms GILLARD:                    The deputy leader, who interjects, is on the public record saying that. The member for Sturt is on the public record saying that. They all went to the 2007 election pledging to vote for that in this parliament. When it comes to talking about deception on this question, they might like to explain to the Australian people why they were in favour -                                                                     Ms GILLARD:                    Mr Speaker, I am more than happy to rephrase. It falls to the opposition to explain how the most senior figures of this opposition went to the 2007 election campaign saying that they believed in putting a price on carbon, that they would all vote for putting a price on carbon -                                                                     Ms GILLARD:                    The senior figures of the opposition should explain why they went to the 2007 election, hands on their hearts, saying, 'I will walk into the parliament and I will vote for a price on carbon.'                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    I am asked whether or not carbon pricing is a mistake for this country, and I am pointing out that carbon pricing in this nation has had strong bipartisan support, and that is why it is not a mistake for the nation. It has been supported fulsomely by the Leader of the Opposition. He sought election in 2007 on the basis that he would vote for carbon pricing -                                                                     Ms GILLARD:                    and he probably said that in 2007 because he believed then, as did Prime Minister Howard -                                                                     Ms GILLARD:                    that it was the right thing for the nation.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for La Trobe for her question. As the representative of an outer urban electorate in this place, I am sure that she, like many other members, takes plenty of calls in her electorate office and has plenty of people seeking to speak to her on the streets of her community about their inability to get broadband - their inability to get a service.                              Today is a landmark day in the development of telecommunications for this country. Today the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission has approved the structural separation of Telstra. Our 100-year-old copper network has served us well but it will not meet the needs of the future. To meet those needs we need superfast broadband. We need the National Broadband Network. And, to ensure that the National Broadband Network can be got to Australians in the most equitable way with services at the cheapest price, we need the structural separation of Telstra so that there are wholesale services and there is retail competition on those services. That is what structural separation means and that is what has been achieved by this government.                              This is the delivery of a major reform, much delayed in this country, spoken about for 20 years but delivered by this government, delivered through legislation at the end of last year and now getting the regulatory approvals it needs today. That means that we now have in place the funding, the legislation and the regulatory approvals to get superfast broadband around the nation.                              This is another example of the government getting the big things done, the big things that will make a difference to our future prosperity as a nation. It is inconceivable that we can hold our place in a competitive world if we are working on yesterday's technology and other nations are working on the technology of the 21st century.                              What today confirms is that in the 2013 election the nation will face a choice. Right around the nation for so many communities that choice will be an incredibly simple one: broadband or no broadband? That will be the choice. Productivity and prosperity in the future, or yesterday's technology? Twenty-first century delivery of healthcare and education services, or leaving our hospitals, GP clinics and schoolchildren behind? On this side of the parliament, we stand for embracing that future and shaping it in Australia's interest, and today is a very important day in ensuring that we get the National Broadband Network done.              </DOC>

  I thank the honourable member for the question, which really raised the importance of the mining tax. Our endeavour to put in place a profits based system in Australia is exceptionally important to the future of Australia. It is about time the coalition understood that we are very fortunate as a nation. There is a huge pipeline of investment in Australia to the tune of $455 billion in either planned or committed capital investment.                              It is also time they understood that our economy is going through a major transition at the moment. Whilst a significant part of our economy is getting major benefits in the process of this investment, there are other parts of our economy that are challenged by the impact of the dollar and, I might say, disappointing commodity prices, such as the aluminium industry. That is the case internationally at this point in time. I also say to the opposition that only Labor have the capacity to manage this transition, just as we, during the period of 1983 to 1996, were the only party capable of opening up Australia to the process of globalisation.                                                                    Mr MARTIN FERGUSON:                    When it goes to a question of having a good, hard look at yourself, it is time the coalition had a good, hard look at its scare campaign in terms of the transition that is going on in the Australian economy at the moment. I am talking about its endeavours to use workers and their families -                                                                     Mr MARTIN FERGUSON:                    with respect to the transition that is occurring with Qantas, Alcoa and BHP.                               Mr Speaker, I thank you for the opportunity to address this matter. The government is hard at work in trying to assist the Australian economy to manage a major investment pipeline whilst looking after those sections of the economy that are challenged by the transition. I say to those opposite: front up to policy and real policy debates rather than having your heads in the sand.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Parramatta for that very important question about the economy, something that those opposite are not interested in at all. Over the weekend my G20 colleagues met in Mexico, in what continues to be a difficult time.                                                                    Mr SWAN:                    It does continue to be a difficult time in the global economy but there have been recent policy decisions put in place in Europe, particularly by the ECB, that have eased pressures in markets. Nevertheless, my G20 colleagues have warned again that there are still challenges in the global economy. We do know that Europe does face a very painful period of adjustment and we also know that unemployment is far too high around the developed world and across the developing world. But, in the face of this, there was a very strong commitment from G20 finance ministers to make jobs, employment and economic growth the No. 1 priority in terms of structural reforms in both developed and developing countries.                               From our perspective on this side of the House, whether internationally or here, domestically, jobs are our No. 1 priority, and they have been from day one. Two-hundred thousand jobs would have been lost in this country during the global financial crisis if those on that side of the House had had their way. We on this side of the House understand that the dignity of labour is the lifeblood of every one of the communities that we represent, and we understand that prolonged high unemployment and small business closures are the most devastating things that can happen to any community, whether here or in other developed economies around the world. The values that drive us are to make sure that we support employment to the extent we can, to make our economy grow so that we can supply the jobs of the future.                               The one thing that everyone on this side of the House is proudest of is that today there are more Australians employed than at any other time in our history, with an unemployment rate of 5.1 per cent. We are proud of that. Despite the global challenges, our economy walks tall in the world, and the rock on which our economic policy is built is strong fiscal policy. Bringing our budget back to surplus in 2012-13 is absolutely critical. Compare and contrast that with the farce we have seen from those on the other side of the House: a $70 billion crater in their budget bottom line. On Q&amp;A last night we discovered there is a fourth stooge: Senator Joyce, who could not explain to the people of Australia how they were going to bring the budget back to surplus.                                                                    Mr SWAN:                    Yes, I withdraw that reference to Senator Joyce, Mr Speaker.              </DOC>

  Thank you very much for this opportunity to outline my portfolio responsibilities over the next 18 months. In the important area of emergency management, my focus will be on ensuring a greater focus on mitigation measures, preventative measures, to prevent people from being the subject of natural disasters in the first place. I am publicly on the record as saying, quite frankly, I think there is a lot of attention paid - and appropriately so - to providing assistance to people and communities once they have been the victim of natural disasters. But I think we as a parliament and indeed as dedicated local members - and I have seen many dedicated local members - need to really put a focus on preventative measures.                              In terms of my housing and homelessness responsibilities, we will be progressing the National Partnership Agreement on Social Housing. We will be pursuing the Social Housing Initiative, which involves $5.8 billion. By the middle of this year we will have all but constructed some 20,000 properties and will have repaired about 80,000 properties. In addition, under the National Affordable Housing Agreement we will be putting $6.2 billion into assistance for those who are homeless, including Indigenous Australians. Under the National Rental Affordability Scheme we have allocated $4.3 billion to reduce the rental payable not only by those who are vulnerable to homelessness but also by essential workers such as firemen, police officers, teachers and nurses. That assistance of $4.3 billion has been provided on the basis that proprietors of properties will reduce their rental accommodation to 80 per cent of market value. Work is being rolled out under the Housing Affordability Fund to assist state and local governments to implement infrastructure improvements in areas and get resources into those areas to reduce the cost of development so that those properties can be sold on the market at a cheaper value. Indeed, one example in Melbourne recently saw a $10,000 reduction in market property values. I will shortly be announcing that some 73 areas will benefit under the Building Better Regional Cities Program.               </DOC>

  I thank the member for New England both for the question and for the work he led when the Windsor inquiry looked into Murray-Darling Basin reform. A key recommendation, supported at the media conferences that followed, held by members of parliament on each side of this House, was for the government to put a pause on all non-strategic buybacks. At that time we gave a guarantee that in the north of the system we would only be buying from river pumpers and in the south of the system the general tenders which had been taking place would not recommence until 2013. Those commitments stand.                              There have been claims, in this parliament and outside the parliament, from three members of the inquiry that the recent expressions of interest that have been launched are in some way a breach of that commitment. I make it clear to everyone, including members of the Windsor inquiry, that the expressions of interest have been launched so that strategic buyback can take place. Rather than doing a basin-wide tender, rather than going through the other system, which members opposite had always opposed, where value for money was the only indicator, we now actually have a situation where we look to expressions of interest to see whether or not for the local community the purchase is strategic - and that is exactly what the inquiry unanimously called for. I am very happy to meet with members of the committee to talk about this; I am very happy to ask the Chair of the Murray-Darling Basin Authority to meet with members of the committee as well.                               This comes down to one really simple dividing line. When we got that unanimous report I actually thought that we had from the coalition members of the committee a willingness to engage in reform and that they would hold themselves to the words of that inquiry - their issue was whether or not the buybacks were strategic. What we have discovered today is that, regardless of the unanimity of the report, there are members opposite whose argument is not just whether it is strategic; they are just opposed to reform of the Murray-Darling Basin. The arguments that they have thrown up in the last few days are a slap in the face to every South Australian member opposite who thought they had a consensus position from the coalition; who thought they were actually on a constructive path forward.                                                                    Mr BURKE:                    That is why, Mr Speaker, what has been announced is exactly what the Windsor inquiry called for, is exactly in line with the commitment we made and is exactly what until this week had been a unanimous position from the coalition.              </DOC>

  The educational achievements of this Labor government are considerable. We take education seriously, and our commitment to make every school a great school is a commitment that we are delivering on. We have doubled investment in education to over $65 billion, including significant investment in national partnerships, where we work with the states to make sure that kids right around the country get the investment they need in their schools. I thank the member for Reid for his question because he has some 10 schools in his electorate benefiting from funding under the National Partnership on Low Socio-economic Status School Communities - which, incidentally, the opposition has said it will cut, so I know the honourable member realises how important this is.                              We have put additional investment into teacher quality because the research tells us that this is the most important thing in improving student results. We have invested in national teacher standards to raise teacher quality. We got that done. We said that we would introduce a national curriculum and we got that done. We now have the first ever national curriculum being taught in Australian schools as we speak. We have delivered over 900,000 computers to every Australian secondary student in years 9 to 12 for this year's schooling.                              We said that we would review funding for schooling, and we got that done as well. Last week, the Gonski review on education funding was released and it was well received and praised by almost every education stakeholder - with the notable exception of the member for Sturt. He went out on his own to recycle the hit list scaremongering routine, but no-one was listening.                              I was asked about the government delivering better education opportunities for young people. Last Friday, the Prime Minister and I launched the third version of the My School website, providing additional transparency and information for schools and parents. What does it tell us about the investments that we have made and are making? There was one fantastic statistic that can be seen on My School that I want to let the House know about. In 2010, we had 17 literacy and numeracy national partnership schools with results that were substantially below similar schools on My School. In 2012 none of these schools are in this category. That is an absolutely fantastic achievement. The point about this is that this is good education policy in practice. This is delivering on the commitments that we have made to make sure that every kid in every school in Australia gets the best opportunity to get the best education that they can.                                                We hear bleats, squawks and scare campaigns from those opposite, along with the promise of $2.8 billion in cuts to education. But when it comes to education, those on this side of the House - Labor - deliver.               </DOC>

  In answer to the member's question, I did make a mistake: I made a mistake in assuming that the opposition would ever be motivated by the national interest. I made that mistake and I am happy to put my hand up to it. I thought that at some point the opposition that had said 'stop the boats' might be prepared to walk into this parliament and vote to give this government and governments in the future the same powers to deal with offshore processing that governments in the past have had. The mistake that I made was believing that somewhere deep down they believe in the national interest.                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I am being very directly relevant to the question that I was asked.                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    I have learned from that mistake. What I have learned is that there is never a time that the national interest worries the opposition. The only thing that ever worries them is their political interest and the depths to which they will go to pursue their political interests know no bounds. They are prepared to see more boats; they want to see more boats despite the risks to lives. Their pledge to the Australian people is to risk the lives of ADF personnel in pursuit of a policy that they know to be flawed. My mistake was ever believing that they were better than that.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Cunningham for her question. Before she was in this place, she was a school teacher. She understands the importance of education. This government fully understands the need to focus on education, employment and the economy. Indeed, this government, when confronted with the global financial crisis, invested a record amount of money into education. As the Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth just said, we have doubled school education funding in only four years. We did so because we understand that it is absolutely critical to manage the economy to help working families. We understand that we need to ensure that those people in communities across the country who depend upon on us are able to be supported through those difficult times. We had to make a decision as to where we would invest that money. We rightly invested it in education. As a result, with that particular initiative alone, the $16.2 billion, we managed to support or create 120,000 jobs in this country, a remarkable effort when compared internationally with the way other governments confronted this issue.                              We know those opposite neglected school funding in their time in government. There is nothing wrong with flagpoles but you have to go beyond flagpoles and invest in school education. By contrast, we built 4,500 new interactive classrooms, 3,100 libraries, 2,900 multipurpose centres and, one other area I was looking at recently, 280 language and science centres across this country as a result of that initiative. This has been a remarkable effort by the government.                               In the end it will always be Labor that focuses on the things that matter. It will always be Labor that puts jobs at the centre of public policy. In relation to this initiative, we focused on jobs to protect the workers in this country and we invested to protect the students who are the workers of the future. This initiative was absolutely critical. Look now at the results. As the Treasurer said today and has said before, we have an enviable unemployment rate of 5.1 per cent. Look around the world: we have an unemployment rate less than half that of Europe and a rate much better than other advanced economies as a result of actions of this government. It will always be the case that this Labor government will invest in education and support jobs.              </DOC>

  There were proper cabinet processes in relation to this matter and we operate a proper cabinet government. Because we operate a proper cabinet government, we are able to assess the policy merits of various proposals. That is why, for example, we will never agree to the opposition's policy proposal to put the lives -                                                                     Ms GILLARD:                    Thank you, Mr Speaker. Because of proper assessment of policy proposals we will never join the opposition in putting the lives of ADF personnel at risk at sea in pursuit of their so-called 'turn the boats back' policy. It has been rejected by senior officers of the ADF as unsafe and risky and the Leader of the Opposition should not stand by it.                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    What I am doing is endorsing the words of Vice Admiral Ray Griggs when he pointed to the risks of turning boats around. He is a man who would know. It follows that if you are putting people at risk at sea you are putting their lives in danger. I am saying that that is the policy the opposition will take to the next election. Of course, the -                                                                     Ms GILLARD:                    On the question I was asked there was a proper cabinet process. We work in accordance with proper cabinet processes and of course we have been prepared to deal with the opposition in a spirit of goodwill of getting legislation through the parliament. We have been repudiated on that because they have no attachment to the national interest. In this parliament I have pointed to the words of the Chief of Navy on the question of the risks of turning back boats.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Page for her question. I am glad I can get a question on infrastructure and transport from this side of the House because, no matter what I do, it is pretty hard to get one from the other side of the House. They just simply will not ask a question on these issues, because they are not interested in infrastructure and transport.                                                                  The member for Kooyong then left the chamber.                                                                                    Mr ALBANESE:                    Right now, today, there are more than 1,600 workers on site working on the Pacific Highway, finishing the Ballina Bypass, Devils Pulpit, Tintenbar to Ewingsdale, Sapphire to Woolgoolga, Bulahdelah Bypass, Kempsey Bypass, Banora Point and Herons Creek to Stills Road.                              This is a vital road on which more than 800 people have lost their lives over the last 20 years. It is an important national priority for us and it has been a priority for the New South Wales government in the past. I wrote to the New South Wales roads minister last month and included a works plan to achieve duplication by 2016. I table my letter to Minister Gay and the work plan. Both Minister Gay and New South Wales Deputy Premier Andrew Stoner have acknowledged that 2016 is achievable. That is why I was disappointed that Minister Gay responded to my correspondence not by writing to me but by giving a letter to the newspapers saying that they would not continue with fifty-fifty funding for the Pacific Highway.                              This week the NRMA has called them out. NRMA President Wendy Machin said this in calling for New South Wales to meet its fair share:                              It was the Howard Government that set the 50-50 funding split for the Pacific Highway from 2006 and the NRMA has supported this approach since day one.                              She should know - a former National Party member for Port Macquarie who knows the highway well and is out there taking a principled position. I table the NRMA release.                              Whilst we have been getting on with the job, what we have seen from those opposite - the member for Cowper - is, first, he said it was not a federal problem when he called the Pacific Highway a state road. Then he said dollar-for-dollar funding should be provided for New South Wales. Then, when we put in $1 billion, they said there was not enough construction. They said it does not actually build roads. But now, this week, in defending the inaction from his coalition colleagues he said, 'Go to Sapphire, to Woolgoolga or to Kempsey and look at the scale of the work that is happening and ask yourself where you are going to replicate that six more times.' Now they say there is too much work taking place on the Pacific Highway, and it is not possible. I say to those opposite -                </DOC>

  The present policy of the opposition as I understand it - and it has moved on a number of occasions - is, despite the risks pointed to by the Chief of Navy in Senate estimates, to endeavour to turn back boats and to return asylum seekers to Indonesia, a country that is not a signatory to the refugee convention. And it is to do that in circumstances in which no agreement about any protections for those asylum seekers have been negotiated, including the most fundamental protection to which the refugee convention obligates a nation: to not return asylum seekers to the place where they were persecuted. That hypocrisy from the opposition comes against the backdrop of having said in this parliament that its position is to argue for a change to the Migration Act that limits offshore processing to countries that are signatories to the refugee convention. So the opposition's current policy is a hypocrisy compared with what they said in this place. What they said in this place was a hypocrisy compared with the conduct of the Howard government -                                                                     Ms GILLARD:                    I will withdraw it and replace it with 'complete contradiction' to the policy of the Howard government, which had asylum seekers processed in a non-signatory country, Nauru. Let us just check these policies over time: they did not care about the refugee convention, then said it was pivotal and now do not care about the refugee convention.                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    I was directly asked about the opposition's policy and whether or not I would endorse it. I was directly asked about that, and I am being directly relevant. If the opposition do not want me to talk about their policy, they should not ask me about it. Let us go down the convoluted road. When they are in government they process in Nauru; it is not a signatory to the refugee convention. They go to the 2010 election saying, in the words of the shadow minister, 'No, it's not a precondition that Nauru is a signatory to the refugee convention.' That is the policy the opposition took to the Australian people. Then they backflipped in this parliament because their political interest was in seeing more boats. They wanted to stymie legislation going through this parliament after the High Court case. Now they appear to have backflipped again with a policy that has all the risks the Chief of Navy has pointed to for ADF personnel. All this convolution points to putting political interest above the national interest. The opposition want to see more boats.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Oxley for his question. It is an important one. The Labor government's priority is to manage the economy in the interests of working people, to give people a hand to support jobs and to make sure we have a strong economy so that jobs grow. That is why we managed the economy the way we did during the global financial crisis - to ensure that as many jobs as possible were protected and that jobs kept growing.                              Commitment to the working people and the working families of this nation is the reason the clean energy future package, containing the carbon price, includes not only household assistance but support for jobs. Today the government released regulations to establish what we have entitled the Jobs and Competitiveness Program. Those regulations are now in place. That program will provide substantial assistance in the form of free carbon permits to the most emissions intensive and trade exposed industries - like the steel industry, aluminium smelting and cement manufacturing. The most emissions intensive industries will receive an initial average of 94½ per cent of their carbon permits for free, meaning that the effective carbon price is reduced from $23 to $1.30.                              The government has designed that assistance to support the jobs in those industries. It is especially significant assistance worth many billions of dollars over the next few years. If a business can reduce its emissions intensity, its effective carbon price might in fact be less than $1.30 per tonne of greenhouse gases. In fact, it might mean that business has excess free permits that can be sold for a profit. That is built into the design of this support and is a tremendously powerful incentive for companies to reduce their emissions. Any discussion about carbon pricing, the competitiveness of our economy and support for jobs in these important industries has to take these issues into account - not the nonsense that is thrown into this debate by the Leader of the Opposition. We have also put aside a $1 billion program to support investments in clean technology in low emissions technologies. We will continue to support jobs and the competitiveness of our economy while the opposition continues to undermine strong economic management.              </DOC>

  In answer to the member's question, as the member probably knows from the discussions over summer, we entered into good-faith negotiations with the opposition in order to see us work together on legislation which would put this government and future governments in the same position as the former Howard government - that is, able to make appropriate arrangements for offshore processing. We actually said to the opposition, in that spirit of goodwill, that we would endorse their stated policy at that time, which was having a detention centre on Nauru, if they allowed us to then have the Malaysia arrangement implemented and we would work together on the appropriate legislative amendment. After days and days of discussions and comings and goings that the shadow minister was involved in and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition was involved in, it became transparently clear -                                                                     Ms GILLARD:                    that the opposition participants in those discussions were not going to enter an arrangement with the government and that the opposition was not serious about the process, and we certainly knew that for sure when we read about it in the pages of the Australian -                                                                                       Ms GILLARD:                    and it had all been tipped out there publicly. So I say to the member who asked the question I understand that it is the policy of the opposition that they want to see more boats. I understand that, because that is their policy, they will oppose any legislation in this parliament.                                                                   -                                                                                      Ms GILLARD:                    Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. So what is raised with me by the opposition is a question of process. What I am inviting them to put their attention on is a question of substance, acting in the national interest, and spectacularly to date in this area of policy - like all others - the opposition have failed to do so.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Hindmarsh very much for that question because I know how much he does, particularly for families and pensioners, in his electorate of Hindmarsh. It is, of course, the case that this government has been getting on with the job of delivering real assistance to both pensioners and households. If you go firstly to the millions of pensioners in Australia, it is this government that delivered the most substantial improvements to the pension and, compared to when the Leader of the Opposition was in government, pensioners are now getting $148 a fortnight extra if they are single pensioners on the maximum rate. That certainly has helped pensioners with their difficulties when it comes to meeting cost-of-living pressures.                              The government is also doing many things to help families. It is this government that has increased the childcare rebate to make sure that it does provide that extra assistance with out-of-pocket costs when parents need to take their children to child care and it is this government that has helped parents with the costs of education, most recently with the cost of school uniforms. And, of course, it is this government that has made sure that it improves assistance for those parents who have got older teenagers who are staying on at school - not like those opposite, who are so out of touch and who have got no idea about the costs of older teenagers. It is this government that has made sure that it delivers to those parents, and they are now getting up to $4,200 extra a year to make sure that they can meet the costs of their children.                                                                    Ms MACKLIN:                    Of course it was this Labor government that introduced Australia's first national paid parental leave scheme, and so far we have seen around 130,000 families get the benefit of that. We have just heard that there has been a row in the Liberal Party in Broome today. Many of the Leader of the Opposition's colleagues do not agree with his policy on paid parental leave. They know that what he wants to do is impose a new tax on Australian families.                                                                    Ms MACKLIN:                    This government wants to cut taxes for Australian families. The Leader of the Opposition wants to impose a new tax.              </DOC>

  I presume the Leader of the Opposition is referring to the closure of the solar hot water rebate scheme. This scheme was always due to close on 30 June this year. What has been announced by the government is that, to be eligible for the rebate before the scheme closes, systems must be installed and ordered (and a deposit paid) or purchased on or before 28 February 2012.                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    During the period of this rebate scheme, which was always due to close on 30 June this year, the hot water industry has benefited from over $320 million in support provided through rebates under the program. It supported 250,000 installations, that is 25,000 more than were promised when the Howard government announced this scheme, because it does stem from the days of the Howard government. When it was announced by the -                                                                     Ms GILLARD:                    I presume hidden in that mouthful of abuse there is actually a question about the management of the program, and I am going to the management of the program. On the management of the program, this program was first announced by the member for Wentworth in 2007. It was stated then that it would close in 2012. Even when the member for Wentworth announced it when he was Minister for the Environment and Water Resources, he was on the public record at that time as saying, 'Once you have a carbon price, you do not need specific policies to support solar hot water.' I think the member for Wentworth is recognising that statement.                               After the closure of this scheme from 1 July, there will be a number of ways in which solar hot water purchases are supported. First and foremost, obviously under carbon pricing there is an incentive for change; second, under the renewable energy scheme, households installing the typical solar water system will still receive between $800 and $1,000 in renewable energy certificates; and then, of course, under the carbon pricing scheme through the Low Carbon Communities Program there is assistance available, particularly to enable low-income communities to make the transition to carbon pricing - so of course consideration can be made to the use of solar energy for hot water in that context.                               In answer to the Leader of the Opposition's question, the scheme was always due for closure on 30 June this year, an announcement made yesterday by the relevant parliamentary secretary about the time by which people would need to have effected their purchase in order to be eligible for the rebate.                                                                  The member for Hume then left the chamber.                              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Robertson for her question. I know she is very concerned about how families in her electorate are supported at every stage of their lives - whether it is through the time they have a new baby and need to be caring for the new infant at home, whether it is in the days that they need access to child care and need childcare support, whether it is in the days when kids are at school and they want support for the costs of getting kids to school, or whether it is in the days that those kids are teenagers and need the kind of support that families need with the cost of teenagers - and, of course, beyond, as people are caring for older relatives.                              At every stage for Australian families we have been determined to make a difference - to provide a package of policies that support families. In that regard we have made a series of changes, but we are adding to those changes - for example, by increasing family payments for families with teenagers, boosting payments by up to $4,200 for each child. We have provided the education tax rebate, which supports families with the costs of getting kids to school, and we are extending that to school uniforms. We are devoting more resources to child care than ever before. We have lifted the childcare rebate to 50 per cent of out-of-pocket costs, up to $7,500 a year, because of its importance to working families and its being such a considerable impost on their budgets when families need child care.                              Amongst all of that we are particularly proud of the introduction of our paid parental leave scheme. We got that done over a year ago. Since then over 140,000 Australian families have applied for paid parental leave payments. It is incredibly important to them at that time when they are at home with a new infant. Our approach of getting this done, our approach of supporting working families at that stage of their lives, is in very stark contrast to the approach being taken by the opposition. I have seen described as 'friendless' in the Liberal party room the Leader of the Opposition's plan for the Ritchie Rich parental leave scheme.                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. On the question of paid parental leave - such a benefit for working families - of course on this side of the parliament we have made sure it is properly funded under the government's budget. On the other side they want to fund it through a Coles and Woolies tax.              </DOC>

  On the member's question: (1) the government of course stands by the Treasury modelling on the effects on power prices; (2) in the design of our carbon price scheme -                                                                     Ms GILLARD:                    Of course, whenever you mention a fact, the opposition cannot take it because their fear campaign just crashes into a hole. But these are the facts. Under the design of our carbon pricing scheme we are providing $5.5 billion through the Energy Security Fund to deal with the electricity industry. We have established the Energy Security Council to provide systemic advice on energy security and possible measures to address any issues that may arise. We have also begun an expression of interest process to close around 2,000 megawatts of very highly-emissions-intensive coal fired electricity generation capacity - and that would have effect before 2020.                              If you are serious about tackling climate change then it must be acknowledged that the energy sector, our electricity generation, is amongst the most emissions intensive in the world. That means we need a journey of transformation in that energy sector, so that we are able to generate energy but to generate less emissions. Putting a price on carbon is the most efficient way to do that. And, having put a price on carbon, we are in a position to provide assistance to families that need it most, including families -                                                                     Ms GILLARD:                    with children, through family payments; taxpayers earning less than $80,000 a year - and, of course, pensioners will benefit too. And millions of households will receive more in their hands than they need to deal with the average impact of carbon pricing.                              Mr Speaker, on the -                                                                     Ms GILLARD:                    Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. On the question of electricity prices, of course there was a time when the opposition was very honest about this to the Australian people - that time has passed. There was a time in August 2010, when the relevant spokesperson from the opposition very clearly said that power prices are set to double over the next five to seven years, irrespective of who is in government. And he talked about an investment drought in energy generation. The biggest problem that would face that sector in terms of making long-lived investments is uncertainty. Who is the architect of uncertainty in this debate? The Leader of the Opposition, with his very wacky plans to impose a $1,300 charge on families -                                                                     Ms GILLARD:                    and of course to throw the energy generation sector into complete confusion. Instead, the government have taken a very purposeful approach to making sure that we embrace a clean energy -                </DOC>

  I thank the member for Melbourne Ports for his very important question because, from day one, we on this side of the House have made the jobs of working Australians our No. 1 priority, so much so that there are more Australians employed now than we have ever had in our history, and we have an unemployment rate of 5.1 per cent. That does not mean to say that there are not challenges elsewhere in the economy, but having an unemployment rate of 5.1 per cent after we have come through a really torrid global recession is a very substantial achievement, and it is one that everyone on this side of the House is very proud of. We know that, if those on the other side of the House had had their way, hundreds of thousands of Australians would have been thrown on the unemployment scrap heap and tens of thousands of small businesses would have closed. But we are getting on with the big reforms to ensure strong economic growth and more Australians getting the jobs of the future.                              We are investing $3 billion in skills. As Senator Arbib said yesterday, one of the things we are most proud of is our record when it comes to apprenticeships. We are very proud of that record. Everyone on this side of the House knows what we did to keep young Australians in jobs and young Australians getting trained. We are also proud of our investment in infrastructure, building the NBN - and here there is a very clear contrast with those on the other side of the House -                                                                     Mr SWAN:                    They are determined to tear down the NBN and they have no plan to train the workforce of the future. We are introducing -                                                                     Mr SWAN:                    Certainly, Mr Speaker. We are introducing a carbon price, absolutely essential to drive investment in renewable energy, to make sure that we are the first-class economy in the 21st century - opposed every step of the way by those opposite. What we are doing is trebling the tax-free threshold -                                                                   The member for Mackellar then left the chamber.                                                                                    Mr SWAN:                    We are very proud of our proposal to treble the income-tax-free threshold, a very substantial benefit for low-income Australians, something that will be ripped away by those opposite, along with the increases in pensions and family payments.                              And we are determined to spread the benefits of the mining boom right around Australia: the tax cuts to 2.7 million small businesses, opposed by those opposite. We are determined to bring the budget back to surplus in 2012-13, something that those opposite cannot do. They have walked away from their commitment to surplus because of a $70 billion crater in their own budget bottom line. That $70 billion crater means they cannot -                                                                     Mr SWAN:                    put forward alternative policies for the future.                                                                    Mr SWAN:                    We have the reform policies for the future. Those on that side of the House have absolutely none.              </DOC>

  I thank the honourable member for the question. In doing so, I acknowledge that there were two questions posed to me on Meet the Press last Sunday, one about the views of the member for Griffith, going to his proposed alternative approach to carbon pricing in Australia. I sought to explain the basis of his thinking. If I have misrepresented his view, I apologise. I was then asked a second question about the view of the government. I indicated that, from the government's point of view, the issue is resolved.                              Industry requires certainty. In the context of my responsibilities to the electricity sector of Australia, it is of the utmost importance for the purposes of maintaining energy security in Australia, because we are at a point in our development at which the demand for energy has increased in Australia whilst we are also required to undertake a major transition aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions in Australia. In the context of achieving those dual objectives, we require certainty in industry for the purpose of facilitating new investment whilst at the same time using our clean energy strategy for the purpose of encouraging new investment in clean energy initiatives such as the potential to develop our gas industry for domestic purposes and, I might say, investment in renewables such as wind and solar. I thank the honourable member for the question.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for his very important question. As Treasurer and as a Queenslander, I can say that I am a very strong supporter of what is termed horizontal fiscal equalisation. What do we mean by that? It is a very important principle, whereby stronger states and wealthier states throughout the life of the federation have supported weaker states. Queensland and Western Australia have been very significant beneficiaries of horizontal fiscal equalisation over the whole of our history. Indeed, you would not have the modern Western Australia or the modern Queensland of today if it had not been for all the financial support that has been provided by New South Wales and Victoria to those two states over a very long period of time. I am a strong supporter of this, because there are other states in our federation that are somewhat weaker when it comes to their capacity to raise revenue and their capacity to deliver services to their citizens. That is why we need to continue to support the independent Grants Commission, as we have done for dozens of years - 20, 30, 40 or 50 years. We have continued to support that principle of the independent decision and distribution of moneys by the Grants Commission.                              There has been a decision recently by the Grants Commission which does take down the per capita amount that goes to Western Australia, and it certainly has made additions to other states. For example, in this decision Queensland does a lot better, because of the huge impact of the floods in Queensland. I do not think anybody would deny the importance of that decision. But there is a principle that the member refers to, and that is why the Prime Minister has appointed a committee to look into the issues raised by the member, within the context of continuing to have horizontal fiscal equalisation.                              I would just make this point. We await the outcome of that committee and we will study its report, but we know that, when you throw in all of the other financial assistance that states get apart from the GST, if you throw in the infrastructure funding and lots of other grants, the figure for Western Australia, even now, is 88c in the dollar, so there is still considerable assistance going to Western Australia. What I have to do is look after the national interest. That is what a national government has to do. We have appointed this committee to come down with their assessment of the proposals put by the member for O'Connor and the Western Australian Premier, but at the end of the day we will do what is right for all Australians.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Chisholm very much for her question and for her support, especially for paid parental leave. She understands, like everybody on this side of the House, why it is so important to give parents that extra support through paid parental leave when a new baby comes into the home. This government is all about getting things done, especially getting things done to support families. That is why we have delivered paid parental leave. I can inform the House that, from today, more than 140,000 families around Australia are benefiting from paid parental leave. We said we would deliver paid parental leave, and we have. We said we would deliver paid parental leave without an extra tax on business, and we have.                              I am asked by the member for Chisholm what the biggest risks to paid parental leave in this country are. The biggest risk to paid parental leave is sitting right there. The Leader of the Opposition famously said when he was in government that paid parental leave would happen over his dead body. But now we know this Leader of the Opposition wants to introduce what has been called by his own side a 'Rolls-Royce system' of paid parental leave. This Leader of the Opposition not only will not deliver paid parental leave; he cannot deliver it, because he has got a $70 billion black hole, and his paid parental leave costs $4.5 billion a year, which he is going to pay for with a new tax on business. He wants to turn his back and look the other way, because he knows -                                                                     Ms MACKLIN:                    He is now. He is certainly looking at me right now, because he knows that that extra tax is going to mean -                                                                     Ms MACKLIN:                    It is not only the people of Australia that know that this Leader of the Opposition cannot afford his $4½ billion scheme; he has now got the member for McMillan and his own senators telling him that he cannot afford his Rolls-Royce paid parental leave scheme.              </DOC>

  I have seen lots of speculation in today's newspapers and in other places about this matter and about the reshuffle in general. As I have said publicly beyond the chamber of this parliament, let me also say within the chamber in this parliament: I am not going to be speculating on the reshuffle. I will announce it and then everybody can see it and judge it as they see fit.                               On the question of the speculation and how I will deal with the reshuffle, let me say very clearly that I will be dealing with the reshuffle because I want the best possible team to continue the government's policies and plans and the one thing in this parliament we never get a question of any substance about is visions for the future and how you go about realising them. The team I select will be a team capable of doing that. I know the Leader of the Opposition has an unhealthy kind of obsession with the so-called faceless men in the Labor Party. What he really should be obsessed about is the useless men sitting behind him.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Shortland for her question. She knows this is a positive and proactive government because 40,300 of her constituents are going to get an increase in superannuation from nine per cent to 12 per cent. That is positive and proactive. This government is positive and proactive about Australians and Australia's future. On this side of the House, we know we can afford to be positive and proactive. There are at least three reasons why we are being positive and proactive: (1) we are positive and proactive about Australia's workplaces, (2) we are positive and proactive about Australia's retirement policies and (3) we are positive and proactive about our financial management.                               Let me turn to the first of the reasons why we are being positive and proactive about Australia's workplaces - 5.1 per cent unemployment, 320,000 apprentices and trainees coming online, a 29 per cent corporate tax, 150,000 community workers getting a long overdue pay rise, an $18,000 tax-free threshold from 1 July and safe rates on our roads.                                                                    Mr SHORTEN:                    We should be so lucky. When we look at the negative, though, the threats to this in Better Workplaces, the opposition have got an industrial relations program and a witness protection policy - an industrial relations policy and witness protection.                                                                    Mr SHORTEN:                    They are certainly against giving 150,000 community workers a pay rise. They do not support a corporate tax rate of 29 per cent.                                                                    Mr SHORTEN:                    So they certainly do not have a view about Australian workplaces. A second way we are doing it is through better retirement policies. We are the only party who want to increase superannuation from nine to 12 per cent. We certainly want to spread the prosperity of the mining boom so that all Australians do not retire poor. Yet, we have got an opposition who will not support abolishing the tax on superannuation for low-income people on $37,000. They will not support increasing superannuation from nine to 12 per cent. But the biggest reason we are a proactive and positive government is that we are moving to surplus. We are engaging in the fastest fiscal consolidation. Those opposite cannot afford to be positive. They have 70 billion reasons why they cannot be positive. The member for Moncrieff let the cat out of the bag. He said last night on Sky News:                              I don't think I'm letting the cat out of the bag when I say people feel that we are not being proactive enough in terms of outlining the policies that we would bring into government.                                                                    Mr SHORTEN:                    The problem for the member for Moncrieff is that he cannot be optimistic -                                                 The member for Moncrieff then left the chamber.                                                                    Mr SHORTEN:                    To put it simply, those opposite cannot flick the switch from negative to positive because the switch that they would have to use costs $70 billion.               </DOC>

  I thank the member for Moreton for his question because the government is getting on with implementing very important reforms, including our clean energy future package. Let's go back to the basics with this. The science is clearly telling us that we need to cut greenhouse gas emissions. Other countries are moving to cut their greenhouse gas emissions. It has been agreed internationally that a new treaty will come into place from 2020 to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and this country must be part of that effort. In the meantime, 90 countries have pledged to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions.                              This government is getting on with an environmental and economic reform that this country needs to make. As our package is introduced, working families, and pensioners in particular, will be looked after. The household assistance package will mean a number of things. In particular, it will mean that nine out of 10 households will receive tax cuts or increased payments, or both. Age pensions will increase by $338 a year for a single pensioner and $510 a year for a pensioner couple. There will be advance payments for pensioners and many others. A single pensioner, for example, will receive $250 in an up-front payment in May-June of this year. Many self-funded retirees will receive assistance equal to the extra payments that the government will provide to other pensioners, part-pensioners and carers. Over four million households will receive 20 per cent more than the expected price impact flowing from the introduction of a carbon price on their household type. The tax cuts will be delivered by a trebling of the tax-free threshold, in itself a very important reform and one that will assist many small business people who are not incorporated. The change to the tax-free threshold will also free up to one million people from having to lodge a tax return. That in itself is a huge reform of the taxation system.                              With other wider government measures, small businesses will be supported by a cut in the company tax rate to 29 per cent, by the instant asset write-off of up to $6,500 per asset that is acquired, and by many other measures that will support businesses and households achieve changes under the clean energy package. This government is getting on with important reform, tackling climate change and supporting households at the same time. This is Labor. We do the tough economic and environmental reforms and at the same time we look after social equity. The opposition do not.              </DOC>

  To the Deputy Leader of the Opposition let me say, as I said to the earlier questions, 'Don't believe everything you read.'

  To the Leader of the Opposition I say the government has a very different view about the future of the nation. First, our nation has been debating the impact of climate change and the need for a price on carbon for the better part of a decade. Indeed, the former Howard government developed a plan for an emissions trading scheme which, had the former Howard government been elected in 2007, it would have legislated for to commence by now. If the former Howard government had been re-elected in 2007, under the platform the Leader of the Opposition took to that election as a senior minister, there would be a carbon price in place by now.                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    So any claim that this has been hurried in development of course does not stand the test of looking at that history.                              In terms of the impact of carbon pricing, we know that the most efficient way of cutting carbon pollution is to put a price on carbon. That is what the legislation does. We know that it will cut the amount of carbon pollution -                                                                     Ms GILLARD:                    I am answering the claim that the scheme is badly designed by explaining why the scheme is well designed and will achieve its purpose. A price on carbon will cut carbon pollution at the least possible cost to the economy. A price on carbon will reduce the amount of carbon pollution that is in the atmosphere by 160 million tonnes in 2020. A price on carbon will enable us to increase pensions, to increase family payments and to triple the tax-free threshold. What that means is that there will be better rewards for people to going to work, particularly second income earners who are perhaps making a choice to return to work part-time - overwhelmingly women. What this means is we will see our economy transform to a cleaner energy future whilst Australian families are supported. Millions of families will actually come out better off as a result of putting a price on carbon and seeing a pension increase of family payments or a tax cut.                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    This is therefore a well-designed - indeed, the best designed - scheme.                              It is a sharp contrast to the scheme advocated for by the Leader of the Opposition, which of course is the most efficient way to do it, would impose huge costs on Australian businesses and would require Australian -                                                                     Ms GILLARD:                    families to stump up a payment of $1,300 per year each, having lost their tax cuts, family payment increases and pension increases. We stand by seizing a clean energy future. The Leader of the Opposition knows nothing except scare campaigns.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for her question. The most important thing we can do for working families is to make sure that anyone who goes to work comes home that night or at the end of their work, which is why it was a very great privilege for me to meet today with the families of truck drivers, the families of people who know what it is like to lose someone in a road accident - not just someone who works in the truck-driving industry but the people who have been killed in accidents because of lack of safety by big trucks on our road. There would not be too many Australians who do not know what it feels like to be on a major highway and be concerned about their safety as a big truck comes in the vicinity of their car.                              We can do better than that. We know that so much of that conduct that we see on our roads is driven by the structure of the industry - the inability of drivers to get safe rates and an incentive system that encourages them to drive faster and longer, beyond the limits of human endurance and beyond the limits of fatigue. That is something that, for those drivers, we need to understand under the current industry system, but it is something we can change. We can change it by having safe rates in the truck-driving industry, and we intend to do so. We have brought legislation to the parliament to achieve just that.                              Working families want to see their loved ones come home. Another great desire of working families is that their children have a better opportunity in life than they did. Most working families aspire more than anything else to see their children enjoy a level of success in their lives beyond what they themselves were able to achieve. That is why we are so passionate about investing in education - it is so important to the future of our economy. We cannot make the happy assumption we will be the high-skilled, high-wage economy in our region. Unless we invest in education, others will win the education race and, as a result, win the economic race too.                              We are investing in education, and it is making a real difference. So I am very pleased and proud to report to the House today the fact that student numbers in universities have increased by 27 per cent since we came to office. That is over 150,000 more students going to university as a result of our special incentives. Many of them come from poorer households and are the first in their family to step inside a university.                              Many of us of my generation know our lives were transformed by getting access to higher education and that we would not have done so if it had not been for the Whitlam reforms. I am very pleased to be able to report to the House today there is another generation getting access to the opportunity because of the reforms of this Labor government.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for his question. It is very similar to one that I have answered in the past in relation to Qantas when it made some announcements and the answer is the same. Virgin Australia will not face any carbon price on its international operations in Australia. There will be a modest impact from the carbon price on its domestic operations. The nature of the impact is comparable to what has been announced by Qantas and I remind the House of those Qantas figures. I understand that the opposition is trying to yell at this point because they know they do not want these figures on the public record because they bring the scare campaign to an end.                              It has been announced by Qantas that for zones of 900 kilometres or less, we are talking about $1.50 in impact, and so it goes on. If it is less than 2,000 kilometres, $3 on the average ticket price. That has been modelled in to the CPI impact of putting a price on carbon to 0.7 per cent. We have responded to that by increasing family payments, increasing pensions and cutting tax. To give the House the figures for that - and I know the opposition will not be interested in benefits to working families - there will be pensioners who end up in front as a result of the amount of money that comes to them in the increase in their pension. They will end up better off. We want to see pensioners better off; I understand the opposition does not.                              There will be family payments increases in order to assist people with children - once again, a benefit to working families - and there will be tax cuts for Australians who earn less than $80,000 a year. Many of them will see a tax cut -                                                                     Ms GILLARD:                    Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I am directly on the substance of the question because in order to view these claims in context one needs to direct their eyes as well to the amount of money that is flowing to families. I know the opposition always want to forget that because they have pledged to rip that money away. They do not want people looking at what is coming through tax cuts and pension increases and money for families because they have pledged to rip it away. The reality is the impact on airlines that the member has raised is modelled into the price impacts and people are receiving compensation in the form of tax cuts, family payments increases and pension increases. No amount of fear campaigning by the opposition changes that fact. I just wish they would be honest about ripping those benefits away and charging working families $1,300 per family in order to pay for their scheme.               </DOC>

  I thank the member for Capricornia for that important question because today's capital investment figures are a resounding vote of confidence in our economy and a reminder of the strength of our economic fundamentals. It is remarkable that these could be achieved given the global instability that we face.                              Planned business investment is going from strength to strength. Total capital expenditure is expected to increase from a staggering $164 billion this financial year to a record $173 billion next financial year. That is an extraordinary amount of strength in our economy and an extraordinary amount of money to be spreading across our economy. We are going to see some lumpiness in this investment, as we have seen in the December quarter figures, as different projects cease and others begin. But it is a huge investment pipeline which is gearing up and it is providing a bedrock of support for our economy, for economic growth and for jobs.                              It is not all just about mining because we know that the growth of middle classes in Asia is going to bring demand for a whole range of goods and services elsewhere in our economy. We also understand that parts of our economy are not as strong as others and that is why, if we are going to meet the challenges of the future, we do need to spread the opportunities of this mining boom across the whole of our economy, not have it concentrated in a few regions in this country. That is why putting in place the MRRT, getting a source of revenue so that we can spread the opportunities of the boom right across the economy, is what our economic circumstances demand. And that is why we are using the revenue stream from the MRRT to give a significant tax cut to 2.7 million small businesses right across the country; to substantially increase the superannuation savings of Australian workers, particularly those on low incomes; and to make sure that we have some money to invest in critical infrastructure, particularly in the mining regions, which are having their quality of life severely impacted by mining in nearby communities.                              When it comes to these tax breaks for small business, the boost to superannuation for Australian workers, the investment in infrastructure, those on the other side of the House want to rip it all away. They do not understand the challenges of dealing with mining boom mark 2. They would rather give a tax cut to Gina Rinehart and Clive Palmer than give a tax cut to 2.7 million small businesses right across our great country. They would rather side with those vested interests than side with Australian workers.              </DOC>

  In answer to the member's question: as the member would probably be aware, there is greenhouse gas reporting legislation which dates from the period of the Howard government, and so people can get on the website and have a look at that information. As I have made the point before, that information is of course not directly comparable to how carbon pricing will work, because, under the legislation that was in this parliament - and I am presuming that the opposition looked at it before they voted against it and voted to endorse their shambolic scheme, so they would be aware of this - the carbon price liability falls on sites that generate carbon pollution in excess of 25,000 tonnes. We have had these debates in the parliament before, because of course there was a period of time when the Leader of the Opposition was saying you could not measure carbon pollution.                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    I am explaining to the House -                                                                     Ms GILLARD:                    I am explaining to the House the mechanisms under the carbon pollution legislation, our clean energy future legislation that went through the parliament, and the identification of which sites and businesses will pay a carbon price. When the legislation comes into operation on 1 July, businesses will commence paying that price. There is the ability to measure, as has been shown by past legislation. What should strike the opposition at this point, as they talk about these matters, is that the legislation to first track carbon pollution emissions was introduced by the Howard government. It was described then - and I quote the member for Wentworth when he introduced it -                                                                     Ms GILLARD:                    I am responding to the question in regard to the measuring of carbon emissions and I am referring to the member for Wentworth's statement, on the legislation I have referred to, that, 'This bill is the first major step in establishing the Australian emissions trading scheme' - a time when they believed in carbon pricing; political hypocrisy from them now.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for his very good question, because this government has an impressive record of tax reform. The first reform recommended by the tax review was for a resource rent tax, which has now passed this House and is up in the Senate. It is a very important tax because it gives us a revenue stream which enables us to implement some of the other recommendations of the tax review, including a very substantial tax cut for small business.                              The member asked what the future for tax reform is in terms of all of those measures that we have already implemented that have been recommended by Henry. We had a very good forum in this parliament at the end of last year. And when it comes to business taxation, for example, we currently have a business taxation reform group which is working on a number of issues, which I am sure all members will be very interested in because we need to take into account the patchwork nature of our economy and that there are some businesses out there doing it tough, particularly when it comes to the non-resource sector.                              I expect to receive that report from that group sometime in the next month or so. In the context of that, the government will be considering a range of measures for possible inclusion in a future budget and responding to the agenda that has been put down by the members. So we are working our way through a range of issues. I take the motion seriously. We have a substantial record of tax reform, both personal tax and business tax, and we do intend to progress that over the months ahead.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Chifley very much for that question. He knows how important it is that this government keep working and keep delivering for Australian families, first and foremost doing everything to get families into jobs and, of course, delivering the support that families need with their most important job - that is, looking after their children.                              One of the things that this government is very, very proud of is the implementation of the nation's first Paid Parental Leave Scheme. We have delivered that scheme. We now have 140,000 families who have registered for the scheme. Eighty thousand of those families have already taken their paid parental leave. What that has meant for those families is that they have not had to make the difficult choice that they had to make in the past when those opposite were in government, the very difficult choice of whether they would stay at home with their baby or go out to work. As a result of this government's efforts, families are now able to stay at home with their newborn babies, and we all know how important that is for the baby and of course for the parents. Many Australian families have written to the Prime Minister indicating how important this has been for them and their children, and we do understand how important it was for the government to do it - without whacking a great big new tax on business to pay for it.                              We know from this Leader of the Opposition that he wants a Rolls-Royce scheme, but we have also had confirmed by the member for Goldstein just yesterday that they are going to whack a great big new tax on business to pay for the Leader of the Opposition's Rolls-Royce scheme. There are many people in the opposition who are now calling on the Leader of the Opposition -                                                                     Ms MACKLIN:                    He is even calling the member for Goldstein a faceless man! Over here we have the member for Goldstein, a faceless man -                                                                     Ms MACKLIN:                    who wants to introduce a new tax -                                                                     Ms MACKLIN:                    on everything.                                                                    Ms MACKLIN:                    The specifics of the question go to the benefits for families of paid parental leave, which this government is delivering. As the member for Goldstein has indicated, every single family will pay more under the opposition's great big new tax to deliver their Rolls-Royce scheme of paid parental leave.              </DOC>

  I would like to thank the member for Blair for his question and I can assure him that the government is indeed getting things done to improve our workplaces. There are some well-known facts about how we are improving our workplaces. We are lifting superannuation from nine to 12 per cent, and in fact there will be 43,500 people in the member for Blair's own electorate who will have better retirement savings courtesy of the people on this side of the House. Not only are we doing that; we are going to lower the corporate tax rate to 29 per cent; we have got the Fair Work Act, which puts fairness back into Australian workplaces; we have got the NBN, which is going to improve productivity; and we have got more people than ever working in Australia's history.                               What is lesser known in terms of our attempts to improve the workplace is what we are actually doing to make workplaces safer. Members of the House would probably know that nearly 300 people are killed each year in Australian workplaces, over 2,000 die from industrial related diseases and 640,000 Australians suffer workplace injury or illness. This costs Australia $60 billion. But this government is determined to improve one workplace in particular at the moment, and that is Australia's roads.                               Let us never forget in this place that, even as we and our families drive on the roads to go home or to go on holiday, every time a truck passes it is a workplace. And let us not forget in this place that 277 people last year were killed in truck related collisions and accidents. Let us not forget in this place that 1,000 people get seriously injured each year in truck related accidents. This is a terrible toll. We were joined briefly in the gallery before by Suzanne de Beer and Lystra Tagliaferri. These two ladies happen to be widows. Their husbands were killed in a truck related collision in Western Australia at the end of 2010. Indeed, what we want to do is make sure that the roads of Australia are not generating more widows. That is why this side of the House is putting up safe rates legislation, because we believe in safe roads. We understand the cost of $2.7 billion due to not having proper, safe rates in Australia. That is actually only the second-most important issue. What is most important is the fact that some people go to work and do not come home at the end of their shift that night. We know this is because of speeding. We know it is because of the pressure put on drivers to meet their deadlines. The safe rates bill will create safe roads. We can have the safest roads in the world. More than 30 years ago this nation introduced seatbelts, and we have seen the improvement that made. This House should unite on making sure that we do something to decrease the road toll caused by trucks. Perhaps for once I could ask those opposite - and I believe they are sincere about this issue - to let's do something that will not only help those widows but also ensure that others do not become widows as well; let's make sure all our families -                </DOC>

  I refer to what I just said in my last answer. The Leader of the Opposition made a false claim yesterday. I have read the statement made by Bob Carr yesterday indicating that that was a false claim.                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    As I have said publicly, I am the only person who can make offers in relation to ministries. On the false claim made by the Leader of the Opposition yesterday, I refer to Bob Carr's statement yesterday - though I am not surprised that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is a believer in conspiracy theories in relation to this matter; after all, she had the humiliation of the Leader of the Opposition saying about the member for Kooyong that it is nice to have someone in the parliamentary party who understands foreign affairs at last.                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    So I understand that she would be a conspiracy theorist, given that the Leader of the Opposition thinks the member for Kooyong should do her job.              </DOC>

  To the Leader of the Opposition's question, I say that we made a judgment about the price that was necessary to bring around a transformation in our economy to a clean energy future. It is true to say that the European price has been suppressed of late. I do not think there is any mystery about that, given the economic circumstances in Europe. If you looked at almost any indicator in the European economy you would see that it is depressed, because it is reflecting the economic turbulence that we have seen coming out of the sovereign debt crisis in Greece and more broadly. We determined that $23 a tonne was the appropriate price to get a transformation in our economy to a clean energy future. We obviously took the best possible advice too on the likely future of carbon pricing in Europe.                              I would say to the Leader of the Opposition that because we have chosen the most effective mechanism to get change in our economy the price is $23 per tonne. What we know from the work of Treasury is that, under the scheme that the Leader of the Opposition peddles, the effective price is $62 a tonne. We also know that with our $23-a-tonne price there is assistance for trade-exposed businesses, families and pensioners in the form of pension increases, tax cuts and family payment increases. In contrast, the Leader of the Opposition's plan comes with a bill for working families of $1,300 each. If you want to look at the most cost-effective way of transforming our economy so that we seize a clean energy future, it is the carbon pricing package this government brought to this parliament and which will be implemented on 1 July. If you want a wasteful scheme, endorse the Leader of the Opposition's.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Deakin for his question and I thank him for his advocacy in this parliament for the people of Deakin. He does a great job raising their concerns in this parliament. Amongst their concerns is the question: how will our nation fairly share the proceeds of the mining boom? Will we use those proceeds of this once-in-a-generation, indeed once-in-a-hundred-years, opportunity to enrich a few people or will we use the proceeds of the boom to help the many?                              As a Labor government, we have been very clear about our choices and the decisions we have made. We are determined that this resources boom benefits the many - that it benefits the many across Australia and that it sets our nation up for a prosperous future. That is why, determined to benefit the many, we have decided that there should be a tax cut for every company. The Leader of the Opposition wants less tax paid by wealthy miners. We say instead, during this resources boom, we should get a fairer share from wealthy miners and use that to benefit businesses around the nation, including, particularly, small businesses, because we understand around the nation and in electorates like Deakin there are many working people for whom the greatest aspiration is to run successfully their own small business.                              We have also determined to share the benefits for the many by doing what government needs to do to enable superannuation contributions to rise from nine per cent to 12 per cent. We have determined as well to build infrastructure, because the mining boom is hungry for infrastructure, and that makes a big difference for the communities that are yielding wealth for our nation. We want them to have the infrastructure that they need. In all of this, we have taken an approach driven by Labor values and very transparent. We have said to the Australian people, 'These are the things that we want to do,' and we have set about doing them piece by piece.                              This is a stark contrast to other approaches to politics in this place. We have, for example, said to the Australian people that we will as a government continue to take the tough decisions necessary to return the budget to surplus. They will be tough decisions, but they will be transparent decisions and everybody will be able to judge them on budget night. In contrast, the Leader of the Opposition has to slash and burn $70 billion in services for working families to even get to the starting line as to where the government is now preparing its budget. Since the parliament last sat, he has committed to keeping these cuts secret and hiding behind a commission of audit. Australians deserve to see a budget in surplus and they deserve to transparently know what it means for them and their families.               </DOC>

  I do thank the shadow Treasurer for that question. He is going to be a shadow Treasurer for a long time, because if he is going to be out there quoting bodgie modelling from the New South Wales Treasury he is not going to go very far.                                                                     Mr SWAN:                    I do not for any period of time give any credence to the assertions that have just been made by the shadow Treasurer. The fact is that the New South Wales government has been publishing all manner of modelling in recent times which is, as I just described, bodgie modelling. We have full faith, complete faith, in our modelling.                                                                     Mr SWAN:                    Our modelling is prepared by one of the most professional organisations in the world, the same people who used to prepare the modelling for those opposite when they were in government, and they had their confidence then just as they have our confidence now. But those opposite will go to no ends to actually go out and trash the reputation of the professional officers in the Department of Treasury here in Canberra for their political aims. That is all about talking our economy down and going out and exaggerating the impact of carbon pricing on our economy.                                                                     Mr SWAN:                    Yes.                                                                     Mr SWAN:                    Mr Speaker, there is not a hole in the modelling. That is the first point to be made, and we should not accept the assertions from the shadow Treasurer. The government has full faith in the federal Treasury modelling, the same people who worked for those opposite over many years and received their support over those years. They are entitled to receive it now. They are entitled to receive that because they are professional.                               We have put in place a scheme which reduces carbon pollution, a clean energy package, which of course is welcomed in part by the New South Wales government. We had the Premier of New South Wales stand up with the Prime Minister only last week endorsing our Clean Energy Finance Corporation, endorsing a very important part of the package. So the New South Wales government cannot have it both ways. They cannot on the one hand endorse this $10 billion commitment and on the other shovel out bodgie modelling to discredit what is a first-class scheme which will reduce carbon pollution in our economy and make sure that we are a first-world economy predominantly driven by clean energy.               </DOC>

  I thank the member for Petrie very much for her question but also for the hard work she does in her electorate for all the families and pensioners that she cares so much about. This government is managing the economy and doing it in the interests of Australian families and pensioners.                               Of course, it is this government that delivered Australia's first paid parental leave scheme, which is now delivering to around 150,000 families, and those 150,000 families no longer have to make the difficult choice between staying at home to look after their newborn baby or going back to work. It is also this government that is delivering to those families who have older teenagers staying on at school. We know that that places an added financial burden on families, so this government has delivered up to $4,200 extra a year for those families, never delivered by those opposite. It is this government that is also delivering tax cuts, making sure that families get more money in their take-home pay. It is also the case that it is this government, on our watch, that has seen interest rates go down. A family with a $300,000 mortgage is now paying around $3,000 a year less than they were paying when the Liberals opposite were still in government.                               We know how important it is to manage the economy, to deliver for families, to deliver for pensioners. When this Leader of the Opposition was in cabinet he said no to a pension rise. This Leader of the Opposition said that paid parental leave would happen over his dead body.                                                                     Ms MACKLIN:                    Mr Speaker, this government does understand how important it is to deliver for families and for pensioners. That is why we have delivered a historic increase to the pension - $150 a fortnight higher than when those opposite were in government. One-hundred and fifty dollars a fortnight is what this government has put into the pockets of pensioners, and all this Leader of the Opposition wants to do is claw it out of them.               </DOC>

  To the member for Indi on the specifics of the business she refers to, of course I am very happy, and I am sure that Minister Combet is very happy, to make contact with this business if she wants to forward us the details. I or Minister Combet would be very happy to have a discussion about the circumstances of this business. As I travel and talk to people I find that, because of the reckless fear campaigning we have seen on carbon pricing from the opposition, many people are finding it difficult to work out exactly what it does mean for them, and I think that it is very important that people have the facts.                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    On the circumstances of small businesses - and I presume the business the member for Indi refers to is a small business - we do want to make sure that small business prospers and thrives in this country. That is why we are committed through the Minerals Resource Rent Tax to giving small businesses a tax cut, giving them a company tax cut early and giving them an instant asset write-off of $6,500 so that they can do investments in their business. This is very valuable to small business, but to do it you need to make sure that you are managing the budget properly and, as well, you need to be passing the Minerals Resource Rent Tax.                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    I have assumed that the question is motivated by a genuine concern about a small business and, in making that assumption about the motivation of the question, I would have thought people would be interested in benefits for small businesses, benefits that will flow from 1 July this year. If people are not interested in those benefits for small businesses then I do really wonder about their motivations. People who care about small business would care about delivering a tax cut to small business. People who care about small business would be interested in delivering an instant asset write-off benefit for small business. On this side of the parliament we care about small business, and that is precisely why we are delivering those benefits and why we are prepared to say that in the resources boom we have now we should be sharing the benefits with the many, not the few. I understand that the member for Indi and the Liberal and National parties would prefer to benefit a few billionaires, but that is not our approach.                              We also want to make sure that the voice of small business is heard at the cabinet table, so I have taken the opportunity of the recent change in ministerial arrangements to make sure that the small business voice is directly at the cabinet table. We will continue to work with small businesses for a prosperous future. I presume we will continue to see fear campaigning and denial of benefits from those opposite.              </DOC>

  I want to thank the member for New England for that question. I know that he has a terrific commitment to the health of his constituents and I have very much enjoyed visiting the Manilla Multi-Purpose Service with him at its opening last week and, indeed, stopping in and looking at the new cancer centre as it is being constructed in Tamworth in his electorate. I know also that the members for Lyne and Denison have, with the member for New England, been supporting the Cancer Council campaign for an expansion of the Bowel Cancer Screening Program. Of course I am not able to comment on what may or may not be in the budget but I do want to say that the members are -                                                                     Ms PLIBERSEK:                    You could have asked this question had you been bothered, but you can never be bothered to ask a question about health.                                                                    Ms PLIBERSEK:                    You can never be bothered to ask a question about health.                                                                  The member for Dickson then left the chamber.                                                                                    Ms PLIBERSEK:                    I want to agree with the member for New England about the importance of bowel cancer screening. He is right in indicating that this is the second most common cause of cancer deaths. Indeed, it is a serious issue. That is why we have committed to ongoing funding for screening for 50-, 55- and 65-year-olds, which will see almost 3.7 million people offered screening over the next four years. It is very important to say that this national screening program, terrific as it is and important as it is in detecting cancers early, when they are much more treatable, is not a replacement for regular contact with a person's GP. People who are outside those screening ages can talk to their GP and can have that test if it is clinically indicated. People are also able to buy a testing kit from a pharmacist for $37. Included in that $37 screening kit is the test itself, the pathology, and also notification to the patient and to their nominated doctor about the results of that test. Thank you for the question. I take it in the spirit in which it was intended - a very worthwhile raising of a very important issue.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Fremantle for that very important question because the government is determined to spread the benefits of the mining boom to every corner of the country and to every postcode in the country. We had the national accounts out for the September quarter last week. Our economy grew by 0.4 per cent in the quarter to be 2.3 per cent over the year. This was a strong result, a very solid result in very difficult global circumstances. What this means is that our economy has now grown more than seven per cent since the start of the global financial crisis, while something like three out of seven major advanced economies have not even got back to where they were. This is because we acted to avoid recession in this country, and because we did that we now have something like 700,000 more people in employment in Australia - something that everyone on this side of the House is really proud of.                               We also understand that not everybody is doing well in this mining boom, which is why we are so determined to ensure the benefits of the mining boom are spread more fairly across our community. We have introduced the MRRT - which is going to be in the Senate in the next few weeks, opposed by those opposite - so that we can fund really important reforms particularly for small business. We are giving a tax break to 2.7 million small businesses; something like 18,200 of those are in the electorate of Fremantle. We are providing a historic boost to superannuation savings for something like 8.4 million workers and 48,000 of those workers are in the electorate of Fremantle. Also we are investing in infrastructure in mining regions.                               Those on the other side of the House are determined to block these very important initiatives which are supporting our economy. Why are they doing that? To give a tax cut to Gina Rinehart and Clive Palmer. We know where their bread is buttered. They are on the side of the vested interests.                               Because our economy is returning to trend growth, it is also important that we return the budget to surplus. We on this side of the House are determined to return the budget to surplus. We know that those on that side of the House are running away from their surplus commitment because they have a $70 billion crater in their budget bottom line. This is what the shadow Treasurer had to say today at a doorstop when he was asked a question about surplus. He said:                              Based on what we know now, we are doing all the costings. All our policies are costed.                                                                    Mr SWAN:                    He then went on to say:                              We have found the savings we were looking for.              </DOC>

  In answer to the member's question, first and foremost he has just insulted every worker at Alcoa by coming into this parliament and pretending that the pressure on Alcoa is about the carbon price, when he and other members of this House well know that the circumstances putting pressure on Alcoa are about international pricing. That has been made by clear by the business. It is a direct insult to those working people to use them as political playthings and to think it appropriate to come into this parliament and misrepresent the circumstances impacting upon their jobs. What an insult to those working people. What a disgrace.                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    We look after working people because that is what drives us. Over there, they are highly motivated -                                                                     Ms GILLARD:                    We will look after working people. Over there, they are motivated by vested interests. What we will do is work with the community of Geelong. In asking this question, the member fundamentally misunderstands the outlook of the council there, many leading lights in the business community there and many leading lights from the football club there and from other organisations that are so important to the spirit and the cement that binds people together in Geelong. They are taking a very proactive approach to managing their city and their region to a clean energy future. They in fact did not wait for government to legislate a carbon price. They got started. They brought people together to work out how they could seize the benefits of a clean energy future, something that the member for Corangamite and the member for Corio both know well. They have been involved in the discussions about that.

Ms GILLARD:                    In this parliament, they are once again insulting the people of Geelong. We will not insult the people of Geelong and that region by misrepresenting what is happening with their jobs. We will not insult them by misrepresenting their ability to respond to change. We will not insult them. Those in that region know what it is like to respond to change and come up trumps. We will provide benefits to working people in Geelong through tax cuts and family payment increases. We will provide the pensioners of Geelong with pension increases. What the member who asked the question would prefer to do is to take all of those increases and tax cuts back and then send a bill for $1,300 to every family in Geelong and then not tell them the truth about what is happening with their jobs. What a disgrace; what an insult.              </DOC>

  Thank you, Mr Speaker. I thank the member for Bass for his question. I acknowledge his commitment to ensuring that we have a government that will deliver in the best interests of working people. The member asked a question about taxation reform and how the benefits of those reforms have been delivered to working Australians. This is a government that has a proud record of reform when it comes to taxation. In the time that we have been in office we have delivered $47 billion worth of personal income tax cuts. That means we are putting more money in the pockets of working people. For an individual on an income of $50,000 a year, these tax cuts mean that each week they are now paying $33 less in tax. That means more money for them to invest in their cost-of-living expenses to ensure that they can provide for their families.                              As a government, we have managed to keep overall levels of taxation lower as a percentage of GDP than the levels they were at when we came into office. We have done this at the same time as delivering record investments in education, health and infrastructure. But there are many more things that we can do when it comes to taxation. The member for Bass asked what can be done. This is a government that is committed to delivering a mining tax that will spread the benefits of the resources boom to ensure that all Australians, regardless of where they live, will be able to obtain the benefits of this resources boom.                              We on this side of the chamber want to give a tax cut to small business. Those opposite simply say no. We on this side of the chamber want to ensure that working Australians get an increase in their superannuation so that they can retire with a decent standard of living. They say no.                                                                    Mr BRADBURY:                    We on this side of the chamber want to ensure that there is investment in infrastructure to make sure that we have a productive economy for the future. But once again they say no.                                                                  The member for Dunkley then left the chamber.                                                                                    Mr BRADBURY:                    But when it comes to the question of repealing a mining tax and delivering a big fat tax cut to a handful of the wealthiest miners, those on the other side are tripping over each other to say yes.                              The member for Bass also asked the question about transparency in relation to plans and commitments. We heard today the member for North Sydney indicate that they have done the hard work and worked out where the cuts are. The only thing that they have not done is told the Australian people.

  I thank the member for Fadden for his question. It gives me an opportunity to deal with this matter at question time rather than by way of personal explanation.                              Let me say, Mr Speaker, that when I saw the article by Major General Cantwell I was surprised, I was disappointed and I was saddened by his contribution. I did not believe that it was either an accurate or fair depiction of either that trip or of my commitment to Australian forces in the field. So I repeat: I was disappointed, surprised and saddened by that contribution.                              I have made four trips to Afghanistan. These things have never been said in any other context other than the contribution by Major General Cantwell over the weekend. I reject absolutely any criticism or questioning of my commitment to our forces in the field.                                                                    Mr STEPHEN SMITH:                    There is no evidence to the contrary.                              There are words and there are actions. The ultimate test of a commitment to our forces in the field is what a minister and what a government do so far as providing the kit and resources required to carry out the job. In Afghanistan our forces have not been left wanting by me or the government so far as resources and kit is concerned, whether it has been upgraded Bushmasters or more Bushmasters; whether it has been better and more powerful rifles; whether it has been the work that we do in anti-IED or roadside bomb protections, including the work we are now doing together with the Canadians for trucks with ground based radar to detect the IEDs.                              Let us be frank about where this has come from. This has come because I absolutely refuse -                                                                     Mr STEPHEN SMITH:                    Let us be under no doubt as to why this question has come and the context. I make no apology for standing up for an 18-year-old member of the ADF when she was vulnerable and in distress. I make no apology for making very strongly the point in principle that it is wrong to bring into play the conduct of the innocent victim of an alleged sexual assault.                                                                    Mr STEPHEN SMITH:                    I will conclude my answer where I started: I was surprised, disappointed and saddened by Major General Cantwell's contribution. I believed it was a wrong and unfair depiction of my visit to Afghanistan and my commitment to our forces in the field. My commitment to our forces in the field will not be trampled upon. It is there for all to see.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Reid for his question. This month the federal and New South Wales governments received the most comprehensive independent study ever done into Sydney's and, therefore, Australia's aviation needs. The report makes it clear that Sydney needs a second airport sooner rather than later. Passenger numbers in the Sydney region will more than double up to 2035. Sydney airport is increasingly at capacity and its peak period is growing. Its size and land transport problems mean that the airport cannot deal with these increases. The need to act is clear. By the year 2035, the cost to GDP of turning away flights will be $6 billion. This is an issue about jobs and our economy.                              International experience shows that airports create 1,000 jobs for every one million passengers. Without action, growing congestion will hurt productivity as flights are turned away and those that make it face longer delays. We are already seeing the impact on Sydney. Because Sydney is the hub, a delay in Sydney delays the entire national aviation system. We know that four out of 10 flights nationally fly into and out of Sydney. Despite the speed of modern aircraft, airlines today schedule up to 25 minutes extra for Sydney to Melbourne flights than they did in 1965. Think about that. In 1965 they scheduled 65 minutes to go from Sydney to Melbourne. Today, in spite of all the technological improvements, it is 90 minutes. That has an impact on our productivity. It is a handbrake on our growth. And the delays will get worse because Sydney is a hub. A delay in Sydney has knock-on effects across the network. That is why it is a national issue and why it needs to be a bipartisan issue.                              The Daily Telegraph captured this point in today's editorial, which was appropriately titled 'If it's built the jobs will follow'. The editorial said that a second Sydney airport:                              _ would bring employment to a new generation of engineers and airline staff. It would deliver jobs across almost every area of commerce. It would help maintain Sydney's prominence as a hub for business.                              This is a critical issue. It is hard. The politics of it are tough. But we need to deal with this sooner rather than later, because it will have a huge impact. I thank those people across the chamber who have entered into a constructive discussion - and I know are entering also into discussions with their New South Wales colleagues - about the importance of us making a decision and moving forward on this vital issue for the national economy.              </DOC>

  That is effectively the same question as the previous two. Let me make these points. Firstly, out of regard for the contribution that Major General Cantwell has made, and his circumstances, I am not proposing to enter into a piece-by-piece running commentary on his contribution. I make that point firstly.                              Secondly, I say again to the House, as I have said outside the House: I was surprised, disappointed and saddened by his contribution. His contribution was neither a fair nor a correct depiction of my trip or of my commitment to our forces in the field.                                                                    Mr STEPHEN SMITH:                    I simply make the point that I was happy to receive the questions. They have been cause for me not to need to take an opportunity after question time to make the point that I have been misrepresented. I simply make the point, as well, that the article also referred to my colleague the former Minister for Defence, Mr Fitzgibbon. He has been quite clear about the accuracy so far as the material is concerned with respect to him.              </DOC>

  Mr Speaker, I am very happy to answer the Deputy Leader of the Opposition's question. I have made the point over very many years, both as a frontbencher in opposition and as a minister in government, that the question of allocation of portfolios is entirely a matter for the Prime Minister of the day. When the Prime Minister indicated to me after the 2010 election that she wanted the former Prime Minister, Mr Rudd, to be the Minister for Foreign Affairs, I asked her if I could serve in Defence and I was greatly honoured when she said I could.                               I have made the point repeatedly that I am very happy doing this job. It is a very important job in our national security space. In the most recent reshuffle, I said consistently from day one until the Prime Minister made her announcement that these were entirely matters for her. Indeed, I said to a number of people in the course of that week that I had been around long enough to work by the old adage that you never quite know what a reshuffle is going to look like until you see the Prime Minister's press release.                               I am very happy doing the important job in the national security space that I do. I am very happy making our contribution and our commitment not just to our forces in the field in Afghanistan but to our national security interests, whether that be peacekeeping in Timor-Leste, peacekeeping in the Solomon Islands, peacekeeping throughout the United Nations or the work that we do in our region, in the growing Asia-Pacific area.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Canberra for her question and acknowledge her long association with small business. Indeed, she was a small business person herself before coming to this place. The government made a very important decision when confronted by the global financial crisis. It made a decision to stimulate the economy by investing in education and housing, providing accommodation for many and some great benefits for students across the land. But the other beneficiaries of that decision were the working people of this country, including those in small businesses. Every member of this place would know that in their own electorate many employees of small businesses worked on those stimulus packages to build, maintain and construct those fantastic pieces of infrastructure. It was a very important decision to make. It allowed us, when private capital was contracting, to invest to ensure that small businesses in this country survived and thrived, and many did exactly that.                              We want to continue to ensure there are conditions for small businesses in this country to do well and to succeed because, as we know, small business is the engine room of our economy. It employs 4.7 million Australians. It is over 20 per cent of the GDP. It is a very important sector of our economy indeed. For that reason, when we seek to enact the minerals resource rent tax initiative we do so so that we can create the environment in which small businesses can thrive and we do so to ensure that they get a tax break, because they deserve one. That is why we are looking to ensure that those businesses have a $6,500 instant asset tax write-off so that they have cash flow, particularly businesses that are in their infancy. Everybody knows that it is absolutely critical that there is cash flow when you are starting up a business or when you have a small business. Whether it be a sole proprietor, a microbusiness or small business in general, these decisions by government are absolutely critical for our economy. That is why it is very disappointing that those on that side who pretend they are the party of small business will not support it.                                                                    Mr BRENDAN O'CONNOR:                    Indeed, Mr Speaker. I am asked about small business. It would be absolutely disappointing, a crying shame, if we did not allow the mining tax to be enacted to ensure that millions of small businesses in this country get a tax break, because that is what they deserve. We on this side will do that. Those opposite pretend to be the party of small business, so they should get out of the way and let us pass that legislation.              </DOC>

  I would say to those workers and that business in my electorate, as I would say to workers and businesses around the nation: we need to act on climate change, we need to reduce carbon pollution and we should do that in the most efficient way possible because that is best for business and therefore for jobs. That is why the government has acted in the most efficient way possible, with a market mechanism - that is, we have taken the same approach that the Leader of the Opposition took when he went to the 2007 election under the leadership of John Howard.                              Since then of course the opposition has trashed Liberal Party tradition and repudiated any link with markets. That is why, as we stand here today, we are able to say the choice facing those workers in my electorate is whether or not the nation has a market based mechanism, whether we have a carbon price starting at $23 a tonne of carbon pollution, or whether we endorse the Leader of the Opposition's plan - an inefficient scheme which would have an effective price of $62 a tonne. I ask the Leader of the Opposition to contemplate how job destroying that approach of $62 a tonne would be. I say to the Leader of the Opposition, too, that I do hope when he had the conversation in my electorate with those workers he explained to them that his scheme relies on charging each of them, each family represented in that business, $1,300 a year. I hope he explained that as well. Perhaps, if he ever chooses to visit that place again, when he next goes he should say to them that he does not want them to get a company tax cut, that he is going to make sure in this parliament he votes against that business getting a tax cut, that he is going to exercise his choice in the parliament to stand up for billionaires -                                                                     Ms GILLARD:                    rather than the working people in that business.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for his question. Every time I have visited his electorate we have had the opportunity to talk to a wide range of people, whether they be SES volunteers or people who work for the local council or local ministers. But we have also spoken to a large number of businesspeople in his electorate. The member understands, as I understand and as the government understands, that right around the nation there are Australians working hard to build their own small businesses and that for many working people their highest aspiration is to own and operate their own small business. So I was very pleased today to be able to announce that the government will create a small business commissioner.                               Small businesses, unlike bigger businesses, do not have the resources to engage with government. They find it more difficult to get the information that they need, because they simply do not have the time; they are so focused on their business. This Small Business Commissioner will be a one-stop shop for advice and information for small businesses and will be a persistent advocate within government for approaches that will be good for small business. It is a measure which stands alongside having a minister for small business at the cabinet table so that those 2.7 million small businesses around the nation which employ half of the Australians employed in our nation today and are worth a third of our economic activity can be represented in the way that they should be.                              I am also very pleased and proud to report to the House that we on this side of the parliament stand for a tax cut for small businesses and a tax cut for all businesses. We stand for reducing the company tax rate for small businesses on 1 July this year. We stand for ensuring that they can have an instant asset write-off of $6,500 so that they can buy new capital for their business and it can be tax effective for them. We stand too for making sure that they can buy motor vehicles for their business and have a $5,000 benefit.                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    It has become clear today that those on that side of the parliament stand against all of these measures. The Leader of the Opposition said today that he will vote against tax cuts for all businesses in this nation. It is heresy to what the Liberal Party has always believed in to vote against tax cuts for businesses.                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    I will summarise the choice. The choice is to share the mining boom and benefit business or to betray businesses and benefit billionaires. We know where the Leader of the Opposition stands: for the billionaires and for the betrayal of businesses and working people around our nation.               </DOC>

  To the member who asked the question: I understand that he is deeply embarrassed today because the coalition has marched away from Australian businesses - marched away from small businesses and marched away from Australian businesses.                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    They stand today for the betrayal of Australian businesses, and I suspect he is embarrassed by that.                              On the question that the member asked me: there is nothing that drives this government more than ensuring that Australian people have the benefits of work and the dignity of work. That is why we worked so hard during the global financial crisis, against the relentless negativity of the opposition, to support jobs. We did not want to see hundreds of thousands of Australians thrown on the scrap heap. We did not want to see young people who came of age during those economic circumstances losing the opportunity for an apprenticeship and a start in the world of work. So we supported jobs; the opposition did not. We continue to support jobs and the opposition does not. That is the track record in this parliament. That track record has been added to today by the betrayal by the opposition of businesses, because, as they betray businesses on this tax cut, they are betraying working people as well.                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    I am asked about jobs, Mr Speaker. Consequently I am responding to the important policies that the government has to support businesses, to support economic growth and to support jobs. The OECD says that, in terms of major tax bases, company income tax has the largest adverse effect on economic growth. If you are against cutting company tax, you are against economic growth. If you are against economic growth, then you are against jobs. And, if you are against economic growth and jobs, then you are also against increasing wages - those increasing wages which come with the benefits of economic growth.                              The KPMG modelling that was done at the time of the Henry tax review indicated that real wages would be around half a percentage point higher than otherwise in the long run with a one per cent company tax cut.                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    I was asked very broadly about jobs and I am saying that the government stands for jobs and it stands for high-skilled, high-wage jobs. In providing a one per cent company tax cut, what we will see, as has been modelled, is around $330 a year for an average employee as a wage rise. That is because of the benefits of extra economic growth. So what we have today is the government standing for jobs, and the opposition opposed to jobs; us standing for a reduction to company tax, and the opposition refusing to reduce company tax; and us standing up for small business as the opposition runs away from them.               </DOC>

  I thank the member for La Trobe for this very important question. As we saw last week, the Australian economy continues to grow, and this is despite the turbulence we have seen particularly in Europe. We do have a very big investment pipeline in this country. Capital expenditure figures that were out last week showed that business is planning to invest a staggering $164 billion this year, and that is set to increase to $173 billion next year, which is a 28 per cent increase on the estimate last year.                              Much of this investment is in resources. We understand that not everybody in our economy is in the fast lane of the resources boom and that there are many companies, particularly small businesses, that are not in that fast lane. That is why we must have the minerals resource rent tax and why we must use the stream of revenue from that tax to give some incentive and some extra lift, particularly to our struggling small businesses that are not in the fast lane of the mining boom. That is why we have brought this legislation out for public consultation and why we will be bringing this legislation to the House for passage through this House and through the Senate - because this will deliver a tax break for hundreds of thousands of small businesses in this country.                              What does the Leader of the Opposition have to say about all of this? He says no. He says: 'No, I can't support that. No way could I support that sort of sensible legislation.' Why does he say no? Why is he constantly saying no? Because he believes that Gina Rinehart and Clive Palmer should get a tax cut, not struggling Australian small businesses, so shame on the Leader of the Opposition.                                                                    Mr SWAN:                    The party of Menzies, supposedly the party of small business, is opposing in this House tax cuts to 2.7 million small businesses in terms of the instant asset write-off and this very important legislation which will come to the House. So I challenge all of those opposite to support this legislation in the House because it is vital to economic growth in this country. That is why we on this side of the House are so committed to tax reform which taxes the superprofits of the most profitable companies in the country and spreads it to every postcode across the country. That is what it does as -                                                                   The member for                   Canning                   then left the chamber.                                                                                                      Mr SWAN:                    It is a very important issue because the Leader of the Opposition wants to write an 11-figure cheque to Gina Rinehart and others like her. That is why this is such an important element of public policy. We on this side of the House want to spread the opportunity right around our country.                                                                  The member for                   Sturt                   then left the chamber.                              </DOC>

  I would like to thank the deputy opposition leader for her question and remind her that tens of thousands of people in her electorate are going to get more super if we get our laws through. In detail as to her specific question, Fair Work Australia is independent. It is independent and the investigation is independent. We have repeatedly said up hill and down dale that we will neither interfere in the investigation nor pre-empt the findings. The desire of the opposition to have us interfere -                                                                    -                                                                                     Mr SHORTEN:                    Indeed it has been confirmed by Fair Work Australia, at a Senate estimates committee, that there has been no political interference. Of course, agencies should always cooperate. Where this is possible and permitted by applicable legislation they should, and I have sought advice from my department about what in the Fair Work Act might impact upon Fair Work Australia's advice and the advice confirms that this is entirely a matter for the general manager to consider and weigh up in exercising her functions, because it is independent. Now where do her powers stem from? They stem from the current Fair Work Act.                                                                    Mr SHORTEN:                    Yes, that is right: it was our act. But we took into our act directly the sections which cover this matter -                                                                   The member for Mayo then left the chamber.                                                                                    Mr SHORTEN:                    So, having confirmed that Fair Work Australia is independent and that the investigation is independent, I have been asked about sections of the legislation. The sections of the legislation which govern this investigation are, of course, in the Fair Work Act. But what the House may not be aware of is that these parts of the Fair Work Act were taken exactly from the previous legislation, the Workplace Relations Act.                                                                  The member for M                  ackellar                   then left the chamber.                                                                                    Mr SHORTEN:                    So the sections which currently govern these actions were lifted from the Workplace Relations Act. What members of the House may not be aware of, when they complain about the sections of the act and about the government, is who actually introduced and drafted the sections which the general manager now functions under. Let me tell you, you do not have to look far to find out who drafted these sections. You do not need to be in a guessing game in 2002; it was Tony Abbott, the then minister for industrial relations.                                                                    Mr SHORTEN:                    In fact, what the Deputy Leader of the Opposition missed - I do not know why that is the case, but I am happy to help here - is section 583 of the Fair Work Act. Again, yes.                                                                    Mr SHORTEN:                    That is all they can yell out: 'No.'                                                                   The member for North Sydney then left the chamber.                                                                                    Mr SHORTEN:                    They do not like the truth when they are about to hear it, and they know what is coming, don't they - yes, they do. The president is not subject to direction on behalf of the Commonwealth.                                                                    Mr SHORTEN:                    They are your sections and, if you are not happy, you should have done something when you were in power.               </DOC>

  I thank the member for Melbourne for his question and understand that he is asking it on behalf of others who have raised this issue outside the House. The issue of euthanasia is clearly one where people have personal and deeply held views. Whenever the matter has come before the parliament it has been dealt with as a conscience vote, and I believe that that is appropriate. It is the sort of question on which community members from different walks of life will have different views. It is not something that breaks down, if you like, against the political spectrum. It is quite a different kind of issue than that.                               It is not the intention of the Australian government to bring to the parliament any legislation dealing with voluntary euthanasia. Of course, in the parliament, parliamentarians as individuals have their rights, and if someone wanted to bring such a proposition as a private member's bill, that is possible, but the Australian government has no intention of bringing such a bill to the parliament.                               We do have a very key focus on supporting people as they move towards the end of their life. One of the things that enliven the debate about euthanasia is people's fears and concerns about how they would be treated when they were at the end stage of life. I think many people in this parliament, through community links, through their own family, through having aged parents and relatives, have probably had to confront some of these questions in their own life. The quality of palliative care, the quality of care that we offer our older Australians, is very important to families, to older Australians and to the nation overall.                               The approach that the government has taken is that we are determined to have a quality national palliative care system. We are working with states and territories on that through the 2010 National Palliative Care Strategy - Supporting Australians to Live Well at the End of Life. We are involved in a very important reform discussion about aged care. I know that in the gallery today there are a number of people who have come to parliament to raise with parliamentarians issues on behalf of older Australians. The minister, Mark Butler, has been making an important contribution, leading that conversation around the nation, and at the appropriate point the government will respond to what we have learned in those discussions.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Robertson for her question. She has a long association with small business; indeed she and her husband, Paul, run a small business in her own community.                              Today the Prime Minister announced a very important decision in the creation of the Office of the Small Business Commissioner. This is a very important decision that was welcomed of course by Peter Strong, the Executive Director of COSBOA, who was in attendance at Parliament House today. Unfortunately, I was unable to attend because the opposition chose to prevent me from attending by not pairing - a rather petty decision, I would have thought - but that was more an insult to the small business community than to me as minister.                              In relation to this decision, the Office of the Small Business Commissioner plays a very important role. The first time this position was created at the state level was by a Victorian Labor government in 2004. This is the first time it has been determined at a federal level. It provides support for small business. It will provide referrals for other government services, including dispute resolution. It will allow small business to make representations to that commissioner and direct to me. This is a very important role to provide independent advice and sourcing advice from the small business community and I think it has been well received by that very important constituency.                              Of course, that comes off the back of the announcement by the Prime Minister to elevate this portfolio to cabinet. I think this is a very important decision. It is the first time that small business has been in a federal government cabinet for more than 10 years. It does speak volumes about the priorities this government has to provide support for this very important constituency. During the global financial crisis we made some very important decisions to stimulate the economy to ensure we could provide support for thousands upon thousands of small businesses. That was the right thing to do, and we look to do more by providing support for small businesses across the country as we provide all sorts of opportunities, including the $6,500 instant asset tax write-off for small businesses, the $5,000 write-off for business vehicles and a reduction in the company tax rate from 30 per cent to 29 per cent for incorporated companies.                               These are important initiatives to create the environment for small businesses in this country to do very well. It is a constituency that employs almost five million Australians. What is going to stop that, of course, is the actions of the opposition leader who is choosing to oppose those tax cuts to small businesses.                                                                    Mr BRENDAN O'CONNOR:                    It is a crying shame that there may be some concerns in relation to that decision. It would be the first time I have ever witnessed a Liberal Party leader opposing cuts to small businesses.              </DOC>

  The member raises a serious question. Many people in New South Wales, and indeed around the country, are concerned about illegal firearms. I understand that community members feel like all too often they see reported on their TV screens drive-by shootings or other violent incidents involving a firearm or bikie related crime. That does worry people about community safety, so this is an important issue. I am not in a position to confirm details about a specific firearm, but what I can say to the member is that this is a question we are taking seriously. When it comes to the illegal firearms market in Australia, how we have illegal weapons in our community, there are a few issues that need to be addressed. One is referred to by the Federal Police as the grey market.                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    On the specifics of the question, I have indicated to the member I am not in a position to verify facts about an individual component, but I assume that the member was motivated to ask this question because he is seriously interested in the issue of illegal firearms in the community, so I will take the opportunity to talk about that serious issue. If I am shouted down by the opposition when talking about illegal firearms and community safety, then so be it.                               On the question of illegal firearms and community safety, the problems in the community have more than one source. One source of them is what is referred to as the grey market, which arose from the failure to return all appropriate categories of firearms under the gun buyback scheme. We have received advice from the Federal Police about the nature of the grey market and it is something that law enforcement officers obviously are concerned about and work on to deal with firearms that have gone into illegal use in the community from that market. Then, as a federal government, we must do everything we can to make sure that we protect the community from importation of firearms and, as a federal government, we are very focused on that. The relevant minister has been dealing with this issue. It was raised by Premier O'Farrell with me some time ago. I referred him to the appropriate intergovernmental committee to deal with this issue and we are very keen to work in a genuine and cooperative partnership with our state colleagues on this question, which is of clear community concern.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Moreton for his question. I know that he is a tireless advocate on behalf of the 19,000 small businesses in his community and I know he is also looking forward to coming into this place shortly and voting in support of tax breaks for those small businesses. Only a Labor government is prepared to manage the economy in the interests of working families. We are a government that sees out there in community, across the economy, that we have a multispeed economy. Whilst parts of our economy are going very strongly, there are other parts that are not doing it quite as well. There are many sectors of our economy that are doing it tough and we want to make sure that we spread the benefits of the mining boom so that small businesses - those businesses that are working in manufacturing, tourism and retail - have some of the benefits of this boom so that they can do what small businesses do so effectively - that is, create jobs and generate wealth for this country.                              I am asked about the impact of not providing this vital assistance to small business. Obviously, if these small businesses and businesses that are likely to receive a tax cut under our proposal do not receive that assistance, they will continue to be weighed down by taxation at its current levels. We want to liberate them from existing levels of taxation by cutting taxes. By lowering taxes, we can help build a stronger economy for the future.                              That is especially why I was surprised to hear the member for North Sydney, when asked yesterday whether or not the opposition would support these tax cuts, say 'no'. He did not just say no once, or twice, he went on to say no five times. This negativity is going to kill small business. This negativity is irresponsible and will harm small businesses right around this country. We want to give a tax break to small businesses all around this country. We want to give a tax break to the 33,000 small businesses in the electorate of Brisbane, even if the member for Brisbane says no. We want to give a tax break to the 17,000 small businesses in the electorate of Macquarie, even if the member for Macquarie says no. We want to give a tax break to the 17,000 small businesses in the electorate of Dunkley, even if the member for Dunkley says no.                              It is absolutely essential at a time when so many businesses and companies across our economy are doing it tough that we provide them with the tax relief that they need. If those opposite are not going to stand up for small business, the Gillard government will.              </DOC>

  On the question of illegal firearms, I addressed in my earlier answer that there is more than one source of illegal firearms and that there is a substantial problem with the grey market in firearms that have been in Australia for some time and have moved from being in legal circulation to now being in illegal circulation. That is of concern. Clearly, if there is any importation of illegal firearms or ammunition for firearms, that is of concern too.                              On collaboration between state and federal governments, we want to take a partnership approach with the state government. On collaboration between the New South Wales Police Force and federal government agencies, I am happy to make specific inquiries following the member's question but as a general proposition there is very good liaison between state policing services and the Australian Federal Police. That has been my experience; I am sure it has been the experience of members generally when they have seen police forces go about their work.                              To the member who is clearly concerned about this matter, I assure him I do not see any politics in this. I see a general sense of concern in the community about illegal firearms. I see police concerned about the question and around the nation I see governments who are prepared to work together on this issue and work together in a collaborative way. I have indicated that to the Premier of New South Wales. I know the relevant minister has been indicating that to his ministerial colleagues as well.                              Clearly, illegal weaponry is a difficult problem. Our society can probably pride itself that we do not have some of the dimensions of illegal gun problems that countries overseas have. The Howard government was to be commended on its gun legislation but we are always -                                                                     Ms GILLARD:                    My point was simply that these matters have been dealt with on a bipartisan basis. I hope that is going to continue, but, given the performance of the member for Cook in parliament today, I doubt it very much.               </DOC>

  I thank the member for Wills for his question. He knows that over 40,000 of his voters will see an increase in superannuation when the increase from nine per cent to 12 per cent passes the Senate. He also knows that Australia cannot rely on the mining boom forever, that the mining boom is only part of Australia's economy and that there are a lot of businesses doing it hard. We know that we need to spread the benefits of the mining boom throughout the whole of Australia. We understand that one way to spread the benefits of the mining boom is to decrease the corporate tax rate from 30 per cent to 29 per cent. We know that 720,000 small businesses stand to benefit as soon as we do that. As Australia is buffeted by economic events overseas, we understand that lowering corporate tax assists the creation of jobs. What can be more important in this country than the creation of jobs?                              I was also asked about superannuation and how that spreads the benefits of the mining boom. Did you know that over 4 million people living in Liberal and National Party electorates stand to get an increase in their superannuation - even if their representatives will not vote for it? In fact, if we get these reforms through, we will also be able to cut the concessional tax for 3.6 million Australians who earn less than $37,000 a year. Instead of paying 15 per cent tax on their superannuation, they will pay nothing at all. Incidentally, we intend to abolish age discrimination so that you can receive superannuation at any age.                              I was also asked how much support there is for spreading the benefits of the mining boom and improving superannuation. There is a lot of support. One area where there is support is from industry funds. Industry funds, as most people - except those opposite - know, have equal employee and employer representation. I was terribly disappointed to see reported in today's newspapers that the Leader of the Opposition had attacked industry funds as some sort of gravy train. I was disappointed because Master Builders Australia appoints directors to industry funds, as do the National Retailers Association, VECCI, Business SA, the NFF and the CCIQ - what did these organisations ever do to be maligned, attacked and defamed by the Leader of the Opposition and his caucus room? All they want is greater superannuation.                                                                    Mr SHORTEN:                    When we talk about reactions to improved superannuation, it is not just about the good work done by industry funds and their reactions. Surely John Brogden of the Financial Services Council cannot be attacked by those opposite? Surely there must be some people immune from being maligned by the opposition? John Brogden, a former Liberal leader in New South Wales, said:                              Millions more Australians will have a better retirement if the superannuation guarantee goes to 12 per cent.                              You cannot bag him for being someone you do not like.               </DOC>

  The Leader of the Opposition is referring to a press report this morning that raised this issue. I would like to refer the Leader of the Opposition to the newsletter of the Shopping Centre Council of Australia, Shop Talk, which has gone out today and which says the following:                              Some newspapers are today carrying an exclusive report quoting a retailer claiming that some shopping centre landlords are including a new lease provision passing on the effects of the new carbon tax to retailers.                              The newsletter of the Shopping Centre Council of Australia goes on to say that the fact that this clause is actually several years old is clearly not referred to in that article. It goes on to explain that the fact that it is several years old is why it does not directly refer to a carbon tax. It then goes on to say that it was included in leases once debate began about the need for legislative action to combat greenhouse gas emissions.                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    The truth of this matter is that this clause has been in leases for several years. Obviously in the public policy debate there has been over many years a reference to dealing with greenhouse gases, none clearer or stronger than when the Howard government, of which the Leader of the Opposition was a senior member, went to the 2007 election on a platform of an emissions trading scheme and putting a price on carbon. I would say to the Leader of the Opposition, if he genuinely has some concern about people who lease shops in shopping centres and run small businesses, maybe he would like to support a tax cut for them. We do and the Leader of the Opposition does not. Maybe he would like to support an instant asset write-off for them. We do and the Leader of the Opposition does not. Maybe he would like to support a $5,000 benefit if they choose to purchase a motor vehicle. No, he is too busy doing what Clive Palmer tells him to do instead.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Page for her question, and I am glad she has received from the Speaker the reassurance that she has. That is very good news. As a Labor government we are focused on running the economy in the interests of working people and making sure we build the economy this nation will need in the future so that working people can have prosperity, that they can have jobs and that, if as they choose their highest aspiration is to open a small business, they can do that too. In pursuit of that objective, at this time in our nation's history, when we are seeing the mineral wealth in our ground sold at very high prices, when we are seeing a resources boom with hundreds of billions of dollars of investment in the pipeline, it is the right time to take a share of that resources boom and ensure that businesses around the nation benefit - large and small.                              This cut in company tax is not only good news for businesses but it is good news for the Australian economy. As OECD research shows, company tax has the biggest adverse effect on economic growth. It follows that if you cut company tax you are helping economic growth. If you are helping economic growth you are then helping the wages of working people. Modelling done at the time of the Henry tax review showed that a one per cent cut in company tax means around $330 a year extra for a worker on an average income. Good for businesses, good for growth, good for jobs and good for wages: that is what a cut in company tax is.                              The nation faces a very stark choice on policies on company tax in this parliament. We on this side of the parliament stand for a rate of 29 cents and for delivering the benefit of that cut rate to small businesses first. The opposition stands for a rate of 31½ cents, as a result of their paid parental leave levy. That is a difference of 2½ cents. That matters in the international comparison. Under Labor we will move up two spots in the OECD ranking on company tax - a lower rate than the US, Japan, France, Belgium, Mexico and Spain. Under the opposition we would have the fifth-highest rate in the OECD.                              We cannot afford to hold Australia back. We cannot afford to have Australia stand still. We need to build the economy of the future. We owe that to working families, who are seeking to make a living and make their way. We owe that to people in business, who are creating the jobs for their fellow Australians. As a government we are determined to deliver it.              </DOC>

  The fear campaign continues and as part of that campaign we get the recycling of the same old questions. To the member who asked the question I say this: how will the families and children she is worried about react to the Leader of the Opposition's Coles and Woolies tax? How will they feel about that when prices are up in the shops as a result of the Leader of the Opposition increasing company tax to 31½ cents? On the matter of carbon pricing and public transport -                                                                     Ms GILLARD:                    I am very anxious to get back to the question. On the carbon pricing regime, bus prices and children catching buses, all of this has of course been factored in to the compensation that families will receive. The member who asked the question should recognise that under the government's plans the mums and dads of the children catching public transport are very likely to have got a tax cut. The mums and dads are very likely to have seen an increase in their family payments. The grandparents of those children will have seen a pension increase.                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    Under the Leader of the Opposition's plan they would have had all of that money taken out of their hands, and then a bill for $1,300 on top. That is what would have happened. And if the children's mums and dads operate a small business they will be paying more tax as well.                              When it comes to running the economy in the interests of working families, children catching buses and children going to quality schools, schools that have not had to face cutbacks, the member had better endorse the policies and plans of this side, because the policies and plans of the Leader of the Opposition are a disgrace for those working families, because they are all about placating billionaires.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Blair for his very important question. Tonight in the Senate there will be a very important debate that goes to the very core of maximising prosperity in Australia and spreading the benefits of the mining boom to every corner of our country. Through this debate in the Senate we will see who is prepared to stand up and fight for a boost to superannuation savings for 8.4 million working Australians. We will see who is prepared to stand up and fight for small businesses - 2.7 million small businesses that will benefit from the $6,500 instant asset write-off. We will see who is prepared to stand up and support vital investment, particularly in our mining regions and particularly in infrastructure.                              We on this side of the House are absolutely determined to ensure that all Australians benefit from the resources boom. We are determined to ensure that the opportunities from that boom are spread right around our country. We believe that the benefits should not go to a fortunate few. We believe that the benefits should not just go to those who are in the fast lane of our economy. We do need to spread the benefits around the economy. We on this side of the House understand that there is a patchwork economy and not everybody is in the fast lane of the mining boom. That is why cuts to business taxation are so important. They will drive investment, they will make business more competitive and they will support jobs.                              We on this side of the House are absolutely determined to maximise employment in this country, to support jobs in this country, which is why we acted so decisively at the height of the global financial crisis. We also understand that there are sectors of the economy impacted by the higher dollar, impacted by the cautious consumer.                                                                    Mr SWAN:                    That is why we believe in providing tax cuts to many companies that need those tax cuts to be more competitive in this environment. Unlike those opposite, we will not stick our head in the sand and we will not leave those people behind. That is why we are so determined to put through these cuts to taxation. But we know what those opposite will do. Those opposite will kneel at the feet of vested interest like Clive Palmer and Gina Rinehart. That is exactly what they will do.                                                                    Mr SWAN:                    They will write an 11-figure cheque to the likes of Clive Palmer and Gina Rinehart.              </DOC>

  If the member for Casey is concerned about the jobs of these workers within his electorate, and I accept that he is, why does he want to deny that business a tax cut? A tax cut would do that business a lot of good. Why is he going to vote against that business getting a tax cut? Why is he going to make sure that business pays more tax?                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    That is what the member for Casey stands for in this parliament - that business that employs 300 workers paying more tax. That is what he stands for.

Ms GILLARD:                    On the question of carbon pricing, of course what the member for Casey has not spoken about and would not speak about is the support for jobs. What he has not spoken about is the support for families. What he has not spoken about are the tax cuts involved. What he has not spoken about is the money going into the hands of pensioners, people who live in his electorate and people who might well go and shop at the business that he has referred to in this parliament. At base, there is no getting away from the fact that as we end this parliamentary week on all of these questions about businesses and business prosperity, on all of these questions about jobs, there is a very simple choice in this parliament: under Labor those businesses will pay less company tax; under the Liberals they will pay more.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for O'Connor for his question. We have had some very productive discussions about workforce issues in not just his electorate but the whole of the state of Western Australia. I know that he is concerned beyond the boundaries of his electorate and for Western Australia more broadly. The government are putting a great deal of effort into both attracting and retaining a regional workforce in not just Western Australia but other parts of the country. It is difficult.                              We have had shortages for many years because the previous government, when the Leader of the Opposition was the health minister, capped the number of GPs that were trained and that led to shortages right around Australia. Of course, it takes a while to train a GP in Australia. We have substantially increased GP training places and we have substantially increased investment in post-medical school places to train GPs, but those students take a while to come through the system. We will see improvements as those Australian GPs come through the system. Meanwhile, we continue to work constructively with overseas trained doctors to fill areas of workforce shortage.                               It is worth putting on the record that some $895 million will be invested into rural health workforce education and training programs over the period of the last budget, with $34.1 million for nursing and allied health rural locum schemes, which will provide 3,000 nurse locum placements and 400 allied health locum placements in rural areas over four years to support rural nurses and allied health workers;                               There will be $6½ million to provide 400 more clinical placement scholarships over four years for allied health students; $43 million for expanded medical specialist outreach assistance programs; $386.8 million for the Rural Health Multidisciplinary Training Program, which includes the Rural Clinical Training and Support program, Dental Training Expanding Rural Placements Program, University Departments of Rural Health program, and the John Flynn Placement Program; and capital funding to support that through the Rural Education Infrastructure Development Pool.                              In March 2010 $345 million was set aside for general practice training. I know that the member for O'Connor knows that 50 per cent of that is undertaken in rural areas. That investment will deliver an additional 5,500 GPs by 2020. But I go back to the point that I made earlier: it does take a while for these new students, after years of constriction, to make their way through the system. I know that the member for O'Connor is very dedicated to his constituents and I look forward to working constructively with him on these issues of workforce shortage.               </DOC>

  I would like to thank the member for McEwen for his question. He knows 55½ thousand of his electors will get an increase in superannuation courtesy of this government.                              I am asked about workplace safety. It is an important issue. We have just released a report which shows in the most recent data available that in 2009-10 216 Australians went to work and did not come home that night. It also reveals that the cost of workplace injury is something like $60 billion. That does not even begin to measure the human cost.                              It also reports to us that there are certain industries in which there is a higher fatality rate than others. One of them, of course, is agriculture. Over 310 people died on Australia's farms in the years 2009-10. Of course the farm is the family home but it is also a workplace. Construction is another very dangerous industry, with 281 deaths over the seven years up to 2009.                              If you look at the numbers between 2004 and 2010 in transport, 567 people have died in the transport industry on Australia's roads and Australia's rail lines. The vast bulk of fatalities in the transport industry are related to heavy vehicle truck incidents. This is a tragedy. It has been recently reported that 246,000 work hard in our trucking industry, yet there are 25 deaths per 100,000. That is 10 times the casualty rate of Australian industry as a whole. Last year, 250 people died in relation to heavy vehicle and truck incidents at a cost of $2.7 billion. In fact, 1,000 people, member for Tangney, if you care, were seriously injured. That is why the government is moving on with Safe Rates legislation, because we intend to do our bit to make roads safer.                              I noticed earlier the member for Gippsland said that safety is a complex matter and there is more than one factor. I agree. But where I do not agree with what the opposition has been saying, in their cynical opposition to this legislation, is I do not accept the proposition that remuneration is not a factor in a complex issue. In 1979 it was established that the method of payment had a big impact.                                                                    Mr SHORTEN:                    I am asked for evidence. The National Transport Commission report of 2008 said there was a link between payment rates and methods for owner-drivers and employees, that these methods create an incentive to drive unsafely and that this results in safety outcomes on roads. This government will not stand idly by and watch Australians be killed on our roads merely because of a lack of resolve. That is why the Safe Rates legislation is fine law.

  Regarding the member's question, we see question time play out as usual. Here we go with the rest of question time, I predict, because the opposition has clearly run out of any questions about the economy or jobs or health or education or the interests of working Australians, and they are certainly not going to ask anything about company tax today, are they? To the member's question -                                                                     Ms GILLARD:                    To the member's question, Fair Work Australia is an independent entity. I know the culture of the Liberal Party is to bully others and try and make them do things as it goes about enacting its instruction from Clive Palmer and others.                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    Ours is to abide by the law. It is an independent agency and it will act as such.

  I thank the member for Chifley, who understands the needs of businesses in Western Sydney, which is one of the largest regional economies in this country and a part of the world that I proudly represent. The question that the member for Chifley has asked goes to the government's plans to manage the economy in the interests of working people. We are determined to put in place a mining tax so that we can spread the benefits of the mining boom to ensure that those businesses that are not experiencing the benefits of being in the fast lane of the economy are able to get a tax cut and tax relief at a time when they need it most.                              When we take decisions in this place they have real consequences for real people. I read in the Age this morning of the case of James Anderson, who runs a small landscaping business in Tullamarine. Mr Anderson is a supporter of this government's plans to cut tax and provide tax relief for small business. In the article he said:                              I think it's very disappointing that the coalition isn't behind this. They should be doing everything they can to help small businesses_                              He goes on to make the point that is the bleeding obvious to people out there in the community, even if it seems to elude those opposite. He went on:                               Especially at the moment where we have a two-speed economy with one sector doing very, very well and the rest doing poorly.                              James Anderson understands that we need to spread the benefits of the mining boom and that is what we want to do.                              I am also asked about the extent of support for these proposals. It is a matter that is on the public record that the business community, through ACCI, the BCA, AiG and COSBOA, universally support this government's efforts to cut taxes because they know it is important to support business. But there are others, not just out there in the community but even in this place, who support providing relief to small business. I was struck by the comments of the member for Hughes in his maiden speech, a member whom I know has in the media recently been associated with the challenges that many businesses are presently facing. The member for Hughes said in his maiden speech:                              _when push comes to shove, if we as the natural friends of small business do not stand up for a fair go for small business people, then we risk them remaining the forgotten people.                              Menzies would be turning in his grave. They want to consign the small business people of this country to the scrap heap of the forgotten people. We are determined to stand up for small business and if those on the other side want to forget about small business, so be it. The Gillard government will stand up for them and we will deliver a tax cut.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Makin for his question, because supporting Australian industry is an absolutely fundamental priority for this government. Whilst we have a strong economy, low unemployment, low debt, moderate inflation and massive private sector investment coming into the economy, some industries in particular are feeling the effects of the high value of the Australian dollar. The government is therefore making tax reforms to relieve pressures in areas like manufacturing, which is feeling the effects of the high dollar. That is one of the reasons why the government has moved to cut company taxes across the board. We propose to cut company tax from 30 to 29 per cent.                               In relation to small business, many unincorporated small business people will also stand to benefit from tax changes the government is making through the trebling of the tax-free threshold. So there are cuts in company tax, there are increases in the tax-free threshold that will flow tax cuts through to people and, in addition, the government is increasing the instant asset write-off for small business to $6,500. This measure is an extremely important one for small business as it will improve cash flow, improve investment, provide an incentive for capital investment and improve productivity in the small business sector. As well as all of that, the government has announced $1 billion in programs to help manufacturers improve energy efficiency, cut pollution and boost productivity.                               All of these measures will help business investment, they will support jobs and they will ensure all sectors of the economy share in the benefits of the resources boom. I am asked about the challenges to these reforms. Incredibly, the coalition are opposing every single measure to support business and to support jobs. They actually oppose a cut in company tax, and the Leader of the Opposition wants to put up company tax for thousands of businesses in this country. They oppose a billion dollars in assistance for the manufacturing sector for clean technology. They oppose a $6,500 instant asset write-off for small business. They oppose $300 million in assistance for the steel industry, which is under pressure. They propose to strip $1½ billion in assistance from the automotive manufacturing sector. This is an incredible performance from the Liberal Party. No wonder people in the business community are asking themselves what on earth is going on with economic policy in the Liberal Party these days.              </DOC>

  To the shadow Treasurer: we appointed Mr Gonski because he was the best person for the job. The shadow Treasurer authorised a press release welcoming the appointment. Senator Wong, the relevant minister, has explained the appointment process. To the shadow Treasurer, I would say that it seems to me quite a remarkable thing that, when the opposition has welcomed an appointment, now apparently it is coming into this parliament in defence -                                                                     Ms GILLARD:                    The appointments process here was an appointments process that got the best person for the job. Peter Costello was appointed by this government to the Future Fund, but he was not the best person for the job, for the role of chair; David Gonski was. If the Liberal Party wants to repudiate the press release of the shadow Treasurer and the shadow finance minister and go on a jobs-for-Liberals campaign, so be it.                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    We engage in merit based selection, and the merit based selection gave us David Gonski. He is the best person for the job.              </DOC>

  In answer to the question I say: (1) the question contains words which would mislead the Australian people, so I am not accepting the premise of the question; and (2) when it comes to businesses around the nation, including businesses in Queensland, the government is determined to give them a tax reduction. What is standing in the way of that tax reduction is the conduct of the opposition. So, if the Leader of the National Party is genuinely concerned about this business and its future, it is very hard to explain why he is opposed to a tax reduction being given to that business. It is very hard to explain that, indeed.                              But when it comes to the opposition, there is no plan -                                                                     Ms GILLARD:                    I was asked about a particular business and I am talking about measures that would assist that particular business. As we all know, as a result of world conditions and the high Australian dollar there is pressure on Australia's manufacturing industry and particularly there is pressure at this time on aluminium. We have always been very conscious that a sustained, strong Australian dollar would bring these pressures to bear on parts of our economy, like manufacturing. That is why out of the proceeds of the minerals resource rent tax we are determined to cut the tax burden on businesses like this one. It is an appropriate way to spread the benefits of the resources boom. We take a very different view on this from the opposition. We stand for a fair share of the benefits of the boom going around the nation. They stand for a privileged few. On dealing with climate change and reducing carbon pollution, we stand for doing that in the cheapest way possible. The opposition, of course, stand for a carbon plan which would impose additional costs on businesses whilst at the same time imposing additional costs on Australian families and taking away from those families the tax cuts, family payments and pension increases we intend to provide.                              To the opposition generally, who I understand today, tomorrow and the next day will continue to ask questions about this matter, I would ask the following: first and foremost, how do you explain the Howard government's commitment for an emissions trading scheme; and, No. 2, how do you marry these professions of concern about these businesses with your plan to block these businesses from getting a tax cut?              </DOC>

  I thank the member for La Trobe for her question, going as it does to the future of the Australian economy. I understand from the Leader of the Opposition's interjection that he is not at all interested in future jobs, future incomes, future prospects for Australian families. But on this side of the parliament we are. We understand that the Australian economy is in a time of change. The global economy is in a time of change. The region in which we live is growing very strongly, and that means that our economy is in a period of great change. There are huge opportunities during this period of great change, but there are also pressures, particularly pressures on our manufacturing sector because of the high Australian dollar.                              The choice of government is, therefore, whether you stand still in the face of all of this change and do nothing or whether you actually take positive steps to make sure that this change works in the interests of working Australians. We have made that decision and we are determined that this change should work in the interests of working people. That is why today I was very pleased and proud to announce a major skills reform package, a new national entitlement for Australian workers for training up to certificate III; 375,000 new completions over the next five years; a new HECS for skills program to assist with the costs of getting upper level vocational qualifications. We are determined that Australians around the nation be able to get the skills they need to benefit in the opportunities that will flow as our economy changes. There is nothing more important to the prospects of Australian working people than having a job, having the best job and having the skills to get the best job that they can. That is why we have announced our skills reform package today. Tonight we anticipate the minerals resource rent tax will go through the parliament. Once again, that is about shaping the economy of the future and making sure Australians around the nation get an opportunity during this time of change.                               Behind both of these policies is a fundamental question. It is a question of who you stand for and what you are prepared to get done on their behalf. On this side of the parliament we stand for benefiting the many; on that side of the parliament they stand for a privileged few. On this side of the parliament we stand for jobs; on that side of the parliament they stand in the way of those jobs. On this side of the parliament we stand for a fair share from the resources boom for all Australians; on that side of the parliament they stand for more profiteering by those who are already very, very wealthy indeed - the billionaires in our society. This is the divide in politics today: who you stand for and what you are prepared to get done for them.              </DOC>

  To the member who asked the question I would say this: she would recall contesting the 2007 election arguing for a price on carbon. I hope she has provided an explanation to this sporting club, and to her whole electorate, as to why she no longer stands for John Howard's plan of putting a price on carbon. While the Liberal Party are at it, they might want to explain why they no longer stand for Liberal values like cutting company tax -                                                                     Ms GILLARD:                    burdens on Australian businesses. The member who asked the question, when she is speaking to the people at that sporting club, may well, too, want to explain the costly burden she and the Leader of the Opposition have planned for the families that use those sporting facilities - a bill of $1,300 per family - as a result of the opposition's inefficient, wasteful and not credible carbon plan. She might want to explain that.                              If she wants to tell the members of this sporting club the truth, then what she will tell them is that as a nation we do need to reduce carbon pollution, that as a nation we should do that in the cheapest possible way, that as a nation that means putting a price on carbon -                                                                     Ms GILLARD:                    I was asked about the circumstances of a sporting club and I was directly addressing those circumstances. The member for Brisbane may want to explain to the members of the sporting club the need for us to reduce carbon pollution, to do it in the cheapest way, to do it in a way that benefits working people through tax cuts and increases to family payments and that benefits pensioners as well. She may want to explain that that is the reality of the government's plan, whereas what the Leader of the Opposition has planned is a big bill for every family at that sporting club of $1,300 per family.              </DOC>

  Thank you to the member for Banks for his question. Investing in skills is an investment in our economy and it is an investment in working people's futures and the futures of their families. People who improve their workplace skills earn significantly better wages. For example, someone who obtains a certificate III, or higher, qualification can expect to earn an extra $400,000 over their working life compared to someone who does not have that level of qualification. Eighty-three per cent of Australians with a certificate III level qualification, or above, have a job at any given time, whereas only 57 per cent of those who do not have those qualifications are in work at any point in time.                              Now these are extremely important things for a Labor government and they underpin our commitment to enabling people to fulfil their potential and acquire workplace skills. That is why the government have already made $7.2 billion available to the states and territories over the next five years for vocational education and training. But today the government announced that a further $1.75 billion would be available to deliver more reforms. As the Prime Minister indicated earlier, the government aims to ensure that an additional 375,000 students complete vocational education and training qualifications over the next five years. As part of these reforms, Australians from post-school to the age pension will have access to a subsidised training place up to certificate III level - an entitlement.                              The government also recognises that young people and their families sometimes struggle with the cost of fees for training courses and that is why, in today's announcement, the government has made clear that it will make available interest-free, deferred loans instead of upfront fees for 60,000 vocational education and training students per year studying publicly subsidised diplomas and advanced diplomas. These investments in skills will ensure that our economy remains strong in the future and that working people have the opportunities that they are entitled to. Investment in skills is the key to our economic future. It is the key to future jobs growth. It is the key to future living standards. It is the key to competitiveness. It is the key to productivity and it is the key to getting through some of the current economic challenges we face in the form of the high dollar. That is what this Labor government is delivering.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Farrer for her question and I note that 42½ thousand of her voters are going to get an increase in superannuation if we get our laws through tonight.                                                                    Mr SHORTEN:                    We welcome the conclusion of the Fair Work Australia investigation. The general manager's referral of the matter to the Australian Government Solicitor we also welcome. In terms of the question about my powers to refer matters, the opposition has, at every stage of this investigation by Fair Work Australia, demanded that we interfere. At the same time, they have also said that we have interfered with this matter, but we did not.                                                                    Mr SHORTEN:                    The question goes to the referral of this report to the Australian Taxation Office. We are certainly reading the report. We are going through it and we are certainly drawing it to the attention of the regulatory authorities to which we can. But let us go further here. On this question and the issues around it about the HSU, the opposition has, at every stage, tried to pre-empt the process of investigation.                                                                    Mr SHORTEN:                    It is under this government and our act that this investigation on the HSU Victoria No. 1 branch has been concluded. The general manager is in the process of concluding the rest of the report.              </DOC>

  I did notice the member for Denison was sporting quite a different look today. I did make some inquiries as to whether or not he was feeling the Canberra cold a bit more than usual and I did express to him my admiration for his bravery in having done the Shave for a Cure fundraising. I know he is not the only member of the House to have done so. I did express the observation that I am glad that there are some alternatives, such as getting a crazy colour put in your hair for a limited period, because I think many of us around this parliament might prefer that to doing what the member for Denison has done.                               There is a lot of goodwill and good spirit across the parliament - in both the House of Representatives and the Senate - towards participating in events like Shave for a Cure. I congratulate all of those who have participated. I am very happy to pledge on behalf of the cabinet that we will get into the spirit through fundraising - not necessarily through mimicking the member for Denison's hair style - and will be very happy as a cabinet to contribute the thousand dollars the member for Denison has asked for.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Parramatta for that question. This is indeed a historic day for economic reform and a historic day for the fair go in Australia. As the MRRT is debated in the Senate, it should be noted that this important reform will provide a revenue stream to ensure that businesses in particular that are not in the fast lane of the resources boom get some tax relief. It is a very important reform which goes to the fact that we on this side of the House understand that the global economic weight is moving from West to East and with that it will bring a resources boom to this country. And it will mean that we must maximise the opportunities that flow from that boom and spread them to every corner of our economy. That is why the debate in the Senate is so important.                              Just as we moved during the global financial crisis to support our economy, we are now moving to put in place the big reforms which will maximise the opportunities that will flow to everyone in our country, not just a select few. Of course, one of those reforms was announced by the Prime Minister today - the importance of skills and the importance of people being able to upskill, and what that means in terms of their capacity to earn and to stand on their own two feet. We also know that we need to spread the benefits of the mining boom through cuts to company taxation, particularly to those companies that are not in the fast lane of the mining boom. That is why on this side of the House we stand for tax cuts for those companies that are not in the fast lane, but of course those tax cuts are opposed by those opposite.                              Those opposite are being either deliberately deceitful or massively ignorant when it comes to this legislation that is in the Senate. We on this side of the House understand the importance of taking the super profits of very profitable companies and sharing them right around the country. What the debate in the Senate shows and what it showed in this House is that those opposite have not got a clue. You could never trust them with the government of this country. They are so out of touch, they do not understand that a company tax cut is important for 2.7 million small businesses. They voted against it. We voted for it. They do not understand the importance of investing in infrastructure. We voted for it. They voted against it. Now, we get to the extraordinary situation where those opposite want to increase company tax by 1½ per cent whilst we want to reduce it by one per cent, making their company tax regime 10 per cent higher than ours. Why would they adopt such a stupid and ignorant position? I will tell you why, Mr Speaker.                                                                    Mr SWAN:                    It is because there is a $70 billion crater in their budget bottom line. They are not capable of running a modern economy.               </DOC>

  Firstly, in terms of the government referring matters, the person with the discretion to refer matters to prosecuting authorities is the general manager of Fair Work Australia.                                                                    Mr SHORTEN:                    No, I said that I would draw it to the attention of the ATO, which was the earlier question asked.                                                                    Mr SHORTEN:                    I am going to assume there is a scintilla of interest in the answer to the question and continue. The general manager of Fair Work Australia has the discretion, upon having investigated the matter - and the matter was investigated by her delegate - to draw conclusions and to take certain actions. What the general manager has done at the conclusion of the investigation into the No.1 branch is that she has instructed the Australian Government Solicitor to apply to the Federal Court for penalties and other orders against the HSU and certain officials. We intend to let that matter run its course. Of course, I would not put it past some of the hooligan elements opposite to try to damage those matters -                                                                     Mr SHORTEN:                    Well, you would have to say your public commentary -                                                                     Mr SHORTEN:                    All right, I take back the use of the word 'hooligan'. There is still further progress to be done on the national office investigation. Again, that is a matter for Fair Work Australia. The sections upon which the general manager of Fair Work Australia is relying upon are sections in the Fair Work Act, the same sections that were put in place by the then minister for industrial relations in 2002, none other than the Leader of the Opposition. We have repeatedly said that Fair Work Australia is independent and investigations are independent. We will not interfere with the conduct of these investigations and we actually have enough respect on this side of the House to let the process take its natural order.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for his question. This is a very important question. Five weeks ago, I announced a national investigation into the illegal firearms market and its links to gang activity in Australia. I commissioned the most powerful law enforcement agency in the country to do this work: the Australian Crime Commission. They have the powers effectively of a standing royal commission - the power to compel witnesses to appear and give evidence and the power and ability to trace firearms. It was their work in tracing one gun that led all around the world to those arrests and the dismantling of a criminal syndicate last week - working with the New South Wales Police Force, the Customs and Border Protection Service and the AFP.                               I have asked the Australian Crime Commission to do that same tracing analysis for the firearms that have been seized right across the country by police over the last 12 months. This will provide police with more intelligence and the capacity to make more arrests. By tracing more weapons you get more criminal intelligence and that gives you the potential to arrest more criminals. This investigation will provide the federal government and state governments -                                                                     Mr CLARE:                    as well as Territory governments -                                                                     Mr CLARE:                    with recommendations on what further action is needed to tackle the illegal firearms market.                                                                  The member for Cook then left the chamber.                                                                                    Mr CLARE:                    The Australian Crime Commission will do this work with other state and territory police forces as well as Customs and Border Protection, CrimTrac, AUSTRAC and the AFP. They will also harness information from the USA's online firearm-tracing system.                              I am asked about alternative approaches. After five weeks the opposition have finally caught up and they are asking for their own inquiry. It begs the question: what would their investigation do? Would it have coercive powers? No, it would not. Would it have the powers of a standing royal commission? No, it would not. Would it have the power to conduct tracing analysis of illegal firearms? No, it would not. It begs the question: why have a 'toothless tiger' inquiry when you already have the most powerful law enforcement agency in the country on the job? I might remind you of this quote, Mr Speaker:                              The idea that you have got to have a Customs officer searching everybody who comes into the country has never been realistic. What you do is you identify through all sorts of intelligence _                                                They are not my words; they are the words of John Winston Howard. He was right then and the opposition is wrong now.               </DOC>

  I have expressed my full confidence in the member for Dobell and I continue to do so. Let me also make this observation: what we are seeing from the opposition today is 'distraction day'. They think the Australian public are stupid. They think members of the press gallery are stupid, too. They think, on a day on which the government will deliver two major pieces of economic reform - the minerals resource rent tax, where the opposition is in a world of pain about denying company tax cuts -                                                                     Ms GILLARD:                    Mr Speaker, I am explaining the motivation for the question. On a day on which there are two major economic reforms before this parliament, the mineral resource rent tax and the skills reform package -                                                                     Ms GILLARD:                    Mr Speaker, this is the best they can do - a cheap distraction - and everyone should see through it.              </DOC>

 We are committed to seeing a cleaner energy future and to achieving that in the lowest cost way possible. That is the commitment of our government. The commitment of those on the other side is to impose the biggest possible cost they can think of right across Australian society, including on the very people that the Leader of the Opposition professes concern about. As we have structured our carbon-pricing plan we have structured it to get the reduction in carbon pollution that even the Leader of the Opposition says he supports - at the lowest possible cost. In doing so we have worked to support families, to support working people, to support people with children and to support pensioners with more money in their pockets and more disposable income. So of course that is relevant to how they can support their local sporting clubs.                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                   This plan is in very sharp contrast to the Leader of the Opposition's plan to impose a bill -                                                                     Ms GILLARD:                   a $1,300 bill, on every family. That is the Leader of the Opposition's plan - an effective carbon price of $62 a tonne. That is the Leader of the Opposition's plan. Here on this side of the parliament -                                                                   The member for Isaacs then left the chamber.                                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                   I thank the member for Sturt for his point of order and I thank him for his frank statement. Let us not forget it was the opposition that first proposed an emissions trading scheme.                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                   So I thank the member for Sturt for reminding us of the deep hypocrisy at the soul of the Liberal Party about putting a price on carbon.                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                   Mr Speaker, I withdraw. On this side of the parliament, we will work with the sporting clubs, the businesses, Australian workers and every part of Australian society to seize a clean energy future at the lowest possible cost. On that side of the parliament, when they do not stand for a contradiction, they stand for a bill for working families of $1,300 each.              </DOC>

 I thank the member for Robertson for her question. I know that in her part of the world she is concerned about how people will seize economic opportunities in the future. She has an electorate which is home to many small businesses - many businesses that want to see a company tax reduction and many small businesses that want to see a benefit so that they can better get on with the job of providing for their families and giving jobs to other Australians. So it is good news for the member for Robertson and it is good news for the Australian nation that last night the parliament passed the minerals resource rent tax.                                                It is good news for the 2.7 million small businesses that will get a tax benefit. It is good news for all businesses around the nation who will see a company tax reduction. It is good news for everyone who cares about economic growth and jobs because if you reduce company tax you increase economic growth, and that means that there will be more jobs. It is good news for more than eight million working Australians who will be able to look forward to more superannuation and a better retirement as a result. It is good news for our national economy that our pool of national savings will grow. And it is good news for mining regions - which are experiencing both the benefits and sometimes the burdens that can come with rapid growth - that there will be new funds available to invest in the infrastructure that mining communities need: the roads, the rail and the ports that help to feed the mining boom. On this side of the parliament we are proud that we have worked long and hard to ensure that we have these economic settings for the future of our country and that during this time of resources wealth we are sharing that wealth with the many around the nation - not the few. Ultimately, these big pieces of public policy speak of your values and who you stand for. We on this side of the parliament are clear: we stand for sharing the benefits of the resources boom with the Australian people. On that side of the parliament they stand for the privileged few like Clive Palmer and Gina Rinehart. On this side of the parliament we stand with Australian businesses, providing them with a company tax cut. On that side of the parliament they stand for increased company taxation, making it harder for Australian businesses to make their way and to employ their fellow Australians. On this side of the parliament we stand for shaping and embracing the future. On that side of the parliament they stand for pretending that you can stand still and wish the future away. We stand for jobs and prosperity; they stand in the way.               </DOC>

 I thank the member for his question and I ask him why he is opposed to that business getting a tax cut and why he will exercise his vote in this parliament to deny that business a tax cut. If he is so concerned about these foundry workers, if he is so concerned about a business that has been in operation since 1920, why will he come into this parliament and vote against it getting a tax cut? That is what he is intending to do. Why is he going to exercise his vote in favour of Clive Palmer and Gina Rinehart rather than that business?                              On the question of carbon pricing, as the member may be aware, although perhaps he has been too caught up in the fear campaign to worry about the fact, there is a program to work with businesses - particularly with foundry businesses - to support them in the transition to a clean energy future. I am sure that the member for Moreton will be working with that business and other businesses in his electorate so that they understand the way in which that assistance is available to them. As the member for Moreton goes about his electorate having those discussions, he will be able to walk into that business, he will be able to walk into small businesses and he will be able to walk down the business streets in his electorate saying that he stands for a company tax cut for those businesses and that the Leader of the Opposition wants to stop that tax cut ever getting through.              </DOC>

 I thank the member for Capricornia for that very important question. The passage of the MRRT is an historic reform for this parliament which will benefit working Australians and small businesses right around our country. Members of parliament from our side of the House voted for very important measures to spread the benefits of the mining boom right across our country and right into every postcode of our country because we believe in a fair go for all Australians. Those on the other side just support the vested interests of a few.                              On this side of the House we have the interests of working people very much at heart. That is why, for example, we voted for the instant asset write-off of $6,500, which will go to 2.7 million small businesses right around the country. Those on the other side voted no. We voted for a huge boost to the superannuation savings of 8.7 million Australian workers, but they voted no on that side of the House. We also voted for a $500 boost to the superannuation savings of those on the lowest incomes in our country, but those on that side of the House voted no. Everybody on this side of the House supported revenue which will go to investment and infrastructure right across our great mining regions, but they on that side of the House voted no.                              A few words about the role of the Prime Minister and the role of the Minister for Resources and Energy in this historic reform. The Prime Minister went into bat -                                                                     Mr SWAN:                   The Prime Minister went into bat for millions of Australian workers, including in the electorate of Capricornia, to have their superannuation boosted.                                                                    Mr SWAN:                   The Prime Minister went into bat for the workers and the small businesses in Capricornia. The Leader of the Opposition went into bat for the mining billionaires. That is what occurred in the parliament. This is a very important and historic reform for our country. It will strengthen our economy, it will strengthen investment and it will strengthen employment, and that is why we on this side of the House so enthusiastically support this major long-term reform for Australia.              </DOC>

 In the first instance, what I would advise the mayor to do is ask the member for Herbert why he voted against the Townsville Ring Road project, which will be funded through the proceeds of the minerals resource rent tax and why he has voted to deny the people of his electorate up to $160 million in extra infrastructure. That is what I would suggest that the local mayor ask the member -                                                                     Ms GILLARD:                   Once again, I say to the member for Herbert that he has got a lot of explaining to do. The Townsville Ring Road was voted against by the member for Herbert. On the question of carbon pricing, I would advise the local mayor to get the facts about carbon pricing that are available to local councils. Because as well as voting against infrastructure in his electorate the member for Herbert is engaged in the Leader of the Opposition's fear campaign, he would of course have avoided any of the facts. The facts are these: the impact on the cost of living has been modelled by Treasury at 0.7 per cent, people will receive in their hands additional money - pension payments, family payments, tax cuts - and any impact on local councils has been factored into those figures. The member for Herbert should get those facts to his local council.                              When the member for Herbert is thinking about the impact on his community of the needs of our future economy, which includes a clean energy future in which we are sharing the proceeds of the resources boom, he might also like to talk to the local mayor about how to get to a clean energy future in the cheapest possible way - that is, with the government's plan, not the Leader of the Opposition's plan - and he might want to talk to the local mayor about how good it would be for local economic activity if businesses large and small got a tax cut. That is our plan, and the member for Herbert is opposed to it, alongside the Leader of the Opposition. He might also ask the local mayor how he would feel about the ratepayers - working people, people with families, pensioners - receiving extra money, because under our government they will and the Leader of the Opposition wants to rip that money out of their hands.                               Townsville is a regional city which has an economy that is going well, and that is fantastic. But economic growth brings pressures for infrastructure and, through the minerals resource rent tax, we are in a position to fund vital infrastructure that the member for Herbert is opposed to, even though the people who live in his constituency will be using it.              </DOC>

 I thank the honourable member for his question. The Regional Australia Institute is a very important commitment made to the regional Independents by the Prime Minister in the formation of this government and we have delivered on that commitment. The Regional Australia Institute is a public company limited by guarantee and the membership of its board is determined by its board. I am happy to pass on your concern about the need for WA representation.                              I should say that the Ministerial Advisory Council on Regional Australia, MACRA, which I have established, has a very broad cross-section of representation, including WA representation. Collene Longmore, CEO at the Shire of Roebourne, is a member of MACRA and we are very keen to ensure all the country is represented. I might say the member for O'Connor is the only member on that side of the House to ask a question in this place on regional development. In all the time I have held this portfolio, I have not had one question from Her Majesty's loyal opposition in relation to regional development. I think the member should pay some regard to who he trusts to better look after the regions when it comes to consideration of issues we bring before the parliament and before the Australian -                                                                     Mr CREAN:                   This is the substance of the question, Mr Speaker. I have been asked about the significance of the Regional Australia Institute.                                                                    Mr CREAN:                   As is your right, Mr Speaker.                                                                    Mr CREAN:                   So far as the Regional Australia Institute is concerned, this is a fundamental plank in enabling regions to better themselves. I have said many times in this parliament that when we look at the patchwork nature of the economy we see that the regions are the patches. We need to encourage them to diversify their economic base. They cannot do that unless there is proper research and proper foundational fact upon which decisions are taken. The reason we have established this important body is to connect with the very good work already being undertaken in regional universities around the country, to identify the gaps, to advise us and to undertake, through the money we have made available to them, how they can fill those gaps. This is a major initiative for regional Australia which has come about only because this government has implemented it.              </DOC>

 I thank the member for Throsby for the question. In doing so, I acknowledge that Australia is grabbing with both hands the window of opportunity which is the resources boom. It is not just about us accessing record commodity prices; it is also about guaranteeing future investment by regaining the loss of market opportunity which occurred under the last resources boom during the Howard government. We are also ensuring that the benefits of this resources boom are spread across the Australian economy, especially in sections such as manufacturing, tourism and education, which are challenged by the nature of the Australian dollar at the moment and the pressures the resources sector is placing on the broad Australian economy.                              Investment is really about the future. We have $455 billion in either planned or committed capital investments at the moment and $170 billion of that is capital investment in the LNG sector. This is exceptionally important. I notice a certain Queensland flavour to the questions from the opposition this afternoon. Let us talk about the benefits to Queensland of the minerals resource rent tax and the petroleum resource rent tax. Let us talk about the $45 billion new capital investment in the LNG sector in the Gladstone corridor achieved since the introduction of the PRRT. Let us talk about the significant investments from India - the first major investments to the Queensland resources sector in the Galilee Basin by GVK and Adani - a country looking for further opportunities to develop a guaranteed source of supply of commodities, despite what the opposition has said about the introduction of the PRRT and the MRRT. More importantly, this reflects increases in not only investment in Australia in the coking coal, thermal coal and iron ore sectors but in jobs growth. That is what this government is all about - investing in our future and guaranteeing jobs growth.                               Since the legislation was introduced we have seen a 37 per cent jump in mining industry employment in Australia. This is not just about direct employment; it is also about the services sector, logistics, maritime services, and cleaning, legal and financial services, all benefitting Australia, especially in Queensland, from this resources boom. It is about time the Leader of the Opposition apologised to the Australian business sector for denying them an across-the-board cut in company taxation, ensuring the opportunity to spread the benefits of the resources boom.              </DOC>

 I thank the honourable member for her question because it is a very valid question when we raise small business in this place and so rare that I get an opportunity or the government gets the opportunity -                                                                     Mr BRENDAN O'CONNOR:                   to respond to questions in relation to small business. There is no doubt that, as a result of the scare campaign by the Leader of the Opposition and indeed the coalition generally, there are some concerns in relation to the assertions made by the opposition, but I can assure the small business community that we are responding to the needs of that sector.                              We have done that, of course, by announcing a tax cut from 30c in the dollar to 29c in the dollar, effective from 1 July this year. We have also done that by announcing an instant asset tax write-off of up to $6,500 for each asset, which is a fantastic opportunity for small business across the country. Whether you are incorporated or not, you are able to get much better cash flow and a greater capacity to invest early on in the business because of the instant asset tax write-off in this country. Indeed, for those businesses that are not incorporated, because of the increase in the tax threshold from $6,000 to $18,200 there are also other benefits that flow there.                              What we will continue to do in this country as a government is represent the interests of small business. We did it recently with the announcement of the small business commissioner. We have done so by providing tax relief and lifting the burden of tax upon businesses in this country by introducing the minerals resource rent tax. We will continue to do that. By way of comparison, we see the Leader of the Opposition be the only Liberal leader in living memory who opposes tax cuts for business in this country.              </DOC>

 I thank the member for Hunter for his question and acknowledge that he moved a motion in the House just yesterday recognising the importance of the MRRT, because he understands the need to provide critical infrastructure in capacity constrained mining regions, including in the Hunter Valley of New South Wales. That is exactly what the Regional Infrastructure Fund under the MRRT is about: giving back to the communities that are impacted by the consequences that have occurred as a result of the mining boom.                              When you travel to many of the mining communities you are struck by the fact that, whilst there is enormous wealth being generated, there are also massive shortages of critical infrastructure, a lack of planning, a lack of foresight and pressure on those communities. It is not just me who says that, because another member of this place said this:                              I share the disappointment about how few mining companies contribute to the areas they invade and how little state governments return of the massive royalty incomes they receive to the communities.                              That was the Leader of the National Party, speaking about the invasion of these companies into these communities - but, of course, opposing infrastructure development in these communities.                              That is what they did when they said no to the MRRT in this place and in the other place last night. They said no to the Scone level crossing study in the member for Hunter's electorate; no to the Gladstone Port Access Road, $50 million, in the electorate of Flynn; no to the Blacksoil Interchange project, $54 million, in the electorate of Blair; no to the Townsville Ring Road project, $160 million, in Herbert; no to the Peak Downs Highway project, $120 million, in Capricornia; no to the upgrade of the intersection of the Bruce and Capricornia highways, another $40 million; and no to the Mackay Ring Road Study.                                                                    Mr ALBANESE:                   Those opposite just say no, no, no, including to regional infrastructure in their communities.                                                                  The member for Dawson then left the chamber.                                                                                    Mr ALBANESE:                   He should be embarrassed by opposing this infrastructure in his own electorate. But it is not just here, because Campbell Newman has been on the Queensland campaign trail promising funds from the minerals resource rent tax for projects such as the Toowoomba Bypass because it does not fit in with his funding model. It is absurd. You cannot have the benefits without having the revenue stream, and that is what this government understands. That is why we have put in place a fair system to spread the benefits of the mining boom to the many - not just their few mates.               </DOC>

 Very simply, the former Secretary to the Treasury has made it very clear that Treasury regards those 10-year estimates as being completely unreliable.                                                                    Mr SWAN:                   They can protest all they like but they know this because it was a statement made in Senate estimates. The member for North Sydney likes to ignore it, but he has a lot of hide to come in here opposing a resource rent tax - absolutely opposing it, lock, stock and barrel - and then to make all sorts of wild and exaggerated claims about revenue streams. The facts are these -                                                                     Mr SWAN:                   The shadow Treasurer is asserting that we should have a bigger MRRT after coming into the House and opposing its passage. How hypocritical can you get? The fact is that the former Secretary to the Treasury has made it very clear he does not regard those results as being -                                                                     Mr SWAN:                   Mr Speaker, I withdraw.

 I thank the member for Kingston for her question. I know she is a very passionate advocate for all members of her local community and that, in particular, she is a passionate advocate for small business. She has 13,500 thriving small businesses in her electorate. That is why she is very pleased to have supported the government's legislation to introduce a mining tax to spread the benefits of the mining boom.                              This government is determined to manage the economy in the interests of working people. That is why we have introduced a mining tax, which will ensure that the benefits of the mining boom can be spread to all corners of this country. As a result of this initiative and the support this government has provided both for working people and for small businesses, many millions of small businesses and many millions of working people will soon receive the benefits of the mining boom. Some 2.7 million small businesses will receive the benefit of the instant asset write-off, which will allow them to invest in the productive capacity of their businesses and make sure they can continue to employ people and generate wealth. This is what people in this place should be doing to support small business.                              In addition to supporting small business, we have supported the millions of Australian workers who deserve an increase in their superannuation. By increasing the superannuation guarantee charge we can increase the superannuation savings and benefits that Australians retire on. We have also targeted some of these initiatives at low-income earners to ensure that they get the benefits of the mining boom.                              Those on the other side have been determined to oppose these measures. They voted against these measures in the House and the Senate and they have foreshadowed that when the company tax cuts come forward they will vote against them as well. It is more than just a little ironic to see those on the other side prepared to come into this place and vote against the interests of small businesses. The member for Swan is prepared to come into this place and vote against the interests of the 19,200 small businesses in his electorate. The member for Cowan is prepared to come into this place and vote against the interests of the 16,400 small businesses in his electorate. I am asked about the impacts of not spreading the benefits of the mining boom -                                                                     Mr BRADBURY:                   I am asked about the impact of not spreading the benefits of the boom. We know that we can deliver a mining tax to keep the resources sector strong and spread the benefits to all Australians. It was not that long ago that those on the other side said that this tax -                                                                     Mr BRADBURY:                   would kill the goose that lays the golden egg. There are millions of Australian businesses and workers and the only goose they have to worry about -               </DOC>

                                                      I thank the member for Werriwa for his question and his interest in small business. There are 7,000 small businesses in his electorate and they will all be beneficiaries of the government's decision to provide tax relief in the form of instant asset tax write-offs and company tax cuts. In answer to his question, and this is consistent with the question asked of the Treasurer by the member for Goldstein, I can assure the House and the entire country that the instant                   asset tax write-offs will apply to all of the 2.7 million businesses in this country. The fact is that this tax relief will be provided to incorporated and unincorporated businesses. That means that, whether you are a sole proprietor, an independent contractor, a microbusiness or a small business generally, you will be a beneficiary of the instant asset tax write-off of up to $6,500 for each asset. Further to that, there is a $5,000 tax write-off for company vehicles. That is in addition to the tax cut from 30c in the dollar to 29c in the dollar for incorporated companies, and there is further relief for those businesses that are unincorporated in the form of an increase to the tax threshold for individual taxpayers from $6,000 to $18,200. This government understands the need to provide relief for businesses across the country, which is the opposite position from that taken by the Leader of the Opposition and the coalition generally. Such a point of distinction between the government and the opposition is remarkable.                                                                                  As a result of the legislation being passed in the Senate last night it is effectively the mechanism to distribute the mineral wealth during a mining boom. This is absolutely critical because, as we know, some sectors of our economy are confronting challenges, not the least of which is the high Australian dollar. For that reason we have to respond in kind to provide support and tax relief to those businesses in those sectors of our economy. Whether it be tourism or manufacturing, there is a need to provide support. This initiative provides support in the form of instant asset tax write-offs for small businesses which really do help with cash flow - particularly if you are a start-up business or a microbusiness. Certainly, the company tax cut will provide relief. The government is proud to do this and we do it for businesses. We just wish that Tony                   Abbott would get out of the way and support tax cuts for companies.                              </DOC>

 I thank the member for Sturt for his question and I note that in the combined electorates of the party he represents four million people will benefit from an increase in superannuation from the legislation passed last night. Furthermore, I refer the member for Sturt to yesterday's answer. It is a public report. It is available to all. The Senate committee released it on Friday. We all understand in this place that there has been a process underway to investigate allegations into the HSU or certain branches of it. We also understand in this place that that process is independent. We also understand in this place -                                                                     Mr SHORTEN:                   I refer the member for Sturt to my answer yesterday. I also refer the members of this House to the process which has been underway. The report has been concluded into one part of the union. That matter has now been referred, at the discretion of the General Manager of Fair Work Australia, to the Australian Government Solicitor's office. We are a government who, despite the calls from those opposite, will not interfere politically with this investigation. I understand why this question has been asked. I understand perfectly well -                                                                     Mr SHORTEN:                   The opposition do not want to talk about the benefits of the mining tax and they will do anything -               </DOC>

 I thank the member for Makin very much for his question and all the work that he does, particularly for older Australians, in his electorate. This government is determined to make sure it does everything it possibly can to support Australians after a lifetime of work. With the passage of the mining tax through the Senate last night we are going to see millions of Australians benefit from increased superannuation, and that will include many people in the electorate of Makin. I know that they will be very pleased with that decision.                              I can also inform the House and the member for Makin that from today Australia's 3.4 million pensioners are also receiving another increase - an increase because of this government's determination to make sure that pensioners are being looked after. It is this government that delivered a historic increase to the pension back in 2009 and we also delivered improvements to the way in which the pension keeps up with the cost of living. That is why since 2009 we have increased the pension for single pensioners on the maximum rate by $154 a fortnight - $154 a fortnight that all of those opposite just wanted to say no to. Since 2009, a couple on the maximum rate have received $156 a fortnight extra because this government is determined to do everything it possibly can for pensioners who need that help now and for those who need increased support through their superannuation.                              In addition to those changes, in May and June this year the government will also be providing additional assistance to pensioners. We will make sure that singles get $338 and couples get $510 combined. All of that will be delivered by this government. I was also asked by the member for Makin about any danger to these increases. What we know is that those opposite want to claw back more than $300 out of the pockets of pensioners. That is exactly what this Leader of the Opposition is going to do to them.              </DOC>

 Thank goodness for that. The whole purpose of implementing the minerals resource rent tax is to finance a small business tax break, a company tax rate reduction, investment in infrastructure and boosting the superannuation of 8.4 million working people. The member for Fraser asks the question: What is the impact on competitiveness of introducing the MRRT in order to cut the company tax rate? The purpose of it is to ensure that those businesses that are not in the mining industry fast lane can be as competitive as possible. In order to make them competitive, to support their desire to be competitive, we need to, where we can, implement a competitive company income tax rate to increase the possibility of retained earnings because, out of those retained earnings, you can then get the productive investment that they are seeking to improve their overall competitiveness. This is true for all incorporated entities in Australia.                              The member for Goldstein asked a question today about the impact of this measure on small businesses. And the truth is he is clueless. We have a small business tax break that applies to each and every small business in this country - 2.7 million small businesses employing almost five million people - which has the same purpose, to encourage investment in productivity-increasing activities. That is the whole purpose of the MRRT - to increase the competitiveness of these businesses.                              On this issue of supporting company tax reform, the former member for Higgins said, 'We would welcome the bipartisan support of the opposition if it could rise to the challenge of supporting national interest reform.' They are true words; they should be supported. The fact is that this Leader of the Opposition wants to increase taxes. He wants to increase the company tax rate, thwart these tax cut reductions for small business and for all business. I say to the Leader of the Opposition: What is wrong with you? You are not even good at being Liberal.              </DOC>

                                                      I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. I am aware of the report, and of course I am aware that many Australian families struggle to make ends meet and certainly feel the pressure when the electricity bill comes in. It is important that Australian families be clear about the causes of rising electricity prices. The truth is that we have seen over decades and decades underinvestment in the capital necessary for our electricity systems, and that means that we are now seeing catch-up investment with all of the costs that come with that catch-up investment. The fact that this exists as a pressure on electricity prices has been acknowledged by all sides of politics. I do note, for example, that the member for Groom acknowledged this when he said that power prices were set to double over the next five to seven years, irrespective of who was in government - lack of planning had led to an investment drought. He also said:                                                                                  Australians in all states are feeling the impacts of rising power prices, in large part due to the neglect and mismanagement of State Governments.                                                                                  I know on all sides of politics there has been an acknowledgement of power rises and that, for example, the Premier of Western Australia, Colin Barnett, apologised to the people of Western Australia for increasing electricity charges by as much as 50 per cent. He said:                                                                                  That was a difficult decision. I knew it was the right decision                   _                   I apologise for it for the hurt. But we had to do it.                                                                                  That was an acknowledgement of the pressures that exist as a result of underinvestment in electricity generation and electricity supply due to, I would say, some severe neglect by state governments.                                                                                   In respect of carbon pricing, which comes into effect on 1 July, of course Australians around the nation will see assistance for an average family of more than $500 a year. There will be tax cuts, increases in family payments and increases in pensions. There will be that money on hand to assist people and, as we know in this parliament, the threat to Australians having and retaining that money is the Leader of the Opposition.                              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Kingston for her question and I thank her for her continued advocacy on behalf of the people of her electorate and the people of South Australia about the future of the River Murray. I was very pleased to join her this morning, along with other South Australian government MPs - the member for Wakefield, the member for Makin, the member for Hindmarsh, the member for Adelaide and Mr Butler - as well as Senator Wong at an event organised by the Adelaide Advertiser to put a spotlight on the River Murray. As a result of that event, many people in this parliament today are wearing the badges that say they love the River Murray.                               I would like to congratulate the Adelaide Advertiser for its continued focus on the future of the River Murray. Growing up in South Australia, I understand what it is like for the people of South Australia and the people of Adelaide to worry about the future of the river. I know what it is like to be in Adelaide in days of drought. I know what it is like to have that sense of relying for your water security on the river and knowing that what is available in South Australia depends so much on the conduct of others upstream. I understand that the people of Adelaide do worry about too much water having been taken out of the Murray and, as a result, they worry about its future. We are working through a -                                                                     Ms GILLARD:                    Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I understand an alternative view is being expressed about whether or not we should focus on the River Murray. I would be very grateful for the member to put it very clearly on the record and then we will compare whether or not it equates with, for example, what the member for Sturt says. That would be a very interesting comparison. As for the government, we are very focused on making sure that this important national river system, the Murray-Darling Basin, is managed properly and managed nationally.                               We are very focused on the needs of the river. We want to see environmental benchmarks, like the mouth of the river being open nine years out of 10, met. We want to make sure that there is security, that there is an understanding of what will happen for the future of the river and that we do have a reform that meets the needs of South Australia, that meets environmental benchmarks like keeping the mouth of the Murray open nine years out of 10 and that meets the needs of the people of South Australia. We will continue to work through to secure a Murray-Darling Basin plan. The people of South Australia have an opportunity to have their voices well and truly heard in that debate. I welcome them lifting their voices today, and we look forward to continuing to hear the voice of South Australia.               </DOC>

  To the member who asked the question, of course I value very much what businesses around the country do in creating wealth and prosperity and in providing jobs for Australians. Indeed, I value that so much that we want to lift some of their burdens by giving them a company tax cut. We want to lift some of their burdens by making sure that they pay less company tax. I think it is probably very disappointing for the member who asked the question that he is not in a position to walk in the front door of that business to meet with the people who work there and to say to them that he supports a company tax cut for that business.                                                                     Ms GILLARD:                    I was asked a question which went to the continuation of this business, its welfare and its ability to provide work for Australians, and I am addressing that question. In addressing that question, I think it is relevant to note that the government wants to provide that business with a tax cut as part of ensuring that Australians around the nation get a fair share of the resources boom. I understand that those opposite are opposed to this business getting its fair share of the resources boom - they want it to pay more tax - but I do not think that members opposite can come into this parliament and feign concern about individual businesses and not acknowledge that they are opposed to providing those businesses with a tax cut.                              On the question of carbon pricing and that business, and Australian businesses generally, we are determined to make sure that we seize the benefits of a clean energy future and that we do it in the most cost-effective way - that is, we do it in a way that is best for Australian businesses and Australian working people, because it is at the least cost. That is the plan of the government, a least-cost plan, and it stands in stark contrast to the shambolic, expensive scheme that that Leader of the Opposition advocates -                                                                     Ms GILLARD:                    which of course includes making the working people at that business worse off by taking tax cuts off them, by taking family payment increases off them and by taking pension increases off aged members of their families. If you care about the Australian economy, its strength and its future, if you care about making sure that we cut carbon pollution, you have got an obligation to look for the lowest cost way to do it. We have. The Leader of the Opposition and his political party have not, and that is bad for Australian businesses and Australian jobs.              </DOC>

  I want to thank the member for Hindmarsh for his question. He has shown a long-term interest, as have the many South Australian members on this side of the House, in wanting to see a good outcome in a national approach to the Murray-Darling Basin.                              One hundred and twenty-two days ago, the consultation on the draft plan began. There are only 26 days left in that consultation process. There have been meetings held, which a number of members from each side of this House have attended. Some members from my own side have made submissions. I know the member for Kingston has made a submission, calling for a tougher plan and wanting a better outcome for South Australia. I know some members opposite have stood up and asked for the numbers to go down in respect of their communities.                              The difference between the submissions from each side of the House during this consultation process is that on this side of the House, when we are participating in that process, we participate with the certainty of knowing we will be on the side of backing the reform when it lands. We know that we will be on the side of having a national approach to the Murray-Darling Basin, whereas the most notable submission from those opposite was the one made by the Leader of the Opposition at the Griffith meeting, when he said that he would only support a 'good plan' without defining what a good plan would or would not involve.                                                The member for Wakefield then left the chamber.                                                                                    Mr BURKE:                    There is a clear game that is going on during the consultation process with the Leader of the Opposition not defining what a good plan is or what a good plan would be. With 26 days to go, he is running down the clock without saying what he would and what he would not support. If your support is conditional -                                                 The member for Solomon then left the chamber.                                                                                    Mr BURKE:                    then you have got to let on to the public what those conditions are. Instead, what happens is they just run down the clock so that when the basin authority comes back with a final plan those opposite can say, 'Oh, that's not what we meant by a good plan,' and then, reluctantly, the Leader of the Opposition will be compelled to vote no. Who would have thought? Who would have thought that you would have a design of a line which is - every step of the way there - to not let on what sort of plan you would vote for, and, in the whole consultation period, to run down the clock for the final 26 days and not make clear what the conditions would be for coalition support?                              Make no mistake: there are people on this side of the House who are arguing strongly for changes to the plan. But there is no-one on this side of the House, during the consultation period, who is saying, 'Let's spike the reform.' There is no-one on this side of the House who is saying that we should abandon the hope of having a national plan. Yet every word that has come from the mouth of the Leader of the Opposition has been designed to get to the day the authority comes back and then say, 'Oh, I never thought I had to support something like that - I will just vote no.'              </DOC>

  To the member's question I say this: I want to make sure that we are supporting small businesses in this country, medium sized businesses in this country and bigger businesses in this nation, which is why I want to ensure those businesses get a tax cut. I want to ensure that the very business the member refers to gets a tax cut.                              Unfortunately, the member who asked the question, who professes concern about this business, is opposed to giving that business a tax cut. I hope he has taken the opportunity to explain that to every person who works there.                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    Of course, I am talking about the future of this business. In its future I want to see it get a tax cut and get tax relief. Whether it is incorporated or not I want to see it get a benefit - a company tax cut, if it is incorporated. Whether it is incorporated or not it will get the benefit of an instant asset write-off of $6,500 a year. Whether it is incorporated or not it will have the ability to get a tax benefit of $5,000 when buying a new motor vehicle. The member who asked the question is opposed to all of that.                              On the question of carbon pricing and this business, or any Australian business, and the Australian nation, if we are committed to reducing our carbon pollution by five per cent by 2020, as is bipartisan politics in this parliament, then action needs to be taken. Once you have agreed to that - reducing it by five per cent - there is only one question you then need to ask yourself. Do you do it in the most cost effective way or do you do it in a more expensive way?                              Prime Minister Howard and his government recognised that the most cost effective way of reducing carbon pollution was to put a price on carbon. Prime Minister Howard was right. The Leader of the Opposition was right when he campaigned with Prime Minister Howard on that platform in the 2007 election. All of the members of the coalition who are on the record supporting carbon pricing -                                                                     Ms GILLARD:                    as the most effective plan, the cheapest plan, are right. Consequently, if we are to cut carbon pollution and look after this business that is the plan we need and it is the plan the government has provided. We do not need the costly plan, smashing into families at $1,300 a year, as recommended by the Leader of the Opposition.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Lyne for his question. I know he is centrally interested in this because of the role he plays on the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit. Since coming to government we have made a significant number of reforms to improve whole-of-government transparency and accountability in grants programs. So we established the Commonwealth Grant Guidelines in 2009 following the highly critical Auditor-General report into the program run by the Howard government - which came, for good reasons, to be known as 'regional rorts'. Having seen that slamming report, in which the word 'corruption' was used, we determined that it was appropriate to act.                              Our government has implemented the first ever comprehensive guidelines, established at the Commonwealth level, to ensure transparency in federal grants programs. I note that the Audit Office, in its report, has said - positively - about this development:                              For the first time, the Government's expectations for Ministers, agencies and officials when performing duties in relation to grants administration, were clearly articulated.                              The office of the auditor has examined some 800 ministerial briefs. It has identified only 33 cases of under-reporting of grants in a minister's electorate. So there is that transparency, and I think that that transparency is a good thing.                              With the Auditor-General now having pointed out this matter, the message must be received by ministers and by departments - because, as the member would be aware, in the audit report there is reference to the conduct of departments in dealing with these questions - that these guidelines must be honoured and must be honoured consistently. But I would point out to the House that we have seen a considerable improvement from the free-for-all we saw under the Howard government. Overwhelmingly the Audit Office, in looking at these briefs, has found compliance. It has found noncompliance in a limited number of cases.                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    The message is now clear to all ministers and all departments about the need for compliance with these guidelines.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Moreton for that very important question. We on this side of the House understand the importance of the change in weight in the global economy of the movement from west to east. That is producing a stunning investment pipeline of something like $455 billion in resources in Australia. We on this side of the House understand the absolute importance of spreading the benefits of that investment pipeline right across our country and right across every postcode. That is why we have introduced the MRRT as the revenue stream that will fund a tax break for 2.7 million small businesses through the $6,500 instant asset write-off. In the electorate of Moreton, that will go to something like 19,400 small businesses. That is why we are having this historic boost to superannuation savings, which will go to 8.4 million workers in our country. It is worth an additional $100,000 for a 30-year-old on average earnings. In the electorate of the member for Moreton, that is something like 50,000 people who will benefit, across all age groups.                              This is a massive way to spread the benefits of the resources boom right around our country. But we should also do more, and that is why we on this side of the House want to cut the company tax rate by 1c, starting first of all with small businesses and then moving across the board. There is a very clear contrast here, because those opposite want to jack it up by 1½ per cent. They do not really have any comprehension of what it is like for all those businesses that are not in the fast lane of the resources boom - for example, small businesses on the Sunshine Coast, and right around the country.                              I have been having a look at the difference between, say, a 29c rate and 31½c across various industry sectors. In the manufacturing sector that would be an additional tax bill of $392 million in manufacturing alone if they had their way. In the retail sector it would be a difference of $270 million.                                                                    Mr SWAN:                    In the retail trade sector and the wholesale sector it would be an additional $400 million of tax paid by companies. In the media and telco sector it would be an additional $188 million and in the construction sector $322 million. In agriculture, forestry and fishing, an additional $306 million would be paid by companies in those sectors. So a proposal to increase corporate tax, precisely at the time -                </DOC>

  To the member for Hinkler, perhaps I could use these words in answer to him: 'You can't reduce greenhouse gas emissions unless you have a price on carbon.' They are the words of John Howard on 27 May 2007. I think Prime Minister Howard was absolutely right. The member for Hinkler thought he was absolutely right too because he campaigned alongside him -                                                                     Ms GILLARD:                    I was referring to one eminent Australian who thought it was fair to put a price on carbon, that being former Liberal Prime Minister John Howard and his cabinet colleagues and backbench colleagues who campaigned alongside him for a price on carbon. Prime Minister Howard believed that because Prime Minister Howard, as I do, believes -                                                                     Ms GILLARD:                    If, as I do, you believe we need to cut carbon pollution - and that is bipartisan politics in this parliament - then you have got to work out how to do it. The cheapest, most effective way to do it is to put a price on carbon.                               Then, having put a price on carbon, you need to support Australian families as they go about their daily work, including Australian families as they go about paying their power bills. We have determined to do just that, to make sure that we use money that flows from a price being paid by companies that are generating carbon pollution to support Australian families, including the Queensland families that the member refers to. So, looking at an average family, they will receive assistance of more than $500 a year to deal with impacts flowing from putting a price on carbon. Many families in fact will end up with more assistance through tax cuts or family payments or pension increases than they need - that is, they will end up in front as a result of the government's scheme.                               To the member who asked the question, I simply ask him to contemplate the alternative. He himself is a member of a political party committed to reducing carbon pollution by five per cent by 2020. I ask him: why does he want to do that in a way that is more costly for Queensland families? Why does he want to reject the advice of former Liberal Prime Minister John Howard about the most cost-effective way to do this? Like the Leader of the Opposition, he is committed to sending those families a $1,300 bill.              </DOC>

  I thank the honourable member for his question. It reflects an interest that many members of parliament have in the integrity of our electoral system. It reflects a concern that this parliament has had since 1984, 28 years ago, the first time we legislated to create a disclosure regime for political donations - a regime that was put in place to ensure transparency, a regime that was put in place to ensure integrity and a regime that was put in place because it acknowledges the fundamentally important role played by individuals and organisations who wish to contribute to the political debate.                              On my side of politics we have trade unions that make donations to political parties. Their donations are disclosed. I was asked in particular about donations of $1 million, and it is of course the case that in the last election the Greens party did receive a donation of $1.6 million from Mr Greg Wood. But I was caused earlier this week following media reports to peruse the total contributions of other individuals too. The House may wish to be aware that the contributions of individuals of substantial net worth are now at a point that should be brought to the attention of this place. High net worth individuals of course are at liberty to make decisions to support our political parties and our political processes, as is their wont. I was made aware that last year Mr Clive Palmer made a contribution in the order of $1 million to the coalition. I am aware that the total contribution now to the coalition from individuals -                                                                   The member for Mackellar then left the chamber.                                                                                    Mr GRAY:                    While on the subject of the core of the question, which is individuals of high net worth making contributions, the total contribution to the coalition now from Mr Palmer is over $4 million - in the last few years, $4 million. I make the observation that never in the history of our parliament have we had an allegation of corrupt or inappropriate behaviour from any of us in this place about donors to the political system. I do make this observation.

Mr GRAY:                    The amount now of $4 million in donations, as recently disclosed by the Australian Electoral Commission, is a point of note for all Australians. It is a very large number. It is a number which is important for us to understand - and the purposes perhaps behind it.               </DOC>

  Mr Speaker, I heard the shadow Treasurer make this statement on television this morning. I am not sure how he can do the work of the tax commissioner or indeed of the Treasury. What I can say is that we have put in place the MRRT. We have worked closely with the industry. In particular, through the Argus process we worked our way through the design of the tax, and we are absolutely satisfied that the revenue streams that we have forecast will be delivered. I do not know on what basis the shadow Treasurer makes that claim; I do not know on what basis he makes it at all.                                                                  The member for                   Cowan                   then left the chamber.                                                                                    Mr SWAN:                    If he has some information he would like to share with the government or with the parliament I would certainly welcome the receipt of it, but for him to claim he could do the job of the tax commissioner in this parliament just demonstrates how he has not got the most basic understanding of the tax system.              </DOC>

  I thank the Chief Government Whip for his question. Indeed, the House has now passed almost 300 pieces of legislation in the 43rd Parliament, delivering a mainstream agenda, making sure we get the economy right, making sure that we create jobs and taking action on climate change, better retirement incomes and of course nation-building infrastructure. This is significant progress, in spite of the obstacles and the relentless negativity we get from those opposite and also from some outside the parliament.                              All of our major reforms have been opposed by those opposite and fought for on the floor of this chamber, and their actions have been supported, and indeed bankrolled, by their allies outside this place. We will see one of them outside this place tomorrow morning, when Clive Palmer addresses tomorrow's Global Warming Hoax rally. We will see, yet again, Clive Palmer with all the signs and the whole campaign.                                                                     Mr ALBANESE:                    Maybe we will see the member for Indi travel to outside my electorate office to attend a meeting with these people, Mr Speaker.                                                                    Mr ALBANESE:                    Indeed what is relevant, Mr Speaker, is what occurs in terms of the legislation that is before this parliament and whether people use their great wealth to try to undermine the processes of this parliament. Mr Palmer is saying that he will take the legislation that was carried by this parliament to the High Court. He does not respect the views that have been put by the democracy in this parliament through the House of Representatives and the Senate.                                                                    Mr ALBANESE:                    With the legislation that is before this parliament it is very important that we take into account people's views. It is important that we take into account people's views based upon the democratic principle of one vote one value, not on the basis of people's wealth or their the ability to influence. It is important also that we respect the democratic decisions of this parliament. The Treasurer outlined the significant benefits that we are making through this parliament in reducing the taxation regimes of small business. Those opposite are supporting slugging those small businesses with increased tax just so that they can give a tax cut -                                                                     Mr ALBANESE:                    to Mr Palmer. I table the Courier-Mail article  which says, 'Liberals ask Clive Palmer to be party president.'              </DOC>

  I do welcome that question because we hear questions like this, and points made like this, from those opposite all the time - talking down our economy every day, every week and every year. The fact is that our public finances are in the best shape of any developed economy in the world.                                                                    Mr SWAN:                    I know that they guffaw, but the truth is this: they like to come into this House and pretend there is nothing like a global financial crisis or a global recession.                                                                    Mr SWAN:                    As a consequence of the global financial crisis, and the global recession, we have written down our revenues by $140 billion over the forward estimates.                                                                    Mr SWAN:                    One hundred and forty billion dollars has been written down over the forward estimates, and in the mid-year budget review last November we wrote them down by $20 billion, coming to $140 billion over the forward estimates - and that is why we are in deficit. We are in deficit because we moved to support our economy, during a global recession, to keep the doors of small business open and to keep Australian workers in their jobs. We have behaved completely -                                                                     Mr SWAN:                    I have been addressing the very narrow question. The reason that we have had these outcomes is revenue write-downs. We are currently engaged in the fastest fiscal consolidation in our history to bring our budget back to surplus in 2012-13.                                                                    Mr SWAN:                    The reason we have deficits is that revenues have been weak. But they choose to stick their heads in the sand and not understand the most basic elements of macroeconomics. It just shows how unqualified they are for government in this country.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for her question, because I think a lot of members in this chamber would have been concerned to hear these allegations that were very widely aired by Mr Palmer, who asserts that one of our closest intelligence allies is using its intelligence agency to stop coal seam gas investments in Australia. This is a pretty extraordinary claim and I would have thought that those opposite - I mention in particular the member for Berowra, a member of the joint intelligence committee and a distinguished former Attorney-General who had a very close relationship, as in fact many Attorneys-General have had, with our intelligence agencies in the US and in Australia -                                                                     Ms ROXON:                    The point I am making is that when allegations like this are made about one of our closest allies it is important for us to call it what it is. This is a bizarre allegation and I do have to wonder whether perhaps Mr Palmer has been watching too much Get Smart. Certainly he is working very closely with 'KAOS' over there. I just want to say that it is an important issue. Our intelligence agencies work closely with our allies. The Americans are lead allies. To have such a donor closely associated with the opposition -                                                                     Ms ROXON:                    The point that I am simply trying to make is that national security is much more than jokes about shoe phones or jokes about other things. National security is about protecting real people from real threats, about making sure that our laws are operating properly, and I would have thought that those opposite would want to dissociate themselves from comments like this that just feed conspiracy theories and do us no justice when we want to work closely with those around the world to share intelligence about real threats that are emerging across the world. What I am calling upon the opposition to do is to make sure the Leader of the Opposition calls Mr Palmer and gives him a dressing down for this sort of behaviour - and he can use his shoe phone if he thinks that is a better idea.                                                                  The member for Fadden then left the chamber.                              </DOC>

  I will restrain myself, Mr Speaker. I just have to go back and run through some of the facts. We have a $6,500 instant asset write-off which can be claimed by up to 2.7 million small businesses. That will be a very substantial benefit, particularly to the cash flow of many struggling businesses right around our country. In the last budget, we did say that the first $5,000 of any car purchase - namely, a ute - could be written off within that framework. That is what we have said so yet again I have not the faintest idea what he is talking about.              </DOC>

  I thank the honourable member for his question, which goes to what is being done in the national interest to tackle people-smuggling. This week, debate started in the House on the legislation moved by the honourable member for Lyne. That legislation would allow the government of the day to implement deterrence to dangerous boat journeys to Australia. It is legislation that the government will support in the national interest. The bill from the member for Lyne would allow the minister to designate a country if it is part of the Bali process, if the minister is satisfied with the protections and, perhaps most importantly, if the country involved agrees to be a partner with Australia in that endeavour.                              It is very important that the country involved agree to receive people transferred. For example, a minister could not be satisfied with the protections in place if that country had not agreed to receive people. Whether people are being removed from Australia by boat or by plane, I would have thought it would be evident to most reasonable people that you would actually have to have the agreement of the country in question.                                                                    Mr BOWEN:                    Even those opposite have recognised this in the past. At the last election, the Liberal Party's policy was that 'a commitment from the return country not to return persons seeking asylum to the place from which they came, claiming to be fleeing persecution, would be key'. That statement would lead you to believe that, if such an agreement could not be reached, nobody would be returned to that country. But, alas, it pains me to say that that appears now not to be the case. We have had a major policy development from the opposition. The Leader of the Opposition is good at saying no, but when a close partner and neighbour says no he appears not to understand the meaning of the word.                              The Indonesian foreign minister said in this building last week that it would be impossible and ill-advised to have boats turned around on the high seas and sent to Indonesia. He said, 'That would give you a hint of our approach.' He is right. Hints do not get much bigger than that. Yet the Leader of the Opposition seems to think that this policy is not dead. Apparently it is just pining for the fjords. The policy of turning back the boats is not dead, and the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Cook seem to say that it does not matter what Indonesia thinks, they will send people there regardless. They say they want a foreign and asylum policy that is Jakarta focused. Well Jakarta have told us their focus and their focus is to reject the cheap populism of those opposite, to reject this cheap policy which puts at risk the lives of Australian Defence personnel and -                                                                     Mr BOWEN:                    Australia's asylum seekers. It breaches our international conventions and will never work.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Page for her question and her long association with small business. Indeed, she has over 11,000 small businesses in her own electorate. I also thank her for her advocacy for the small business commissioner, something that we have responded to in recent times.                              The Gillard government, of course, is committed to helping Australia's 2.7 million small businesses around the country. We are helping them in a number of very important ways. Firstly, there is the reduction in the company tax rate from 30c in the dollar to 29c. Secondly, there are the income tax rates from 1 July for those unincorporated small business owners, who will receive an increase because of the increase in the tax threshold to $18,200. Indeed, I might add that there is also an increase for those who can receive personal tax cuts, if they are an employee of their own company, and also receive the company tax cut. There is the $5,000 write-off for vehicles and the $6½ thousand instant asset tax write-off for assets purchased in that financial year, which is very important. It provides cash flow solutions to problems that may occur from time to time, particularly for microbusinesses, sole traders - those small companies that really need some assistance.                              I might add, in relation to the question that was asked earlier by the member for Goldstein, in relation to the $6,500 instant asset tax write-off, that that is for each asset purchased under $6,500, not just one asset, so there could be multiple assets. So this is a great boon for small businesses around the country. It can only be done, of course, because we have enacted the minerals resource rent tax -                                                                     Mr BRENDAN O'CONNOR:                    which will allow us to distribute the mineral wealth around the country, providing opportunity for small businesses, particularly those -                                                                   The member for North Sydney then left the chamber.                                                                                    Mr BRENDAN O'CONNOR:                    This is a very important support for businesses, particularly in sectors like tourism and manufacturing that are confronted with challenges including the high Australian dollar.                              I know small businesses are astounded that the opposition has not supported this initiative. One of those is Derek Stewart from Queanbeyan Diesel Service, just down the road from here - indeed, so close that the Leader of the Opposition went there last year to do a media opportunity. Mr Stewart was quoted in the Australian today, and he said he was concerned that the Leader of the Opposition 'missed the bus' when it came to tax cuts for small business. Well, Mr Speaker, he has missed the bus. I am sure he would not miss Clive Palmer's jet, but he did miss the bus. The fact is that we will continue to -               </DOC>

  In answer to the member for Kooyong's question, first, I draw his attention to what the ANAO actually found. The member for Kooyong had his first question ruled out of order because he in part sought to misrepresent that, and I would counsel him against that in this question as well. Second, I remind the member for Kooyong that this government has moved to introduce guidelines because of the conduct of the Howard government under regional rorts, causing the Auditor-General to author a report that used the word 'corrupt'. The member for Kooyong should understand that. The word 'corrupt' was used in that Auditor-General's report. We have responded to those kinds of findings about the conduct of the Howard government by making sure that there is a new system of transparency.                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. What we intend to do is act in accordance with the findings of the audit report. That is what the government will do. That is, of course, a different approach than has been taken in the past. We are a government that have introduced transparency guidelines because we were disgusted by the conduct of the Howard government. If the member for Kooyong is truly disturbed by such matters then I find it hard to explain how he can serve behind this front bench, given their conduct in the regional rorts affair -                                                                     Ms GILLARD:                    and the conduct of the Howard government generally.              </DOC>

  I would like to make a couple of points. We have a AAA credit rating from the three major financial credit rating agencies globally for the first time in our history. We came through the global financial crisis in better shape than any other advanced economy. We have a strong economy. But, of course, as a consequence of the global financial crisis, the floods in Queensland and events in Europe, there has been a dramatic impact on our budget bottom line.                              Those opposite come into this House and talk down our economy and pretend that the global financial crisis and the global recession never happened. That is what they pretend. They pretend that there has been no impact on our budget revenues, which have been written down by $140 billion over five years. They want the public of Australia to somehow believe that that never happened. Well, the fact is that it did happen.                                                                    Mr SWAN:                    The consequence of that is that we have been running a deficit. But we have been putting in place strict fiscal discipline to come back to surplus. This has been recognised by the OECD and most particularly by the IMF, who have said that the Australian government's fiscal discipline it is an example for the rest of the world. While the IMF, the OECD, the World Bank and other agencies recognise that in the circumstances no other government in the Western world has done a better job than Australia, those opposite come into this House and trash our economy and our public finances with questions like the one we have heard today.                                                                    Mr SWAN:                    I am coming to the substance of the question. The reason we have a deficit is that revenues have been written down. It is not because, as those opposite allege, we are somehow out there on a spending spree. We have supported employment and small business in our economy. We have done it with a responsible fiscal policy that has given us an economy that is the envy of the world. Everybody on this side of the House is proud of our employment performance and is sick of the trash talking about our economy.               </DOC>

                                                      Ms GILLARD:                    I understand that neither the question nor the answer will be of interest to those in this parliament who believe that their job is to represent the few. But those of us on this side of the parliament believe our job is to represent the many and want to see the House informed that today I had the opportunity, with the Minister for Industry and Innovation -                                                                   The member for Gippsland then left the chamber.                                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    the Premier of South Australia, Premier Weatherill, and the representative of the relevant union, Ian Jones, to announce that we are co-investing in the future of Holden in our nation. Holden is an Australian icon. People have known about Holden cars for all of the time that Holden has been here in our nation manufacturing motor vehicles. It is part of the Australian identity.                              In January this year we faced a circumstance where it was possible that there would be no more Holden car manufacturing in this nation. That was a real risk because of changing global conditions and economic circumstances, including, in particular, the impact of the high Australian dollar on manufacturing, including car making. It gives me great pleasure to be able to say to the House that we have worked together with Holden and we have secured Holden to manufacture cars in Australia for the next decade. Holden will be manufacturing two new-generation motor vehicles here in Australia for the next decade. This is a great example of how you can manage your economy to meet the needs of the many, not the few, for the million Australians who rely on manufacturing for their living and who understand how much of a body blow it would be to Australian manufacturing if we lost the car-making industry.                              At the start of this parliamentary session the Leader of the Opposition said he wanted to debate the economy. On this side, during the parliamentary session, we have continued to work on the economy, securing the future for Holden, getting the mining tax through the parliament, passing the means testing of the private health insurance rebate and securing ACCC approval for the structural separation of Telstra. New figures show 150,000 families are benefiting from paid parental leave and 27 per cent more students are at uni. There are new plans for HECS for skills. We are determined to keep managing the economy in the interests of working people; all we see on the other side is division and negativity as they pursue the interests of a privileged few.               </DOC>

  What it confirms is that the government has put in place responsible arrangements to bring the budget back to surplus in 2012-13. The irony of getting a question about the surplus and a profile of spending from a crew that have a $70 billion crater in their budget bottom line!                                                                    Mr SWAN:                    Mr Speaker, it was a question about our surplus and it was a question about the profile of a particular piece of expenditure across the forward estimates. What I am saying is that we have strict fiscal discipline, which is bringing our budget back to surplus. That stands in stark contrast to those opposite, who have a $70 billion crater in their budget bottom line. To fill that crater they want to put up company taxes by 1½ per cent.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Chisholm for that very important question. We on this side of the House have made jobs our No. 1 priority from day one. The heart and soul of any Labor government is making jobs the No. 1 priority. It is why we acted to support jobs in the face of the global financial crisis and the global recession and it is why we avoided recession in this country: to save hundreds of thousands of jobs in Australia, to save people from the unemployment scrap heap and, importantly, to keep open the doors of small business. Since we came to office there are an extra 700,000 jobs in this country. Just think about this for a minute: unemployment in Australia is at 5.2 percent - there is barely a developed economy in the world that can say that unemployment is at that level. It is at twice that level right throughout Europe and is massively higher in the United States.                              If those opposite had had their way Australia would have gone into recession, unemployment would be far higher and we would have seen business closures. We on this side of the House understand the importance of jobs and we understand the importance of the changes that are underway in the global economy - the movement in global economic power from West to East, which is bringing to this country a huge investment pipeline, particularly in resources. We on this side of the House will make sure that the opportunities from that investment pipeline are spread right across our country. That is why we are putting in place the big economic reforms to ensure prosperity for the future. That is why we on this side of the House want to cut company tax by one per cent and those opposite want to check it out by 1½ per cent. That is why we on this side of the House are supporting a significant tax break for 2.7 million small businesses through the $6,500 instant asset write-off and, in particular, supporting the boost to superannuation savings, particularly for young people in our community. If you are a young worker on average wages you will get an extra $100,000 when you retire because of these arrangements. There is a very clear choice, when it comes to jobs in this country, between a government that will go into bat for workers and small business and a wrecking-ball opposition who have a $70 billion crater in their bottom line.              </DOC>

  We in this country have a $1.4 trillion economy, we have an unemployment rate of 5.1 per cent, we have a level of public debt lower than just about any other developed economy, and we have an investment pipeline in this country of $455 billion that is coming into this country to ensure that people are in employment and that our economic prospects are bright. At the height of the global financial crisis and the global recession we acted to support our economy -                                                                     Mr SWAN:                    Now we are putting in place very big economic reforms to make sure prosperity continues. And the opposition come into this House and ask questions like that. It just demonstrates what little appreciation they have of the economic challenges facing our nation.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for New England for his question and his ongoing interest in aged-care matters. In this place we might from time to time end up at different policy destinations, but I think we all start at the same basic proposition: that one of the truest tests of a decent society is how we treat our seniors - those citizens who for years have worked hard, paid taxes and raised their families and who in retirement might need some care and support in return from the community that they helped to build.                              While our aged-care sector has served the nation very, very well over the years, we understand on this side of the House - and I imagine on the other side as well - that it is a sector that requires very real reform. That is why we asked the Productivity Commission in 2010 to conduct a comprehensive inquiry to the future aged-care needs of the nation. As the member knows, the Prime Minister and I released that report in August last year and since that time I have been engaging very closely with the sector, with all stakeholders - provider interests, trade unions and consumer interests, very importantly - to develop a meaningful response to that report.                              I have also had the opportunity to talk directly with more than 4,000 older Australians at a series of two-hour forums conducted across the country to hear their experiences and their expectations of aged care. As the member knows, we conducted a session of that type in Tamworth, which was very well attended, late last year. At the same time the member for New England was able to arrange a meeting between myself and registered nurses in the electorate of New England, where they talked to me about the pay gap between public hospital nurses and aged-care nurses. I also know that the member for New England handed to me a petition this week with, I think, around 4,000 signatures from the electorate of New England, drawing the government's attention to this issue.                              Those consultations have confirmed the Productivity Commission's findings that the supply of a well-trained, properly remunerated and dedicated workforce is perhaps the key supply constraint on our aged-care sector. I also note that a survey of members of National Seniors Australia released last week confirmed that members of that organisation saw that these workforce issues were the major concern that they had about aged care into the future.                              As the member knows, the commission did consider the issues outlined in the member's question - the adequacy of wages and also staffing levels in aged-care facilities - and we are obviously very deeply considering those recommendations along with the 58 other recommendations made by the Productivity Commission. The Prime Minister committed her government last year to starting the process of aged-care reform in this term of government and we remain committed to that commitment.               </DOC>

  I thank the member for Wakefield, who has an extremely direct interest in this issue. This is a Labor government and we stand up for working people. We manage the economy in the interests of working people and in the interests of the manufacturing industry. That is why today we have announced, as the Prime Minister indicated earlier, a $275 million co-investment with General Motors which will secure Holden's Australian car manufacturing operations for a decade.                              The reality is that without this co-investment GM Holden would have closed its Australian manufacturing operations, and that would have cost thousands of highly skilled manufacturing workers' jobs. It would have also meant the loss of vital design and engineering capabilities and would have put other parts of the automotive manufacturing industry in this country under extreme pressure. Instead, the government has secured a commitment from General Motors to keep making cars in Australia until at least 2022. This is a major achievement. This co-investment is part of a total investment package by Holden, by General Motors, in excess of $1 billion and, very importantly, the package is designed to ensure that Holden's operations are competitive while the Australian dollar is around parity with the US dollar. This will be a significant improvement in the competitiveness and productivity of Holden's operations and it will support tens of thousands of jobs throughout the economy. It will also build important business opportunities for car component manufacturers to take part in global supply chains.                              When Labor says we support manufacturing, we mean it. When we say we support workers and their families, we mean it and we act upon it. Instead, the opposition leader pretends to be a friend of manufacturing workers, but what happens when that is put to the test? Those on the other side of this parliament have a policy to take $1.5 billion out of Labor's new car plan which funded the government commitment outlined in today's announcement with Holden. Before the ink was dry on this morning's announcement the coalition rushed out to oppose it. The coalition's position would put tens of thousands of people out of work in this important manufacturing industry. This coalition is full of hypocrisy on issues of this nature.                                                                    Mr COMBET:                    I withdraw, Mr Speaker.               </DOC>

  I would obviously be very pleased to get from the member the details of the incident he refers to and I will investigate it fully. I am very happy to do that. On the broad assertion made by the member, perhaps the member should recognise that the world has been through a global financial crisis, the biggest economic event since the Great Depression of last century. As a result of that global financial crisis hitting economies around the world, including our own, the amount of revenue coming to the government has been fundamentally reduced. That is understandable. You see economic activity reduce, you see businesses under pressure and you therefore see revenue coming to the government also reduced. So the global financial crisis certainly did hit into the government's budget by way of billions and billions and billions of dollars of reduced revenues. It was also hitting into our real economy, which meant that we could have seen thousands and thousands of people lose their jobs, become unemployed - young people who did not get -                                                                     Ms GILLARD:                    Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. The second part of the question reflected on the government's budget management and so I am explaining circumstances in relation to the budget. Of course, when you look at the budget you have to look at money coming in and money going out and, whilst those opposite refuse to recognise it, because of the global financial crisis there was a reduction in revenues flowing into the government. Until the opposition recognise that, they should be viewed as a hopeless joke in the economic debate because that is transparent to anyone who has high school economics or even less.                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    Faced with those budget circumstances we have done a couple of things. We have moved to stimulate the economy to keep people in work. We as a Labor government think jobs are important; those on the other side could not care less about working people having jobs.                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    Mr Speaker, in order to have prudent budget management we of course have worked hard to make sure that across the government's budget we are taking an efficient approach to government expenditure. I will certainly respond to the individual example raised if the member gives me the full details. Generally you can rely on the government to run the government's budget in the interests of working people. It is a very stark contrast to the privileged few billionaires who are always on top of the Leader of the Opposition's list.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Fremantle for her question. Indeed it is the case that, at the start of this parliamentary session, both the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition said that they wanted to engage in an economic debate. There is nothing more important in an economic debate than nation-building infrastructure. What we have done on the side of the chamber is engage in nation building on behalf of the Australian people in the long-term interests of our economy. We have the rolling out of a $37 billion capital works program, the doubling of the roads budget, an increase in rail investment by tenfold - the work we are doing to commit more money to urban public transport since 2007 than all governments combined, from Federation right through to 2007.                              Just last week I convened the first meeting of the Urban Policy Forum, getting together about the implementation of how we build better cities, how we build productivity and how we improve liveability and sustainability in our cities. Of course, we did not have a very high bar in terms of urban public transport, given that not one cent was spent on urban public transport by the former federal government. What we have been doing is running around the country opening projects like the Ballina Bypass, the upgrades of the Hume Highway, the Pacific Highway, Port Botany rail, the Western Ring Road and the Calder Freeway.                              Those works have been taking place. We have also been getting the big policy decisions done through this chamber. The safe rates legislation went through, which will deliver safety for truckies and will have an impact not just on truckies but on all who share the roads with our truck drivers. That was important legislation. The legislation supporting the Regional Infrastructure Fund has gone through, providing infrastructure important to those communities under pressure due to the mining boom, and this morning we had the important delivery of our legislation to revitalise Australian shipping. We make no apologies for wanting to see the Australian flag on the backs of our ships, of replacing ships of shame with the Australian flag in the interests of our national economy, in the interests of our environment and in the interests of our national security. When we came to office, we were ranked 20th out of 25 OECD countries when it came to investing in public infrastructure as a proportion of national income. We have made a difference. We will continue to engage in this economic debate while those opposite in the 'no-alition' just say no, no, no to all of these reforms.              </DOC>

  As I have explained to this parliament before, I think in response to a very similar question, we do have some measures in the carbon pricing package to assist not-for profit organisations. Let me also explain more broadly that, whether it is in Queensland or in any other part of Australia, we have worked through the carbon pricing package to provide support to families and to pensioners so that they will have more money in their hands. Whether it is those workers who are getting a tax cut of $300, whether it is workers who earn less than $80,000, whether it is people getting increases in family payments or whether it is pensioners, we have worked so that nine out of 10 households will receive assistance, and there will be millions of households that will receive more assistance than the average carbon price impact on them. We have also worked in the carbon pricing package -                                                                     Ms GILLARD:                    I was about to point out that we do have a special stream of funds to assist not-for-profit organisations. Of course, because the Leader of the Opposition broadly raised other entities, I am explaining the household assistance package and the fact that people who are members of those organisations will receive money in the form of tax cuts, family payments or pension increases, and there are billions of dollars of support for jobs.                              Specifically on the flights he raises, I draw his attention to the dedicated funding stream under the Low Carbon Communities Program to provide payments to charities to offset the carbon costs they will face for - and these are important words - aviation and maritime transport fuel to assist them. That has specifically been done because we do not want vital services like medical air services to face additional fuel costs from the introduction of a carbon price. So the Leader of the Opposition has raised with me a broad set of circumstances. That is the set of circumstances in relation to not-for-profit organisations and care flights, for example. The set of circumstances for members of sporting clubs is about tax cuts, family payment increases and pension increases, and there are also billions of dollars in support for jobs through the Jobs and Competitiveness Program. This is all a very sharp contrast to the plan of the Leader of the Opposition, which is ill thought out, which would be incredibly costly to the economy and would impose on each family a bill of $1,300.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Deakin for his question, and I thank him for his deep interest in the economy, knowing that it offers jobs and prosperity to working Australians. I thank him for his deep interest in the budget, knowing that it matters to working Australians that tonight's budget responds to the needs of our economy, bringing the budget to surplus whilst of course protecting front-line services for families and building the things that our nation will need for the future, like a National Disability Insurance Scheme, like a better aged-care system and like a better way of looking after the dental needs of Australians who most need our care and concern for their dental care.                              There is no clearer sign of a strong economy than a surplus, and in tonight's budget we will bring the budget to surplus. We have achieved that despite the global financial crisis and despite continued uncertainty in the global economy. Bringing the budget to surplus is the right economic measure now. It will give us a buffer should the global economy take a downturn in the future and it offers the Reserve Bank the maximum room to move on interest rates should it choose to do so. Members in this parliament - or at least on this side of the chamber - would have recognised the relief that many Australians felt when interest rates were reduced by the Reserve Bank in their recent decision, helping people pay the mortgage because of the pressure of the mortgage on Australian family budgets.                              I understand, and the government understands, that Australians are concerned about cost-of-living pressures, and we will continue to work with families to help them make ends meet. That is why we are investing more money in child care than ever before. That is why we instituted a paid parental leave scheme. That is why we have worked to ensure that the tax-free threshold will be tripled so people can see more of the benefits of work in their hands. And that is why we are also introducing a schoolkids bonus, so families can get the benefits of dollars in their hands as they pay for the costs of kids going to school. We know that those school bills, whether they are for excursions or uniforms, can put a lot of pressure on working families.                              Tonight's budget will be a practical plan for Australia to return to surplus and to deliver on Labor values. It will be a truly Labor budget that goes in to bat for millions of Australians on low and middle incomes. They are the people that we have been concerned about as we have put the budget together. It is a budget that goes in to bat for them whilst delivering a budget surplus, the right choice for our economy now.              </DOC>

  I am moderately surprised to get a question from the Leader of the Opposition on the economy. I cannot recall the last time the Leader of the Opposition ever asked me anything about the economy. So in these very unusual circumstances let me address the Leader of the Opposition's question. I understand that the Leader of the Opposition is going into the budget lockup. When he does so, I suggest that he does look at that part of the budget that talks about the questions that he raises with me, and then he can come back tomorrow with a rephrased question. That is what I would say to the Leader of the Opposition first and foremost, because the image he has tried to create in people's minds is a wrong image.                              As usual, the Leader of the Opposition comes into this place making wild and inaccurate claims about the Australian economy. We know, of course, that this follows a long stream of inaccurate claims about the Australian economy and particularly about Australian debt. We have had opposition spokespeople going around claiming that our nation is like one of the nations in Europe. They have been going around trying to spread fear in Australia about the circumstances of our economy. That is, the opposition have believed it is their mission to talk our economy down. The Leader of the Opposition should know, if he knew anything about economics, that in this country we will see net debt peak at less than 10 per cent. That is compared to economies in Europe where net debt is in the order of 80 and 90 per cent. The Leader of the Opposition knows that.                              On questions of what will be in the budget, we will have plenty of time to address that. But I would say to the Leader of the Opposition that when we do work through the budget details revealed tonight he ought to come to this debate acknowledging that the Australian economy is strong in its fundamentals. He should stop talking the Australian economy down. He should acknowledge we came out of the global financial crisis strong because we supported the jobs of working Australians, the government working with responsible employers and trade unions to save 200,000 jobs. He should acknowledge that as a result we have an unemployment rate that is the envy of the world and is half of the unemployment rate being experienced by many in Europe and is well below the unemployment rate of the US. He should acknowledge that our economy has strong fundamentals. That does not mean that there are not Australian businesses facing stress and strain with a strong dollar, but talking our economy down will not help those businesses. And for the first time ever the Leader of the Opposition should walk in here on Thursday with an economic plan, not a load of old rhetoric.              </DOC>

  What the Deputy Prime Minister was referring to this morning was the debt cap changes that the government is bringing to the parliament. This is to deal with volatility during the course of the financial year. Debt will remain below the $250 billion current cap at the end of financial years, but there is volatility during the year. What the Leader of the Opposition, who is obviously struggling to understand the budget - and there is no mystery about that given his lack of interest in economics, as the former Treasurer, Peter Costello, was known to remark on more than one occasion - has obviously not noticed in the budget is that it brings the budget to surplus in 2012-13 exactly as promised. It brings the budget to surplus because that is the right thing for our economy now. It is the clearest sign of a strong economy. It is giving us a buffer for the future. With the government doing the right thing - bringing the budget to surplus - we are giving the Reserve Bank the room to move, should it choose to do so, in reducing interest rates. We know from last week just how important interest rate reductions are to working families.                              We have learnt something else today about the nature of the Leader of the Opposition and his approach to budgeting: he does not trust Australian families. That is the issue before the parliament today. We believe hardworking Australian families can be trusted -                                                                     Ms GILLARD:                    I was indicating, to the Leader of the Opposition's question, the answer: the debt cap; the importance of the budget surplus; and the importance of staying in touch with and understanding the needs of working families and having a bit of respect for their ability to budget, manage and put their children first instead of spending the day insulting them the way the Leader of the Opposition has.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Blair for his question because this is a battler's budget that only a Labor government could deliver. We are proudly back in surplus - light years ahead of our peers. We are proud to be spreading the benefits of the mining boom right around our country, to many more Australians, giving them a stake in our economic success. We are certainly very proud to make room in this budget to provide for the most vulnerable in our community, like Australians with a disability. We are returning to surplus. We are building surpluses over the forward estimates. What we are doing is providing the maximum room for the Reserve Bank of Australia to adjust interest rates should it so decide. What this means is that the interest rate in Australia - the cash rate - is now lower than it was at any time under the previous government. If you have got something like a $300,000 mortgage you are now paying $3,000 a year less than you were paying under the previous government.                              I know everybody on this side of the House understands how important it is to get into surplus, how important it is to stay in surplus and how important that is for the future of interest rates in our community. What we also understand is the importance of assisting low- and middle-income families in our community and spreading the benefits of the mining boom across as many of those households as we can. That is why we are proud to provide additional support to families from 1 July next year via the family tax benefit. We are also particularly proud to be introducing a new schoolkids bonus to provide more support for the cost of education for families - something that is very important. Our future is one that is intertwined with the region. It is not just about a resources boom and what it does here. Our ability to harvest the opportunities of the Asian century in the future depends upon the quality of education for our children. As a government, from day one, we have been investing in education. Another way to do it is to help those families with those cost-of-living pressures that come when the kids are going back to school or starting a new term, and that is why the schoolkids bonus is so important.                              But we are doing more than that. We are giving important tax relief to small business with the instant asset write-off for up to 2.7 million small businesses in our community and by bringing in loss carry-back. All of these are very important ways of ensuring we strengthen our economy and look after low- and middle-income Australians.              </DOC>

  This is a question that I take very seriously, because the government takes its $250 billion debt cap very seriously.                                                                    Mr SWAN:                    Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. The budget papers show that Commonwealth securities on issue are under the existing limit at the end of each year. That is the fact. I know it is an uncomfortable fact and I know it is going to stand in the way of a massive scare campaign that those opposite want to run. I know they will go to any lengths to talk down our economy and to run it down in terms of its international reputation. But those are the facts. We have had a request from the Office of Financial Management to put a buffer in because we do have a challenge when it comes -                                                                     Mr SWAN:                    We have been advised by the Office of Financial Management that we should have a buffer, notwithstanding the fact that at the end of each year we are within that cap. I know those opposite do not understand a lot about financial markets, so we will just run through a couple of the facts. First and foremost, in terms of Commonwealth revenues, they tend to come in in lumps and they tend to come in particularly towards the end of the year. What actually happens is that expenditure is evenly spread across the year. So we have an in-year financing challenge which is made worse by the fact that we have maturing bond lines and as they are maturing we are issuing new ones. That can mean we do go over the cap on a temporary basis but we stay within it at the end of the year. The point that the OFM has made is this, and I will quote from their memo: 'To manage these fluctuations in an efficient and effective manner it is critical that the debt management operations of the AOFM are not affected by short-term borrowing constraints such as a debt cap or a similar mechanism.' We reported in full in the budget papers what we were intending to do and why we were intending to do it. It is very sensible for Australia and I think that those opposite should just pause for a minute and not play politics with this issue.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for La Trobe for her question, and I know that she is concerned about families in her electorate who can struggle to make ends meet, to pay the bills when they come in and to pay all of the costs for getting the kids to school. In fact, in the member for La Trobe's electorate we have 10,300 families who will receive our schoolkids bonus because they are families with 18,150 school-aged children. That means the families in the member for La Trobe's electorate will see almost $11 million to assist them with the costs of getting the kids to school.                              This is part of a Labor budget, a Labor budget where we have delivered for the economy to make sure that we are doing the right things to keep our economy strong. We have come out of the global financial crisis strong and we work together to achieve it. The government is playing its part with employers and trade unions to keep people in jobs. Now, as our economy returns to trend growth, is the right time to deliver a surplus, to give us a buffer for the future, to ensure the Reserve Bank has the room to move, should it choose to do so, and reduce interest rates.                              As we have made the difficult savings choices to bring the budget to surplus, we have been determined to protect and support working families and their children. There is no better way of doing that than by assisting families with the costs of getting the kids to school. We know right around the nation that, whether it be the winter uniform, the school excursion, the new books, the new shoes and then needing to get another pair of shoes as the kids grow, that those bills, those costs, can put pressure on working families. That is why we are very proud that we will be delivering to them a schoolkids bonus - $820 per secondary student, $410 per primary student - and that they will see that money coming to them before the end of this financial year and then in following years in January and July.                              We trust working families, we respect them and we know they are making the best decisions for their children. We know schooling costs them a lot more than $410 and $820. It is only those who are cosseted on Sydney's North Shore that could fail to realise that working families need relief, working families face the costs of getting kids to school, and we are intending to help them with those costs because we respect them and we want to support them. We will not spend our days offering cheap insults to their ability to look after their children.              </DOC>

  This is the line that is being peddled by those opposite, who have a $70 billion hole, or crater, in their budget bottom line. Somehow they want to walk around and pretend that we have not done the hard yakka to bring our budget back to surplus, so they have come up with the great con, which is to claim that, if we had included all of the NBN accounting that they say we should, we would be in deficit. The truth is this: that we are operating under a Charter of Budget Honesty developed by those on that side. We are working within accounting standards that were followed by the previous government and we have accounted for the NBN in precisely the same way as bodies like Australia Post and EFIC have been accounted for forever and a day, and were accounted for by the previous government in that way. I reject the slur that comes with that question that somehow we would not have a surplus if the NBN was accounted for differently. We have accounted for the NBN in the same way as these bodies have been accounted for by previous governments according to the accounting standards and according to the Charter of Budget Honesty.                              The second slur that they are throwing around is somehow that the moneys have been moved around. The fact is we have in this budget $33 billion worth of savings, and they find that very, very hard to cope with given they have a $70 billion hole in their budget bottom line. They cannot even find $70 billion. We have found $33 billion worth of savings in this budget and that is why we are coming back to surplus, and if you have a look at the figures you will see that we have payments at record lows - well below anything that we have seen for a four-year period since the early 1980s. What that shows is considerable expenditure restraint right across the forward estimates, so let us just dispatch with this slur because those on the other side of the parliament cannot make their budget numbers add up. What we know is that the auditors they hired to look at their books at the last election have been found guilty of misconduct. No wonder there was an $11 billion black hole in their estimates at the last election campaign. So they come to this with very dirty hands and they have no credibility when it comes to budget accounting.               </DOC>

  I thank the member for Melbourne for his question, because in this House the company tax cut has been opposed not just by the Greens but by the Liberal Party. That is why the government has not been able to get its proposal through - they have made it very clear well in advance that they would not support a cut in the company tax rate. Indeed, they have been in the opposite position: they have a policy to increase company taxation, not to cut it - quite extraordinary.                              The member asked me about what we are using the revenue for and why we have chosen to invest in the families of Australia, particularly those on low and middle incomes. We on this side of the House absolutely understand how important it is to give a bit of extra support to low- and middle-income families in our community and we make no apology for the fact that we are spending some of that money to boost the purchasing power of low- and middle-income families in this community who deserve to have a bigger stake in the mining boom, spreading the opportunities of that right around our community.                              We understand that for many small businesses, particularly in the patchwork economy, there needs to be business tax reform, which is why we are moving forward with the instant asset write-off - a very big boon for small business in our community - and proceeding with the loss carry-back as well. These are two important reforms to make small business more competitive, to give them a helping hand whilst, at the same time, making sure that we give a fair go to low- and middle-income working families. On top of all of that, we are putting in place fundamental reforms, such as the National Disability Insurance Scheme, and putting in place additional support to help people with dental care. All of these things, plus a huge aged-care package, demonstrate that if you can make big savings in your budget you can bring it back to surplus and make room for important new priorities.               </DOC>

  I thank the member for Petrie very much for her question. The Treasurer last night delivered a Labor budget that is going to bring this country back to surplus and that spreads the benefits of the mining boom. This is a budget that gives back to families, a budget that in true Labor style makes sure that families get the benefit of this boom.                               Today I have introduced legislation into this chamber to deliver Australia's schoolkids bonus, a bonus that will see 1.3 million Australian families getting more help to make ends meet. Families would receive $410 a year for each child they have in primary school and $820 a year for each child they have in secondary school, and this would be paid before the start of term 1 and term 3. The fact is that 80 per cent of families were missing out on their full entitlements under the education tax refund. This new schoolkids bonus will make sure that one million Australian families get more money.                              On top of that, this budget delivers to 1½ million families extra funding through their family payments from the middle of next year. Families on the maximum rate will receive $600 extra if they have two children or more. That is what this government is delivering in this Labor budget to help families make ends meet.                              The member for Petrie asked this question. There are 9,700 families in the electorate of Petrie who are going to benefit from the schoolkids bonus.                              Today the Liberals confirmed that they are going to oppose the schoolkids bonus. We found out just before question time that they are loading up the list of speakers for this afternoon because they are trying to avoid bringing on the vote. They are so ashamed of their position.                               I say to the member for Riverina that I noticed in the Wagga Daily Advertiser today a lady -                </DOC>

  To the member for Menzies, I say that is the arrogance of the opposition on display. It shows just how out of touch it is with the needs of working families. I hope that the member for Menzies contacts the 5,000 families in his electorate who are eligible for the schoolkids bonus and explains to them why he is coming into this parliament and voting against them getting that bonus. To the member for Menzies, let me say this: it is only members of the opposition who apparently fail to understand that families face cost-of-living pressures. Not one of them gets it; they are all going to vote against relief for working families. Not one of them understands Australian families and their needs today.                              It is only members of the opposition who apparently imagine that you can send a child to primary school and somehow that costs you less than $410 a year, and that you can send a child to high school and somehow that costs you less than $820 a year. People who live in the real world - that is, people who are not members of the opposition - know that educating a child costs thousands of dollars. What this bonus is for is to provide a bit of relief to working families who are doing it tough. It is for families who are eligible for our family tax benefit system, families who are eligible for that relief because we know that they need it to make a difference to the cost of the winter school uniforms, to the cost of the shoes and to the cost of the excursions.                              What have we heard back from the opposition to try to justify their position in not supporting the schoolkid bonus? The Leader of the Opposition was asked what the difference is between this and the baby bonus, because he supported the baby bonus. In a masterstroke in Australian politics, his answer was, 'Well, look, they just are'. And then, the shadow Treasurer, when asked what the difference is, said, 'there is a vast difference'. 'What?', he is asked. 'Well, you have to have a baby to get the baby bonus', he said. Apparently the shadow Treasurer does not know babies grow into school children! That is what happens: they grew into school children! And then you have the cost of sending the kids to school. How out of touch can these people be? How cosseted from the real world are they? How insulting of Australian families.                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    I thank the Manager of Opposition Business for illustrating my last point. These arrogant, cynical people think Australian families do not care about their kids. They think 1.3 million Australian families are going to take this money and not use it for the benefit of their families and their children. They are contemptuous of working children.               </DOC>

  I thank the member for McEwen for his question because we know that this budget is really and truly putting low- and middle-income Australians first. It is a Labor budget that is delivering support for the cost of living for 1.5 million Australian families like the 12,800 families in the seat of McEwen who will be eligible to receive this government's new schoolkids bonus. These 12,800 families will receive $820 a year for high school students and $410 a year for every primary school student. We are ready to provide these 12,800 families in the seat of McEwen, and the 1.3 million Australian families around Australia, with this year's bonus payment in just a few weeks time. That is more than $13 million in support for kids' education that families in McEwen alone will receive. I know the member for McEwen will be standing up for his families in his electorate. He knows how important it is to get that support out to the mums and dads and kids in his electorate and right around Australia.                              It is particularly important for the member for McEwen because in his home state of Victoria the Liberal government has just cut back on family support. In its budget, the Baillieu Liberal government cut its School Start Bonus, meaning 40,000 families in Victoria will be losing payments because of Liberal Party cuts. Now we have this Leader of the Opposition standing in the way of helping Australian families just trying to do the right thing by their children.                               These are ordinary working Australians and they are in the electorate of every member over there. Like the member for Leichhardt: will he be standing in the way of the 12,500 families in his electorate receiving the payment? Or the member for Forde: will he be supporting the 12,000 in his electorate or will he be stopping them from receiving more than $12 million in just a few weeks time? What about the member for Maranoa, the member for Parkes, the member for Ryan, the member for Longman and the 46,000 eligible to receive this payment in their electorates? Will they be standing up for them?                              No matter where they are in Australia, we know that coalition governments cut services and payments for families. But this is not just about payments. It is not just about blocking the cash to these families. They are actually refusing to trust Australian families. The Leader of the Opposition is saying, loud and clear, to parents that he does not trust them with their own family budgets. This is an insult to all Australian parents. It is an attack on their ability to look after their own kids. We know that parents make decisions every day, every week, about their children. But the coalition do not think they can be trusted with some extra cash.               </DOC>

  I thank the shadow minister for his question, and it is a very important question. It gives me the opportunity to address debt and it gives me the opportunity to talk about why we are coming back to surplus and paying down debt.                               When the global financial crisis hit we moved with a powerful stimulus to support our economy. Because we did that, hundreds and thousands kept their jobs and hundreds of thousands of small businesses kept their doors open. The consequence was that we, almost alone amongst developed economies, avoided a recession. Avoiding that recession is why we are in such a strong position now amongst developed economies in the world compared to just about anybody else. We avoided a recession. That is one of the reasons we have unemployment at 5.2 per cent and a strong investment pipeline and why opportunities are so big for our country into the future.                              When that hit, it hit our revenues. Our revenues have been written down by $150 billion over five years. Those opposite expect the Australian people to believe that if they had been in our position they would not have done anything other than accept that revenue hit and they would not have moved to support our economy. The consequence of that would have been higher deficits, higher debt and higher interest payments, today. If they had been in power during that period of time, we would be sitting here looking at higher unemployment, higher debt and higher interest payments.                                                                    Mr SWAN:                    We are coming back to surplus because we have a strong economy. We walk tall in the world and as a consequence of that we have the capacity to accumulate surpluses and, over time, pay down debt. That is precisely what we should be doing and that is exactly what we are doing. That is the reason we have put in place $33 billion worth of saves in this budget. The weight will be on those opposite because they have a $70 billion crater in their budget bottom line and every save of ours that they knock back will add to that $70 billion crater. That is the contrast between that side of the House and this side of the House. We take fiscal policy seriously. Those on that side of the House had their auditors found guilty of professional misconduct during the last election campaign. They could not be trusted to run a chook farm.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Wakefield for his question. The member for Wakefield knows that the clearest sign of a strong economy is a surplus and that is what this government is delivering. A surplus is the best defence we can provide against any future shocks in the global economy but, importantly, it is also a means by which we can provide the Reserve Bank with all the room that it needs in order to cut interest rates, if it chooses to do that, and to pass on the benefits of that to families right around our country.                              The member for Wakefield asked me about how we are spreading the benefits of the economy through this budget. We are doing that in many respects. But we are a government that understands that whilst we are experiencing a mining boom there are many families - and many businesses around our country and our communities - that are not receiving the benefits of that boom. That is why we are determined to spread the benefits of the boom and that is what this budget does. When it comes to the position of those opposite in relation to these matters, we have already seen that, apart from the fact that they cannot accept that Labor will deliver a surplus, they now find themselves in the situation where they are standing between us and the families right around this country that we want to deliver a schoolkids bonus to. We know that they are very unhappy about the budget and the return to surplus, because that is bad for them politically; it is good for the country but it is bad for them politically. But we also know that they now say that they will in fact support the increases to the family tax benefit part A; they say that - even though they have consistently maintained the position that they will oppose the mining tax and oppose any of the benefits that are yielded by that. In fact, the member for North Sydney is on the record, consistently, saying:                              The Coalition is opposed to the mining tax. We can't make promises that can't be paid for.                              We will rescind this tax in government and we will unwind the expenditure linked to it. This is fiscally prudent. It would be irresponsible to keep the expenditure without the supporting revenue.                              Then they say they are going to support measures linked to the mining tax - and they have just exposed the fact that they have no capacity to pay for them. By their very own words they are damned. They have a $70 billion crater and it just keeps getting bigger. They keep digging and digging and digging. If this black hole got any deeper, we would need a Stephen Hawking documentary to try and uncover exactly what was inside of it.                              When it comes to their black hole, the day of reckoning is approaching. In two days time, or tomorrow night, the Leader of the Opposition will have the opportunity to spell out exactly what savings he will make. If he does not take that opportunity, we know his black hole will only get bigger.               </DOC>

  To the Manager of Opposition Business, No. 1, I say: how remarkable that they cannot sustain a debate on the budget for even one question time - so little interest in our economy, in jobs, in the cost of living pressures on working Australians. They just do not care about working Australians and their prospects and their future, and do not have the intellectual ability or economic capacity to sustain a debate on the budget.                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    Then, in relation to the Manager of Opposition Business's question, let me say this to him: I have been completely frank about all matters involving the member for Dobell. As to persons with unanswered questions in this parliament, the Manager of Opposition Business is one; the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is another; the Leader of the Opposition is a third, on the Ashby-Slipper matter. And wouldn't we all like to know what Mal Brough has got to say?                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    So, on questions to be asked and answered: I hope they are. On the Manager of Opposition Business's question, what I said on radio this morning is of course my view and I have stated it before. Overwhelmingly, in our nation, the trade union movement is professional. It is decent. It is hardworking. It is representing working Australians. To the extent that any dollar is ever used in a way which is not for -                                                                     Ms GILLARD:                    As I said on radio this morning, every dollar collected by trade unions should be properly used for the benefit of members. That is my view. That is the Labor view. That is the Labor way. I understand that the Manager of Opposition Business is going to come in here and try and chuck around unfounded allegations and smear, because he does not know anything about education or anything about working people, or supporting them. If he has got an allegation to put, he should put it. If he does not have an allegation to put then he should at least pretend for one question time that he has got one concern about schools in this country. I have never seen him exhibit any interest in what he is supposed to be doing in this parliament, which is taking an interest in Australian schools - not once, not ever -                                                                     Ms GILLARD:                    And, of course, that lack of care and concern for working Australians characterises this opposition, and no more so than today.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Page. The member for Page is a great supporter of infrastructure in her electorate; in particular, the Pacific Highway, where she got to open the final stage of the Ballina bypass - a great project announced by this government, funded by this government and opened by this government.                              Last night the Treasurer delivered a Labor budget that builds on our nation-building agenda, a budget that returns to surplus but not at the expense of investing in our productivity and the infrastructure that we need for the future. Since we came to government we have doubled the roads budget and increased investment in rail tenfold. We have reformed the way that we plan, finance and build infrastructure by establishing Infrastructure Australia, and in last night's budget we committed funding for the final projects that were on the Infrastructure Priority List produced by Infrastructure Australia after its national audit in 2008.                              We have now funded every single project, because last night we provided $232 million for the Goodwood and Torrens Junctions project that will improve the movement of freight and ease traffic congestion in Adelaide. In addition, we confirmed funding for the Majura Parkway in the ACT. This is about delivering on Infrastructure Australia's agenda. We also, of course, put into the Nation Building Program an additional $3.56 billion, subject to matching funding from New South Wales, to complete the full duplication of the Pacific Highway by 2016 - promised by the Howard government, but they only contributed $1.3 billion over 12 years. This will take our contribution, if New South Wales matches its rhetoric before the election with action in its next budget, to over $7.7 billion. It will improve productivity; more importantly, it will improve road safety.                              There has been some comment from New South Wales today about the funding arrangements. I table a press release from Wendy Machin from the NRMA confirming that it was the Howard government that set the fifty-fifty funding split for the Pacific Highway from 2006, and the NRMA has supported this approach since day one. I also table from the Sydney Morning Herald a front-page story of 7 March 2009 headed 'Rees bungle costs state $50 million', where, because New South Wales Labor were not delivering on their Pacific Highway promises, I took action against them. This needs to be above politics. The New South Wales government needs -                </DOC>

  To the member for Sturt, the Manager of Opposition Business, can I say: if he wants to get into a debate about who stands up for working families in this parliament and who stands up for a privileged few, no better day to have it than today - a day on which we are standing up for 1.3 million families around the country; a day on which those on the opposition benches are going to use their vote, their reckless negativity, to try and get in the way of working families getting the Schoolkids Bonus, some basic support, to help with the costs of getting the kids to school.                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    Madam Deputy Speaker, I was asked a very general question and I am intending to answer it. We also, in this response by the opposition to the budget, could not see a more clear example of who stands up for working people and who stands up for a privileged few than on the question of family tax benefits. We have decided, because of the reckless negativity of the opposition in stopping the company tax reduction, to share the benefits of the boom with working families through a family tax benefit payment increase: $300 for families with one child, $600 for families with two or more children. When the Leader of the Opposition has been asked who he stands for in relation to this proposition, who does he stand for? As I was asked by -                                                                     Ms GILLARD:                    Thank you very much, Madam Deputy Speaker. I was asked basically about who stands for the many and who stands for the privileged few, and I am answering that question. I am answering it very specifically in relation to family tax benefit because we have decided to take the benefits of the mining boom and benefit working families around the nation. We have decided they are the people we stand for; not the Clive Palmers, not the Gina Rineharts, but working families. The Leader of the Opposition, when asked about this this morning -                                                                     Ms GILLARD:                    Thank you very much, Madam Deputy Speaker. On the question of the many and the few, the Leader of the Opposition, when asked this morning whether or not these payments would be continued if he was ever Prime Minister, said Australian families would just have to wait and see. That is code for him and Clive and Gina turning up on their doorstep and demanding the family payments back. That is what that is code for.                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    The party of the privileged few; the party of working Australians: the contrast could not be clearer, Madam Deputy Speaker. Day after day after day, the opposition show who they stand for: a privileged few. Of course, in standing for working Australians -                                                                     Ms GILLARD:                    we stand for well-run, decent trade unions. That is the Labor way.              </DOC>

  Madam Deputy Speaker, I would like to compliment you on the job that you are doing under very difficult circumstances. I thank the member for Throsby for his question. When I was down visiting him recently -                                                                     Ms PLIBERSEK:                    I was very pleased to meet with the Illawarra Dental Health Action Group and their head, Alice Scott. They have been working with the member for Throsby for many years and they worked with the previous member for Throsby, Jennie George, as well. She mentioned them nearly a decade ago in this place when she presented a petition about the abolition of the Commonwealth Dental Health Program by the Howard government in their first budget. I must say that the measures in last night's budget restore much of the damage done by the Howard government during their term in office.                              This $515.3 million package includes $345.9 million spent delivering services that will reduce the backlog on public dental waiting lists around the country. It includes other measures, such as workforce measures, relocation and infrastructure grants to encourage dentists to relocate and practice in remote areas, oral health promotion and other very important measures. This will be vital for the 30 per cent of Australians who cannot currently access the dental care they need. It is proof that good economic management is not in opposition to strong social objectives. Indeed, it has been very well received by people in the health community, including the Australian Dental Association President, Dr Shane Fryer, who said:                              The provision of funding to bolster the public dental services will help to reduce the waiting lists that cause some Australians to wait years for access to a dentist                              Carol Bennett, CEO of the Consumer Health Forum, said the package was addressing years of neglect. She said:                              We are pleased that the Federal Government has recognised that teeth are part of the body and that dental care should be part of the health system.                              The CEO of the Australian Healthcare and Hospitals Association, Prue Power, said the package was 'an extremely important step' that will greatly improve the health of Australians on dental waiting lists and 'their quality of life, as well as improving productivity and reducing hospital admissions.'                              This is a measure that will make a great deal of difference to hundreds of thousands of Australians, not only improving their dental health now but also offering preventive care for years in the future. That means that people will be able to have fillings instead of tooth extractions when they are visiting the public health system. After years of neglect, this builds a renewed focus on our public dental systems.              </DOC>

  I certainly do recall that statement and I endorse that statement. It requires a competent opposition that can get their questions in order, but in a parliament where we had a competent opposition, that would be exactly how question time worked. In this parliament where we have an opposition that cannot sustain a debate on things like the budget then we get these kinds of questions.                              In answer to the member's question, I detailed at the press conference that I conducted on a Sunday all the details about my discussions with the member for Dobell which led to him now sitting on the crossbenches. Those details are available and I will send the member the transcript.              </DOC>

  I thank the former member for Lowe and the current member for Reid for his question. In the lead-up to the last election, this Prime Minister promised that aged care reform would be a priority for this term of government. Last night's budget delivers on that commitment.                              A little over a fortnight ago, the Prime Minister and I announced the most sweeping changes and improvements to aged care in almost 30 years, transforming a system that was built in the 1980s around nursing homes to one that is built around supporting older Australians to stay in their own homes for as long as possible and, if at all possible, for the remainder of their lives. In designing our reforms, we listened closely to the Productivity Commission and to the aged care sector itself, but most importantly, we listened directly to older Australians. The overwhelming message to us was that what they want from an aged care system is support to stay in their own homes.                              Over the next five years, we will expand home care by two-thirds, taking the total expansion of home care under this government to around 110 per cent. Home care will shift from being provider centred to being truly consumer directed and consumer controlled. A fairer system of residential care financing will not only stimulate new investment but also put an end to the excessive bonds that too many families have to pay, amounting to almost $2.6 million in some cases, just to get entry to a facility. Better wages and better work practices will help underpin more sustainable workforce arrangements that will allow us to grow the workforce to the size that we need. Significant new investments will be made in areas like dementia and palliative care, investments that have been warmly welcomed by groups like Alzheimer's Australia and Palliative Care Australia. The government's package allocates $3.7 billion over five years to new initiatives to improve access, choice and quality of care and does so in a way designed also to improve the sustainability of our aged-care system. With aged-care spending this year around 70 per cent higher than it was five years ago, we have unashamedly redirected some of that money from old priorities into these new initiatives. We have also made some new changes to co-contribution arrangements that kick in after July 2014, with robust caps and strong protections for full pensioners, and we have been able to do all of that while still maintaining protections around the family home.                              The government's package has received very, very broad support from the aged-care sector and from the community, but they have also told us that they want support for aged-care reform across the parliament. To that end we all look forward to the Leader of the Opposition tomorrow night telling the nation where he stands on the future of aged care.              </DOC>

  I do welcome a question from the Leader of the Opposition on the budget and on economics, because we so rarely see them - causing, as we found out last night, members of the Liberal Party to yearn for a return of Peter Costello.                              The answer to the Leader of the Opposition's question is as follows. If the Leader of the Opposition looked at the budget papers he would see that our determination to return to surplus is evidenced by the fact that in the forthcoming financial year 2012-13 - where we have budgeted a $1.5 billion surplus - since the last budget, revenues to be received have gone back by approximately $10 billion. And, despite that major knock on revenues, we have worked to find savings so that we bring the budget to surplus in that year.                              This is part of a broader savings package of $34 billion across the forward estimates. So I say to the Leader of the Opposition: look at that determination; look at how it builds on $100 billion of savings identified in past budgets and how it builds on $11.5 billion of savings in the midyear outlook. I say to the Leader of the Opposition, too, that when he is reflecting on this year he needs to acknowledge that this is the year in which we have dealt with a number of one-off factors like, for example, this being the financial year immediately after the most costly natural disasters in the nation's history.                              To the Leader of the Opposition, who has spent months and months and months predicting that the government would not bring into this parliament a budget with a surplus, I say this: he has been proved wrong then and he will be proved wrong now. In his negativity, the Leader of the Opposition will do anything to try and besmirch what is a remarkable achievement for our nation: coming out of the global financial crisis so strongly, keeping people in work and now returning the budget to surplus so quickly. He will do anything to deny the Australian nation that achievement, because it is all part of his reckless negativity towards the economy and towards the work of this parliament in general.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Chifley for a very important question, because our economy walks tall in the world. We have solid growth, we have low unemployment, we have contained inflation and we have a strong investment pipeline. Of course, this government has always put the jobs of Australians first. That is why we acted during the global financial crisis to support the jobs of Australians, and we avoided recession because of what we did in putting jobs first.                              We have always put jobs first in the reforms we have put in place through our five budgets in this House. This morning we have had a resounding endorsement of our economy and a resounding endorsement of our jobs record. Australia now has more people in work than ever before, with an unemployment rate of 4.9 per cent. That is something that everyone on this side of the House is proud of. Since this government was elected, 800,000 jobs have been created. But we cannot see anyone happy about that on the other side of the House.                              There have been -                                                                     Mr SWAN:                    There have been 90,000 jobs created in Australia since the beginning of the year, and that is why we are bringing our budget back to surplus: because we have trend growth, we have low unemployment and it is important to have a surplus and build it over the years. That is why we are putting in place productivity-enhancing reforms, particularly incentives for small business. But it is also why we are in a position to spread the benefits of the mining boom right around our country, particularly to 1.5 million low- and middle-income families, with additional payments in terms of family tax benefit and, most particularly, our schoolkids bonus to help 1.3 million families with the cost of education. But, just as those opposite voted against jobs during the global financial crisis, they voted against the schoolkids bonus in this House - and shame on them. As we stand here today, they are voting against it in the Senate as well.                              Tonight the Leader of the Opposition needs to come clean on what other assistance to families the Liberal Party opposes. When he walks into this chamber tonight, he should say whether he is supporting proposals to spread the benefits of the boom and how he is going to pay for it. How is he going to pay for spreading the benefits of the boom? If he is supporting a return to surplus, will he support the saves to get there? What is he going to do to find the money to fill the $70 billion crater in the budget bottom line that the shadow Treasurer spoke about on breakfast television? We on this side of the House have always stood for jobs. Those opposite want to give the benefits of the boom to Clive Palmer.              </DOC>

  I thank the shadow Treasurer for that very important question. The fact is that we have advice from the Australian Office of Financial Management saying that they think it would be prudent to put in place a buffer. The advice and the budget papers very clearly say that at the end of each year we will be within the $250 billion debt cap. They clearly state that, but the Office of Financial Management have given the government very clear advice that we do require a buffer, for the reasons that I spoke about in the House here yesterday: because the in-year financing requirements mean that we will go over that level.                                                                    Mr SWAN:                    First of all, I could refer the member to the minute from the AOFM. He should take the time to read it in full.                                                                    Mr SWAN:                    I am happy to table it; it is not a problem at all. This is a very serious issue and it is not an issue with which the opposition should be playing politics, and they know it. The fact is that we will be within the debt cap at year's end in all future years, but the AOFM have said very clearly that they would like a buffer, and that is why we are providing it. They have said this is the best way to achieve the objectives of our program. This is just very typical of the lengths to which the opposition will go to talk down our economy and to exaggerate and run scare campaigns about matters that ought to be the subject of bipartisan political agreement in this House. They really should not. These matters are far too important for the opposition to be playing the sorts of politics that they are playing. So I would refer them to the minute from the AOFM. They should take it seriously and they should desist from this sort of behaviour.              </DOC>

  The opposition has a very small problem. The fact is the IMF, the credit rating agencies and all responsible bodies around this country and around the world happen to think that our financial situation is one of the best in the developed world. So, trying to maintain this argument that somehow there is a problem with the modest level of debt we have, which is one-tenth of what occurs in the major developed economies, is simply farcical and speaks very loudly about the opposition's economic incompetence. We have taken on a modest amount of debt to protect our economy. We are coming back to surplus and building those surpluses to pay that down. That is what we should be doing - accumulating surpluses when growth returns to trend and implementing our fiscal rules. That is what this budget does. It brings the budget back to surplus and builds the surpluses over the years to build up the buffer that we need, because our economy is strong. That is precisely what we are doing.                              Of course, our actions have been endorsed by the three major global rating agencies. Those on the other side of the House want to pretend that there have been no revenue losses from the global financial crisis, no revenue losses from the global recession and that our revenues have not been reduced overall by $150 billion. Of course, if they want to pretend that, I would hate to think what our level of debt would be now if they did not take the actions or go anywhere near the actions we took during the global financial crisis, because it would be far higher. If action had not been taken, unemployment in this country would be far higher and deficits and debt would be far higher. Of course, we took the responsible action and, having taken the responsible action, we are doing the responsible things: bringing our budget back to surplus, building those surpluses and paying down debt over future years. That is classic economic policy, which has been endorsed by the global agencies and endorsed by the rating agencies, and all that those opposite are doing here today is turning their economic credentials into a complete farce.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Kennedy for his question. I know of his very sincere interest in this matter. He has raised the matter with me before. I know on the times that I have travelled to the region with the member for the Kennedy - and the Deputy Prime Minister has travelled there with him, I believe, on more than one occasion - he has raised these and a series of related questions. I am very happy to say to the member for Kennedy that I am happy to look in detail at the matters that he has raised today.                              He would be aware, of course, that we have been working with the local community for reconstruction and relief following the cyclone. That has taken many forms. It is part of the overall contribution the Australian government is making to rebuilding essential community infrastructure, and that is in the order of a $5.9 billion contribution. There is a special package of $15 million that the member for Kennedy is aware of to assist with repair of marine infrastructure and restoration of foreshore areas. I know he was involved in the development of that particular package. I know too he has been involved in the recommendations of various work, including looking at some jetties that the member for Kennedy has raised.                              All in all, I can provide the House with an update: in the Far North, $443.3 million worth of projects have been completed or are progressing or are out for tender, and a further $243.7 million worth of projects will shortly be released to markets. We understand very sincerely that small businesses and primary producers took a very big hit with the cyclone, so we have been delivering grants and loans, in the number of 2,500, to small businesses and primary producers and also to not-for-profit groups who felt the brunt of the loss of infrastructure and of the community need at this time. On further specifics, I am very happy to keep in discussion with the member for Kennedy about the needs of the community as it recovers from what was a very devastating blow.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Fowler very much for his question. He does understand how important it is to spread the benefits of the mining boom especially to those Australians who are not living in the fast lane, who are not benefiting from this mining boom, in many parts of Australia. As the Treasurer has just indicated, the Schoolkids Bonus has now passed the Senate - of course, no thanks to anyone opposite; absolutely no thanks to anyone over there.                              The new Schoolkids Bonus will benefit 1.3 million families and I am very pleased to say to the member for Fowler that it will benefit around 13,000 families in the electorate of Fowler. That means that families with primary school aged children will receive $410 a year, and $820 for each secondary school student. The good news for families is that this money will come when they need it: at the start of term 1 and the start of term 3.                              I was very interested to hear on Radio National this morning the member for Sturt, who actually thinks that this is a good idea. He does seem to understand, as a result of his comments, that the big costs associated with children going to school come in January and February, when parents need to really get out there and pay for the new schools and books and all the other things. I just say to the member for Sturt: that is exactly what this legislation does - it delivers to families when they need it. But of course the member for Sturt, along with everybody over there, just wanted to say no, and they opposed the legislation yesterday.                              While they were trying every single trick in the book, every trick they could try yesterday to prevent families getting this money, this government has got on with it and will make sure that the Schoolkids Bonus is delivered to those parents that need it. The real test is going to be for the Leader of the Opposition tonight. Tonight we will hear how the Leader of the Opposition is going to justify giving billions of dollars to Gina Rinehart and Clive Palmer while he says no to families.

  In answer to the member's question, I will make my own decisions and not take advice from the former leader he refers to. But I would be recommending to the opposition that it takes some advice from one of its former leaders, Prime Minister Howard, who said in respect of budget matters and opposition leader replies: 'A litany of negatives is no substitute for an alternative economic plan.'                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    I am dealing with the question in the way in which it was put - to play the politics, not anything serious, as we know from this member. John Howard was right about two things. He was right about the member for Sturt and he was right when he said that an opposition leader fails the test of a budget reply if there is not one positive word, not one positive thought, not one alternative idea -                                                                     Ms GILLARD:                    I conclude by saying that that former leader's words were: 'You have got to present an alternative' - and you had better tonight.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Capricornia for her question. I am proud to be a part of a government that is supporting hardworking Australian families, and I know the member for Capricornia feels the same way. One of the best things we can do to support families is to have a strong economy. The unemployment figures today, showing that unemployment in Australia is at 4.9 per cent, are further evidence of how strong the Australian economy is.                              But of course we understand that there are some families who are doing it tough. That is why in the budget that we have handed down we have provided assistance to working families. We have provided that assistance in the form of the schoolkids bonus but also in the form of additional payments to families. In addition to that, by returning the budget to surplus we know that we are giving the Reserve Bank the room that it needs to cut interest rates if that is what it thinks is appropriate - and, of course, that is important for Australian families. That is what this government believes managing the economy is about. It is about low unemployment, low interest rates and providing assistance to hardworking Australian families.                              But of course the opposition do not care about Australian families. We saw that last night when we came forward with a plan to provide assistance to hardworking Australian families and they opposed it. They opposed it not once, not twice, but six times. Six times they opposed our plan, and they opposed it on the basis that the Leader of the Opposition said that families could not be trusted to manage their own budgets. Well, if Australian families cannot be trusted to manage their own budgets, why should Australian families trust the Leader of the Opposition to manage the nation's budget - and why should they do that when he has got a $70 billion budget crater and he has no plans to fill it? That is why he has no economic credibility.                              Those on the other side are very concerned about the lack of credibility of the Leader of the Opposition. That is why I was not surprised to see reports in the papers today that there is a cunning and devious plan to parachute Peter Costello back into parliament. They figure that is about the only way they might be able to give their economic leadership a little bit of credibility.                                                                    Mr BRADBURY:                    Unfortunately, it looks as though what was reported might not be happening - we will not be getting Abbott and Costello; we are just stuck with the Three Stooges.

  I thank the member for Page for her question. Tomorrow I will be up on the North Coast with the member for Page and the member for Richmond outlining our commitment to deliver the full duplication of the Pacific Highway by 2016, something that has been championed by many in this chamber over a long period of time but something that has only been delivered by this government. That is why on Tuesday night we put $3.56 billion into the Nation Building Program, which will be made available on a dollar-for-dollar basis to the New South Wales government for the Pacific Highway.                              I am asked why is it important that commitments are met with funding - with actual plans to get them done. I am reminded that recently the Leader of the Opposition has had discussions about infrastructure. He does not have commitments, of course; he has aspirations. Well, you cannot drive on an aspiration. In his op-ed in the Daily Telegraph on 5 March he announced over $50 billion in aspirations for Sydney's infrastructure. It included building a road tunnel under Mosman, in his electorate. That has suddenly become a national priority. All this on top of a $70 billion black hole that he starts with. No wonder he did not match it.                              But there is something in common here, which is that it is only Labor governments that actually do something about funding infrastructure, not just talking about infrastructure. We know that for the Pacific Highway for the life of the Howard government they contributed $1.3 billion while the state government contributed $2.5 billion during that same period. Yet now, in spite of the very clear statements made by the Premier of New South Wales prior to the election in March 2011 that he was absolutely committed to delivering funding, we have support for the program being withdrawn. Despite the fact that they were completely critical, the Premier, the Deputy Premier and the now minister for roads gave very specific commitments about matching funding. Indeed, in last year's budget we put in $750 million based upon matched funding. On budget night last year the state government said they would exceed that matching, but now $300 million has disappeared from that commitment.                              We need to get on with the job of building the Pacific Highway full duplication. The fact is you cannot drive on an aspiration; it does need funding and it is about time the coalition and the National Party local members, who had transport ministers for all those years, get on with the job of telling their coalition colleagues in New South Wales to fund this road.               </DOC>

I received the Fair Work Australia report on Monday evening and on Tuesday morning I referred to the Australian Electoral Commissioner questions that were raised in it and asked for advice from the Electoral Commissioner as to whether or not there were any matters that should be considered by the government.

  I thank the member for Fremantle very much for her question and for all of the advocacy she does not just in her own electorate but in many parts of Australia for people with disabilities, their carers and their families. I think it is true to say that she along with many, many others understand that people with disability, their families and their carers have been waiting for this change for a very, very long time.                              I think it is also the case that for people with disability - and so much so for carers as well - often they wake up every day to a day of waiting. Whether it is waiting at the end of the phone for a respite place or waiting for a new wheelchair, we, I think, do understand just how critical it is that we get on with the job that we have at hand. It is why in this very, very significant Labor budget we have for the first time put the money down to build the first stage of a National Disability Insurance Scheme. It is something that so many people have been waiting for and working for for a long time, and we have committed $1 billion for this first stage. It will mean that around 20,000 people over the next two years in, we estimate, four locations around the country will be part of the first stage of a National Disability Insurance Scheme. We will work with the states and territories on the rollout of the National Disability Insurance Scheme, on the design work that is so important and also on the funding and governance that is necessary for the scheme.                              We are delivering this new scheme one year ahead of the schedule set out in the Productivity Commission report, and that is because we understand just how critical it is to address the long wait that people with disability and their carers have had over a long time. That said, this government has been getting on with delivering other significant reforms for people with disability, including a very significant boost to funding for disability care and support to the states and territories; we have been doubling the money going to the states and territories. We delivered historic increases in the pension, the disability support pension and the carer payment. We are delivering much-needed increases in pay for community service workers and early intervention services for children with disability. These changes are making a difference but the NDIS is now here to stay.               </DOC>

  I thank the member for his question. As the Leader of the House indicated, the Australian Taxation Office is an independent statutory authority, and it is entirely appropriate that that be the case. I think we all agree it is appropriate that bodies such as this, and the various investigatory and compliance arrangements they pursue, should be at arm's length from government. To the extent that this report is already in the public domain, I suspect that it would be a matter of consideration to the extent that other matters in the public domain are, as a matter of course, matters for the taxation commissioner. It is always open to any other authority or any other individual to refer the matter. If they choose to do that then I am sure the commissioner will consider the matter.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Hindmarsh for his question. It is extremely important that there is transparency about the impact of carbon pricing on electricity prices. In recent weeks regulators in jurisdictions such as New South Wales and Queensland have confirmed that the Treasury modelling of this impact is bang on what the Treasury said it would be. Indeed, there is an average impact on households across the nation of only $3.30 a week and the government is making available household assistance that averages $10.10 a week across households in Australia - $3.30 versus $10.10. That household assistance is delivered via tax cuts from 1 July this year involving a trebling of the tax-free threshold and an increase in the pension of $338 a year for a single pensioner - and $250 of that increase will be delivered over May-June to single pensioners. Many self-funded retirees will receive benefits, and a supplementary allowance for youth, the unemployed and single parents, to be paid in the next financial year, was also announced by the Treasurer in the budget.                              This government is acting to relieve cost-of-living pressures on Australian householders. Up against this are all sorts of misrepresentation. The Leader of the Opposition has claimed there would be unimaginable cost increases. He has claimed that electricity prices will rise by as much as 30 per cent. Today in Western Australia the Liberal Premier, Colin Barnett, is trying to misrepresent the fact that he has already increased electricity prices for Western Australian households by 57 per cent since he came to power, and now he is increasing them by another 15 per cent and trying to blame the federal government. In fact, the electricity price rise, averaged across Western Australian households, is less than $3 a week and the federal government is delivering an average of $10.10 a week in assistance.                              The shadow Treasurer has been tweeting on this issue this morning indicating that, if the opposition came to power, they will cut electricity prices. The question for the Leader of the Opposition is: will he tell us in his address tonight whether he is going to cut electricity prices? Rule it in or rule it out. Let us have the facts.              </DOC>

  I thank the Leader of the Opposition for that question, because I would have thought that anyone who has been listening to the debate in this country over the last five years knows that we are having a carbon price. I can well understand how sensitive he is about the assistance that we are providing to families through our carbon price assistance package, the clean energy package. I can see why he is so sensitive about the fact that we are providing additional assistance to pensioners, I can see why he is so sensitive about the fact that we are providing additional assistance to families and I can see why he is so, if you like, sensitive to the fact that we are providing assistance to trade-exposed industries. We make no apology whatsoever for providing this assistance to Australian families, because when there are deposits in their bank accounts they do need to know why they are there and where they came from. So he is very sensitive about this, but we are providing assistance to households and assistance to industry. That is how it should be as we make the transition to a cleaner carbon economy. We are putting in place a clean energy package because we understand that in the 21st century no first-class First World economy can be powered by anything other than clean energy and more efficient energy practices. That is why we are proud of the assistance we are providing.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for his question because, as all members would be aware, in Greece and many parts of Europe we face very profound economic challenges. These have been underscored in recent weeks by further events in Greece and across the European Community. The G8 has acknowledged at its weekend summit that growth and jobs must be the imperative for the global economy, and indeed here in Australia they have been our imperative from day one of the global financial crisis. The Prime Minister and I will continue to work through the G20 to ensure that the European leaders meet their commitments and put jobs and growth to the forefront of their decision making.                              As we said very clearly in the budget, the situation in Europe continues to cast a very dark shadow over the global economy. We expect that Europe's economy will contract by three-quarters of a per cent this year. That was there in our budget forecast, published on the night of the budget. Australia is not immune from this global instability, but we do need to remember that we have some of the strongest economic fundamentals amongst developed economies. Our economy has grown something like seven per cent on its pre-crisis level. This is absolutely outstanding growth, and that is why over the next year and the year after that we will outperform every other major developed economy. That is something that everyone on this side of the House is very proud of. We have a low unemployment level here of 4.9 per cent. Compare that to what is going on in Europe. There have been something like 800,000 jobs created in this country since this government was elected, and we have a record pipeline of investment, very strong public finances and a AAA credit rating from the three major rating agencies for the first time in our history - not something ever achieved by those opposite at any time they were in government. And what is the reason for this? It is because we got the big economic calls right at the height of the global financial crisis. We supported small business, we supported employment and we supported our communities. That is what we are doing with the budget as well: bringing the budget back to surplus and putting in place the big reforms to continue the economic growth that is so important to the future of all Australians.                              We have had a lot of negative talk from those opposite about our economy. They continue to talk it down on a daily basis. For them, it is as if the global financial crisis had never happened, the floods had never happened - none of these things had ever happened. They just go out there and talk down these fundamentals. But when it comes to putting the runs on the board for the economy we on this side of the House have gone there in spades. Those opposite can go out and talk our economy down, but we on this side of the House will continue to support it.               </DOC>

  I am very pleased that I was asked that question, because one of the things this government is very proud of is the assistance that we have put into North Queensland and Far North Queensland following Cyclone Yasi. It has cost the Commonwealth budget something like $6 billion, and when we came to this parliament to discuss how that could be funded we were opposed by those on the other side. We were opposed in one of the most substantial packages that has ever been put in place in this country to support communities that have been hit by a natural disaster. This has been particularly the case in assistance we have provided to local government areas -                                                                     Mr SWAN:                    I certainly have, Madam Deputy Speaker. We have been providing assistance particularly to local authorities right throughout that region - very substantial assistance - which has been welcomed. When I was there earlier this year locals came up and congratulated both the Commonwealth and Queensland governments on the degree of assistance that has been provided.                              I have also been asked about landfill operators. There are a number of steps they can take to reduce or offset their carbon liabilities, and they ought to take those steps.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Corangamite very much for his question, as he knows this government is all about spreading the benefits of the boom, especially to those families who have been finding it difficult making ends meet.                              Just last Wednesday families started receiving money from the household assistance package - up to $110 per child per family for families on family tax benefit part A, and up to $69 per family for those on family tax benefit part B. We want to make sure that families get this extra assistance before the carbon price starts on 1 July, and we also want to make sure that it is the big polluters that pay the carbon price, not Australian families. What we know from those opposite is that all they intend to do is to claw back this assistance from Australian families and from pensioners.                              I am also very pleased to let the House know that, from 20 June, families will be receiving the first round of the schoolkids bonus - opposed by each and every one of those opposite. From January next year at the start of term 1 we will start paying the first part of the schoolkids bonus, and the second part will be paid in term 3. This will amount to $410 per child for those in primary school and $820 per child for those in secondary school. This means that one million Australian families will get more money as a result of this government's change and the introduction of the schoolkids bonus.                              The Treasurer also announced in the recent budget that families are going to receive another increase next year as part of our spreading of the benefits of the boom. Families on the maximum rate of family tax benefit will get up to $600 extra if they have two children or more. This government is all about spreading the benefits of the boom, but all those opposite say to each and every one of these measures is a great big 'no'. We have just seen from the Victorian government that, while we are introducing a new schoolkids bonus, the Victorian Liberals are just getting rid of their school start bonus. We are helping families: all those opposite can do is hurt them.              </DOC>

  What we have here is yet again another example of the opposition talking our economy down and trying to undermine confidence in our community. I can think of nothing more reckless than that sort of assertion, which somehow tries to equate what is going on in the Spanish banking sector with what might be happening in the Australian economy. This is the same sort of wrecking-ball politics and economics we have seen from those opposite throughout the whole global financial crisis and global recession. They come into this House, on the one hand, and pretend it never happened - that it never had any impact on our budget bottom line and that we did not have to put in place a stimulus to support our economy - and then, on the other hand, come back and say, 'Oh, there's a big problem in Europe!'                              There is a challenge in Europe for the global economy and we have got the runs on the board in handling that global volatility. I recall that when the global economy was challenged by events everywhere, including in Europe, those opposite opposed the actions we took to support the Australian people. I remember that well and so do the Australian people.                                                                    Mr SWAN:                    As I was saying earlier, if you look at our forecasts, the forecasts of the IMF, the forecasts of the major private forecasters or of the OECD, what you see is an assessment of an Australian economy which, relative to all of our peers, is strong. We are growing at trend. We have unemployment at 4.9 per cent. We have a strong investment pipeline. We have our public finances in good nick. We have a AAA credit rating from the major agencies for the first time in our history, and yet those opposite have the hide to walk into this House and compare the Australian economy and our financial sector to Spain! To ask a question like that - to come in here and talk down our fundamentals - just shows how reckless those opposite have become in their assessment of the economy and how incompetent they are. They are not capable of being put in charge of a $1.4 trillion economy.                              The fact is our forecast, the private forecasts, the IMF forecast and the OECD forecast all show that we can achieve this with a carbon price. We are achieving it with a carbon price because we have the guts to put in place the longer term decisions which secure our prosperity and ensure that we continue to have 21 years of continuous growth. Far-sighted Labor governments brought in superannuation, enterprise bargaining and competition policy and brought down the tariff wall. Just as measures in that vein have strengthened our economy, putting a carbon price in will strengthen our economy. We have the guts to face up to the challenges of the 21st century and to support our economy and our people, but those opposite are so reckless they just talk our economy down every day of the week.               </DOC>

  I thank the member for what is a very important question. Horizontal fiscal equalisation - that is, the method where the stronger states in Australia have supported the smaller, economically-weaker states - has been in place throughout all of our history and used to be a point of bipartisan agreement in Australian politics between the Labor Party on this side and the Liberal Party on that side. It has been there for a very good reason: it is so that we do not end up with those big disparities that you see in countries in Europe, that we all grow together, that we do not grow apart. That is what we have had this in place for over 100 years and it is why we have had bipartisan agreement on it until recently, until this wrecking ball Leader of the Opposition has put his wrecking ball through what has been a long-established method of ensuring that, wherever you lived in Australia, you would get comparable services to anybody else wherever they lived. That is what HFE is all about.                              The Leader of the Opposition went down to Tasmania and blew the whistle. He said, 'We're going to cut you adrift.' That is what he said, and all of the other, Tasmanian Liberal members were scattering for the hills. 'He's here! He's here! He's going to cut us adrift!' And then he went to South Australia and did the same, and he got driven out of South Australia as well. The truth is we are having an independent review of the formula, as we should. We said we would do it. We had a request from the Western Australian Premier to do it. That review has produced an interim report. The final report is not too far off. I welcome a very significant debate in this House about how we support all Australians no matter where they live, but the Leader of the Opposition does not. He has wrecked consensus on some of the most basic matters of economics. He is now wrecking consensus on something that goes to the core of the social and economic stability of this country. When we have that report out, it is going to be very interesting to see what all the Liberals from South Australia and all the Liberals from Tasmania do when he tries to fudge his response like he has tried to fudge everything else.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for her question, because the fact is that our economy is now something like seven per cent bigger than it was prior to the global financial crisis. We should recall that many other developed economies have not even got back to where they were prior to the global financial crisis. So growing around trend but also coming back to surplus does give the Reserve Bank of Australia in particular greater flexibility when it comes to the setting of monetary policy, and that is a very good thing.                              In addition to putting in place all of our plans to grow the economy, we also want to spread the opportunities of our economy around every corner of our country. We grow the economy, we grow the pie but we also do that to spread opportunity. In particular, given the fact that we have a mining boom, this budget was an opportunity to spread some of those benefits right around our economy to many of those people who do not feel like they are in the fast lane of the mining boom, to those people who feel like it is somebody else's boom. That is why we have put in place very substantial assistance to 1.5 million lower-income families. That is why we have put in place the new schoolkids bonus that the minister was talking about before. It was incredibly opposed by those opposite. How could you oppose an existing measure which really gives cost of living relief to families when they need it?                              They come in here and talk cost of living all the time, but suddenly it disappears when it is the cost of kids going back to school. Then it is not a matter for them to be concerned about. They do not care. They simply do not get it. They really do not get it when it comes to growing our economy. They certainly do not get it when it comes to cost of living pressures on families, particularly those for people who are trying to educate a couple of kids. But they also do not get it when it comes to tax reform and relief for small business. Our loss carry back is a very important initiative. They also voted in this House against the $6,500 instant asset write-off that is going to be so important to up to 2.7 million small businesses right across our country.                              But where they really do not get it - and I think this is where we had a real clanger from the shadow Treasurer during the week - is where it comes to the National Disability Insurance Scheme. They can give a tax cut to Clive Palmer and Gina Rinehart, but they cannot support disabled Australians in our community. We heard the truth about that from the shadow Treasurer. They are happy to see people in a wheelchair go to the back of the queue, but they are happy to put Clive and Gina at the front of the queue.

  I do thank the member for that question. I want to spend a bit of time on it because I think it just demonstrates how irresponsible the opposition is. As I indicated to the House last sitting week, we were seeking to get a buffer over and above the debt cap of $250 billion simply because there were variable moments during a year when we went over the cap. I explained the reasons for all of that in the House: we would be at the end of each year within the $250 billion cap. I even went to the lengths of giving the shadow Treasurer a minute from the AOFM as to why this is not controversial. But if it does become controversial then it is a serious issue. If you are going to take the wrecking ball out on this issue, in this environment, given international markets, that is seriously reckless - that is seriously dangerous. What it demonstrates is what a danger you are to the Australian economy and the Australian people.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Moreton for his question. I know, like so many people on this side of the House, he spends every waking moment of the day fighting for those hardworking families and businesses in his electorate and right across this country. That is why, I know, he is very proud to be a part of a government that is delivering a surplus budget, a part of a government that is showing economic leadership. That leadership is demonstrated by the fact that we have growth returning to trend; we have unemployment at a very low level, with a 4 in front of it - 4.9 per cent - we have inflation contained; and we have a record pipeline of investment coming into this country. All of the indicators demonstrate this is a strong economy - a strong economy being managed in the interests of working people.                              But on this side of the House we understand that, whilst this is a strong economy, there are many families and many businesses across this country that feel as though they are not sharing in the benefits of the boom. That is why we are determined to spread the benefits of the mining boom and that is why we are increasing family payments. Indeed, the member for Moreton will know, because he fights so hard for his community, that 9,000 families in his electorate will benefit from this measure. He knows that there are 6,800 families in the Moreton electorate that will benefit from the schoolkids bonus. He knows that there are 19,400 small businesses in his electorate that are very keen to take advantage of the instant asset write-off when that comes into effect on 1 July. And he, along with the rest of us, is very proud of continuing our reform agenda when it comes to productivity and job creation, and that is why he supports the loss carry-back measures that we have introduced as well. Of course, all of these economic fundamentals underline the importance of us returning the budget to surplus, and that is what we are doing to give the Reserve Bank the room that it needs to cut interest rates if it chooses to do so and to spread that relief to families and businesses across our economy.                              I think what most Australians cannot understand is why those opposite came into this place and voted against the schoolkids bonus. What most Australian cannot understand is why the Leader of the Opposition last week said that he will refuse those families an increase in their family payments. All of this is because he does not trust Australian families. He says he does not trust them to manage their budgets. Well, they should not trust him. He has a $70 billion black hole and he has no plan in terms of how he intends to fill it. But we all know to fill that black hole he would have to rip away payments and rip away services that these hardworking Australian families and businesses rely upon. He just will not tell us what they are. He will not stand up for working families and small businesses, but when it comes to spreading the benefits of the mining boom he is happy to see them trapped in the deep pockets of Clive Palmer and co. -                </DOC>

  It is true that we have had higher than expected arrivals on average in the last couple of months. It is true. But the fact is that they go up and they go down. You are not entitled to claim, on the basis of two months, a permanent figure. You are not entitled to claim that at all.                              You did correctly say that the budget estimate is 450 arrivals per month. That is true. Of course, as is usually the case, you are out there, really, conducting a campaign against the government's forecast. You always get that wrong. You will be wrong on this occasion.

  I thank my New South Wales colleague the member for Reid for his question. The carbon price, as the member for Reid indicated, will have a modest impact on the cost of living and, as the acting Prime Minister indicated earlier, only 0.7 per cent increase in the consumer price index - less than one cent in the dollar.                              To help households, the government is providing tax cuts. We are trebling the tax-free threshold to implement those costs. We are providing increases in family payments and we are increasing the pension and many other Commonwealth benefits.                              What this means is that nine out of 10 households will receive some assistance, six million households will receive assistance covering their entire expected average price impact, and four million households will receive assistance covering 120 per cent of the average price impact that we expect them to experience, meaning that they will have a buffer that will leave them - the four million lowest households in the country - better off. In fact, some of these payments for increased family tax benefits began last week and payments to pensioners will also be made during the months of May and June - an initial $250 for a single pensioner, for example, and $380 for a couple.                              Contrary to some of the commentary that we hear from the Leader of the Opposition, these increases are permanent and they are indexed. In addition to this, the budget provided for more general relief from cost-of-living pressures. That is why the budget included no less than $5 billion in new support for low- and middle-income households.                              These new measures will spread the benefits of the mining boom. They include our schoolkids bonus, which will give families $410 a year for each child in primary school, and $820 a year for each child in high school for those eligible under family tax benefit arrangements. Those initial payments will begin next month, as my ministerial colleague indicated earlier.                              The budget also included a supplementary allowance of $210 for singles and $350 for couples, to help the unemployed, to help young people, and to help single parents, with things like utilities bills. Those opposite showed their true colours in their response to many of these measures, including the schoolkids bonus. First, they patronised people by arguing that families could not be trusted to spend the money on their children. Then they voted against the schoolkids bonus, seeking to deny families thousands of dollars in assistance.                              On the one hand they create cost-of-living fear and on the other hand, when it really counts, they vote against -                </DOC>

  The fact is that those opposite want to turn this parliament into a kangaroo court. There are two very important principles at stake here. One is the presumption of innocence and the other is the separation of powers. Somehow those opposite want to say that this parliament should be making definitive judgments, not the courts of law. That is the proposition that goes to the very core of the question that has been put by the Manager of Opposition Business. They want to turn the parliament into a kangaroo court for their own political purposes, because there is no institution, there is no principle, that this Leader of the Opposition will not trash.                              This is not a consistent position from those opposite. We have already heard some words from a number on the cross bench here about how it is important to have the separation of powers in the parliament - that the parliament should not become a kangaroo court - but someone else has said something pretty telling about this. Of course, that was the current Leader of the Opposition, in a debate in this parliament back in 2007, when one member for parliament, the member for Bowman, was the subject of very serious allegations. The member for Bowman was the subject of serious allegations, and this is what the then Leader of the Opposition said.                                                                    Mr SWAN:                    He said:                              The matter is really now before the police and perhaps the Criminal and Misconduct Commission in Queensland, and let's let those authorities make their investigations and come to any conclusion.                              He's a backbench member of parliament and I think he's entitled to stay in the parliament until these bodies have come to their conclusions.                              That is what he said when we were dealing for the member for Bowman and a couple of others who had very serious charges against them, as well. So the tune has changed somewhat since 2007. What is really different here is that this speaks volumes about the modern Liberal Party.                                                                    Mr SWAN:                    I take these issues very seriously. The government takes these issues very seriously. But at a time when we have economic volatility in Europe and a time when Australia is on the cusp of fantastic opportunities, what are those opposite doing in the parliament? They are getting out the mud bucket! That is what they are doing! They are not in here talking about the big issues that Australians want them to talk about. This Leader of the Opposition has got the mud bucket out, because this Leader of the Opposition is always about confrontation. For him, his leadership is the political equivalent of 'bringing back the biff'. The problem with that is that when you bring back the biff, people get hurt. We understand on this side of the House how important it is to respect the separation of powers, to respect the fact that when people have a charge against them they are entitled to be presumed innocent until proven guilty. But not in the modern Liberal Party. They have taken the wrecking ball to any convention -                </DOC>

  I thank the member for Parramatta for her question. She, like everyone on this side of the House, is very committed to working Australians and their families. We are committed to it and that is why we have got behind the last budget, because working Australians and their families are big winners out of the last budget.                              The best way that they are big winners is that we are bringing the budget into surplus. It is a remarkable accomplishment when you look around the rest of the world to see how well this government and our Treasurer have done in producing a surplus. Furthermore, when we talk about the surplus, that is not the only way that we are helping working Australians and their families deal with the mining boom. There is no question that the mining boom has been very good for some Australians, but not for all Australians. We have seen the pressure on the dollar. We have seen investment going to the mining areas and we have seen other parts of the Australian economy do it harder - manufacturing, domestic tourism and education services. This is a budget which is about helping spread the benefits of the mining boom to all Australians.                              There is a long list of how working Australians get helped in this budget. First of all, we have seen this budget build upon previous Labor budgets and, in fact, two weeks ago we saw the ABS employment statistics for April say that 11½ million Australians are working. This is the largest number ever in the history of the Commonwealth. The jobs are being created - 87,000 jobs in 2012 alone. We know this year will be hard on employment but, even contrary to some of the expectations, we have been going better than we dared hope.                              It is not just about creating jobs in this budget; it is also about the skills. Last financial year 320,000 people entered apprenticeships. If you want to do something for working Australians, give their children and their young ones an opportunity to get a skill and a trade. The list goes on. We have seen in this budget support for older Australians to be able to find work and support for sole parents to be able to find work. We have also seen support for people who receive family tax benefit part A. We have seen support for families to help make ends meet. If they have two children, they get $600 - that is real money. If they have one child, they get $300.                              This list of the accomplishments of this budget in helping people do not stop there. For example, there is the schoolkids bonus. We hear a lot from the opposition complaining about how some people get attacked by the government - well, let me tell you: I have never seen such a massive smear on parents with school age children who receive family tax benefit part A.                                                                    Mr SHORTEN:                    You might not like hearing it, but you shouldn't have said it! Australian parents can be trusted to spend money on their kids. If you do not know that, then get out and talk to some parents trying to make ends meet. It does not just stop at the school bonus for kids. How about that tax-free threshold - below $18,000, no tax. How about some social justice for people trying to make sure that they get the benefit of this economy as it changes?                                                                    Mr SHORTEN:                    What about that billion dollars for the National Disability Insurance Scheme? We have shown our bona fides. Where are those of the opposition?              </DOC>

  The answer is very simple. The Prime Minister has dealt with this matter at length both in the parliament and out of the parliament, and so has the member for Dobell. This is just part of the continuing smear campaign which is being run by those opposite. The member for Dobell has explained his position and Prime Minister has explained her position. But those opposite want to continue to run this smear campaign. They want to take the mud bucket out.                                                                    Mr SWAN:                    Well, certainly: the shadow Treasurer also referred to this question in the media I think over the weekend when he said that he would accept the support of Mr Thomson on the floor of the parliament. That says it all!              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Bass for his question. I was with him in Scottsdale not long after the budget talking up another great initiative that will see the diversification of that economy and also taking the opportunity to demonstrate the great commitment that this government has made to regional Australia - a commitment that, I might say, did not get one mention in the Leader of the Opposition's budget speech-in-reply.                              This is a government that has made the greatest ever commitment to regional Australia in the history of this country. Last year's budget saw the biggest ever financial commitment to regions - $4.3 billion over the course of the four years - and this budget built on that. What we saw was $475 million allocated to regional hospitals and those announced in the budget and $110 million to ensure that dentists and GPs are encouraged into regional areas. There was also the significant slice of the healthcare budget that will go to regional Australia as well as the significant assistance to families in regional Australia through the schoolkids bonus and the family payments.                              I also say that, because we have now passed the minerals resource rent tax, the regions will now be able to experience a further three Regional Development Australia Fund funding rounds. We have announced the first, which was $150 million and which leveraged more than three times that in terms of investment. We are about to announce the second round of $200 million, but the final three rounds would not be there if the minerals resource rent tax had not been passed. Those that sit opposite will abolish that when they come in. In other words, they will cut the very means by which regions in this country will benefit.                              We on this side have always understood the importance of regions. Whenever they have come to office, they have either abolished the department of regional development or scrapped the program. They have even gone so far as to say that they have no constitutional role in the Commonwealth for regional development. That is what the opposition stands for - they are anti the regions. Those regions which see the opportunities going forward for economic diversification as well sustainability as well as a fair go for the families out there will only get it from Labor governments. This budget has underpinned those credentials yet again and exposed those who sit opposite as not being supporters of the regions whatsoever.              </DOC>

  In terms of the Fair Work Australia report I have said on previous occasions, and I am certainly happy to repeat it here, that this investigation will be tested in court. I think this is important. There has much been said about this investigation, and the member for Dobell has given his statement in the last couple of hours about it. I certainly believe that the investigation has taken too long. What I also know is this: the investigation stage is at a conclusion. I believe it is fundamentally important to the members of some of the parts of the HSU that have been affected by this inquiry that they see this matter brought to a close - all of the matters, including the question which the opposition member raised. I also think that these matters have to be brought to a close in the correct way: they have to be tested in court.                              I also say this in passing: I think we owe it to the individuals caught up in this controversy and their families to have this matter tested in court. This parliament should not be judge and jury; we owe it to everybody who has been caught up in this disturbing, regrettable and unfortunate issue - the whole issue. If the people opposite are so outraged by what has happened, at least respect the process enough to let the matter be brought to a conclusion in the way it should be as opposed to by any other sort of kangaroo court of political opportunism.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Lyons for his very important question, because it goes to how the government can provide support for small business. The fact is that there are more than 2.7 million small businesses in this country and that they employ almost five million Australians. It is therefore very critical that we attend to their needs. As a result, the first important thing that this government did in relation to the budget was to ensure that it returned to surplus, because it creates the environment for monetary policy to work with government fiscal policy to improve the lot of small business. That is the first thing.                              The second thing that I would like to say in relation to small business for Lyons and for every electorate around this country and for the small businesses that live within those electorates is that we have dedicated initiatives to ensure we provide support for small businesses. Firstly, there has been the loss carry-back initiative, a fantastic opportunity for those small businesses who seek to invest or innovate to claim losses of up to $1 million on taxes already paid on previous profits. This has been well received by COSBOA, by employer bodies and by small businesses across the country to provide opportunities for them. I also refer to the initiative that has been referred to by the Acting Prime Minister and the Assistant Treasurer insofar as the instant asset tax write-off is concerned. This is also a very important initiative, targeting small businesses who need to deal with cash flow issues. This provides an opportunity for a 100 per cent depreciation after one year on every asset purchased up to $6½ thousand. This is a fantastic initiative, one that has been embraced by small businesses that I have met, whether it has been in Grafton in regional New South Wales or whether it has been in Cairns or in Launceston or in Devonport or in the capital cities, where I have been meeting with small businesses to talk about those issues.                              Of course, they have asked me: why is it that the Leader of the Opposition opposed the proposed tax cut for business? I had trouble explaining it because it would be the first time in living memory that a Liberal leader would oppose a company tax cut for businesses. It would be the first time that that had occurred. We said that, as a result of the obstinance by the opposition to prevent small business getting the tax relief, we would find another way to improve consumer and business confidence - and we have done that, dedicating resources to families across this country in order for them to be better off and to cope with cost of living pressures. We will keep dealing with these issues. This is important for small business and -                </DOC>

  What I can say is this: after the introduction of a carbon price, our economy will continue to grow, and grow strongly. We will continue to generate income. We will grow strongly. If you look at where we have been in the last few years and where we can go, we have been in a position where we have been growing unlike any other developed economy. In the next two years we are going to outperform every other major developed economy, and everyone on this side of the House is proud of our job creation record. Over 800,000 jobs have been created in this country - in the past year something like 90,000 jobs. On the Thursday after the budget, we had the Bureau of Statistics figures, which showed that unemployment in Australia was at 4.9 per cent. That is something we are proud of as well.                              But we also understand that our economy does face great structural changes and that there are people who do unfortunately lose their jobs. We should give them our full support. Those workers that have lost their jobs at Qantas should receive the full support of Qantas and should receive their entitlement to whatever benefits and support can come from the government, and we will do our utmost to help each and every one of them.                              But for those on that side of the House to maintain that these job losses are somehow the result of the introduction of a carbon price shows how dishonest those opposite are - completely dishonest with their scare campaign. They have no shame, because this is the crew that would not stand up for the Australian workforce at the height of the global financial crisis, when they came into this House and the Leader of the Opposition slept through the critical vote to save Australia, to save Australian small businesses and to support our employment. The Liberal Party were missing in action.                              This government provides an enormous amount of support to ensure that our economy continues to grow. We are investing in the productive side of our economy. We are doing everything we possibly can to set our economy up for the future. Putting in place carbon pricing reform is just as important a reform as bringing down the tariff wall, the introduction of national superannuation and the introduction of enterprise bargaining. We are doing this because we are all about jobs. Jobs are the No. 1 priority of every member on this side of the House, and they will continue to be our priority. We will not shirk the hard decisions. We will support the Australian workforce every day of the week.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Melbourne Ports for that very important question, because the stability and security of Afghanistan is firmly in the interests of our region and our country. As the Prime Minister has said, we are on track to complete the transition in Afghanistan by the end of 2014. After the transition, Afghanistan will have responsibility for its own security. Of course, the nature of Australia's engagement in Afghanistan will change, but our commitment to development and stability in Afghanistan will remain. That is why the Prime Minister has worked directly with world leaders - the US President and others - to make sure that we get in place a plan for the future. That is why the Prime Minister has also met with the Afghan President and signed a new partnership agreement between our two nations. This is a very clear demonstration of Australia's long-term commitment to supporting Afghanistan's security, development and governance following transition.                              Of course, we are committed to lifting living standards in one of the poorest countries in the world, and we will also be in full support of efforts to combat transnational threats such as terrorism and narcotics. There will also be greater commercial engagement between our two countries. This partnership will be backed up with a commitment to see our aid increase substantially between now and 2015-16. There will be a commitment to increase our aid from $165 million a year to $250 million a year. As we are already doing, we will be building more schools, more infrastructure and more health and education services. This new partnership will provide the assistance that Afghanistan requires for its future development, and it certainly does build on the very substantial foreign aid that we are providing right across our region and across the globe. Our aid budget is a reflection of our commitment to assist with the development of the world's poorest nations, and with this new agreement we will continue to do that.              </DOC>

Mr SWAN:                    It certainly was - the assertion about the council in Queensland was just wrong. But I will go through the issue. The majority of landfills and the majority of councils in Australia will have no liability under the carbon price. The landfills have to be big enough to be liable. Many of them will never have to pay for emissions for waste deposited before 1 July 2012 and there will be no liability for the whole of 2012-13. The government and the regulator will engage directly with the councils to talk about these matters and to make the assessment as to whether they are liable or not.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Petrie for her question. I know she is a tireless advocate for the people of north Brisbane in her electorate of Petrie. This government understands the pressures that the patchwork economy is placing on Australian families and small businesses, and that is why we are determined to manage the economy to spread the benefits of the mining boom and to ensure that we keep our economy strong. And it is a strong economy; it is an economy that has been growing strongly. It is now seven per cent larger than it was before the global financial crisis hit. We have low unemployment, at 4.9 per cent, and contained inflation. We have a record pipeline of investment coming into this country and our public finances are amongst the strongest in the world. A AAA credit rating from all three major ratings agencies is something that was achieved under this government for the first time in our nation's history.                              Not only are we determined to spread the benefits of the mining boom and manage the economy in the interests of working people but we are determined to do it whilst also cutting taxes. And we have been cutting taxes. Since we came to office we have delivered $47 billion worth of personal income tax cuts. And now we are delivering a new wave of tax reforms. We are tripling the tax-free threshold from 1 July, and that will mean one million Australians will not even have to lodge a tax return. We are delivering tax cuts to over seven million Australian workers. Over six million of them will receive $300 a year in a tax cut. This is real tax reform impacting on real people.                              At the same time, we are delivering tax reform for small businesses. On the one hand we have introduced our instant asset write-off. We have also introduced measures that will be coming into effect shortly that will allow for the carry-back of losses. These are measures that underpin our approach to cutting taxes. But the best evidence that this is a low-tax government is our tax to GDP ratio. It is at 22.1 per cent in the coming year. How does that compare with previous governments? When the previous government left office it was at 23.7 per cent. In fact, it hit a record high of 24.25 per cent back when they were in government.                              If we were taxing at those levels today, we would be bringing in an extra $33 billion in tax every year. We are a low-taxing government and they were a high-taxing government. And then we heard last week from the shadow Treasurer that he wants to scrap the tax cuts that we are about to introduce. He wants to scrap them, he wants to claw them back. The Australian people know that we support families and businesses. The opposition want to hike up taxes -                </DOC>

  I thank the shadow Treasurer for that question because it is a very important question. It is true that the government has a modest borrowing program. Those opposite have decided to go around the country and run a scare campaign about that as well.                              The truth of the matter is we do have a modest borrowing program and net debt is 9.6 per cent of GDP in 2011-12. Let us get things into perspective because that is about one-tenth of debt elsewhere across other major developed economies, so very modest. This is why the major rating agencies have given us our AAA gold plated rating. Our credit worthiness is very high. It is the highest rating they can give. This country, led by this government, has been given that by the rating agencies for the first time in our history. It certainly was not given to this country when those opposite were in government. Net debt at about 9.6 per cent of GDP is like someone earning $100,000 a year and owing a modest $9,600 a year. Net interest payments in 2012-13 will be 0.5 per cent of GDP and that is like someone earning $100,000 a year and paying only $500 in interest. This just puts our debt into perspective. What we have here is an irresponsible scare campaign -                                                                     Mr SWAN:                    I certainly am answering the question. If he wants to go into the ins and outs of every figure, he can read it in the budget papers.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for New England for his question. I know he has shown an interest in Indigenous employment for quite some time now and I know that he, like the government, is very committed to closing the gap on Indigenous employment, and I value his interest in this very important subject.                              The government signed the Australian Employment Covenant in 2008. Since 2009, through the Indigenous Employment Program, there have been more than 83,000 placements of Indigenous Australians into jobs or training. Of that 83,000, more than 38,000 of those placements have been into actual jobs. We are very committed to our target of closing the gap. When it comes to the 61,000 job commitments from the Australian Employment Covenant, the Australian government has supported the Australian Employment Covenant with more than $7 million so far for their Indigenous Employment Program.                              We have been working with the Australian Employment Covenant to ensure that when these jobs come online that we actually have Indigenous Australians trained and ready to take them up. It is important to remember that not all of the jobs come online straight away. They are forward commitments of large companies across Australia. In fact, we already have more than 73 covenant employers for which we are providing direct support today of more than $132 million. These job placements currently are with companies such as Coles, Woolworths, some of the big banks, Accor Hotels and Linfox. I am in regular contact with the Australian Employment Covenant and I have also met several times with GenerationOne in relation to Indigenous employment. I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate those employers that are taking their commitments very seriously indeed.                              I visited the Pilbara last week. I visited the Fortescue Metals VTEC model. I also went and visited Rio Tinto, Woodside, Ngarda Civil and Mining to look at some of their Indigenous employment programs. The VTEC model is just one of those. I understand the commitment of Mr Forrest and of the other companies when it comes to Indigenous employment. What I have said is that we want to do an evaluation of the Indigenous employment programs such as VTEC before we commit any further funding. That evaluation will look at real outcomes for Indigenous Australians and it will also look at value for money for taxpayers for these programs. The Indigenous Employment Program is funded for $650 million over four years and we are very committed to ensuring that we have Indigenous Australians in jobs and that we continue to close the gap on Indigenous employment.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for La Trobe for that very important question, because our economy does walk tall in the world. We have solid growth, we have low unemployment, we have contained inflation, we have rock-solid public finances and of course we have a huge investment pipeline. One of the reasons we are in such a strong position is what this government did at the height of the global financial crisis and the global recession to support employment in this country. We got the best outcomes of any developed economy in the world. Of course, those opposite, if they would have had their way, would have seen Australia go into recession, deficits and debt would have been higher, unemployment would have been higher and business closures would have been higher. But our economy is fundamentally stronger because of what we did at the height of the global financial crisis and the global recession.                              Now we do expect to return to trend growth and, given the investment pipeline, we are in a position to spread the opportunities from this growth right around our country, to make sure that these opportunities go to every postcode, to make sure that these opportunities do not just go to those that are in the fast lane of the resources boom. Plenty of people out there are sitting around and saying: 'Where is this boom? Are we part of it or not?' So the important thing that we have put in place in this budget is a plan to spread the benefits of a strong economy right around our country. Of course, that is why we are delivering tax cuts to something like seven million low- and middle-income-earning Australians. This will take something like one million Australians out of the tax system.                              These proposals would be ripped away by those opposite if they had their way. These very big tax reforms for people who are on some of the lowest incomes in our community would be ripped away. It is also why the budget delivers $5 billion over five years in additional support for low- and middle-income households to help with the cost of living. Here, in particular, is the schoolkids bonus, recognising how important it is to help families when the kids are back at school. Additional assistance will also be provided in additional family payments. All of these things would be ripped away by those opposite. They claim that they are concerned about the cost of living, but they are not when it comes to sending the kids to school or when it comes to actually providing some help through the family payments system.                              Of course there are also the payments that are going out now in terms of the clean energy package - payments to families and payments to pensioners. All of these would be ripped away by those opposite. In addition to that, they would rip away the instant asset write-off - this fundamental tax relief for up to 2.7 million small businesses right around this country. That too would be ripped away.                               What this really demonstrates is that those opposite have no plan to return our budget to surplus, no plan to provide tax relief for small businesses, no plan for the future of the country.               </DOC>

  Because the coalition's policy was a complete failure. This so-called 'solution' was a complete failure.                                                                    Mr SWAN:                    They might like to pretend that Nauru was a solution; it was not. But there is a solution out there that can be put in place. It is called overseas processing, it is called the Malaysian arrangement, and they are blocking it. And why are they blocking it? Because they know it will work - because they have made the judgment that they will not support overseas processing, which is the only measure which will break the people smugglers' model. They will not support it because they think it is in their political interest to have more boats arriving in Australia. So they get up and ask questions about boats arriving in Australia, but the blame rests fairly and squarely with them and their refusal to support overseas processing.              </DOC>

  I would like to thank the member for Capricornia for her question. This budget was important because it provided an opportunity for families to get additional support as they face cost of living pressures when they are raising their kids and sending them to school. Not only was it spreading the benefits of the mining boom, not only was it focused on the vulnerable in our community, but it was making sure that at that time of the year when parents know that they have got additional schooling costs - the start of term 1, the start of term 3 - if their kids are in primary school for each kid they could get $410, and if their kids were in high school they could get $820. This was a really good, positive measure that was put forward by this government, who understands that these costs are real for working families.                               Of course it came on top of record levels of investment in education by this Labor government over time. We have seen a national curriculum delivered. We have seen improvement in school facilities right around Australia. We have seen computers coming into high schools so that every kid in years 9 to 12 has the opportunity to get into the digital age. On top of all of that, we have got a budget which provides not only the tax relief that the Treasurer spoke about but also help for parents who face real cost of living pressures and know that some extra money for new school books, a uniform, some sports gear, or whatever it might be, would help them with raising their families.                              The question that I was asked, about how important this help from the government is, goes right to the heart of the challenges that parents face as they are educating their kids. When a kid comes home and says to their mum or dad, 'I need a little bit extra for a school excursion,' the parents have got to find that money out of their own pocket. We understand that these are real costs for parents around Australia. But when the Leader of the Opposition chose to block the schoolkids bonus he was saying in effect that he does not trust families to make those decisions. I do not think many people understand that 1.3 million families will benefit from this schoolkids bonus. That is 1.3 million families whom the Leader of the Opposition - who wants them to trust him as a politician - was not prepared to trust to make decisions about educating their families. I think that speaks volumes about the Leader of the Opposition.                              The shadow minister for education said something like, 'This is just a sugar hit.' I suspect that left a sour taste in the mouths of a few people around Australia when they heard it. It highlights the fact that those opposite do not understand that families face real cost of living pressures and that this government is providing them with support as they send their kids to school.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Capricornia for that important follow-up question. In Capricornia, some 8,650 families are expected to benefit from the schoolkids bonus. That is a lot of families who know what it is like to meet those additional education costs for their kids. Now, because of the budget that has been brought down by this government, they will have the opportunity to do that. It is not only 8,600 or so families in Capricornia but also 280,000 families in Queensland who are also expected to benefit.                              The government understand how important education is. We know that every young Australian student who has the opportunity to be at a school that has good facilities provided by this government, access to computers provided by this government, teachers with good quality training provided by this government, and a national curriculum delivered by this government will benefit. In the electorate of Capricornia, 13 schools have benefitted from eight trades training centres and more than $20 million from us. That is 13 schools who have benefited under national partnerships from the investment that we have made in making sure that there is teacher quality in schools, support for teachers as they teach kids, and improvements and additional effort on literacy and numeracy. All of these significant investments are happening not only in Capricornia but right around Queensland, because this government understands the importance of education.              </DOC>

  No, I do not, and I would like to take some time to explain why. There is an enormous difference between the decision taken by the Prime Minister and the decision taken by the member for Dobell to go to the crossbenches and what has been put forward by the opposition in this House. There is an enormous difference. What is going on in this House today is that those opposite want this parliament to be a kangaroo court. We saw that earlier today with the reference to the Privileges Committee by the Manager of Opposition Business. He wants this parliament to be judge, jury and executioner; whereas we on this side of the House believe that people are innocent until they are proven guilty and that they should be given an opportunity to explain themselves. Those on that side of the House want to turn this parliament into a kangaroo court. They should be ashamed of the tactics that they have applied in this House both yesterday and again today.                              The opposition have basically been trashing the rule of law in our country. That is what has been going on. They have been coming into this House and denying the presumption of innocence, and they have been denying the separation of power. All of this comes from the Leader of the Opposition. All of it comes from him. He wants to tear down the very pillars of our democracy. He wants to tear down the rule of law for political gain. I will tell you what: that is not leadership; that is weakness and cowardice. I can tell everybody in this House, and you can literally feel it here: there is a stench of negativity about this Leader of the Opposition and everybody over there knows it. These are the sort of 'say anything, do anything' tactics that we have had from the Leader of the Opposition that demonstrate that he is unfit for high office.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Blair very much for his question and for all the work that he does for the people in his electorate, in the Ipswich area. I was very pleased to be with him in Ipswich late last week to meet with people with disability, people providing services to those with disability and their families and carers and to especially talk to them about the government's plans to introduce a national disability insurance scheme. We certainly are getting on with that job, and I appreciate the way in which the member for Blair and the people in Ipswich were so supportive of the government's moves.                              For the information of the people of Blair, from 20 June around 11,000 families will start to receive the schoolkids bonus, and of course that will mean that people who need a helping hand will get it with their education costs. One of the important things for that area is that that will mean not only that those thousands and thousands of families are going to get that extra bit of help but also that the newsagents, the clothing shops and those places that sell shoes and all the things that kids need will see a boost to the local economy. We expect around $11 million to be spent in the member for Blair's electorate, and that certainly will help those retailers as well as those families. This will be the case right around the country as we see parents get this extra help for all the things that their children need. We expect around one million families will get extra money.                              I have had quite a lot of correspondence from families around the country, one parent saying that he applauds 'the new schoolkids bonus - a lot less paperwork, always a good thing.' Of course, we know that did not stop the opposition from saying no. It does not matter what the public thinks, the opposition just say no. Parents say they want this schoolkids bonus; the opposition say no. The opposition say that they do not trust parents. Parents have found this deeply insulting. I heard from another mother recently, and she knows exactly how she will be spending this money. She is going to spend it on a new school uniform for her child - 'Something,' as she said to me, 'I had to put off due to struggling financially.' Of course, that is something that those opposite do not understand at all. This government is determined to do everything it can to help parents and to make sure it supports them. All those opposite can do is say no and make it plain that they intend to claw back this assistance from families.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Bradfield for his question. I do have confidence in 'full work Australia', Fair Work Australia.                                                                    Mr SHORTEN:                    Sorry, I was momentarily confused with our very good unemployment numbers - 4.9 per cent. But, in terms of Fair Work Australia, I do have confidence and I do have confidence in the work they do. I have confidence that when they hear the minimum wage case which started yesterday they will put the interest of low-paid workers first. I have confidence in Fair Work Australia to ensure that collective bargaining is done to accomplish the best interests of employers and employees. I have confidence in Fair Work Australia to make sure that workers have an opportunity to have a say in their workplace.                              I have confidence in Fair Work Australia to be able to ensure that when unfair dismissal applications are made they are handled in the most appropriate manner possible. I have confidence in Fair Work Australia to do the right thing by employers and by workers in Australia. I have no confidence in those opposite to ever do the right thing by Australian working people.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Fremantle for this question, and I know that she is particularly interested in the answer. In addition to all of the comments that have been made already in question time today by the minister for education and the minister for families, looking at the practical things that we can do to provide assistance to families who have children both at primary school and in secondary school, the member for Fremantle, along with a number of people on this side of the House, has been advocating for some time for the establishment of a national children's commissioner. This is an issue that we are giving attention because, as well as supporting families across the board with the costs of looking after children, we want to make sure that children, particularly those in vulnerable situations, do have an advocate absolutely dedicated to listening to their needs and making sure that the voices of children are heard, and that in our policy making - like we did when the Treasurer put together this budget - we continue to pay attention to the needs of children.                              I am particularly pleased that I have been asked about this today, because tomorrow in this place we will be taking the important step of introducing legislation to establish the first National Children's Commissioner within the Australian Human Rights Commission. The National Children's Commissioner will have the important task of promoting the rights, wellbeing and development of children and young people in Australia. This will mean that for the first time Australia will have a dedicated advocate focused on the human rights of children and young people at the national level, and it will see issues of children continue to be front and centre of the government's policy development, instead of sidelining these concerns.                                                                    Ms ROXON:                    I take those interjections, because the point already made by ministers who have answered a range of questions today is that we are already heavily focused on the needs of children and the needs of families with children, particularly -                                                                     Ms ROXON:                    the cost of bringing up those children but also their needs. Whether it is making sure that there is more research, whether it is making sure that they have adequate advocacy or whether it is educational programs that can be conducted, these will all unashamedly focus on the needs of the most vulnerable children in our society. Crucially, the commissioner is going to consult directly with children and young people to ensure that their voices are heard and their needs are pursued. Talking directly with kids will signal that, as adults, we think that they matter, that we value their childhood and that we will listen to their needs and their hopes. This has been a longstanding policy of the Labor Party. I am delighted that we are now able to make this a reality because of a provision set aside in this year's budget. I think it highlights that, as well as being able to bring our budget into surplus and spread the benefits of the mining boom, this budget looks after those who are most vulnerable in the community, including those whose voices are often not heard.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Mayo for his first question on industrial relations since he designed Work Choices. I listened carefully to the member for Dobell's speech. Let me put this on the record: there has been no evidence of misconduct provided to me about the matter which you are raising. There has been no evidence of misconduct provided to me. However, when I am asked about the statement and the matters referred to in the statement, let me also put on the record - as this government has done any number of occasions since the release of the Fair Work Australia general manager's delegates report into the HSU - that something has clearly gone very wrong in parts of the HSU. The conduct and behaviour, the subject of the findings, are unacceptable. It is disturbing.                                                                    Mr SHORTEN:                    Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. To take up where I left off, the question asked by the member for Mayo is clearly politically motivated. There is no doubt that those who are responsible for the conduct reported in parts of the Health Services Union should be held accountable. We owe it to the members, we owe it to their families. But to do so means the court processes must be upheld. I think it is time for those opposite to stop engaging in the personal destruction of people. It is time for those opposite to accept that the court processes are the best place to test the evidence. It is in fact time for those opposite to return to the matters of importance in the national debate about the future of work and workplace relations. It is time for those opposite to raise their voice not in some sort of swamp of self-righteousness. It is time for those opposite to stand up and raise -                                                                     Mr SHORTEN:                    It is time for those opposite to stop being self-righteous and instead - why don't they ever vote for an increase in super for low-paid health workers? Why don't they ever vote for a pay rise for low-paid workers? Will they be making a submission to the minimum wage case in favour of health workers? I think not.                                                                    Mr SHORTEN:                    No.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Moreton for the question and the strong interest he is taking in environmental issues in Queensland. It has been the position of this government for some time, since we issued our response to the Hawke review on national environmental law reform, that if you can - without reducing the national standards of environmental law - have more of the referrals being done at a state level, then you can achieve the same environmental outcomes without increasing the burden on business. We have argued for a year that it is the right thing to do and our amendments that we will be bringing into the parliament will reflect that.                               Notwithstanding that, the Queensland Premier has gone further and has been demanding that these things be done immediately. He has also been demanding that he become the enforcer of national environmental powers at the COAG meeting. Well, it only took a fortnight after that before he went from saying he wanted to enforce national environmental law to wanting to tear it down. From time to time, people will ridicule environmental protections for endangered species when it is a species no-one has ever heard of, when it is something that if you saw it in your garden you would think was a weed, when it is some sort of thrice-mutated frog. But only the Queensland National Party could say that an obscure species unworthy of protection was going by the name 'koala'. Only the Queensland National Party would be able to say, 'Well, we are just going too far if we going to protect the koala under national environmental law.'                               So I say to the Queensland Premier, if he still wants to have a go at taking on and getting rid of some of the processing times, which we believe should happen - I wrote more than a week ago to my counterpart, the Queensland environment minister, as I did to the other states' environment ministers, and said there is one species where the delays have caused immense pain and annoyance for communities. Many members of parliament here on both sides of the House, notably the member for Kennedy, have complained for a long time about the impact of flying foxes when they are in urban communities, when they are in schools, when they are in hospitals, when they are in parks. There is a limited period each year when you can relocate them, and every day that you delay that with processing times makes the problem worse. It ends up with communities being saddled with these problems.                              I have written to the Queensland government saying, 'If you want this power on flying foxes, let's agree, and agree quickly, through a conservation agreement' - not a word in response. It is one thing to spend all your time grandstanding, but if he actually wants these powers it is time to play, to sign the document instead of just writing media releases, and to get an outcome that the people of Queensland can benefit from.              </DOC>

  I believe that the report prepared by the delegate for the general manager of Fair Work Australia, Terry Nassios, is a very serious report. It is a report which we have said is disturbing in its findings. I also believe that we owe it to the members of this union to see this process reach its end - which is for the matter to be tested in court. This parliament is not qualified to test and cross-examine these matters -                                                                     Mr SHORTEN:                    This government will not be diverted from its process to make sure that the report is concluded and that the matters listed in the report are tested in the court.

  I take the opportunity to thank the member for Page for her question and for her long-held interest in this area. The member for Page knows well that our government has just delivered a budget which will return us to surplus, a budget that spreads the benefits of the mining boom but also, importantly, a budget that supports the most vulnerable people in Australia. Of course, we know that many of the most vulnerable people in Australia are those who are outside of the labour market - those who are unemployed and, in some cases, who have been trapped in a cycle of intergenerational welfare dependence. This Labor budget commits some $9.3 billion to our employment services over the next four years so that we can help spread the benefits of our prosperity.                               With an April unemployment rate of 4.9 per cent, we know that hundreds of thousands of Australians are sharing in the benefits and the dignity of work. But statistics like this do not just happen. We worked hard to create Job Services Australia, and I can now inform the House that, less than three years after these services were established, our providers have now successfully made over one million job placements across the nation. It is significant that amongst these placements the outcomes for the most disadvantaged Australians - for those suffering mental illness, for those who are homeless and for those facing multiple disadvantage - have improved by a staggering 90 per cent.                              This is the agenda that we are progressing. This is the Labor way: ensuring that individuals are not left on the sidelines, that those with the capacity to work are in work and that they are given every opportunity to participate. We know this is for their benefit but it is also for the benefit of our economy and our productivity. We are proud of the progress that we have made but we know that there is more to be done. In our budget we have announced new measures, new support, for the job seekers who need it the most, and new incentives for employers to help those job seekers to get that first foot in the door that they need.                              Our government has been very clear that no-one should be left behind. We are committed to ensuring that Australians have the chance to share in our prosperity. Through this focus, through this budget, we are creating jobs. We are supporting the workers who put in the hard slog and deserve the benefit, but we are also increasing workforce participation to help spread the benefits of the strong economy, and our nation is both stronger and fairer as a result of it.              </DOC>

  To the Leader of the Opposition's question, I am of course always concerned when I hear news of job losses. For the individual workers involved and for their families this is a very difficult time and I certainly feel for them and we will be working to support them. But I also think it is very important that in this place and beyond this place -                                                                     Ms GILLARD:                    we are clear as to what the reasons are and what the pressures are on the aluminium industry. I am very conscious of those pressures on the industry that are happening here in Australia and overseas. The reality is that the continuing fallout from the global financial crisis, along with increased global capacity, is putting downward pressure on world aluminium prices. Aluminium prices peaked at $3,300 per tonne but are now approximately $2,000 per tonne - that is US dollars - representing a fall of 40 per cent.                              This depression in global aluminium prices has resulted in numerous closures around the world of older, less competitive smelters. Hydro Aluminium has consistently identified the strong Australian dollar, low metal prices and current international -                                                                     Ms GILLARD:                    I took the question seriously and presumed that the Leader of the Opposition was actually concerned about these job losses. Obviously these workers are just political fodder to him; the same way that the steelworkers he stood alongside have just been props, because he has not been prepared to support their jobs. I am identifying the factors that Hydro Aluminium has pointed to as relating to the news today about these jobs: the strong Australian dollar, low metal prices and current international economic conditions. Minister Combet has spoken directly to the company today, and they are very clear that their current financial pressures have nothing to do with the carbon price. So the Leader of the Opposition should not come into this place and mislead. He should not do that.                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    I would point out to the Leader of the Opposition - and this might be a fact that he is interested in -                                                                     Ms GILLARD:                    that the key uncertainty facing this company currently is the refusal of the New South Wales government to reach agreement over a long-term electricity supply contract. So, if the Leader of the Opposition is really concerned about these jobs as opposed to his mock political concern, then he may consider getting on the phone and speaking to his Liberal counterpart Premier O'Farrell about that matter. Beyond that, he should not come into this parliament and mislead this place or these workers about the reasons for these job losses.              </DOC>

This was a pivotal summit for outlining the future strategy in Afghanistan, building on the transition strategy agreed in Lisbon around two years ago in 2010. We had the opportunity at this summit to be briefed by General Allen on progress in Afghanistan. His brief about that progress accords with what we hear from our Australian Defence Force, and that is that progress is being made and transition is on track as a strategy.                              The province in which we work, Oruzgan province, will commence its transition in coming months. That is expected to take 12 to 18 months, and at the end of the transition process the bulk of Australian forces will be able to return home. The work of transition is, of course, the work of training, but pressure needs to be maintained on the insurgents. Al-Qaeda has been hit hard, and the momentum of the insurgency has been stalled.                              At the same time it is appropriate and necessary that there be progress in governance, aid and development. Afghanistan is one of the poorest countries on earth, and Australia has been contributing to its aid and development. Work needs to be done as well on political reconciliation, which needs to be an Afghan led and Afghan owned process.                              Beyond the days of transition in Oruzgan province and before the end of 2014, when the NATO combat mission will cease, Australia will continue to be engaged in Afghanistan. We will particularly be engaged in training in the Afghan Artillery School and training army officers in a UK led training initiative. We will also be maintaining a role for special forces during that period to deal with counterterrorism work.                              Beyond 2014, the mission will change. The combat mission will be at an end. But there will be a need, as was discussed at the summit, for the international community to stay engaged with Afghanistan - to stay engaged in training, advice and assistance; to stay engaged in the provision of aid and development moneys. In Chicago I had the opportunity to sign a long-term partnership on those questions with President Karzai and, as I have made clear here and in Chicago, Australia has an open door to a continuing role for special forces, should that be necessary.                              The summit achieved its outcomes as set and established, and Australians can be assured that the transition strategy in Afghanistan is on track.               </DOC>

  I would have to say I am a little bit surprised by the shadow Treasurer's question, because the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Treasurer have been going around the nation saying that the cost-of-living increases from the carbon price will be 'astronomical'. And then the shadow Treasurer comes in today and actually backs in the figures about cost-of-living increases - about a $9.90 increase rather than the wild and inaccurate figures that have been used in the Leader of the Opposition's fear campaign. So I thank the shadow Treasurer -                                                                     Ms GILLARD:                    I thank the shadow Treasurer for bringing to an end the Leader of the Opposition's cost-of-living scare campaign. The next time the Leader of the Opposition says the cost-of-living increases will be 'astronomical', we will remind him of this moment when the shadow Treasurer pulled the rug out from under him.                              To the shadow Treasurer: the figures that the government has worked on are the figures that have been modelled by Treasury. As electricity price regulators around the nation have made the determinations about the impact of carbon pricing on electricity prices, that modelling has been shown to be right - bang on the money. It has been right in Queensland and right in New South Wales - right in those places where electricity price regulators have actually sat and made a determination about the impact of carbon pricing. So the shadow Treasurer should know that the Treasury modelling done by the same people that the shadow Treasurer relied on when he was in government has been verified to date.                              The shadow Treasurer should also acknowledge that, for the lowest income Australian families, we have provided a buffer of more compensation. They will come out better off. That is something that the shadow Treasurer wants to rip away from them. He wants to make them worse off. Millions of Australian families will receive enough compensation for the flow-through impact of carbon pricing. The real risk to the cost-of-living pressures for these families actually arises from the shadow Treasurer and his $70-billion plan to rip away the services that Australians rely on, his plan to take away their tax cuts, his plan to take away their pension increases, his plan to rip away their family payments, his plan to even rip away family payments not at all associated with carbon pricing, and his direct refusal to assist families with the cost of getting the kids to school.                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    That is the real set of cost-of-living pressures on Australian families flowing from the reckless policies of the Leader of the Opposition and his friends.               </DOC>

  I thank the member for Banks for his question. Over the weekend and on Monday I accompanied the Prime Minister at the NATO International Security Assistance Force summit in Chicago. In the course of those two days, I had the opportunity of exchanging views with a number of my counterparts, including Secretary of Defense for the United States, Leon Panetta; my United Kingdom colleague Philip Hammond; my Canadian colleague Peter MacKay; our New Zealand colleagues, foreign minister Murray McCully, who was representing John Key, and also the defence minister, Jonathan Coleman; and of course defence minister Wardak of Afghanistan.                              As the Prime Minister indicated, the agreement reached in Chicago on the future of Afghanistan and transition is very important. As the Prime Minister has said, we are on track for transition by the end of 2014. The agreement over the weekend also means that, by the middle of next year, by the middle of 2013, the so-called Lisbon milestone will have been met and all of Afghanistan will have commenced transition.                              The member for Banks asked me what implications this has for Oruzgan. Members might be aware that, shortly before the Chicago summit, President Karzai announced the third tranche of transition of provinces and districts in Afghanistan, and Oruzgan province as a whole was included in that tranche.                              Transition in Oruzgan we expect to occur over a 12- to 18-month period, with the transition process to commence in the next couple of months. As to Australian forces, our Mentoring Task Force is making steady and good progress in training and mentoring the 4th Battalion of the Afghan National Army, and our advice continues to be that, in the course of the 12- to 18-month period that the Prime Minister and I have referred to, the Kandaks of the 4th Brigade as a whole will be able to take lead responsibility for security in Oruzgan province and be operationally viable. Later this month, our Mentoring Task Force 5 will travel to Afghanistan and take over from Mentoring Task Force 4. This will be the first of our task forces to be involved or engaged in the transition process. In Townsville on Saturday before our departure to Chicago, the Prime Minister and I had the opportunity of meeting with members of that task force and being briefed by the Chief of Army and by the commanding officer of  Mentoring Task Force 5. Over the weekend, the Prime Minister and I made this important point: the conference was a very good success, but Afghanistan continues to be difficult and dangerous. It is difficult and dangerous for our troops deployed there and as we now commence this current, northern fighting season, I know that the thoughts of all members of the House will be with our forces in Oruzgan and Afghanistan.              </DOC>

  To the question by the Leader of the National Party, I would say that, as usual, what we are seeing is an attempt by the opposition to make wild claims and cause fear in the Australian community. We have seen it consistently with the claims about astronomical increases in the cost of living. We have seen it consistently with the Leader of the Opposition saying the coal industry would close. We have seen it consistently with the Leader of the Opposition saying Whyalla would be wiped off the map. We have seen it as the Leader of the Opposition has used working people as if they were props in a drama or a play that he was directing - standing next to a steelworker whose job he was not prepared to vote to support, or standing next to a car worker whose job he was not prepared to support. We have seen all of these tricks from the opposition as part of their fear campaign. To the opposition I say this: on 1 July we will see the truth, and the reckless claims of the opposition will crash to the ground at that time. The Leader of the Opposition will then have to explain to the Australian people why he spent month after month after month after month making such wildly inaccurate claims about carbon pricing, whilst doing absolutely no work on the policies that would make a difference to the nation's future.                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    The point I was making was, like with the many other wild claims by the opposition, we will see the truth on the 1 July.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for his question and I know that he has a keen interest in the Gonski review reforms. I understand from the Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth that both he and the member for Lyne attended a forum at Port Macquarie High School on 3 May, and that there was a very good discussion amongst local community members there about the Gonski recommendations.                              To the member, can I say this about the way in which we are approaching the Gonski review: what David Gonski and his very eminent review team did was produce a comprehensive report about a new way of approaching school funding including a school resources standard, and loadings on top for things like educational disadvantage and for students with disabilities. They did produce a figure of $5 billion, that is true, but they themselves indicated in their report that that was working with older data, and they also indicated that there were some things that we needed to do for education which were very important reforms for which they did not have the tools to do any modelling.                              To take one example of that, they indicated that there is no common assessment, or definition, of students with disabilities and so, if - as the Gonski review recommends - we were to put a loading on top for students with disabilities, we currently have no national platform or data sets which would enable us to do that. A lot of work is now happening through very collaborative working groups between the federal government, state and territory governments, the Catholic education system and the independent schools. It is only when we see the outcome of that work that we can start to make a set of decisions about how the government will resource school funding.                              Of course, the government's objective is for the budget to be in surplus and we will hold to that, but we also believe people can judge us on our record about school education. We as a government have almost doubled the amount of money going into school education, because it was so shamefully neglected by the Howard government. Questions of educational disadvantage, for example, were not even considered or debated by the Howard government. We have acted to remedy that and, of course, we will take that set of Labor values into consideration in making the next decisions, following the work being done now on the Gonski review.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Chifley for his question. When the government announced its Clean Energy Future package last July, we released comprehensive modelling by Treasury on the impacts of carbon pricing. That modelling showed very clearly that the carbon price would add about 10 per cent to electricity prices, which is around $3.30 a week per household on average - and, of course, the government is delivering assistance to the extent of an average of $10.10 per household per week.                              Price regulators in different jurisdictions are now confirming Treasury's modelling and showing a lesser impact in some states and territories than the modelling suggested. For example: in New South Wales, IPART, the independent price regulator, has issued a draft determination with a carbon price impact on the average household in New South Wales of $3.27 per week; Western Australia's regulator has found an impact around $2.45 week; in the Northern Territory it is around $2.48 a week; in Tasmania is around $3 a week. All these figures are under the Treasury-modelled cost impact.                              The government's household assistance package will provide, as I indicated, an average of $10.10 per week per household. It will do this through permanent tax cuts - by trebling the tax-free threshold, which also releases one million taxpayers from having to file a tax return. It will also deliver it through permanent increases in the pension and through payments to many self-funded retirees. It will also deliver it through permanent increases in family tax benefits and many other Commonwealth payments. This is contrary to much of the commentary that we have heard from the Leader of the Opposition.                              These are the facts: electricity prices are bang-on or a bit less than the Treasury modelling as the regulators bring in their determinations and the government is providing comprehensive assistance to households - it will reach nine out of 10 households - yet for the last 12 months the Leader of the Opposition has run around making false claims designed to engender fear that the carbon price will increase electricity prices by 20 per cent, 25 per cent or 30 per cent. That is specifically what he has claimed - just last week, the Leader of the Opposition went on a hysterical rant claiming that the carbon price will certainly force up electricity prices by 20 per cent. But, now that the facts are coming in, what they will show is that the Leader of the Opposition is nothing but a shallow political con man.              </DOC>

  Thank you very much, Madam Deputy Speaker, because that was very selective quoting indeed by the Leader of the Opposition - something we have become completely accustomed to. As has been made clear by Hydro Aluminium over a considerable period of time, there are a number of factors that are influencing this decision and the financial losses that they are incurring - essentially, the effects of growth in global supply in aluminium, the strong value of the Australian dollar over a period of time, the ongoing effects of the global financial crisis, and in fact nothing less than a 40 per cent depreciation -                                                                     Mr COMBET:                    in the price of aluminium on the London Metals Exchange. I have met the company - it is in my region - discussed these issues and discussed the pressures on the company. I spoke to a company representative again today in relation to this issue who emphasised to me that the announcement today is not driven by the implications of the carbon price; it is driven by the current pressures leading to the current financial losses that the company is incurring. You should not misrepresent this.                                                                    Mr COMBET:                    The member for Paterson, before question time, took glee in the pressure that these workers and their families are experiencing. You should be ashamed - you should be ashamed of the position that you articulated, and the Leader of the Opposition should represent the facts.                                                                  The member for Paterson then left the chamber                   -                                                                                     Mr COMBET:                    I have concluded my answer, thank you.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Fremantle for her question. I had the opportunity whilst in Chicago at the NATO/ISAF Summit to talk to a number of leaders about circumstances in the global economy and particularly current circumstances in the European economy. I had the opportunity to meet with the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, the Chancellor of Germany and the newly elected President of France. As members of the House would be aware, concern has been sparked yet again about circumstances in Europe arising from the inconclusive elections in Greece, and Greece is to go to another election. Indeed, that election will be resolved very shortly, before the forthcoming G20 meeting, and I anticipate that, just like the G8 meeting had a discussion about circumstances in the global economy, the G20 meeting will be very focused on the global economy and the circumstances of the eurozone.                              As Australians watch these reports on their TV screens, it is understandable that people would be concerned. Some of the footage, particularly from Greece, has been particularly startling, with people feeling the economic pressures there. The Greek economy has undergone a very sizeable contraction, and circumstances for many of the people of Greece are very dire indeed, with unemployment at simply staggering levels. So it is understandable that Australians watching all of this would be concerned.                              The Australian economy is not immune from international events, but Australians can be reassured that the Australian economy is in a very different circumstance from economies like Greece , like many others in Europe and even like the United States that people see on their TV screens. The fundamentals of our economy are strong. We have a AAA rating from all three credit agencies for the first time in our nation's history, strong public finances, economic growth, low unemployment and inflation within the Reserve Bank band. Consequently, that means that Australians can look on the Australian economy with confidence.                              That does not mean that there are not some pressures in the Australian economy, particularly arising from the strength of the Australian dollar, with the pressures that puts on manufacturing, tourism and other sections of the economy. But Australians can be reassured about the fundamental strengths of our economy and they can also be reassured that this government will always put jobs first, the way we did during the global financial crisis. We will continue to do so.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Hindmarsh for his question, because the OECD Economic Outlook, which was released overnight, puts Australia up in lights as the standout developed economy in the global economy. It shows Australia is the standout developed economy if you look at this report. The OECD basically says that the Australian economy is going to grow faster than any other major developed economy, not only this year but next year as well. We have heard nothing positive from the opposition about this today. The Leader of the Opposition has been out and talked about everything that could be negative but nothing that is positive for Australia. This report is a very positive report on the strength of the Australian economy. Our unemployment is low, we have very good public finances, we have a strong investment pipeline and we are growing substantially faster than most other developed OECD economies.                              We are beginning to see why the rest of the world is waking up to the pro-growth, pro-jobs approach of this government. You can see it written all the way through the OECD report. The correct decision that this government took to support demand, to support Australian employment, to support small business at the height of the global financial crisis is one of the reasons Australia is now so strong compared to other developed economies. If other developed economies had followed our course, they would be in far better shape today. We have a pro-growth, pro-jobs approach which supports all of our people. We know that the opposition at the height of the global financial crisis and the global recession opposed all of those measures which would have sent unemployment through the roof and seen the closure of tens of thousands of small businesses in this country.                               It is pleasing to see such a strong endorsement from the OECD and, in particular, such a strong endorsement from the OECD which supports coming back to surplus. This is what the OECD has to say:                              _ restoring fiscal leeway while macroeconomic conditions are still favourable, and the terms of trade high, is welcome.                              Too right it is welcome. This is the correct decision for Australia; to support employment, to support growth and to give maximum flexibility to the Reserve Bank to take decisions on interest rates should they decide to do so. It gives us the capacity to put new incentives in the tax system to support small business in terms of loss carryback and to put in place the instant asset write-off which is also going to support investment in small business. There will be 2.7 million businesses eligible to use the instant asset write-off. This is very important for future investment.                              We on this side of the House understand what must be done to manage our economy. We understand what has to be done to bring the budget back to surplus, unlike those opposite.               </DOC>

  My judgment about the member for Dobell sitting in the Labor caucus has been made and is clear. I have publicly explained it. It was about respect for the parliament. I think as a matter of common sense people would understand that there is a difference between which party rooms members of this parliament sit in and the question of being entitled to sit in this parliament itself. There is a difference in those things. Clearly sitting in this parliament itself, being here representing an electorate, is a different matter. Obviously there are exceptional circumstances in which someone can be excluded from voting, but people are entitled to vote on behalf of their constituency.                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    I am referring for example to the constitutional circumstances. I suggest if the member does not know them he ought to acquaint himself with those circumstances.                               I have been concerned throughout this matter about the presumption of innocence and prejudgment. I would refer the member for Sturt, who asked the question, to the words which I think are important: 'The irony is that the Leader of the Opposition thinks he should be judge and jury in these matters.' Those words were said by Premier O'Farrell in the New South Wales parliament. Of course, the opposition are full of hypocrisy, not consistency; nothing to do with standards, everything to do with their political interests.               </DOC>

  Yes, this is an important issue because it is about the jobs of working people and our government always takes very seriously the jobs of working Australians. We do that despite the continued negativity and day-to-day opposition of the Leader of the Opposition and his team. They did not support jobs during the global financial crisis. They did not support the jobs of steelworkers. They did not support the jobs of automobile workers. The Leader of the Opposition talks a lot about jobs but he has never acted once to support a job in this nation.                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    On the question of the jobs at Kurri Kurri, this is an important issue for those working people. Of course, when any job is lost in this country, our concern goes to the person who has lost their job, and to their family. It is a very difficult time for them. But I would refer the Leader of the Opposition to the statement made by the vice-president of the company operating the smelter on the Channel 9 news last night. He said, 'We've been losing a substantial amount of money for the first four months and we need to stop the losses' - that is, this business has been in a loss-making position. And, as the Leader of the Opposition well knows, carbon pricing does not come into effect until 1 July.                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    There is no amount of spin or negativity from the Leader of the Opposition that changes the fact that this business is in a loss-making position before carbon pricing starts on 1 July. Of course, that is because of changing conditions in the aluminium industry. We have got the continuing fallout from the global financial crisis.                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    We know that those opposite, including the shadow Treasurer, who is screaming and shouting, like to pretend the global financial crisis did not happen. Of course, it did happen and we supported jobs and you voted against Australian jobs. There is a fallout from the global financial crisis. There has been a 40 per cent fall in aluminium prices around the globe. That means there are numerous closures of older, less-competitive smelters around the world.                              The Leader of the Opposition should not treat working people with contempt by coming into this parliament and trying to pretend that circumstances about their jobs are just more fodder for his fear campaign. On this side of the parliament we respect working people, we support their jobs. The Leader of the Opposition just treats them with contempt day after day - but what else would you expect from a man who advocated Work Choices and believes in it still.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Canberra for her question. I know that she is vitally interested in jobs and the strength of the Australian economy and she understands the importance to the modern Australian economy of the resources investment pipeline. Australians, as I said yesterday, would be watching with some anxiety circumstances in the eurozone and particularly circumstances affecting Greece. People may well have noted the lack of a clear new plan emanating from a meeting of European leaders being reported in the Australian media today. From this, they would be right to conclude that there are significant headwinds in the global economy.                              But the Australian economy is walking tall despite these difficulties in the global economy. Today we have further evidence of just how our economy is walking tall in these global circumstances, and that is the fact that new figures show the resources investment pipeline is now nearly half a trillion dollars - half a trillion dollars of new investment flowing into our country, into our resources sector. This is giving our nation a once-in-a-generation opportunity to ensure that the mineral wealth within our grounds is fairly shared across the economy.                              As a Labor government we are committed to doing just that - through the minerals resource rent tax, which will ensure that we can boost investment in infrastructure and keep feeding the boom. The minerals resource rent tax means we can provide small businesses, who work so hard for this nation, with a tax break. We believe that the mums and dads who operate those small businesses are entitled to a fair go and a little bit of tax relief - and we will provide it. And we will ensure too that Australians around the nation see for themselves the benefits of this boom. Many families are saying they understand that the circumstances and fundamentals of the Australian economy are strong but they want to know where their share is. We are determined to give them their share through increased family payments whilst we work with Australians on cost-of-living pressures through our new schoolkids bonus. Of course, we have been opposed every step of the way in trying to ensure that the minerals boom is fairly shared across this nation. But as a government we are determined that Australian families will feel the benefits of the mineral wealth within their grounds at this time in our nation's history.              </DOC>

  I say to the Leader of the Nationals: why should Australians pay a $1,300 impost per family because of the carbon pricing scheme of the Leader of the Opposition? Why should Australian families have their increased family payments ripped out of their hands and given to Liberal Party mates like Clive Palmer? Why should Australians see $70 billion slashed out of the health and education services that families rely on? Why should Australians see -                                                                     Ms GILLARD:                    I was really asked a very broadly phrased question, and I am explaining to the House. Why should Australians put up with $70 billion being taken out of health and education and payments to families? Why should Australians have to put up with tax being increased on Australian families by the shadow Treasurer, a plan he has so clearly revealed?                              The Leader of the Opposition comes into this place day after day with his scare campaign, but let me assure the House of this: there is one side of politics, one Prime Minister, that you can trust to run the economy in the interests of working people. There is one side of politics you can trust to always put the interests of a privileged few before the interests of the many. If you want a government that is going to put Gina's interests first then the Leader of the Opposition is your man. If you want a government that is going to work with Australian families to alleviate cost of living pressures through a schoolkids bonus, for example, that is opposed by the Leader of the Opposition. If you want someone who is going to vote against supporting jobs, standing by steelworkers and standing by car workers - then the Leader of the Opposition is your man.                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    Thank you very much, Madam Deputy Speaker. As I was saying, the government will always prioritise the jobs of Australian working people. We will always prioritise supporting Australian families. We will always prioritise building the economy we need for the future through clean energy, through sharing the proceeds of the mining boom and through investing in education and infrastructure, including the National Broadband Network. The Leader of the Opposition has made it abundantly clear to the Australian people that he will always put the interests of Liberal Party mates and a privileged few before the interests of working people. That is the contest in Australian politics, that is the divide in this parliament, and we are a government very proud to run the economy in the interests of working Australians.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for McEwen for that question, because just this morning we did receive a stunning endorsement of our economy's very strong economic fundamentals. We have had a report from the Bureau of Resources and Energy Economics that shows that the investment pipeline is simply skyrocketing. In the just six months to April 2012 the pipeline has grown by more than 10 per cent to reach a new record high. This means that Australia's pipeline of investment in resources is now worth half a trillion dollars, up from $456 billion just six months ago. And over half of that pipeline is at an advanced stage, providing a bedrock of support at a difficult time in the global economy. This is a resounding vote of confidence in the future of our economy and our region, and it simply torpedoes the claims by those opposite, who always try to talk down our economy.                              In our economy we have solid growth, low unemployment, contained inflation, low net debt and, of course, we have this huge resources investment pipeline that is worth half a trillion dollars. I think it is about time those opposite came out and welcomed these figures, instead of talking our economy down as they do day in, day out. As the Prime Minister said before, our economy does walk tall in the world, but we do understand that not everybody in our economy is in the fast lane of the resources boom, which is why the budget focused on spreading the opportunities of the boom right across our economy. In terms of the investment programs for small business - loss carryback, the instant asset write-off - all of this is part of spreading the benefits of the boom right around our economy and, in particular, to small businesses but also to households. We do need to spread the benefits of the boom to households right across our economy. Of course, there will be increased family payments to 1.5 million families and, as the Prime Minister said before, a new schoolkids bonus to help 1.3 million families with education costs. The Liberals over there are happy to give the planet's richest woman a tax cut, but we on this side of the House are absolutely intent on providing a schoolkids bonus and increases in family payments to people on low and middle incomes. They will not stump up for people with a disability or for families on low and middle incomes, but they are quite happy to give a very big tax cut to the world's richest woman. We on this side of the House will never, ever apologise for standing up for working families in this country.              </DOC>

  To the member for Sturt, I dealt with effectively an identical question yesterday. I do understand that the opposition do not want to ever come into this parliament and talk about jobs. They are not interested in jobs. They do not want to unveil their $70 billion of cutbacks in health and education. They do not want to talk about that. They of course do not want to talk about -                                                                     Ms GILLARD:                    I was merely pointing out that here we go again with the opposition in its spin and negativity. I refer the member for Sturt to the statement of the shadow Treasurer at the National Press Club on 16 May, where he indicated to the people there and to the Australian nation that the Liberal Party would very cheerfully accept the vote of the member for Dobell. So, enough of this hypocrisy.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for New England for his question, because the government's clean energy future plan - of course, developed in discussion with the member for New England - does provide local councils significant economic opportunities to reduce methane emissions from their landfill waste and to boost their revenue.                              Reducing methane emissions, which is a powerful greenhouse gas, from council landfills can be achieved by using existing and well-known technologies that have been in place for some time. Essentially, what is involved is the covering of the landfill and the capturing of the methane as the waste decomposes. The captured methane can be flared off or burnt off or used to generate electricity, which can be used to power council facilities and be sold into the electricity grid. So, the destruction of methane from existing waste from landfill facilities can also create revenue under the government's Carbon Farming Initiative. On top of that, if landfill operators use the methane to generate electricity they may be eligible for renewable energy certificates under the renewable energy target legislation.                              There are already 59 landfill gas generators registered and operating in Australia. In fact, one of them is within one of my own local government areas in Newcastle, at the Summerhill waste facility - and I am very familiar with it. Using opportunities of this nature might also have the effect of eliminating or significantly reducing any liability for landfills under the carbon price mechanism. The facts of the matter are that the majority of local council landfills in Australia will have no liability under the carbon price. It is only the larger landfills that will be obliged to pay the carbon price for their methane emissions and even then their emissions will not create any liability during the financial year 2012-13. By using the opportunities that I have been pointing to to capture methane, the liability in the future for those large landfills could be significantly offset. In fact, the government estimates that the Carbon Farming Initiative income will outweigh the carbon liability for those large landfills all the way through to 2020. So there are significant opportunities, and I noted yesterday that the Tamworth Regional Council indicated it intends taking them up in the member for New England's electorate. They will have good environmental outcomes and they represent important economic benefits that are potentially there for local governments as well.              </DOC>

  In this government we believe in the fair go all round at work. In this government we believe in the creation of wealth in Australia and the creation and improvement of national income. But we also on this side of the House in this government believe in the fair distribution of the national income.                              We are delivering the fair go all round. That is very clear. Here are five or six simple numbers: better productivity through the year, up to 1.8 per cent - up from the haunting legacy of the Howard government of 1.4 per cent; reasonable wage rises occurring for Australian workers; 87,000 new jobs created since January, despite the difficulties caused by the global financial crisis; superannuation - nine per cent to 12 per cent, opposed over there, supported here; and 8½ million Australians better off because of the people on this side. You do not have to take my word for these things. The ILO, the IMF and the OECD - the rollcall of serious global observers - say that this government gets the importance of the fair go all round.                              I am asked, 'Are there challenges?', and I hate to say that there are some storm clouds of challenges gathering on the horizon. There are some people in public life who want to cut take-home pay, who want to cut shift rates, who want to cut penalty rates, who want to cut redundancy rates, who want to undermine safety at work. What we need to do in order to see off these repugnant ideas crawling out from under the rock where they have been banished since 2007 is to be transparent.                              This government's transparency is here for all to see, and we stand by what we do for all to read - this is the bill we passed looking after coalminers; this is the bill we passed for better safety; this is the bill we passed for safe rates; this is what we have done for health and safety. We know where we stand. We are on the record. We have got our record, our views, out for all to see. Indeed, six months before the 2007 election, we had 50 pages of policy - nothing to hide, all upfront, all for debate.                              But those opposite think that politics is a game of hide and seek. They hide the policies and the public have got find them. The quiet achiever from Canning, though, yesterday belled the cat. He said, 'We've got an IR policy, but we don't want to be done like John Hewson was by Paul Keating, so we're not going to tell you.' Indeed, Christopher Pyne played Sergeant Schultz on the media today: 'It's not me; I'm not the IR guy. Oh, that's the policy committee. I'm not in that. I'm only in shadow cabinet; what would I know?' Let me tell you, a mouse pad is not a policy.               </DOC>

  I am happy to say to the member who asked the question that I very much enjoy question time because it reminds me every day of how truly pathetic the opposition is. Unfortunately, it is the opposition that is broadly opposed to question time, which is why they do their stupid motions every day. But in my own way I am grateful for that because it enables me to get 25 minutes more work done every day. So move your motion and I will go and get something important done for the nation.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Capricornia for her question. She represents workers in a lot of coalmines, as I do in my electorate and in my region. There is great cause for confidence in the coal industry because the coal industry is continuing to see very strong growth. In the figures referred to earlier by the Treasurer that have been released today by the Bureau of Resource and Energy Economics, actual and planned investment in the coal sector currently stands at $96 billion. This does not include over half a billion dollars currently committed for new exploration investment. That extraordinary investment pipeline will help keep not just coalmining but also a wider economy strong in coming years.                              It is good news for all Australians, except one - the Leader of the Opposition. It is bad news for the Leader of the Opposition because it exposes the deceit of his predictions of doom and gloom for the coal industry under the carbon pricing arrangements. In fact, on a visit to Peabody Energy's Metropolitan mine last June, he claimed the carbon price meant 'death to the coal industry'. The day after he visited another Peabody mine in Queensland, predicting the destruction of the industry, the company rather inconveniently announced at a $4.7 billion takeover of Macarthur Coal. Peabody's latest quarterly report is quite instructive on this. It shows an increase in Australian revenues of 48 per cent and an increase in profits of 11 per cent. That is the doom and gloom, that is the nature of the deceit that has been engaged in day after day in relation to the coal industry by the Leader of the Opposition.                              Like so many of the claims of the Leader of the Opposition on carbon pricing, as the facts come out in relation to his predictions of death for the coal industry, all will be revealed. The fact of the matter is: the coal industry is experiencing record growth and investment. That is why government has determined to spread the benefits of the boom through mechanisms like the minerals resource rent tax to people throughout the Australian community, not just to the Clive Palmers and Gina Rineharts of the world. We have introduced those measures through things like tax cuts for households, increases in family tax benefits, increases in the pension and other measures to assist households that were announced in the budget. Those are the facts. It is important for people to hear the facts and, as the facts come out, the Leader of the Opposition's fearmongering will be completely exposed for the deceit that it is.              </DOC>

  I say to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that, on matters to address problem gambling, the government is very serious about dealing with the destruction that problem gambling can bring to Australians and their families. Of course, the member for Denison has a very specific view about mandatory precommitment. That legislation was not going to succeed in this parliament because the opposition had said very clearly that they would not support it - because the opposition say no to absolutely everything. We would not at all be surprised that the opposition would choose to oppose a government measure. All they ever do is just say no.                              So, in the face of the opposition's obstruction, we have worked hard to put together legislation which we hope will get the support of this House. I do not know if the Leader of the Opposition has specifically stated where he stands on this legislation, but it will be the biggest package of reforms to address problem gambling ever considered by the national parliament. So the Deputy Leader of the Opposition may want to reflect on whether she wants to do anything about problem gambling or whether she wants to just keep saying no and playing politics. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition may also want to discuss with the Leader of the Opposition, given she is interested in these questions of trust, what he meant when he said in the 2004 election campaign about the Medicare safety net:                              That is an absolutely rock solid, ironclad commitment.                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    The Deputy Leader of the Opposition is interested in broken promises, so she may want to raise that with the Leader of the Opposition, trashed after the election. On problem gambling, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has a decision to make: does she care at all about problem gambling or not? I suspect, like the rest of the opposition, she will just say no.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Page for her question and for her ongoing commitment, like the member for Richmond and the member for Lyne, for ensuring that the Pacific Highway is fully duplicated. We allocated $3.56 billion in the recent budget which, if matched by New South Wales, would allow for the full duplication of the Pacific Highway by 2016. Now, you would think that that would be supported by all those who care about road safety and by all those who care about productivity. But I was surprised, when listening to Senate estimates yesterday, that Senator Barnaby Joyce said we were just pork-barrelling seats on the Pacific Highway. We know that the Greens have said that the only reason we are funding the Pacific Highway is because of donations from trucking companies. I expect them to oppose road funding but I do not expect it from local members and the National Party. I should add: 'if you look at what their record is.' The member for Dawson has said this: 'We're looking at the commitment of $3.6 billion put on the table for the Pacific Highway. You can only write it down to pork-barrelling and vote buying.'                              That is the attitude of the National Party towards works in the electorates of the member for Cowper and the member for Paterson and other people on the North Coast of New South Wales. Well, here are the facts. There are five projects underway on the Pacific Highway. The amount of $1.6 billion, or 92 per cent of the funding for projects, is in seats held by the coalition. Only three per cent is in the electorate of Lyne and four per cent in seats held by members of the Australian Labor Party. Of the work to be done, 48 per cent is in coalition-held seats, and these people have the hide to say that it is pork-barrelling. This is in the national interest. The coalition in New South Wales are baulking from their responsibility to front up money and the coalition are attacking the allocation of money for this project. It is little wonder, given they put in $1.3 billion over 12 years and we have already got over $4.1 billion allocated up to now. They have more interest in giving Gina Rinehart a tax cut than looking after the Pacific Highway.               </DOC>

  The answer to the member's question is very clear. The opposition has decided it wants to see more boats, and because the opposition has decided it wants to see more boats -                                                                     Ms GILLARD:                    Because in its negativity it is so opposed to the national interest, the opposition in this parliament under this Leader of the Opposition trashed the outlook of the former Howard government, trashed everything that was ever said or acted upon by the former Howard government in enabling governments to make appropriate decisions about offshore processing. The member who asked this question was part of leading the opposition to a position that meant it did everything it could to stop the government entering into an arrangement with Malaysia and putting it into operation. It decided that, instead of having the maximum deterrence for boats, it wanted to see more boats. Now, this reckless negativity has cost our nation. It has meant that people are embarking on dangerous journeys. It is against safety at sea. It has also meant that we have seen more boats.                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    The member is screaming and shouting but the one thing he will not do is come into this parliament and vote to enable the government to put into place the arrangement with Malaysia. He will not do that because he wants to see more boats. He loves it when he sees boats, because he will always put their political interests above the nation's interest. This is the reckless negativity of the opposition at every stage and in this area of policy above many others. Their trashing of the national interest is there for all to see.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Petrie for her question and for all the work she does, especially for families in her electorate in the Northern Suburbs of Brisbane, as this government goes about its work to build a clean energy future for our country.                              It is the big polluters that are going to be paying for the pollution they put into our community, and not Australian families. One of the very important things that has been happening over the last 10 days is that we have been delivering to families in advance of the carbon price starting. Families have been receiving up to $110 per child for families on family tax benefit part A and up to $69 per family for those on family tax benefit B.                                                                    Ms MACKLIN:                    I can inform the House that as of last night around 1.3 million Australian families have received their household assistance payments valued at $255.6 million. That is the money that families are getting in their pockets right now to make sure they get the extra assistance to help make ends meet.                              From 1 July this year we will also be providing families and other Australians with a tax cut. More than seven million Australians will receive more money in their take-home pay because of this tax cut. It will mean that around a million of them will not even have to fill out a tax return anymore. For a family with two primary-school-aged children and an income of $80,000, this means they will get more than $1,000 in tax cuts and payment increases. That is the reality of what this side of the parliament is delivering to Australian families.                              We know what the big danger is for families. We know that this Leader of the Opposition wants to claw this money back from families, take it out of their purses and wallets -                                                                     Ms MACKLIN:                    That is exactly what this Leader of the Opposition intends to do: get rid of the tax cut, claw back the family payments and, of course, just say no to the schoolkids bonus.              </DOC>

  To the member's question: really, one wonders about the levels of delusion on display over there. Let us just go through some of the facts. The opposition has moved 57 censures or suspensions. That means they have lost the opportunity to ask 359 questions. That means they have lost, in total, 31 hours and two minutes of question time. That means they have lost, in total, the equivalent of 14 question times.                              What the opposition shows in this parliament every day is that it does not want to debate the real issues facing the Australian people; it wants to engage in negativity and spin. So it comes in with these kinds of questions which we have heard today - nothing serious ever about the economy, nothing serious about the budget, nothing on the future of health, nothing on the future of education, nothing on building the future economy, nothing on our relationships with our region, nothing on the defence or national security of the nation - nothing of meaning. The opposition comes in with its cheap politics and then it follows up its pathetic attempts in question time with the Leader of the Opposition or, increasingly, the Manager of Opposition Business, just carrying on with their cheap politics for 25 minutes.                              If the member over there thinks that is accountability, or the appropriate way for a member of parliament to conduct themselves, then he is seriously out of touch. Can I suggest he gets himself in touch by standing at a school gate in front of a school in his electorate, looking every working mum and every working dad in the eye and saying, 'I don't believe you should get the schoolkids bonus.'                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    I was asked a very broadly phrased question, so I am saying on accountability: why doesn't the member for Menzies - or indeed, the Leader of the Opposition - stand at a school gate and tell every working mum and dad he does not want them to have the schoolkids bonus? Why doesn't he go to a car factory and say, 'I do not support money to support your jobs'? Why doesn't he go to a steel mill and in front of those steelworkers say, 'I did not support money to support your jobs'? Why doesn't he walk to a hospital and say, 'I took $1 billion out of you last time and now I've got $70 billion worth of cuts to make'? Why doesn't he go and talk to school teachers about the planned cuts that he has for education?                              When it comes to accountability I am certainly there for real accountability. It is the opposition that does not want to be held accountable for its reckless negativity.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Corangamite for his question and his interest in more than 15,000 small businesses in his electorate. The budget announced by the Treasurer delivers for small business in this country. The budget, firstly, returns us to surplus. That is important. The budget, secondly, spreads the benefits of the mining boom. That is also a very important factor in providing support for small business. Indeed, there are specific measures to ensure that small businesses, incorporated or otherwise, are in a position to have an environment in which they can thrive.                              The budget surplus is very important because it gives the Reserve Bank the opportunity, if it so chooses, to lower the official cash rates. Recently we saw a 50-basis point reduction of the official cash rate. That effectively means we now have an official cash rate that is lower than at any time during the Howard years. That provides opportunities for small business to access credit and provides confidence that that can happen more effectively for those businesses in need of credit. The budget surplus also provides a buffer for our economy against any possible future international economic shock. Again, this is a very important thing and it was remarked upon by the OECD this week as being a very effective way of protecting ourselves against any future shock.                              This budget also provides some very specific initiatives to help the more than 2½ million small businesses in this country that employ almost five million Australians. We have the loss carryback initiative which provides direct benefits for up to 110,000 companies. That will allow them to invest and innovate. It also provides confidence for those businesses who may not be directly benefiting but know that if they end up in a loss position for the financial year they will be able to claim the refund of taxes paid previously. The instant asset tax write-off is a very good initiative for cash flow. It allows for the purchasing of each and every asset up to $6,500. This has also been well received by COSBOA and others in the small business community and provides great opportunities for small businesses.                              The Leader of the Opposition is on the record opposing a company tax cut entirely and also opposing the tax cut for businesses that we were proposing to introduce. This is a shameful thing for a Liberal leader who pretends to support small business. What is even worse is that this Leader of the Opposition wants to take the tax relief for small business in the budget and give it back to Clive Palmer, give it back to Gina Rinehart. The Leader of the Opposition has no regard for small business in this country.               </DOC>

  Once again we see another disgraceful attempt by the Leader of the Opposition to rejoice in job losses and to try and join those job losses to his fear campaign about a price on carbon - a disgraceful attempt to try to make working people and their futures and their families grist to his political mill. The truth about this situation is as follows. I start by saying that of course I am very concerned whenever I hear about a job loss. I am always very concerned for the working person involved and for their family, which is why as a government we made sure during the global financial crisis that we supported jobs - we understood their importance to working people. With this group - the Hastie Group - which has entered voluntary administration, it is a complex situation.                              The government is working closely with the insolvency practitioners involved to ensure timely assistance to the employees as the situation evolves. I note that the administrators are working with project managers to see if blue-collar employees can be transferred or made available to head contractors to complete projects currently underway. But all workers who are made redundant will be entitled to tailored support from Job Services Australia and we will ensure full provision of government support, including access to the General Employee Entitlements and Redundancy Scheme for eligible employees in the appropriate circumstances. As the Leader of the Opposition well knows, the explanation for this circumstance is not carbon pricing, and he should not be trying to pretend to these working people - or, indeed, to any other Australian - that it is.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for his question, and I certainly thank him for all the work he does out in his community addressing local issues. I have had the opportunity to visit with him in his electorate, where people are still engaged in flood recovery, and I want to thank him for his ongoing advocacy for his local community.                              From today, over 3.2 million pensioners will receive more money into their bank accounts to help them make ends meet - 3.2 million pensioners who will see more money in their bank accounts from today. Across Australia, over $700 million in household assistance will be going out to pensioners before carbon pricing starts on 1 July. Full and part pensioners will receive upfront household assistance payments of $250 for singles and $380 for couples, and from March next year pensioners will receive ongoing assistance that keeps up with the cost of living. Across these pensioner households we have taken care to ensure that pensioners receive compensation so that they come out, many of them, in front - because we know that pensioner budgets are tight. For pensioners, 93 per cent of households will be at least 20 per cent better off as a result of these payments.                              This is part of a set of arrangements to benefit families around the country. On average, $9.90 in additional price impacts will be experienced, but that will be matched by $10.10 in assistance, with six out of 10 households fully assisted with the cost-of-living impacts and nine out of 10 receiving payments in some form. This is all part of ensuring that a major reform like seizing a clean energy future is done in a Labor way. At the same time we will also be assisting people with their other cost-of-living pressures, including through the schoolkids bonus, which will provide cost-of-living relief for 1.3 million families.                              I am proud that on this side of the parliament, understanding the needs of families around the country and the needs of pensioners, we are providing direct assistance and that 3.2 million pensioners will see it in their bank accounts from today.              </DOC>

  I am surprised to get a dorothy dix from my friend the member for Brisbane, but I do thank her for it. This project is vital for Australia's future, and this agreement is vital for delivering it. The money needed to be raised for this project is $9.5 billion. That needs to be raised on international markets, and that makes this the biggest single debt-raising to occur on the planet this year. To get that finance, Roy Hill needs to reassure its investors that it is able to complete the project on time and on budget. Because the very significant expansion in the resources sector in Australia as we speak is so big - which goes to show the myths that are peddled by the Leader of the Opposition about the resource sector and the impact of the carbon price and the minerals resource rent tax - Skills Australia estimates that an additional 89,000 workers will be required in the mining sector by 2016 compared to November 2010.                              It is important that this agreement delivers on those jobs. There have been a lot of myths perpetrated over the last few days. Let us be very clear about this: 6,700 jobs are being delivered to Australians because of the actions of this government, because this government has entered into this agreement. That is something I am justly proud of.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Throsby very much for his question, because of the hard work he does representing pensioners in the Illawarra. Like him we believe that after a lifetime of work pensioners deserve to get that extra support to make sure that they can make ends meet. That is why this government, this side of the parliament, delivered the biggest increase to the pension in 100 years, opposed by those opposite and by the cabinet that Leader of the Opposition was a member of. This government actually delivered that very significant increase to the pension which, since 2009, has meant that pensioners are getting around $150 extra a fortnight - a very, very significant achievement by this government.                              We also want to make sure that it is the big polluters that pay for their pollution, not pensioners. That is why, starting from today, pensioners are receiving extra money paid straight into their bank account. It will come over the next fortnight, generally on the pension day that people have. It will mean that single pensioners will be receiving an extra $250 and couple pensioners $380 per couple combined. From March next year this will become a permanent payment, delivered either fortnightly or quarterly as part of pensioners' usual payments.                              As the Prime Minister indicated, this is a benefit that is going to 3.2 million pensioners. We know that this government wants to make sure that pensioners are helped. It is this Leader of the Opposition that is going to claw that money back, and all it is for those opposite is a big joke. You think taking money off pensioners to fill your $70 billion black hole is a big joke. Pensioners know that you are clawing it off them and you are going to do it as fast as you can.              </DOC>

  I thank the honourable member for Melbourne for his question. In answer to his question, his constituents - and every other resident of Australia - are at the front of the queue for the jobs at the Roy Hill project. This $9.5 billion project will require over 8,000 workers in the construction phase over the next three years. As part of the agreement struck by the government they must employ at least 6,700 Australians in those positions. The agreement enables them to employ up to 1,715 457 visa holders if they are unable to source those workers in Australia. My department will audit Roy Hill every six months to ensure they are complying with the agreement - including ensuring they make every effort to recruit Australian workers. I understand Roy Hill is about to begin a very comprehensive and substantial recruitment program in Australia and all Australians will be able to apply for one of the 6,700 jobs that this government has ensured will be delivered.                              Another myth which is the subject of the honourable member's question is training requirements. As a result of this government's assistance, under the Roy Hill agreement, Roy Hill must create 2,000 training places for Australians, including 230 apprenticeships with a special emphasis on mature age Australians just like the ones the honourable member refers to. As I said before, perhaps most importantly of all this agreement was necessary to ensure these jobs were created in the first place. This EMA delivers on what EMAs were meant to deliver when the National Resources Sector Employment Taskforce recommended them in 2010 and when the budget announced them in 2011. Without the assurance of the enterprise migration agreement there was a very real risk that this project would not proceed at all. The confirmation of the project is very good news indeed for Australian workers. The sheer size of the expansion in projects means that there will be workforce shortages over coming years and these agreements are a key way the government ensure that the projects are delivered. They will be delivering export earnings for Australian workers for many years to come and jobs for any Australian who wants to work in the resources sector.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Petrie for that question because we on this side of the House have a proven track record in delivering support to people on low and middle incomes to make ends meet. As the Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs said before, we delivered the single biggest increase in our age pension in 100 years. It is something that everybody on this side of the House is very proud of. On top of that we delivered a fair go budget, which is spreading the opportunities of the resources boom right around our country with the schoolkids bonus and increases in family payments. We are now delivering assistance particularly to pensioners with the clean energy package. As the Prime Minister said, we are delivering $250 for single pensioners and $380 for couples. That is something like $700 million which will go to more than three million pensioners in our community. On top of that, there is also additional assistance to students and job seekers that will come through in coming weeks.                              In all we are putting something like $1.5 billion into the pockets of pensioners and those who are receiving clean energy assistance - and that is just the beginning. From 1 July we are tripling the tax-free threshold. This will provide tax cuts for something like seven million low- and middle-income earners in our community. Some of the oldest in our community will be the biggest winners. If you take a self-funded retiree couple with $35,000 each in private income, they will receive a tax cut of $1,500. What we are doing here is ensuring tax justice for some of those people on the lowest incomes in our community.                              It is completely beyond me why the shadow Treasurer said a week or so ago that they are going to claw all those tax cuts back from something like seven million low- and middle-income earners in our community. That will be ripping $3 billion off low- and middle-income earners in our community - ripping it off the six million people out there who will get assistance that exceeds the costs that flow through from the clean energy package. Those opposite come in here day after day and claim they are concerned with the cost of living. They have policies where they are going to claw that assistance back. Indeed, the opposition leader here will claw that assistance back from the 11, 000 pensioners in his own electorate.              </DOC>

  I thank the shadow minister for the question and in doing so indicate that we made it very clear in the budget of last year that we are open to doing these agreements on a variety of projects if they meet the conditions that we deem appropriate. This is the first of potentially a range of agreements, but people should remember first and foremost this is about creating jobs for Australians. That was our top priority during the global financial crisis and it is our top priority as we go forward as a nation. This is 6,700 new jobs. But also understand that this project is not currently committed. Last week we reported to the House that there were $260 billion in committed capital investment in Australia at the moment. Delivery of this project will take us to $270 billion. My problem as the minister is that in all of the discussions I have with the companies we either make sure that we can source labour or we lose these projects, we lose investment and we lose job opportunities for Australians.                              People should remember that this is not just about jobs in construction; this is about almost 2,000, high-skilled, well-paid jobs in production. Our agreement is that only Australians will be employed during production. The training agreement entered into by the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship demands that during the period of construction Australians will be trained to have jobs during production - 2,000 of them: apprenticeships and traineeships and, perhaps more importantly to me, as someone who cares about employing Indigenous Australians, 100 guaranteed opportunities to employ Indigenous Australians.                              The agreement speaks for itself. It is in our national interest but, as usual, the coalition cannot see the wood from the trees when it comes to the national interest.              </DOC>

 I thank the member for Werriwa for his question. The carbon price will only have a modest impact on the cost of living - an increase in the consumer price index, in fact, of 0.7 per cent. Key aspects of this forecast are now being confirmed by determinations that are coming from various of the state jurisdiction pricing regulators.                               To help households the government is providing tax cuts, we are increasing pensions and we are increasing family tax benefits and a host of other Commonwealth payments. A fortnight ago, of course, we started making lump-sum payments to families in relation to family tax benefit increases. From today, as we have heard, cash payments will start flowing to pensioners. Single pensioners will receive $250 and couple pensioners will receive $380. This is going to be very helpful to pensioners all around Australia, in all of our electorates - those that we represent in this House. For example, in the electorate of Paterson, over 29,000 pensioners will receive assistance and yet the member for Paterson opposes it.                              Pensioners around the country, in fact, have been repeatedly misled by members of the coalition, by the Leader of the Opposition, about the carbon price. The Leader of the Opposition has in fact claimed the cost of living impact of the carbon price will be 'unimaginable'. The member for Paterson, who I referred to a moment ago, has said that the carbon price would 'start an avalanche of inflation and a massive price hike'. All of this is completely deceitful.                               Just last week the member for Paterson also wrongly blamed the carbon price for job losses at the Norsk Hydro aluminium smelter, whereas Norsk Hydro Vice President Halvor Molland made it absolutely clear:                              The decision would have been the same with or without the carbon tax.                              Those are the facts. The price impact is only 0.7 per cent. The government is using that carbon price revenue to provide tax cuts, pension increases, increases in family allowances for families who receive family tax benefits and we are increasing many other payments - an average of $10.10 per week for households across this country, with a modest price impact. In fact, when taken in combination with other measures announced in the budget, some families with an income in the order of $60,000 or $80,000 a year could well receive over $2,000 extra in the next financial year.               </DOC>

  I thank the member for Farrer for her question. The Gillard government is very committed to the creation of jobs in Australia.                                                                    Mr SHORTEN:                    There we go again! Whenever we talk about creating jobs those opposite just start barking! The Roy Hill project will create Australian jobs. This is a government committed to the creation of Australian jobs. That is why I have been pleased to work with the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship on the Roy Hill project. There will be over 6½ thousand Australian jobs created for Australians in the construction phase and 2,000 jobs in the production phase. This is good news, but those opposite are always trying to find the wedges and the bad news in the good news.                              What I am also pleased to be able to answer in terms of the member for Farrer's question is that we will have the jobs board to ensure that Australians who are out of work will be able to put their names forward, and Australian mining companies will find it easier to employ Australians. Furthermore, we are very keen in terms of a commitment to training and skilling of apprentices and Indigenous Australians. What is wrong - too much good news?                                                                    Mr SHORTEN:                    Certainly it has been an opportunity for the government to work on creating the EMA. Let us be very clear for the Manager of Opposition Business in this House: this government stands for Australians to get jobs in Australia but we also stand to exploit the mining boom and, where it is necessary, if Australians have the opportunity to get the jobs, once that has been satisfied, we welcome the opportunity to develop the minerals resources of this country in the long-term interests of Australian children and their grandchildren.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Wakefield for the question. This morning the Murray-Darling Basin Authority released the revised draft plan. We went through a series of iterations of this document, and this is the latest one. It has a number of improvements, but I still believe it falls short of the ambition that the government has for Murray-Darling reform.                              There are some significant improvements in this from the previous iteration of the document - in particular, on groundwater. Many members in this House - the member for New England included, but a number of members from both sides - had mentioned their concerns about the significant increase in groundwater extraction that appeared in the draft plan. None of us want to see a situation where you go to so much effort in improving surface water only to see it undone by overextraction of groundwater. Given the limited knowledge of the science of groundwater, I think there is an argument to make sure that we have a very precautionary approach to this matter. I raised this view at a number of the public meetings around the Basin. It is one of the few issues where you have irrigation communities and conservation groups arguing the same thing.                              The authority certainly have made significant adjustments back in a much more cautious approach to groundwater, and I commend them for doing that. But there are still limits to the ambition of the reform, and in their covering letter in presenting it to me they have flagged a couple of issues which will now go to the ministerial council for us to work out how much further the reform can be taken. One issue they have raised - something that has been consistently put forward by the Victorian government, in particular - is about wanting to see just how far we can press the issues of the river rules, environmental works and measures and infrastructure measures to see how far we can go in using non buyback methods to bridge the gap.                              There have been demands, in particular from the South Australian government, about wanting to see how much further we might be able to go with achieving environmental outcomes. Many of the environmental outcomes are well met by the document in front of us. When you go through the accompanying documentation, you see that the Coorong, the Lower Lakes, Hatter Lakes and a series of places have been well catered for. There is a number, like Chowler, that still fall well below, and the authority has provided a pathway by way of a request for government to consider further infrastructure investment to be able to take that to levels that begin with the number 3,000 while, by doing it through infrastructure, not having the knock-on impact to communities.                              So we know what the authority thinks and we know the government's intention as to where we would like to take the reform. But it must be something that can survive this parliament, and to date I still do not know what the opposition believe. Barnaby Joyce stood up at a media conference and said, 'I'll tell you what we believe: we disagree with what the Greens are saying,' and nothing more. We need something that can survive the parliament. We cannot be yet another generation that falls short on Murray-Darling reform.               </DOC>

  I do thank the shadow Treasurer for that question, because the very purpose of this government is to create wealth and to spread opportunity, to make sure that our economy grows and to make sure that the benefits of that growth are spread evenly across our country. That theme goes to the very core of our recent budgets - indeed, to all of our budgets. Of course, there is nothing we are more proud of than the something like 800,000 jobs that have been created in this country with an unemployment rate of 4.9 per cent. We are very proud of that. We are also very proud of the fact that we have a very big resources pipeline - a big investment pipeline of over half a trillion dollars.                              We on this side of the House are absolutely determined that all Australians who are looking for work get a chance to get a job on those projects. That is what we are about. That is why put in place the resources task force, which recommended enterprise migration agreements, and, of course, we will work with investors -                                                                     Mr SWAN:                    My essay was about how some vested interests have a disproportionate say in our economy and in our society and seek to exercise disproportionate influence. In this case, we have an investor that is going to invest in a project which is going to create Australian jobs. We will work with any investors to create Australian jobs. That is what we have been doing. You would not have an investment pipeline of over half a trillion dollars if we did not work with the business community and the mining community to create opportunities for Australia, and I would never discriminate against any individual who was prepared to put cash on the line to invest in jobs in this country. There is a very important point that needs to be made, and everybody should listen and take this very seriously. We need to take the bounty of this boom and spread it among all Australians; but when vested interests like Gina Rinehart get up and oppose the MRRT, we will bell the cat about what they are really saying. What they are saying, when they are opposing the MRRT, is that all Australians should not get a fair share of the mining boom. We could have a disagreement with her about that and still put in place a set of policies which grow our economy and spread jobs to every corner of our society.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for La Trobe for her question. In part because of the resources boom, Australia's shipping task is now the fourth largest in the world. But, at the same time as it has been growing, the number of Australian ships operating has been in drastic decline - from 55 in 1996 to 21 today, with just four operating internationally. We are a country where 99.9 per cent of our exports are moved by ships, and there will soon be no Australian shipping fleet to revitalise. We need to act now or we will simply not have an industry at all, and an Aussie flag on the back of an Aussie ship will be consigned to history. Our reforms are designed to encourage investment in Australian shipping - not through protection but by ensuring that Australian ships operate competitively with their international competitors through zero tax for Australian shipping companies and zero tax for Australian seafarers. Those opposite have never seen a tax reduction that they could support.                               This is sensible policy to level the playing field with our international competitors. That is why it has been welcomed by the shipping industry, and that is why it has been welcomed by many users of ships. These reforms are entirely consistent with the unanimous recommendations of the House of Representatives inquiry of which the member for Hinkler was the deputy chair.                              Those opposite should get on board for this important reform. We have had a parliamentary inquiry which was established in 2007 and which reported in 2008. In 2009 I convened the Shipping Policy Advisory Group, which contained groups such as BHP Billiton, Rio Tinto and the Australian Shipping Association. In 2010 we fulfilled our election commitment by delivering a discussion paper. In 2011 there were three industry groups, including the tax group chaired by Treasury. There were industry representatives on each of the three groups, which dealt with taxation, regulatory reform and workforce development issues. We had exposure drafts of the legislation, yet those opposite say 'no, no, no' to this reform. They want another inquiry. The walking vuvuzela is back again. Aussie seafarers on Aussie ships with an Aussie flag on the back, carrying Aussie goods around the Aussie coast and internationally - how hard is it to say yes to this reform?               </DOC>

  I was fully briefed about the Roy Hill enterprise migration agreement having returned from Chicago last Wednesday. I say to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition: yes, my statement in the parliament is right, because that statement is about the minerals resource rent tax. Let us be very clear: when it comes to the minerals resource rent tax, we have picked the side of Australian families and increasing their family payments, and the Leader of the Opposition has picked the side of the billionaires.                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    I am directly answering the deputy leader's question.                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    The deputy leader's question went directly to a statement in parliament about Gina Rinehart's interests being served by the Leader of the Opposition. Yes, he is Gina Rinehart's butler because he is a man in this parliament who says to Australian families, 'Give up your family payments because I want to give them back to Gina Rinehart.' The Leader of the Opposition, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and all of those on the opposition benches seem unable to make what is a very clear distinction.                              I am happy when major mining companies create Australian jobs and prosperity.                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    That is a good thing, and that will only ever get a tick from me. That is a good thing. I simply believe that, at the same time as those mining companies are creating those jobs and prosperity, they should pay their fair share of tax. I know that that is an offensive proposition to the Leader of the Opposition. He thinks that Australian families should give up increased family payments. He believes that working people should give up superannuation. He believes that mining companies should give up infrastructure so that those mining magnates can pay less tax. That is the political divide in this parliament - whether you believe in opportunity for all coming out of the resources boom or whether you believe in serving the -                               When a Minister is occasionally unable to provide an immediate substantive answer, he or she may either undertake to supply -                               it or sit down.                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    Thank you, and I was addressing that section of the question that related to my statement in parliament last Thursday about which I was very directly asked, Madam Deputy Speaker. And so, having made very clear that the Leader of the Opposition is in here to serve the interests of a privileged few, let me also say this: we will always put Australian jobs first.                                                                  The member for Solomon                   then left the chamber.                                                                                                      Ms GILLARD:                    On arrangements with Roy Hill, and arrangements in mining generally, we will always put Australian jobs first. The Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and the Minister for Resources and Energy have worked on this agreement to secure Australian jobs and of course I support that securing of Australian jobs. I know the Leader of the Opposition is always opposed to Australian jobs.               </DOC>

  Thank you to the member for Page for her question. This government has brought down a responsible budget that will get Australia back to surplus. We have a strong economy. It is an economy that is expected to grow faster than all other advanced economies over the coming years. We have low unemployment, we have contained inflation, we have low net debt and we have a record pipeline of investment coming into this economy. In these circumstances, now is the time for us to be returning the budget to surplus and that is what this government is doing.                              We are a Labor government, and as a Labor government we are determined to make sure that we spread the benefit of the boom and that we ensure that all Australians get some benefit out of the growth that our economy is experiencing. That is why we are determined to provide assistance to pensioners and to families. That is why I am happy to report to the member for Page that some 31,500 pensioners in her electorate will benefit from the upfront household assistance payments of $250 for individuals and $380 for couples combined. Those 31,500 pensioners in the electorate of Page will be receiving this assistance straight into their bank accounts. With that many pensioners in her electorate, it is no wonder that the member for Page is very passionate about support and assistance for pensioners.                               I note that in the neighbouring electorate on the mid-North Coast of Cowper, there are even more pensioners - 33,100 of them. With that many pensioners in his electorate, I would have thought that the member for Cowper should not come into this place and vote against assistance for those individuals. I hope the member for Cowper writes to every one of those 33,100 pensioners in his electorate to explain why he wants to rip that assistance away. That is what he will do if they get elected.                              We have delivered this assistance and that comes on the back of an historic increase in the pension. The increase that a single aged pensioner is receiving under this government since 2009 is more than $4,000 a year. In contrast, those opposite want to come into this place and pretend that they care for pensioners and for Australian families. The Leader of the Opposition comes in and says he cares about pensioners, but he votes no to pension increases. He says that he cares about families, but he votes no to increases in family payments. He says that he cares about small businesses, but he votes no when it comes to tax relief. We all know that those opposite have got a $70 billion black hole. The only way they are going to fill it is by burning a hole in the pockets of pensioners and working Australians.               </DOC>

  On Friday last week I did meet with some union officials and talked about the Roy Hill enterprise migration agreement and talked about circumstances involving Australian jobs. I also on Friday last week met with the Minister for Immigration and the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, and we discussed the jobs board and its interconnection with enterprise migration agreements - that is, making sure that Australians who are on the jobs board can have the opportunity to be considered first for the many jobs that will flow from the huge mining boom that our country is experiencing - and we discussed additional monitoring and oversight of enterprise migration agreements.                              On my briefing about -                                                                     Ms GILLARD:                    I have answered both of those questions in the House today, and no amount of screaming by the opposition changes those facts. The facts I have explained to the House today are the facts I have explained to everyone: I was briefed on my return from Chicago. Of course I support the creation of Australian jobs. I want to see more than 6,000 jobs created for Australians at Roy Hill, and we will always support arrangements to put Australian jobs first. We know we will always face the relentless negativity of the opposition when we do so because the Leader of the Opposition has never in this parliament stood up for Australian jobs - not during the global financial crisis, not for steelmakers, not for auto workers - and he never will.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Fraser for his question. The member for Fraser knows well this government's strong record when it comes to jobs and increasing workforce participation. But what he and we on this side of the House also know is that we also need to make sure that no-one is left behind, that all people across our community are sharing in the prosperity of our strong economy.                              I know that many members in this place hear in their local community, like I do, from mature-age Australians who feel they are not being given their fair go when it comes to applying for jobs and getting involved in our labour market. In fact, the evidence shows that, while unemployment rates are generally lower for mature-age Australians, when they do happen to find themselves out of work they tend to take almost twice as long as the rest of the community to get back into the workforce. Despite lower rates of absenteeism, high retention rates and the benefit of decades of experience in the labour market, too many mature-age Australians are feeling like they are being shut out of the workforce.                              In this year's budget our government reaffirmed our commitment to mature-age Australians and the valuable role they play in our economy and in our workplaces. That is why we will be offering a new jobs bonus of $1,000 to employers who take on a worker aged 50 and over. We know that subsidies and incentives work. Last year we introduced wage subsidies to encourage employers to take on job seekers who had been unemployed for two years or longer. We have already seen over 6,000 of these workers re-enter the workforce, some of them for the first time in over a decade.                              This jobs bonus is about giving mature age job seekers that first foot in the door. But it is not the only initiative our government is introducing in this area. We have also announced a significant expansion of the Corporate Champions program. This is where our government works hand in hand with the Australian Industry Group  and ACCI to change the culture of our workplaces and ensure that we value mature-age workers. We have also announced an expanded career advice line, staffed by recruitment professionals, for mature-age job seekers and, importantly, we have announced additional funding for the Age Discrimination Commissioner, ensuring that we can crack down on discrimination where it takes place in our community.                              Our government is putting in place the necessary supports to make sure those who wish to continue working can do so. We are putting in place the supports to ensure that people get a fair go in our workplaces, including mature-age Australians. This is good news for our community and it is also good news for our strong economy and our workforce.              </DOC>

  The Leader of the Opposition is growing strangely obsessed and unable to listen to my words - I am not quite sure why. The Leader of the Opposition, of course, is always opposed to jobs, so when someone talks about Australian jobs first he obviously gets confused. He did not want me to mention Australian jobs first, because they are offensive to him. He did not want me to mention the training of Australians first, because that is obviously offensive to him.                              The Roy Hill agreement includes Australian jobs, Indigenous training -                                                                     Ms GILLARD:                    The member for Menzies says, 'We know all that.' He dismisses out of hand more than 6,000 jobs for Australians. That is completely irrelevant to him. He could not care less about employing 6,000 Australians. He could not care less about the training outcomes for 2,000 Australians. He could not care less about the 200 apprentices and trainees. He could not care less about the 100 Indigenous Australians being prepared for work in the construction industry. The member for Menzies might think these are incidental details and not interesting. These are real people's lives, getting an opportunity from the resources boom. The Roy Hill agreement has in it all of these outcomes, as well as the agreement that there will be up to 1,715 foreign workers for the construction phase. So, of course, in total the Roy Hill agreement is about jobs, is about training, is about Indigenous Australians, is about this agreement for up to 1,715 foreign workers and it has my support.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Kingston for her question because there was a very exciting scientific decision taken last week on Friday by the Square Kilometre Array Organisation. Australia and New Zealand had been competing with South Africa for the right to host and construct the Square Kilometre Array project. In a Solomon-like stroke of wisdom, the Square Kilometre Array Organisation decided to share the project development between sites in Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. It is a great result for Australian science. It confirms our expertise in radioastronomy and places our scientists at the forefront of global astronomy and will do so for many years to come.                              The Square Kilometre Array is a $1.9 billion project. It is a radiotelescope and one of the largest scientific projects of the 21st century. It will collect vast quantities of data that will be available for the consideration of astronomers all around the world. In the first phase of the project, Australia will build on its substantial investment already at the CSIRO's Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder - ASKAP - telescope which is in the Murchison region of Western Australia. The two governments of the Commonwealth and Western Australia have worked together and have jointly invested to date more than $400 million in research infrastructure for the 36-dish ASKAP and the Murchison radio astronomy observatory. In phase 1 of the Square Kilometre Array project we will build on that investment, installing more than 60 dishes to detect mid-frequency radio waves. We will also build an array of antennas designed to detect low-frequency radio waves.                              The SKA is more than just an astronomy project. It will create hundreds of jobs in engineering and construction and put Australia at the forefront of the information technology industry as well because the supercomputers that will be needed to process the extraordinary volume of data from this project will be leading technologies. They will be available to and engaged with Australian scientists for many years to come. Many industrial innovations will also inevitably be generated by this project. It is a great win for Australian science and a great win for Australian innovation and a credit to both Senators Carr and Evans, who have worked on this project for some time.              </DOC>

  I am advised by the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport that Rex is in fact expanding its operations and number of flights. Once again we have the Leader of the Opposition in this place seeking -                                                                     Ms GILLARD:                    If I can finish my sentence, Madam Deputy Speaker, once again we have got the opposition in this place trying to mislead about the impact of carbon pricing. They are trying to create a fear in the Australian community about the impact of carbon pricing on regional airlines. As I have just indicated, the minister for transport has advised me that Rex is expanding.                              On the impact on Brindabella and on air travel generally, as we have canvassed -                                                                     Ms GILLARD:                    On regional airlines, Brindabella - the question that the Leader of the Opposition asked - we have in the past canvassed in this parliament the modest impact of carbon pricing on air travel. We have also in this parliament discussed how this impact -                                                                     Ms GILLARD:                    No. 1, I remind the Leader of the Opposition that carbon pricing does not start till 1 July. No. 2, I remind the Leader of the Opposition that the impact on air travel is in the order of a few dollars per flight. No. 3, I remind the Leader of the Opposition that that impact has been modelled into the assistance that families and households are receiving. I remind the Leader of the Opposition that 3.2 million pensioners are, as we speak, receiving the first round of additional assistance in their bank accounts, which will be followed up next March and be ongoing; that 1.5 million families around the country are receiving assistance into their bank accounts as well. I remind the Leader of the Opposition that he is a man who has made many false claims about carbon pricing, all of which will be shown to be untrue on 1 July. He said prices rises will be unimaginable; he will be shown to be wrong. He said power bills will jump by 30 per cent; he will be shown to be wrong. He said the coal industry will shut down; he will be shown to be wrong. He said entire towns like Whyalla will be wiped off the map. So, when the sun sets on 1 July and none of those things has come to pass, then this destructive negativity from the Leader of the Opposition will be revealed to the Australian people for what it has always been - him trying to run a political fear campaign and prepared to engage in any level of distortion to do so.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for her question; I know of her deep concern for families in her electorate who are under cost-of-living pressures. I know too that she is working to get information out to members in her community about what assistance is available for people. As of yesterday, 3.2 million pensioners commenced to receive money into their bank accounts - single pensioners $250, pensioner couples $380. More assistance will be received from next March and that assistance will be received fortnightly and be ongoing. Families will also see increases in family payments flowing through to bank accounts.                              On 1 July Australians will see a tax cut. Australians will see the benefit of a tax reduction for people earning less than $80,000 a year. They will see the tripling of the tax-free threshold. That means half a million Australians will move from paying tax to paying no tax. A million Australians will no longer be required to fill in a tax return at the end of the tax year. This assistance is being made available to families and we know on average that the price impacts flowing through to families are $9.90 per week, whereas on average the assistance is $10.10 a week.                              These are the facts. These are the facts that the Leader of the Opposition does not want Australians to know. These are the facts that counter his scare campaign. He has claimed that price rises will be astronomical, that power bills will go up by 30 per cent, that major industries like coal and steel and cement will shut down, that towns like Whyalla will be wiped off the map. These false claims have been repeated time after time after time by the Leader of the Opposition. On 1 July and in the days following, these false claims, this destructive negativity, will be shown for what it is: part of a fear campaign aimed at Australians, part of the Leader of the Opposition's destructive and negative campaign. These claims will be shown to be demonstrably false; they have always been untrue. The first of July is coming and people will be able to judge for themselves.              </DOC>

  To the shadow Treasurer's question let me first say this: you never accept a purported fact from the opposition when it is brought into this parliament during question time, because you always find out on analysis that what is being said is not right - part of a fear campaign. For example, I have just been given the media release of Aeropelican and Brindabella Airlines, who talk about -                                                                     Ms GILLARD:                    Yes, I will, Deputy Speaker. I know, of course, that you cannot in front of this opposition bring a fact into the building - they get hysterical. So we will deal with their misleading about Brindabella Airlines at the end of question time. But I do draw people's attention to the press release.                              On the question that I have been asked - which, when we look into it, I am sure will turn out to be equally misleading, because that is what the opposition does on carbon pricing - as the shadow Treasurer would be aware, we have spoken to the Australian people about local government and carbon pricing: about the very, very modest impact and about how the impact on rates has been modelled into the anticipated price rises of 0.7 per cent. That is less than a dollar in a $100.                               Of course, what the shadow Treasurer does not want to tell Australians is that the assistance that is being made available - the payments for 3.2 million pensioners, the family payment increases for 1.5 million, the tax reduction, and the shadow Treasurer has been very clear about this - all of these things will be taken away by the shadow Treasurer. Money ripped out of the hands of working Australians raising children; money ripped out of the hands of Australians who are benefiting from a triple tax-free threshold; money ripped out of the hands of pensioners, and many of them better off as a result of the assistance that is being received.                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    Thank you very much, Deputy Speaker, and on relevance it is relevant that the price impact is 0.7 per cent, less than a cent in a dollar; it is relevant that families are receiving assistance; and it is relevant that the Leader of the Opposition wants to take every dollar of that assistance away from hardworking Australian families and from Australian pensioners.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Deakin for his question. What we are doing is putting in place economic settings which mean solid growth in our economy, low unemployment, contained inflation and a budget returning to surplus, along with rock-solid public finances and a huge investment pipeline. All of this comes about because we took the correct actions during the global financial crisis to avoid recession. The consequence of that has been something like 800,000 jobs created in this country over the past four years. We now get to a situation where our unemployment rate is 4.9 per cent, the envy of the developed world.                               We have not seen or heard anything positive from this opposition about that good economic news. They just hate to hear good economic news. That figure of 4.9 per cent came through about three weeks ago and there has not been one positive comment from the Leader of the Opposition about an unemployment rate in our community of 4.9 per cent. Last week we had the new figure of half a trillion dollars invested in resources. Did we hear one positive comment from the opposition about that? No, no positive comments at all. Why is that? Because we have here in this opposition leader the most reckless and the most dangerous opposition leader we have ever seen in the history of our country. We have never had an opposition leader as negative as that man opposite. He will say anything and do anything to talk our economy down - and while he talks it down he then turns around and complains about lack of confidence. In America they have a term for that - it is called 'putting sand into the gears' and then complaining about things not working. That is what this opposition leader is all about, throwing sand into the gears.                                                                  The member for Casey then left the chamber.                                                                                                      Mr SWAN:                    Despite the negative approach of those opposite, we are getting on with growing the economy and spreading the benefits of the boom right around our economy. Tripling the tax free threshold - that will be ripped out by those opposite. Putting in place increases in payments - all those to be ripped out by those opposite. We understand what it is like to make ends meet. We understand that families out there need additional support with the cost of living. But, of course, those opposite will oppose anything, say anything and do anything in this House, and we just saw another example of that from the shadow Treasurer. What they demonstrate every day of the week is that this opposition leader is too destructive and too negative to ever be put in charge of a $1.5 trillion economy.              </DOC>

  To the member for Menzies: I believe it is a good idea to benefit 1.3 million families with the costs of getting the kids to school. I do believe that. I also believe that it is appropriate that there is welfare conditionality when people, despite assistance and despite work, are not putting their kids in school. That is why we introduced the school attendance measure. I note that, for all of the cant on the other side, it is this government that has got on with the hard jobs of welfare reform in the interests of children, like ensuring that weekly benefits are contingent on kids being in school. It is one of our proud reform measures.                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    Thank you very much, Deputy Speaker. I am answering the member for Menzies' question. On the member for Menzies' question, I believe that weekly welfare benefits should be contingent if people are not getting their kids to school, and it is this government that has introduced it, not those over there, despite all their cant and hypocrisy on the question. This government has introduced it. On the schoolkids bonus, I believe that 1.3 million families should have the benefit of additional resources to help get their kids to school, and I know that the Leader of the Opposition wants to rip that money out of their hands.                              A little bit earlier today, the Leader of the Opposition was in his party room referring to me, and for once he got it right. Let me say to the Leader of the Opposition: I will stand up and fight for working people and their families and I will do that every day between now and the next election. I will stand up and fight and make sure that working people benefit from our strong economy. I will stand up and fight and make sure that we are appropriately spreading the benefits of the boom and I will stand up and fight and make sure families are getting assistance to help them make ends meet.                                                                    Mr PYNE:                    Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order.              </DOC>

  I thank the honourable member for his question. Whilst unfortunately he did not get an opportunity to complete reading the question, I understand that he is referring to the Alpha Coal Project in Queensland. This project has not received all the approvals in terms of environmental requirements at this point in time, but I think the question was going to whether or not the company had applied for an Enterprise Migration Agreement. The answer to the question is no.                              But, given the importance of this project, the member appropriately raised the question of employment, which is of the utmost importance to the government. This project potentially represents 3,600 new jobs in construction. More importantly, in production it represents 1,000 high-skilled, well-paid jobs for Australians. My responsibility is to continue to meet with GVK Hancock Coal , as I have in the past.                               The question also went, as I understood it, to whether or not Gina Rinehart would be able to apply for an Enterprise Migration Agreement. Firstly, she is not the major investor. She is a minor investor at 21 per cent. The major investor is GVK out of India and, as a devotee of the former Premier of Queensland Joh Bjelke-Petersen, who opened up foreign investment for the purposes of developing the coal regions in Queensland, I am sure that he would welcome a new investor, GVK, out of India.                                                                    Mr MARTIN FERGUSON:                    I simply say to the honourable member that I appreciate his focus on employment. We are very proud of our employment record - 4.9 per cent nationally, 5.4 per cent in Queensland - and if this project goes ahead it is going to be interesting with respect to the challenges we will confront in terms of employment. Alpha's neighbouring town of Emerald currently has an unemployment rate of 2.6 per cent. If the project goes ahead I simply give the House this undertaking: our first priority is the employment of Australians.                                                                    Mr MARTIN FERGUSON:                    Our second priority is to ensure that Australians are trained - and I know the member for Kennedy cares about Indigenous Australians - and engaged for the purposes of production. One thousand high-skilled jobs in production and foreign investment are welcome in Australia.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for his question. Indeed, today, thanks to the reforms of the Hawke and Keating governments, flying is five times more affordable than it was 20 years ago. There will be an impact of the carbon price on domestic aviation. It will be one-third of the impact of the GST. If you look at flights, for example, that Virgin have announced, the flight from Sydney to Melbourne, or Sydney to Brisbane, or Melbourne to Adelaide, will increase by $1.50.                              We have had a scare campaign again today in question time from those opposite. It is appropriate to look at the facts of how aviation - including regional aviation - is going. Regional Express put out a release for their 2011 full-year results and this is what they had to say:                              I am actually more optimistic and confident of the outlook and potential of the Rex Group than I have ever been for the past nine years.                              That is what Mr Lim had to say. And on 22nd May they released this statement that from 9 July 2012, nine days after the carbon price starts:                              _ Mildura will once again have direct flights to Adelaide and Sydney in addition to two daily return flights to Broken Hill.                                  _   _   _                              In addition, Broken Hill will, for the first time, receive air services to Melbourne via Mildura.                              Then we get to Brindabella. It gets better. This is what they said in the release that was selectively quoted opposite. It was headlined 'Aeropelican and Brindabella airlines increase charter capacity', and it said:                              Following a significant rise in charter enquiries resulting from growth in the resources sector Aeropelican and Brindabella Airlines will increase the availability of their aircraft in New South Wales and Queensland to take advantage of ad-hoc and contract FIFO opportunities.                              They are going to make more money out of the growth in the resources boom, which is why they are cutting back so that they can use the aircraft for more profitable routes. That is what they say in the release.                              Then we get to the shadow Treasurer's email - and he ripped off half of it! It starts, 'Dear Steve' - to a Tory staffer - 'In line with our discussion this morning, I can confirm that whilst not the primary reason for cancelling the above notice - ' You are a joke. This scare campaign will be exposed for what it is after 1 July.               </DOC>

  It has not taken long, has it, for the opposition to be back to this? Despite the protestations of sympathy of the Leader of the Opposition, every word dripping with insincerity, the truth was revealed on the weekend in the newspapers when the henchman of the Leader of the Opposition was out saying they will continue their campaign against the member for Dobell until they break him. Those are the standards of the Leader of the Opposition, those are the standards over there.

  I thank my friend the member for Page for her question because, as we have indicated repeatedly, the carbon price will only have a modest impact on the cost of living, in fact an increase of 0.7 per cent, less than 1c in the dollar. As I have also observed previously, state based regulators are now confirming key aspects of the forecasts of the Treasury modelling.                              For example, the New South Wales Independent Pricing and Regulatory Tribunal did recently indicate that electricity prices would rise by an average of $3.30 per week per household, bang on the Treasury modelling. Of course, the government's household assistance package provides an average per household of $10.10 a week. IPART in New South Wales has also approved a carbon price impact on council rates of just 0.4 per cent, less than the Treasury modelling. IPART's figures today have been confirmed by none other than the New South Wales government.                              Today the New South Wales local government minister issued a press release showing council rates will rise just 0.4 per cent as a result of the carbon price. For the average household in New South Wales, this is just 6c a week. This was the press release that the shadow Treasurer was waving around earlier. However, he did not get his calculator out because what we have got is the New South Wales government confirming that rate rises will be less than that modelled under the Treasury modelling, just 0.4 per cent. But, of course, it does not stop the opposition. It does not stop the Leader of the Opposition, who has written to councils warning that the world will end as a result of the carbon price! His letter is chock-full of misleading information, including the assertion that it will be more expensive to run council trucks. The trouble with that, just taking that one example, is that on-road fuel costs are not increasing under the carbon price and, in fact, off-road fuel costs will decrease. Excise is being cut. It will fall from 1 July for local governments. All of these are hysterical predictions and deceitful claims.                              Now the facts are coming in. The facts are: the cost impacts are modest and millions of Australian households will be better off, and they will be better off because this Labor government is delivering tax cuts, pension increases and increases in other benefits and family allowance payments. Be assured that every single lie, every single deceit, will be held to account.               </DOC>

  I think the member for Sturt's question in English means that they asked questions at Senate estimates yesterday. They had five hours of opportunity with Fair Work Australia there. As a result of their questioning they did get the document that the member for Sturt refers to. That is what Senate estimates is there for. Should Senate estimates want to reconvene, then that is a matter for it.                              Leave not granted.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Capricornia very much for the question. Like her, I believe, and we all believe on this side of the House, that after a lifetime of work pensioners do deserve some extra assistance to help them make ends meet. That is why this side of the House delivered the largest increase to pensioners in 100 years - more than $150 extra a fortnight that is now going into the pockets of pensioners because of the dedication of this side of the parliament to the needs of pensioners.                              As pensioners now know, they are starting to receive additional funding into their bank accounts right now. Single pensioners are getting their clean energy advance, with $250 going into their bank accounts. Couple pensioners are receiving $380 combined. I can inform the House that, as of last night, more than -                                                                     Ms MACKLIN:                    Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. As of last night, more than 627,000 payments had been made to pensioners, worth more than $135 million. That means that, for a maximum rate single pensioner, they are going to be $134 a year better off. For couples, they will be $201 a year better off as a result of the payments that this government is delivering.                              For those pensioners up in Central Queensland, there are 18,600 pensioners around Rockhampton who are going to receive payments in this fortnight. We have seen in the Morning Bulletin a pensioner up there saying that it is going to be good for him. He is going to be able to afford some extras.                                                                    Ms MACKLIN:                    We saw a person from the member for Dawson's electorate - now that he is getting warned. A lady told the Daily Mercury that she will spend the extra money on household costs. What I would like to know from the -                                                                     Ms MACKLIN:                    What we would like to know is whether the member for Dawson has told his constituent or told the Daily Mercury whether or not he has been honest with them. Has he told them that he is going to claw back all of this money that this constituent has just received along with all the other people in Dawson? Eighteen thousand pensioners in Dawson are receiving that money. The member for Dawson is responsible for telling all of those pensioners that he is going to claw that money back from all of those pensioners in Dawson.

  I welcome the opposition's interest in enterprise migration agreements and the benefit they bring to the Australian economy. Enterprise migration agreements were recommended by the National Resources Sector Employment Taskforce, chaired by the now Special Minister of State, in 2010. They were adopted in the 2011 budget and announced. I then issued the guidelines on EMAs after consultation with the sector and with unions, as I recall, in September 2011. The application from Roy Hill came in, as I recall it, in the few months after that. It was, perhaps, in early 2012 or late 2011. I updated the productivity committee of the cabinet informally as to progress and regularly consulted with officers across the government as to progress in relation to this development. As I said yesterday, the Prime Minister's office was briefed in detail early in the week of 21 May.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Canberra for her question and acknowledge her interest in veterans' issues. As the Prime Minister and the Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs have outlined, the government has a plan to build a clean energy future and has a comprehensive package to ensure that veterans and their families receive extra financial assistance.                              From 14 June 2012 upfront household assistance payments will be made, as have been outlined - $250 for single service pensioners and $380 for couples combined. The fortnightly payments commence in 2013. In addition, disability pensioners will receive a payment now ranging from $140 to $380 for a special rate or TPI pension. Around 310,00 individuals are covered by this - 160,000 service and age pensioners, 110,000 disability pensioners, over 90,000 war widows and widowers - and, I repeat, veterans receiving both disability pension and service pension will receive payments for both pensions. There are 3,400 of these recipients in the member for Canberra's electorate. Children of veterans and members receiving payments under children's education schemes will also receive assistance. Additional assistance will be available through the family tax benefit, the new low-income supplement and the tax system. We know already of new tax rates from 1 July 2012 and, of course, the changes to the tax-free threshold being increased by $6,000 to $18,200.                              You would think, given the importance of these payments to the veteran community, that they would be supported by the opposition. You would think as they go around the veterans' community, as they are want to do, ingratiating themselves on a whole range of issues, that they would be supporting these issues. Of course, they are not. When they go around the veterans' community you do not see them saying to them, 'We've said no to pension increases. We've said no to tax cuts for working families,' and they have also said no to pension increases. Will they fess up, when next they visit an RSL conference, that they plan to take these moneys away from the veteran community? Will they do it? That is the question they need to respond to. No amount of the Leader of the Opposition strutting around like a peacock, or should I say a lyrebird, in his lycra, in his budgie smugglers, in his safety vests and hard harts will distract Australians, including veterans, from asking the hard questions of the opposition leader.               </DOC>

  In relation to the Leader of the Opposition's question, the situation here is perfectly clear.

  I thank the member for Corangamite for that question. This government has been committed to education as the great enabler in Australian society because we know that for any young person to reach their potential, to get a good job for the future, having a great education lies at the foundation of that. No government has delivered more over a shorter period of time in policies on and investment into education: the big improvements in school facilities, bringing through a national curriculum, delivering transparency through the My School website and national partnerships focusing on lifting education performance in schools right around Australia.                              We understand that for parents, whose No. 1 priority is to make sure that their kids get a good education, that comes with costs: costs that come along with school excursions, kids growing out of school uniforms and kids literally growing before their eyes. That is why the budget had a schoolkids bonus in it. It was so that parents could make decisions about how they support their kids in the costs that they have to meet when they go to school - $410 for kids in primary school; $820 for kids in secondary school. In fact, on Friday, 15 June, people around Australia can expect to see Labor members of parliament, who are proud of this initiative, at the schools in their communities, telling people about this schoolkids bonus. The fact is that over one million families will benefit from this initiative. In fact, people will start seeing cheques coming into their accounts this month and in June. Then it will happen before first term and it will happen before third term.                              But, when we announced this schoolkids bonus, the Leader of the Opposition came out straight away and knocked this by saying he thought that parents were going to spend the money on pokies. Then his shadow ministers chimed in on the negative chorus to describe it as a hit list. The fact is this: this government trusts families to make decisions about spending money on education because we know that families rate education very highly, but the opposition leader did not trust families to make that decision themselves. This is because his inherent negativity has given over to a negativity that even Australian families can make decisions about how they want to spend money to support their kids.                              Here on this side of the House we are going to make every school a great school. We walk away from the negativity of the Leader of the Opposition, who would not even accept that families around Australia could make the best decisions in the interests of their own kids to apply a schoolkids bonus.              </DOC>

  No question for 250 days and then two in two days; it is my lucky week, Madam Deputy Speaker! The situation is very clear. The minister for immigration approves enterprise migration agreements. That is the situation; that is the continuing situation. In relation to caucus discussions, which of course we do not discuss in detail, it was a very positive discussion this morning which recognised the benefits of enterprise migration agreements, so I am glad the opposition even recognises those. As I said in my previous answer, I have discussed with and updated informally the productivity committee of the cabinet in relation to this enterprise migration agreement. I continue to work with my colleagues on the productivity committee of the cabinet, and the situation is that the minister for immigration approves enterprise migration agreements.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Wills for his question and his sincere interest in the small businesses not just around the country but particularly within his own electorate. I was recently able to visit some of those small businesses and talk to them about the way they can leverage the rollout of the NBN and the fantastic opportunities that are afforded them as a result of that fantastic piece of infrastructure.                              The member asks about the issues of confronting cost-of-living pressures. Can I say to the member and to the House that this government is acutely aware of the cost-of-living pressures confronting ordinary Australians. That is why in relation to small business we made some decisions that will create the environment in which small business can thrive. We have, for example, enhanced the benefit and simplified the depreciation rules for small business. What does that mean? It means, firstly, that you can purchase assets up to $6½ thousand, ensuring an instant tax write-off. That means an immediate depreciation, providing cash-flow solutions for small business. It also means that depreciation schedules will be lessened, reducing paperwork for small business.                              We have also introduced the loss carryback initiative. This is a fantastic initiative for at least 110,000 incorporated small businesses in this country that allows them the opportunity, if they have made a loss in the financial year, to claim a refund of company tax paid in the preceding year. We have tripled the tax-free threshold, which is very important for unincorporated small businesses, allowing for $18,200 to be tax free.                              We have delivered a budget surplus by making tough fiscal decisions. This will create the environment in which the Reserve Bank, if it chooses to do so, can lower the official cash rate - again, a very important thing for small businesses. We saw the reduction by 50 basis points of interest rates to small businesses. That provides greater access to credit for small businesses around the country.                              Broadly, we have compensated the vast majority of Australians and, indeed, overcompensated four out of every 10 households for the estimated 0.7 per cent modest rise in prices that will flow from the carbon price from 1 July. I do believe these are very important initiatives. We would hope that the Leader of the Opposition would support some of these, but we have a Liberal Party leader who, for the first time in that party's history, opposed tax relief for small business because he continues with his nasty, negative attacks on people generally.               </DOC>

  Whether or not the opposition leader likes it, the facts of this matter are the facts. As I have said on a number of occasions to this parliament, I was fully briefed about this matter on my return from Chicago as the minister for immigration has said now on more than one occasion. That briefing was provided to my office early in the week starting 21 May. I know it may shock the Leader of the Opposition, but some of us like to work off the facts and some of us like to get the full information. I know these concepts are not going to compute for the Leader of the Opposition. Why would anyone care about facts? The Leader of the Opposition never has. Why would anyone want to think something through? The Leader of the Opposition never has. You do not need to think things through when the first thing you are going to say is 'no'. It does not require any thought. As for me, I think facts are valuable; I think that thinking is worthwhile.

  I find it extraordinary that despite the fact a report on the Murray-Darling Basin was released yesterday morning we go through two question times without any interest at all from those opposite, no interest at all. We have 15 members opposite who have seats within the Basin. Do you remember 1½ years ago when the guide came out? There was question after question of people interrogating the document. There was question after question of members of the opposition wanting to take an interest. Whether they were in the northern end, whether they were through the Murray system, whether they were at the South Australian end, they were taking an interest in where this reform would go. And that was before we entered the statutory process.                              We now find ourselves at the final stages of a statutory process and not a word from those opposite. There has not been a single word or moment of interest. This is the reform that John Howard described as the greatest environmental challenge of our generation. The member for Wentworth brought the legislation into this parliament in his time as Minister for the Environment and Water Resources, actually caring about wanting to do something about this. And yet all we have from the opposition now, after two days to work it through, to read it, to work out what they think, is silence.                              It is not like there is not a capacity to have an opinion on this. The Australian Conservation Foundation said it believed the revised plan fails a whole lot of river health targets. The National Irrigators' Council view it as unacceptable for the opposite reason. The National Farmers' Federation believes there needs to be a shift in emphasis towards infrastructure. The New South Wales Irrigators' Council reckon it is Armageddon. It is not hard to have an opinion on this.                              From the government's perspective, I have made clear it has done the right thing on ground water. I do not think it has gone far enough on the environmental ambition that you can have for this sort of reform. But all we get from the Leader of the Opposition is him turning up to a meeting of thousands of people in Griffith and when they say, 'We want you to vote this down because there's too much water in it', he says, 'Don't worry, I won't support a bad plan'. Then he goes out to the front steps of Parliament House and to a whole lot of conservationists, who are saying, 'We don't think there's enough water in it', he says to the opposite crowd, 'Don't worry, I won't support a bad plan.' You cannot have the situation. Who would have thought that he was gearing up to vote no? Who would have thought that he would go to every audience and pretend he is on their side, when the conclusion every time is the same word: no? When it comes to Murray-Darling reform, Australia has been waiting for generations for there to be national control of the Murray-Darling Basin, and it will occur this year.              </DOC>

  The Leader of the Opposition in his question refers to a Minerals Council report that was reported in today's newspapers and has been the subject of some discussion since. I think it is worth noting that that article, which was in the pages of the Australian and the Financial Review today, was written by Angus Taylor. That name may be familiar to some because he has just been preselected as the Liberal candidate for the seat of Hume at the next election - a very important point.                              Is it of any surprise to me that a man who is presenting for election as a candidate for the Liberal Party at the next election is talking the economy down? That is of no surprise to me whatsoever. Is it of any surprise to me that someone preselected as a Liberal candidate for the next election is making absurd claims about carbon pricing? Well, no, that is of no surprise to me either. It is not of any surprise to me that he is actually a very vocal and proud supporter of Work Choices? Apparently he has not got the memo yet that tells members of the opposition to not be truthful about their support for Work Choices.                              What the Leader of the Opposition ought to be acknowledging in this parliament are the following facts: our economy is strong -                                                                     Ms GILLARD:                    It is a serious issue. It is too serious for the petty politics of the opposition, far too serious for that. Running the economy is a serious issue. Making sure our economy is the envy of the world has required serious work. Making sure that there are $500 million of investments in the pipeline has required serious work. And at every step of the way, this government has worked with the government of South Australia because we want this Olympic Dam project to go ahead. We worked hard with the government of South Australia to achieve that result. What will not help the achievement of that result is a reckless negativity, talking the economy down and making false claims about carbon pricing. Those things are calculated to destroy jobs and opportunity in South Australia and right around the country.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for his question, because I think everybody on this side of the House was proud to stand up in this House this morning and support the 'fair go' budget - very proud to support a budget that was coming back to surplus, very proud to support a budget which is going to spread the benefits of the boom to every corner of our country and certainly very proud to make room in a very tight budget to assist those with disabilities. So everybody on this side of the House is very proud of a budget which will grow our economy and spread the benefits to every corner of our country.                              We know those opposite are so reckless and so destructive that all they ever want to do is talk our economy down. What we will do on this side of the House is build up our economy and build up our country. We have confidence in the future of this country. Those on that side of the House, led by this negative opposition leader, just want to talk the economy down every day - day in, day out.                              There are substantial benefits in the budget to assist families in Australia: a $5 billion package over five years of additional support for low- and middle-income families in this community. We are very proud of that, and particularly the additional assistance with the costs of sending kids to school. There is also the assistance in terms of the clean energy package, going out to something like three million pensioners - we are very proud of that - and additional assistance to 1.6 million families and, on top of that, tripling the tax-free threshold. That is going to make an enormous difference to many people on low incomes, giving a tax cut to something like seven million Australians on low and middle incomes. Then, of course, there is the assistance for business - the loss carry-back and, of course, the assistance in terms of the instant asset write-off, which will go to something like 2.7 million small businesses.                              So we on this side of the House were very proud to stand up and support that assistance for families and business when the Leader of the Opposition was simply running away from it - running away from the families of Australia in terms of the assistance to families to educate their kids, and running away from the assistance to small business. Fair dinkum! You should have seen it in here this morning. It was as if the Three Stooges were back in play, stumbling and bumbling around the corner of the House, and they were joined by a fourth. Shemp over there joined the Three Stooges this morning, running away from the people of Australia and running away from cost-of-living assistance. He is all opposition and no leadership.              </DOC>

  To the Leader of the National Party I would say the following: the regulators for electricity prices in major states around the nation have already spoken. They have already spoken about the impact of carbon pricing, and when they have spoken about the impact of carbon pricing they have said that its contribution to increased electricity prices will be the same as the Treasury modelling at 10 per cent, or indeed less than the Treasury modelling. Now the Leader of the National Party shakes his head, but you cannot shake your head and wish away a fact. That is what has been said in New South Wales. That is what has been said in Queensland. In Western Australia the amount was actually less. Let us remember: not only have these determinations by the electricity price regulators backed in the Treasury modelling, but what they mean is that what the government has been saying to Australian families and pensioners about assistance is absolutely right. People will see assistance coming into their family budgets - 3.2 million pensioners - and millions of them will be better off. Families on average will see assistance of $10.10 and will experience price changes of less than that.                              On the specific example that the Leader of the National Party has raised, I am more than happy to take a look at it, but what I would say is this: my experience in this parliament time after time, day after day, is that things are brought into this parliament by the opposition and represented as if they were true, and on further inquiry they are found out to be completely false and just another part of the fear campaign coming from this Leader of the Opposition. Let's remember where this fear campaign has got itself to. It has got itself to a point where Liberal-National Party members are now anxious about the relentless negativity of the Leader of the Opposition and his overblown, false claims.                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    Thank you very much, Madam Deputy Speaker. I think it is relevant in assessing claims by the opposition that we have heard so many false ones: the end of the coal industry, astronomical price increases, electricity going up by 30 per cent and on and on it has gone. These relentlessly negative claims, these destructive claims, will be shown to be untrue following 1 July, and then the issue for the Leader of the Opposition will be that he might be able to run but he will not be able to hide after 1 July.                              To the Leader of the National Party, if he chooses to forward that information to my office I will have a look at it.                                                                  The members for Goldstein and North Sydney then left the chamber.                              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Calwell for the question. I know that she in her electorate is working hard to ensure that people are getting the right information about the assistance that they will receive available through our clean energy future package. I do note too that she was proudly in this parliament to support the schoolkids bonus against the opposition from those members of the Liberal-National Party who thought working families did not deserve a break and should not get any money to assist them with the costs of getting the kids to school.                              The member for Calwell asked me about how Australians will experience carbon pricing from 1 July and what assistance is available to help people make ends meet. I do understand that working families struggle to pay the bills, and that is why we have made sure that in creating a carbon pricing scheme we will be giving families around the nation, on average, assistance of $10.10 per week, and that will be more than the impact that they will experience from carbon pricing. Six out of 10 households will receive assistance that fully matches or exceeds these costs. Three point two million pensioners are already seeing advance payments of $250 per single pensioner and $380 for pensioner couples, and then in March they will see more assistance and it will be ongoing. Our economy will also see the benefits of investments in a clean energy future.                              From 1 July Australians will be able to experience this, they will be able to live it and they will be able to make up their own minds. That ability to make up their own minds will be a very sharp contrast to the relentlessly negative and destructive fear campaign that has been run by the Leader of the Opposition. They will be able to make up their own minds about his claim that price rises will be unimaginable. They will be able to see whether or not whole towns have been wiped off the map. They will be able to see whether or not their fuel bill or their electricity bill goes up by 30 per cent. And they will be able to see that the mainstays of our manufacturing sector are here and stay strong.                              From 1 July, Liberal MPs who have joined the Leader of the Opposition in this negative campaign will then be left to wonder whether their relentless negativity has left them at the point of no return - where they will be given the Leader of the Opposition's systematic misleading of the Australian community, on the coal industry, on the cement industry, on jobs, on the cost of living and on electricity prices. We know from this morning that the Leader of the Opposition can run, but come 1 July he will not be able to hide from these claims being revealed to be wholly untrue.              </DOC>

  I am very pleased to be asked that question because yesterday in question time I referred to a misleading letter sent by the Leader of the Opposition to local governments around Australia, which erroneously claimed, misleadingly claimed, that the cost of running council trucks is going to go up. He has been dropped into this, assumedly, by the shadow minister, who has not done his homework in relation to this matter.                              As I told the House yesterday, this is completely misleading, because the facts are these. In relation to local councils, to which I was referring and to which the Leader of the Opposition had written, their on-road fuel costs will not increase under the carbon price from 1 July. Secondly, and importantly, off-road fuel costs for local councils will actually fall from 1 July. Currently, the fuel tax credit for diesel used by local councils - it is important to listen to the facts occasionally - in off-road activities like road construction and maintenance is 19.0715c per litre. From 1 July the fuel tax credit for these activities will, in fact, rise to 31.933c per litre. That means that the effective fuel tax rate for local councils for off-road diesel use will decrease from 1 July by 12.8615c per litre. If they had had the gumption on that side of the parliament to do their homework, they could have looked it all up on the ATO website. Do your work. Do not come in here and impugn my integrity or go outside. Do your homework!              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Denison for his question. I know that he has had a consistent interest in this issue, as have a number of members of parliament on both sides of the House. I know many of my colleagues are very concerned about it too.                              I believe all Australians were shocked by the footage we saw on Four Corners 12 months ago. It was truly horrifying footage. At that time we had no ability as a government or as a nation to track what was happening to cattle who were exported live from Australia to Indonesia or to other nations. We responded by introducing a system that enables us to have visibility across the supply chain. Put simply, that means that we are able to track and trace where Australian animals go and where they are eventually slaughtered. That means that we are also in a position, through working with exporters and requiring them to step up to the responsibility, to be able to ensure that there are OIE standards where animals are ultimately slaughtered. They are the international standards for dealing with livestock. That is the approach that we have taken.                              The member for Denison is right: there was more footage relatively recently. The tracing system enabled us to know which exporters of live animals were involved - that is, where the animals had come from. Consequently, through the regulation system - the regulator is the Secretary of the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry - we were able to take some action in relation to those exporters.                              I know that the member for Denison, a number of other members of this parliament and other people would want to see other standards applied than the OIE standards, but we have deliberately adopted the OIE standards because they are the standards that have worldwide recognition. Consequently, we believe they are the right standards for a worldwide system because cattle from our country go to a number of export destinations. Can I say to the member for Denison that we do work with industry and exporters to encourage stunning. We believe that should be a practice which is encouraged and we will continue to work with the livestock industry and live cattle exporters on encouraging the use of stunning for livestock in abattoirs overseas.              </DOC>

  I thank my colleague the member for Capricornia for her question. As a Queenslander, she has a very keen interest in this issue. We have heard already about the importance of the government's household assistance package to assist people, but it is also important to give careful consideration to the implementation of the carbon price in important industries like the liquefied natural gas industry. The fact is that the LNG industry is experiencing an unprecedented boom and the outlook remains very strong. In its latest report on major resource projects, in fact, the Bureau of Resource and Energy Economics identified seven LNG projects under construction at a value of over $164 billion. In addition, as of last month there were 12 proposed LNG developments undergoing feasibility studies and investors are committing tens of billions of dollars to the LNG industry in the full knowledge of the implementation of the carbon price.                              The investment boom in LNG production will flow through to communities with stronger employment growth, increased incomes and improvements in local service and for local families in facilities provided. As an example of that, on 27 April Santos announced that it would invest $200 million into roads, affordable housing and environmental and social projects as part of its Gladstone LNG project. But this must be very hard news for the Leader of the Opposition to hear, it has to be said. He has prophesied:                              The carbon tax is a deadly threat to the economy of Gladstone _                              That is what he said, and I am glad to see him affirming it. The truth when one looks at these projects is that there is an incredible $56 billion of investment in three LNG projects alone committed and planned in Gladstone. He has predicted the death of Gladstone, that it would collapse as a town and that it would fall off the continent, but there is $56 billion worth of investment in the full knowledge of the carbon price being implemented. The fact of the matter is that there is not just relentless negative comment coming from the Leader of the Opposition; it is relentless deceit. The campaign against the carbon price is a complete fraud. His campaign for the Prime Minister is a complete fraud.               </DOC>

  I would ask that the interjection that was just across the chamber be withdrawn. It was about a dead man. I think we have had enough of that and it should be withdrawn.                                                                    Mr ALBANESE:                    If we are going to have the Leader of the Opposition say that that was a rebuke of me, the person who said it should withdraw and then we will move on.                                                                    Mr ALBANESE:                    We are indeed well aware of the destructive negativity when it comes to this Leader of the Opposition and the carbon price. He goes around talking the economy down, he visits businesses and talks them down and he tells workers that they will be done out of a job. One company that has been a victim of this campaign is Nolan's Transport, in Queensland. The Leader of the Opposition visited Nolan's Transport, in Queensland, to talk up his scare campaign against the price on carbon. The response that occurred as a result of that company's invitation was a talking down of that company, and that company regrets very much its invitation to the Leader of the Opposition.                              In this month's issue of Australasian Transport News in an article headlined, 'Nolans fed up over dodgy carbon tax claims', they ping the carbon price campaign and the scare campaign being run by this Leader of the Opposition. In this article, Mr Terry Nolan, the owner of the company, says:                              _ it wouldn't cost us anything like the $3 million per year claimed in the email. We're sick of people using our business as a political pawn without checking the facts.                              Mr Nolan went on to talk about the email that has been distributed talking down this company by saying, 'Whoever sent it, it's definitely for political reasons.'                              What we need to do when it comes to the price on carbon is to have a rational discussion about what the facts are. There will be some increases in prices, though heavy vehicles, of course, are excluded from the scheme until 1 July 2014. We need to have a rational discussion including the support and assistance measures that have been put in place by this government.                              Last Thursday I indicated that the Leader of the Opposition would be going to Kurri Kurri on the following Saturday. But he was not welcome in Kurri Kurri on the Saturday - he was not welcome to conduct the scare campaign. If you see this Leader of the Opposition coming to your business, I have a bit of advice for you: lock your doors, because this bloke will just talk down your business. He regards it as his role in life to talk down the economic position of businesses, to talk down the Australian economy and to try to scare Australian workers. That is the role he plays.                              We are prepared to have a rational debate out there. This Leader of the Opposition is so desperate that he is prepared to tear down the economy and to tear down individual businesses.              </DOC>

  To the member for Indi: I think I answered a question either identical to or very similar to this earlier in the week. I am passionate about Australian jobs, and I do not care who hears it. I am passionate about Australian jobs. I have conversations about what we can do to support Australian jobs frequently with my ministerial colleagues, with the trade union movement and with employers around the nation. This is a government with a proud track record -                                                                     Ms GILLARD:                    As I was saying, I am passionate about the creation of Australian jobs, so, whether it is a discussion with union leaders last Friday or with business people or with my ministerial colleagues or my caucus colleagues, what is always first and foremost for this government is the creation of Australian jobs. We have a proud track record of creating Australian jobs, and we will continue that record of creating Australian jobs. I will always in all circumstances look to see what more we can do to create Australian jobs. We will keep working with the resources sector, with businesses around the nation and with the trade union movement to create Australian jobs, and I am happy to share that passion with this House.              </DOC>

  I thank my colleague the member for Moreton for his question because factual information in this debate about climate change and carbon pricing is extremely important, especially when there is a deceitful campaign being run against it, with misleading claims being made that cause people to feel fearful, that cause anxiety and cause insecurity that is completely unjustified. It is very important for local communities to hear the facts. We have heard numerous misrepresentations from those opposite, especially from the opposition leader. We have already heard some instances in question time today relating to the issue of local government. We have heard about the fact that Gladstone is going to be destroyed! We have also heard claims that Whyalla will be wiped off the map.                              It is not commonly known, but the opposition leader has essentially forecast that the coal industry will cease to operate from 1 July. In fact, nearly $100 billion of investment is coming into the industry. We have heard of unimaginable price increases and that the household assistance will not be permanent or ongoing and will not be indexed. All of that is completely fallacious and deceitful.                              Last week, questions were asked about an announcement by Norsk Hydro in relation to the Kurri Kurri aluminium smelter. It was falsely claimed by the opposition that this was attributable to carbon pricing. It is very important that members of the public get the facts about these issues. This is a facility in my own region in the Hunter Valley. A person - a member of the public - has contacted my office and indicated her concern about this issue. She indicated that she has contacted the company to ask for a reply about the causes of the closure of the aluminium smelter. She received a reply from Mr Halvor Molland, who is the vice-president of Norsk Hydro. He said to her, 'I am sorry to see you have based your opinion on Foxtel news and not on what Hydro actually have said.' He went on:                              We have been quite specific, saying that the carbon tax is not the reason - but shorter term market conditions and the macro-economic environment.                              The decision to initiate consultation with a view to close the aluminium production at Kurri Kurri would have been the same - with or without the carbon tax.                              He said, 'But unfortunately our announcement on Wednesday has sparked a political debate outside our control, where the carbon tax is in the middle.' He went on:                              Fact is that Kurri Kurri is already losing significant amount of cash every month - before any carbon tax has been implemented.                              It is deceit. It is fraud. It needs to be corrected, and you should apologise.              </DOC>

  I welcome the question from the shadow minister because I welcome any opportunity to talk about this project and this agreement which delivers 8,000 jobs - 6,700 jobs for Australians - 2,000 traineeships and a mine which will deliver 55 million tonnes -                                                                     Mr BOWEN:                    A very telling interjection from the shadow minister!

  I thank the member for Deakin for his question and his ongoing concern for 15,600 small businesses in his electorate. The government is boosting confidence for small business by returning the budget to surplus. We have the lowest official cash rate for many a year - lower than at any time under the Howard government. We have low unemployment. We have low debt. We have contained inflation. We have $500 billion of investment in the pipeline, which instils confidence in business, including small business.                              Of course, we have payments to pensioners and students, tax cuts to workers, and school bonuses to parents, enhancing consumer confidence, which in turn will enhance business confidence. And the budget, of course, helps cut down paperwork and encourages investment through the asset write-offs and the loss carry-back scheme. The member has asked me whether there has been any misinformation in relation to these matters and whether we have some concerns. Well, we need look no further than the Leader of the Opposition, who has not met a voter he has not tried to scare. The Leader of the Opposition and his cohorts continue to talk the economy down, despite the evidence to the contrary.                              Just over a week ago, the member for Higgins claimed online that a business in her electorate was closing down due to government policies, including carbon pricing. Of course, the truth was somewhat different. The owner in question confirmed he was using the premises to sell his stock from his actual store three doors down the road because his tenant had recently vacated. The member, accompanied by the shadow minister for industrial relations, Senator Abetz, claimed the shop was closing down when in truth it was temporarily expanding its shopfront to sell its stock. I, of course, forgive the owner for what he has advised was an attempt at black humour. But I do not forgive the cruel hoax that the member for Higgins and the shadow minister for industrial relations have done to scare small businesses in that electorate and, indeed, electorates around the country.                              This is just another part of the scare campaign waged by the Leader of the Opposition on all small businesses across this country. He has no capacity other than to trash our economy contrary to the evidence. He has no capacity to do anything other than talk our economy down, which, of course, affects adversely confidence in small business. Indeed, I tell you: when I talk to small businesses they ask when he is going to say one thing about a positive plan for them and for this country's future.              </DOC>

  The Deputy Leader of the Opposition knows cabinet is confidential. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition has also misquoted the minister for immigration from yesterday. I refer her to his actual answer, which is very different from what she just said to the parliament - another mislead by the opposition. This is all they do in question time - part of the relentless fear campaign we see everywhere.                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    As I have said, cabinet meetings and cabinet subcommittees are confidential. But I believe it is offensive indeed for the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to come into this place and misrepresent the minister for immigration's answers from yesterday. If she is incapable of reading Hansard, one wonders what she is doing here.                              Leave not granted.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Parramatta for her question. She is a very hardworking and passionate advocate for the people of Western Sydney. She is right in pointing to the strength of the Australian economy. It is one of the strongest economies in the developed world, with low unemployment, contained inflation, low net debt and a record pipeline of investment - in fact, half a trillion dollars are coming into the resources sector alone. On top of that, we are returning this budget to surplus and, in returning the budget to surplus, we are determined to spread the benefits of the mining boom -                                                                     Mr BRADBURY:                    to ensure that hardworking families, in electorates like the member for Parramatta's, not only have the opportunity to make ends meet but to get ahead. I am pleased to advise the member for Parramatta that, in her electorate alone, some 9,000 families will be receiving the schoolkids bonus. In addition to that, 45,000 hardworking individuals will receive a tax cut. On top of that, 14,000 families in the electorate of Parramatta will get an increase to their family payments. And of course our responsible economic management is giving the Reserve Bank the space that it needs to cut interest rates, if it chooses to do so, to deliver more relief to working families.                              These benefits are not just confined to the electorate of Parramatta but will be spread right across Western Sydney and, indeed, right across the country. I note that, in the electorate of Macarthur, which is also in Western Sydney -                                                                     Mr BRADBURY:                    12,000 families are set to receive an increase in their family payments and 11,000 families will receive an increase in their payments through the schoolkids bonus. The member for Macarthur likes to stand up for working families - or at least he likes to come into this place and pretend that that is what he does. Just a couple of weeks ago he came in here and said, yes, parents in Macarthur are struggling, they need all the help that they can get. But then he came straight back into the chamber and voted against giving them a schoolkids bonus. He goes back to his electorate and tells people he is here for working families, but then he comes in here and he votes no. Why did he vote no? He voted no because he wants to stand up for those families but the relentless and destructive negativity of the Leader of the Opposition is getting in the way. The Leader of the Opposition says no to increases in family payments, no to increases in the pension, no to the schoolkids bonus. I know they are addicted to saying no, but the member for Macarthur, if he really must say no, should say no to the Leader of the Opposition and come in here and say yes to the relief that we want to provide to working families in his electorate.              </DOC>

  Thank you very much to the member for Durack for his question. The member for Durack may not be aware, though he ought to be aware if he has been studying Senate estimates, that appropriate provision has been made for monitoring and compliance work. To the member for Durack: this side of the parliament will always work hard and diligently to ensure that Australians are getting opportunities and getting them first. We are a Labor government and that is why we, during the global financial crisis, voted to support Australian jobs and prevailed against the destructive negativity of those opposite. And that is why in this period when our economy is the envy of the world but around the nation there are patchwork pressures, which means that it is possible in one part of the nation for a skilled worker to lose their job but their very skills to be desperately in demand in another part of the nation, we will work as a Labor government to ensure that people know what the opportunities are that are arising from the resources boom.                              Common sense tells all of us that it is not possible for everyone to work in the mining industry, that it is not possible for everyone to relocate to where those job opportunities are, that it is not possible for everyone to work in a fly-in fly-out arrangement. But if there are Australians ready, willing and able to do the work and it is available, then I want them to get that work first. That is what we are determined to do. That is what we will use the resources of government to do. That is what we will work hard to ensure, because we want the benefits of the resources boom to be spread right around the country, whether those benefits are in the form of jobs or whether they are in the form of increased family payments.                              It is the opposition who want those benefits to be concentrated in the hands of a few. The Leader of the Opposition has been talking about that today to the Minerals Council of Australia. He has been speculating about just how tough it is to be a billionaire. Well, let me say to the Leader of the Opposition that what he should have said to the Minerals Council today is: 'Heaven help working Australian families struggling to make ends meet if this Leader of the Opposition ever becomes Prime Minister,' because his job then will be to rip out of the hands of families the benefits of the boom and to give it back to a few.              </DOC>

  I have dealt with that question and the fact that here is the Leader of the Opposition yet again, with all his destructive intent. While this government has been getting on with creating Australian jobs, there he is mired in his petty, petty politics.

I think we have seen on grand display the lack of interest of the opposition in this serious policy question. They don't care about jobs. Petty politics back and forth, petty politics back and forth - that is all they will ever be about.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Hindmarsh for his question. The passage of the budget's second reading is good news for families around Australia, because in that budget we continue our commitment to supporting education for families right around Australia. Importantly, we continue our commitment on the national partnerships that sees the federal Labor government provide support to the states for specific investments in things like teacher quality, literacy and numeracy, and low-socioeconomic communities.                              I was very pleased that the COAG Reform Council reported today that reward payments to the states have been paid by the Commonwealth on these national partnerships - in particular, $147 million in reward payments on literacy and numeracy. This is an important national partnership. We have seen about half a million students benefiting from additional support in schools as they come through primary school, getting their reading, writing and maths under control. We now have many of the schools involved where the kids are performing at above national minimum standards. So that is really good news and the budget provided an additional $250 million to make sure we continue that national partnership.                              Of course the budget also included the schoolkids bonus. Here, as I am asked about the schoolkids bonus, I have to reflect on the pressures that families face when they want to get their kids off to school and they have those extra expenses coming. Let us just take an eligible family - a typical family with two kids, maybe one is in primary school and one in high school. They can expect over the course of the year just over $1,200 in support from the schoolkids bonus for the pair of runners that are looking a bit tatty, or maybe it is a new backpack or some stationery needs. It is particularly important that parents are given the opportunity to manage their budgets in this way, because they understand the kind of education costs that they are facing for their kids that have to be met.                              In Hindmarsh, about 5,500 families will benefit from the schoolkids bonus. Across South Australia about 96,500 families will benefit from that schoolkids bonus. The only person who led the charge of 'no' against the schoolkids bonus was the opposition leader, who seems to be hard-wired for negativity. So opposed to the idea of parents getting a schoolkids bonus was he that he claimed that the money would be spent on poker machines. I think that says more about the Leader of the Opposition than it does about families around Australia, who know the education needs they face and know that this government is doing something to meet them.              </DOC>

  Can I say to the Leader of the Opposition: rather than theorising about a draft report that is out for consultation, if he has got the slightest concern about problem gambling in our nation, he can approach the dispatch box now and we will give him leave and give him an opportunity to say he will back this government's reforms on problem gambling. We will give him an opportunity to say that he will pledge the Liberal and National parties to do something to address the scourge of poker machines around the country and the fact that so many Australian families actually have their budgets and their families broken by poker machine gambling. If he is really serious, I trust he is doing that now.                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    I say to the Leader of the Opposition: if he is prepared to use the terminology of 'old scourge', why is he not prepared to do anything about it? Why is he so hypocritical that he will not today pledge the Liberal and National parties to support this legislation that the government wants to bring to this parliament to address poker machine reform and problem gambling? The Leader of the Opposition in his press conference a little bit earlier today was asked about this and said, 'That's not what we're here to talk about today', and then just shut down his press conference. Running and hiding is not good enough from this Leader of the Opposition. If he is going to have a pretence of caring about problem gambling, then he should pledge today, he should pledge now, his support for poker machine reform. Otherwise he will not be taken seriously. On interactive gambling there is a draft report out for consultation. If the Leader of the Opposition has views, I suggest he involve himself in the process, but no-one is going to take him seriously unless he says, 'Yes, I support poker machine reform'.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Bass for his question and I know that he is centrally concerned about economic questions for the people of his electorate and the people of Tasmania. He has been a continuous advocate to me about the needs of the Tasmanian economy, particularly whilst its economy is in the kind of transition that we are seeing now. We will continue to work with the member for Bass and our Tasmanian members to address issues in the Tasmanian economy.                               We do have new figures today that showcase the strength of our economy. Capital expenditure figures have shown a strong increase in the March quarter, up 6.1 per cent to be at 28.6 per cent higher than a year ago. This reflects the huge pipeline of resources investment flowing into our nation, nearly $½ trillion. While we should always be very cautious about quarterly figures, the year-on-year figures also show an increase in manufacturing investment. These figures today show the fundamentals of our economy are strong, an economy that has grown by 8.8 per cent since we came to office. While much of the world went backwards or at the very best stagnated, we have leapt forward by 8.8 per cent. What that means is that we are a government dedicated to managing the economy in the interests of working people and sharing the benefits of a strong economy and the current resources boom.                               I had the opportunity to speak to the Minerals Council of Australia about that last night. I recognise that people work hard in mining and take big risks, but I also recognise that people in hospitals, people in schools, people in factories, people in shops work hard too and they are entitled to see a fair share of the resources boom. We will continue to be focused on spreading the benefits of that resources boom and we will not be prevented by the aggressive negativity of the Leader of the Opposition from getting that done. Despite today's figures of strong investment in the resources sector we have heard the Leader of the Opposition predict the death of the coal industry, the collapse of the mining industry, the end of manufacturing and entire towns being wiped off the map. I know many of his colleagues are worried that this aggressive negativity is reaching the point of no return, when on 1 July each of these claims is shown to be part of just fear mongering in the Australian community against the Australian national interest. Whilst the Leader of the Opposition continues with that reckless scare campaign, we will continue with the job of growing the economy in the interests of working people.              </DOC>

  As usual the Leader of the Opposition is twisting things, talking down the Australian economy and twisting things. The one thing he has not gone to, that he did not want people to hear or know, is that the report he refers to deals with questions like the strength of the Australian dollar. Of course, the strength of the Australian dollar is bringing a transformation to our economy. It is a reflection of the strength of mining and the resources boom and in that sense, because we welcome the investment of the resources boom, we welcome the jobs, we welcome the opportunity for prosperity and we welcome sharing it around the nation. A high Australian dollar is a good thing. It also means in the eyes of the world that everything we earn and everything we own is worth more than it was before, and many Australians are benefiting from that by going overseas - some of them for the first time - because of the strength of the Australian dollar. But at the same time the strength of the Australian dollar is bringing changes to our economy, a patchwork effect in our economy, and the Leader of the Opposition has refused to indicate that factor in his question to me, preferring instead to continue his relentless fear campaign on carbon pricing.                              Despite the Leader of the Opposition's relentlessly campaign, the facts cannot be denied, and the facts are that the fundamentals of our economy are strong - unemployment is low, the inflation rate is within the Reserve Bank's band and we have strong public finances. We have an economy that is the envy of the world. We will continue to nurture this economy and grow this economy in the interests of working people, by continuing our investments in infrastructure, roads, rail, ports and the National Broadband Network; by continuing our investments in skills, now at almost double what we inherited from the neglect of those opposite, including the Leader of the Opposition; by ensuring that we cut red tape, working with the business community and through a productive process through the Council of Australian Governments; by continuing to work hard to keep our economy strong so that Australians have got the benefits of jobs.                              The problem for the Leader of the Opposition is that every time he raises his voice and asks people to cry out in fear, he thumps his head into an inconvenient fact, and that thumping will be at its loudest on 1 July when the recklessly fear campaigns of closed-down industries, towns wiped off the map, astronomical price increases and power increases of 30 per cent are shown to be the untruths they always were.               </DOC>

  I thank the member for Robertson for the question, because today's capital expenditure figures are great news. They do reaffirm the fundamental strength of the Australian economy and they are a resounding vote of confidence in the future of our economy. This is especially so given the amount of global uncertainty that is around. To see planned business investment going from strength to strength is a very big vote of confidence in our economy - businesses putting hard cash on the table to drive the productive base of our economy, to secure growth and to secure jobs.                              The figures are simply stunning. Total capital expenditure is expected to increase from a staggering $158 billion this financial year to a record $173 billion next financial year. In mining alone, business is planning to invest a staggering $119 billion in 2012-13. That is over 150 per cent higher than its level of just two years before and 13 times the level of investment before the first phase of the boom. So this is a very strong investment pipeline. We saw it again in the figures that came out last week, where we have this half trillion dollar pipeline of investment in resources alone. These figures are a reminder of the strength of our economy and they demonstrate that we are in a league of our own, because business is prepared to put cash on the table to drive jobs.                              So it is really difficult to understand why those opposite continuously come into this House and talk our economy down and then turnaround and bemoan the fact that confidence might be down. They go out recklessly talking down our economy day in, day out. We on this side of the House are really proud of our nation's economic performance. What motivates each and every one of us is to ensure that the prosperity and growth that we have is spread right across our community - that every Australian has a say and a stake in our future prosperity. That is of course why we are delivering tax cuts, increases in family payments, providing assistance to families in terms of education costs and so on. It is also why we are bringing our budget back to surplus, because this sends a really strong and clear message to the world about the strength of our economy.                              Today's data should be welcomed by everyone in this chamber. It is certainly welcomed by everybody over here, but never welcomed by anybody on the other side of the chamber. The Leader of the Opposition ought to put down his mud bucket and come out and welcome this great news for Australia.              </DOC>

  I say to the member for North Sydney, first, as usual, the question from the opposition contains a misrepresentation about the Australian carbon pricing scheme and the description of it as the 'world's largest'. That is a misrepresentation constantly restated by the opposition. I suggest to them that perhaps they get in contact with some of their sister political parties around the world, including the British Conservative Party, and have a discussion about things like putting a price on carbon. I suspect they should talk to them about what is happening in Europe and around the rest of the world rather than come in here and fearmonger in the way in which they do.                              On the ease of doing business in our economy, we continue to work to make sure that businesses large and small can prosper in our nation. We are working with small businesses through the instant asset write-off, something the opposition has repudiated because it would prefer the big mining companies to have the money, to give them back the minerals resource rent tax. We are working through the Council of Australian Governments to reduce red tape, through the seamless national economy initiatives - things that were too hard, left undone, neglected, and left by the wayside under those opposite when they were in government - and things like national occupational health and safety laws, which was something that was always too hard and too difficult for the opposition. We continue too to add to the ease of doing business through infrastructure investments, including very importantly the National Broadband Network, with a clear productivity benefit for businesses large and small and for our nation overall - something repudiated by those opposite; something that they would rip out of the ground and take away the associated productivity benefits.                              The Leader of the Opposition and the member for North Sydney continue their carbon pricing fear campaign, but I bet neither of them will come to the dispatch box today and guarantee that the claims that they have made will come true on 1 July - guarantee that the coal industry will shut down on 1 July; guarantee that the cement industry will shut down on 1 July; and guarantee that price rises will be astronomical on 1 July; guarantee that their claims about electricity pricing will come true on 1 July. In my last answer, the member for Bowman said, 'It is not about 1 July' - another clear sign that the opposition knows that its aggressive negativity is going to fall foul of the facts on 1 July and many members of goodwill opposite know that too.               </DOC>

  I thank the member for Melbourne for his question. I know that he is raising an issue that is on the minds of many Australians as result of the recent news about the decision in the UK on the extradition matter involving Mr Assange. Can I assure the House of the following: the Australian government is providing full consular assistance to Mr Assange, as it does for all Australian citizens. I am advised that Australian consular officials visited Mr Assange on a number of occasions during his period of detention in London and raised several matters of concern with prison authorities on his behalf. Australian consular officials have attended all of Mr Assange's court appearances, including yesterday's hearing.                              Since Mr Assange was released on bail, Australian officials have repeatedly conveyed offers of consular assistance through his lawyers, with whom they were most recently in contact yesterday. Swedish authorities have confirmed that any legal action against Mr Assange will be conducted in accordance with due process. As the Minister for Foreign Affairs has said today, at this stage we do not have any advice from the United States that there is an indictment against Mr Assange or that the United States has decided to seek his extradition. If at any stage in the future Mr Assange faces legal proceedings from the United States we would, for Mr Assange - as we would for any other Australian citizen - seek assurances from the United States in relation to due process. The Australian government cannot interfere in the judicial processes of other countries, but of course we will continue to closely monitor proceedings against Mr Assange and continue to provide full consular assistance to him.              </DOC>

  I thank my colleague from Lake Macquarie and the Hunter region, the member for Shortland, for her question, because we represent an area that is very important in the resources sector, and the fact of the matter is that the resources sector, the minerals industry, is set to prosper under the carbon price.                              Last night I had the opportunity at the Minerals Council dinner to sit next to an executive of Peabody Coal, who updated me on the company's $5 billion takeover of Macarthur Coal. That is the takeover that humiliated the opposition leader, because it was announced the day after he visited a Peabody coalmine and declared that carbon pricing would destroy the coal industry. The very next day Peabody announced a $5 billion takeover. His precise words about the future of the industry were: 'A carbon tax means death to the coal industry.' Yet the trouble is, the coal and minerals industries are experiencing record growth. The Bureau of Resources and Energy Economics has reported that there is over $500 billion worth of capital expenditure in the investment pipeline.                              Since the carbon price was announced, we have seen multibillion dollar takeovers, massive investment and new mine approvals. It is not just big companies that are investing; it is also many small investors -                                                                     Mr COMBET:                    including many members of parliament who have a lot of confidence in the future of the industry. In fact, since the carbon price was announced last February, and the start of the opposition leader's people's revolt started, many coalition MPs have actually bought shares in the industry. Now, the member for Wentworth is amongst them, but we would respect that because he knows the campaign run by the opposition leader is complete and utter rubbish, nonsense, false, a fraud and a fabrication. But it does include the members for Brisbane, Flynn, Stirling, Fadden, Bennelong and Kooyong. Not only that, when you have a look at the register, all up about 30 per cent of the members of the coalition are investors in the minerals industry. That is quite a few. We are sure of one thing: it does not show much faith in the member for Warringah's investment advice, does it?                              Publicly, their leader talks mining stocks down; privately, they snap up the investments. There might be a little insider trading strategy going on, but it demonstrates hypocrisy. If there were a TV reality show, Australia's Greatest Hypocrites, they would be the winners.              </DOC>

  Now, of course, we see revealed that the opposition cannot possibly sustain a debate on the economy - apparently cannot even sustain a debate on carbon pricing. They packed that in because they are doing so badly with their fear campaign in here because of the absurdity of it. They cannot ask another question about carbon pricing when the depth of their investment in the resources sector has been revealed.

In answer to the deputy opposition leader's question, as I have stated on a number of occasions in this parliament, I was fully briefed on this matter when I came back from Chicago. Until I had received all of that information, I was not in a position to assess this matter. I assessed it following that briefing.              </DOC>

We have heard how, in private, many of those opposite understand the facts and they make investments - they put their money where they really think things are going. They do not listen to the investment advice from the Leader of the Opposition.                              The facts are that under a carbon price Australia's economy will continue to grow, and it will continue to grow strongly. There will be 1.6 million extra jobs over the next eight years, and income per person will increase by $9,000 - all with a carbon price in place, all as we are helping nine out of 10 households with assistance through our household assistance package, and all while we are supporting jobs and the competitiveness of the economy with the program we have put in place to support businesses in the emissions-intensive and trade-exposed part of the economy.                              But of course, some people in this place still prefer a world of fiction. The Leader of the Opposition has been running around the country with his own special horror story, predicting doom and gloom. He has predicted the death of Gladstone, the death of the Latrobe Valley, the death of Portland, the death of the Hunter region - Illawarra, Kwinana, Whyalla, and the story goes on.                                                                    Mr COMBET:                    It reminds you a bit of the old Lucky Starr song from the 1960s, I've Been Everywhere. You know, 'Cabramatta, Parramatta, Wangaratta, Coolangatta' - but the punchline is, 'everywhere is doomed, man'. That is what he is - getting around, Lucky Starr, 'everywhere is doomed', it has all gone. But the fact of the matter is interest rates are coming down, unemployment is under five per cent, inflation is under control, private investment is at record levels, we have a AAA credit rating, a low debt-to-GDP ratio, budget surpluses across the forward estimates. But this does not stop the Leader of the Opposition.                              He predicts the death of manufacturing, the death of the auto industry, the death of mining, the death of the coal industry, the death of the nickel industry, unimaginable cost increases, unimaginable power price increases, apples, fruit, mincemeat, chops, T-bone steaks - all out of reach; there is no way anyone will be able to buy anything. There is doom for families, doom for pensioners, older people, younger people, babies, the middle-aged - they are all doomed. And none of it is true. No-one over on that side of the House believes him either. No-one believes him. They put their money where they think the markets are really going. His whole campaign is a complete fraud. As 1 July approaches he is going to get more and more desperate, because he will have no credibility left.               </DOC>

  I ask that Leader of the Opposition to address himself to some of the facts that I know he finds uncomfortable. He walks around making claims about carbon pricing: Norway's carbon tax on petrol, $64; Switzerland fossil fuels, $37; Sweden on heating fuels, $145; Ireland a carbon tax of around $24; Finland taxes on -                                                                     Ms GILLARD:                    In Canada, the province of British Columbia's carbon tax is around A$28. Those are the facts for the Leader of the Opposition. Of course, what he does not want people to recognise is that in South Korea they have just legislated to have an emissions trading scheme. California is moving to an emissions trading scheme. He does not want any of those facts recognised, because he wants to play his fear campaign. What he does not want recognised as well is that he stood alongside Prime Minister Howard in the 2007 election, when Prime Minister Howard promised that the emissions trading scheme that the Leader of the Opposition believed in then would be a world-class emissions trading scheme - more comprehensive, more rigorously grounded in economics and with better governance than anything in Europe - the platform he went to the 2007 election on.                              Since then, what the Leader of the Opposition has done is to decide that his narrow political interest is best served by fear campaigning. The problem for the Leader of the Opposition is that whilst it has been easy to run around the country making all of these huge claims about carbon pricing, it is not going to be sustained when it happens on 1 July. When the sun sets on 1 July and people are still digging coal, when the sun sets on 1 July and the prices in the shops are not astronomical, when the sun sets on 1 July and power prices have not gone up by 30 per cent, when the sun sets on 1 July and you can happily walk down the streets of Whyalla, what is the Leader of the Opposition going to say? He will have been exposed before the whole Australian community as someone who has been on a campaign of deceit for month after month after month just in his naked political interest.                                                                     Ms GILLARD:                    No amount of screaming or squealing by the opposition frontbench changes that simple truth. On 1 July every Australian will know -                                                                     Ms GILLARD:                    If the Leader of the Opposition believed any of these reckless claims, he would be guaranteeing them today and members of his team would not be investing in the mining industry.               </DOC>

  I thank the member for Banks very much for his question, because this Labor government does understand that families have a lot on their plates and can do with every extra bit of help possible. That is why we are delivering extra assistance through our household assistance package. I can inform the House that 1.6 million families have already received additional assistance in the last fortnight to help them with their bills now and their bills in the coming months. We know that every single one of those people on the other side of the House wants to claw that back from every single family - 1.6 million families you want to claw it off. That is also why this side of the House wants to deliver another increase to family payments, put in this year's budget by our Treasurer, to make sure that we deliver extra help to Australian families. This was once more opposed by each and every person on that side of the parliament. Of course, it is why this side of the House is also delivering the schoolkids bonus. Extraordinarily this week the member for Menzies has said that he thinks it is not that difficult, actually, to collect all your receipts. It just demonstrates how completely out of touch all of the people over there are. Listen to the families who complain about how difficult it is to collect their receipts, the one million families who are missing out because of the previous system. This side of the parliament will make sure that those one million families get the extra money they need and that they get it when they need it. That is what this side of parliament will do.                                                                    Ms MACKLIN:                    We know that this Leader of the Opposition has failed Australian families and is going to claw back the money that they have just received in the last fortnight. He opposes the schoolkids bonus and is going to take that off them. He is going to take the family payments off them. He has failed the leadership test for Australian families.              </DOC>

  To the member who asked the question, jobs will grow under carbon pricing. I refer him to the Treasury modelling. Jobs will grow under carbon pricing. He may have listened to the Leader of the Opposition's fear campaigning. He may have swallowed the line that whole towns will be wiped off the map, that there will not be coal mined anymore, that everybody will apparently be living in a cave with no electricity, unable to afford food - and the ridiculous stuff just goes on and on and on and on. The member may have swallowed the Leader of the Opposition's fear campaign, he may have done that, but it does not equal the facts.                              To the member who raises this question, I do understand that there is concern in his region about carbon pricing. I genuinely understand that. He would also understand that, as a government, we are working with his region, working through the implications and we are very determined that, unlike the time when the state Liberal government forced his region into a transition with no assistance and no support, we will be there working with the community because we want to see people having the benefit of jobs. If you look at the whole of the carbon pricing package you see jobs continuing to grow and you also see us working with specific industries and with specific regions.                              As we leave this parliamentary session we are moving towards a time where the truth about putting a price on carbon will become increasingly clearly, where people will see -                               _ the use of Question Time for its political impact, the opportunity given to Members to raise topical or urgent issues is invaluable. Ministers accept the fact that they must be informed through a check of press, television or other sources of possible questions that may be asked of them in order that they may provide satisfactory answers.                              The problem with this government, Madam Deputy Speaker, is there are no satisfactory answers.                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    Thank you very much, Madam Deputy Speaker, and I note that the younger members of the opposition backbench really like that point of order. In answer to member's question -                                                                     Ms GILLARD:                    Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. To the member who asked this question: it was clear from his point of order that in fact he is making some assumptions about what may or may not flow from a tender process that is underway. I would say to the member that he cannot make assumptions about what might flow from that tender process. But what he can safely assume, what he can always assume, is that this government will support jobs, this government will work with his region to support jobs, this government will work to keep growing the economy so that there are more jobs and, at the same time, we will be there providing households with assistance, because we understand that they are under cost-of-living pressure.                               We will leave to the opposition the fear campaigning, all of the game playing, the running around, the stunts - all the other kinds of trite and silly performances that we have seen in parliament over the last week - and we will get on with the job of running the economy in the interests of working people, something that the Leader of the Opposition and his team will never understand.              </DOC>

  I have been to a few G20 conferences and, as I have sat at the table, there is one thing that all the developed economies there around the table know - there is no stronger developed economy in the G20 than Australia. There is no stronger developed economy in the G20 than Australia. But, of course, what do we get here? Day after day, the opposition comes into this House - and goes around the community - and talks our economy down, deliberately insulting all those hard-working business owners and those millions of workers who have worked hard to make our economy strong.                              I have been asked by the Leader of the Opposition how many countries around the G20 table are putting in place policies to deal with dangerous climate change and creating situations where they can reduce their emissions. Seventeen of the G20 members, or 85 per cent, are putting in place emissions trading schemes at a national or subnational level. That is what is going on in the G20. I tell you what, if those on the other side were at Los Cabos, they would have been terribly embarrassed, because the G20 nations with developed economies and developing economies do appreciate the need to deal with reducing carbon pollution, and are putting emissions trading schemes in place at a national or subnational level.                              Let us just go specifically to some of the countries that are sitting around the table.                                                                    Mr SWAN:                    Madam Deputy Speaker, I am certainly happy to address it directly. Over the four years to July 2011, European carbon prices have traded in the range of $16 to $50. Now, what countries could there be around the G20 table who might be in that situation? There is France, there is Italy, there is the United Kingdom - there is a whole range of developed economies that are part of the European scheme. Those opposite will come into this House and maintain that the European price is low at the moment, but there is no reason it will stay there. What we do know is that carbon prices in the European zone have traded between $16 and $50 over the four years through to the middle of 2011. I think that answers that question pretty clearly. You on that side of the House are so embarrassed by your performance here. Countries around the world are putting in place emissions trading schemes, because those countries understand the importance of dealing with dangerous climate change.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Deakin for that very important question. All Australians have justifiable reason to be proud of the remarkable economic achievements of Australia. These achievements have occurred in some of the worst global conditions since the global financial crisis and, of course, the global recession.                              There is no doubt that when it comes to the developed world, the Australian economy is the standout performer. That is occurring at a time when many developed economies are experiencing mass unemployment, but there are more Australians in work here than there have ever been at any time in our history. There have been something like 800,000 jobs created in Australia since this government came to power - and that is in the face of the extraordinary challenges that we are experiencing emanating from Europe, particularly at the moment. And that is why the Prime Minister will make this point at the G20 meeting: how important it is, particularly for the policymakers of the European region, to put in place policy reforms which will boost growth and restore the sustainability of public finances in the eurozone. We need to see consistent and determinate action from the Europeans to ensure that growth is restored.                              No economy is immune from the turmoil in Europe, but here in Australia we have been a beacon of strength compared to what is going on elsewhere in the developed world. So much so that the Australian economy is now 10 per cent larger than it was prior to the global financial crisis. What a substantial achievement that is for Australia, when you consider that there is barely a developed economy that has got back to where it began at the beginning of the global financial crisis. Everybody on this side of the House cheers that performance.                              Those on the other side of the House were so embarrassed when the national accounts came out two weeks ago that they were in the stand booing the performance of the Australian economy. No-one was more disappointed with those results than the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Treasurer over there on that side of the House. On Tuesday, the shadow Treasurer said that the Australian economy was underperforming, and then on Wednesday he said the performance was extraordinary - what a backflip! Underperforming one day, extraordinary the next - but it was not a backflip, it was just a big belly flop, Madam Deputy Speaker. No-one was more embarrassed than the shadow Treasurer. On this side of the House, we celebrate the fact that we have the best combination of growth - strong growth, strong employment growth, strong investment - with contained inflation and interest rates coming down. This is a great result for Australia, but it is one that those opposite do not support and continually run down.              </DOC>

  The premise of the Leader of the Opposition's question is simply wrong. First of all he is claiming that the increases in electricity prices are principally the result of the carbon price. That is a lie, and it has been demonstrated to be a lie by the decisions that have been taken -                                                                     Mr SWAN:                    It is simply untrue -                                                                     Mr SWAN:                    I withdraw. It is simply untrue to claim that the great bulk of those price increases are the result of the carbon price. They are not and he knows that to be false. The fact is the impact on the average household from the carbon price when it comes to the average electricity bill is $3.30 a week. He knows that is the case, but he is out there not telling the truth about the impact.                              We have the Leader of the Opposition walking back from what he was saying a week or two ago about the impact of the carbon price. First of all he said it was going to put a wrecking ball right through our economy. The wrecking ball has gone out the door, and he is now saying it is going to be a python squeeze rather than a cobra strike.                                                                    Mr SWAN:                    Whether it is a cobra or a python, it does not change the fact that the Leader of the Opposition is a snake oil salesmen. He has been slithering around the country with a whole series of poisonous messages and a forked tongue telling untruths about the impact of the carbon price on electricity. That is what he has been doing, and it is not true. Now we have been told that this is responsible for what is going on in New South Wales. I tell you what: there is a choice in New South Wales. From the billions of dollars that Barry O'Farrell is getting from the electricity generators, why doesn't he give it back to the people of New South Wales in cuts to their electricity prices? They are the ones that are principally responsible for price increases.                                                                    Mr SWAN:                    The impact of the carbon price for the average household will be $3.40, for which they will receive average compensation of $10.10.              </DOC>

  In response to the member for Capricornia's question, scientists have been advising governments for a long period of time that climate change poses significant risks. To Australia the risks are from higher temperatures, changing rainfall patterns, more extreme weather events and rising sea levels. These represent serious economic risks - risks that you should take as serious economic risks. They will have impacts in many different industries across our economy, like agriculture and tourism, and in our society. Faced with that scientific advice, governments have a public policy responsibility to act. That is why this government is putting a price on carbon. The carbon price will create an incentive for the largest emitters of greenhouse gases in our economy to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, because it will require them to purchase a permit for every tonne of greenhouse gas that they emit. We are doing this not only in an environmentally effective way and an economically responsible way but in a socially fair and just manner. The price impacts will be modest at only a 0.7 per cent increase in the CPI. As the Treasurer and Acting Prime Minister just indicated, the modelling showed that the average electricity price impact will be $3.30 a week per household across the country.                              The Leader of the Opposition has previously described the price impact as 'unimaginable'. But the fact of the matter is that state pricing regulators are now confirming the Treasury modelling and they are consistent in the price impacts with that which was suggested by the Treasury modelling - $3.30 a week averaged across households. In South Australia, the average is just under $1.50 a household. The government is assisting households with an extra $10.10 a week through tax cuts, higher family tax benefits and increases in pensions. It is targeted to assist low- and middle-income households. The government is also funding the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission so that it can tackle businesses which try to rip people off with false claims about carbon pricing. Today the ACCC announced a carbon claims hotline to make it easier for people to make complaints. For those listening to the broadcast, it is 1300 303 609. The ACCC, importantly, points out that price increases associated with carbon pricing should be 'truthful and have a reasonable basis'. This is advice that the Leader of the Opposition should take.               </DOC>

  There are a couple of very simple points that I will make. All of those claims, at the end of the day, will be tested by the ACCC. We will have a test of these sorts of wild claims about pushing up prices. There are going to be a lot of them made. They have been made by those opposite. Of course, they would not pass the ACCC test if it applied to them; they have already failed it massively. But the fact is that the impact of this on the general inflation in the economy is less than 1c in the dollar. That is the truth of it. The fact is that most of the claims that are being made out there, particularly from those opposite, are inaccurate, but they can be put to the test if those claims are going to be made.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Lyne for his question and for his ongoing commitment to upgrading the Pacific Highway. Indeed, in the federal budget this year we did announce an additional $3.56 billion funding for the nation-building program and we indicated that it would be available for the Pacific Highway on a dollar-for-dollar matching basis. We also indicated that it was possible to achieve the joint objective, first put down by the Howard government, of a full duplication of the highway by 2016. So I was very disappointed by the fact that the New South Wales government has failed to step up to this opportunity in spite of the fact that year after year they made promises that they would deliver matching funds for the Pacific Highway and that they were committed to the full duplication by 2016. They failed to deliver.                              Premier O'Farrell, Deputy Premier Stoner and Minister for Roads and Ports, Duncan Gay, are all on the record time after time saying they would make it a top priority. They now say that the reason was a $5 billion cut in funding for New South Wales in terms of revenue expectations. But the fact is this government found space to provide increased funding in the nation-building program even though there has been a $140 billion drop in revenue as a result of the global financial crisis. The NRMA came out for New South Wales to match the funding. But it gets even worse. Last year, the state government Treasurer, Mike Baird, said in his budget speech:                              In its last Budget, the Commonwealth allocated $750 million _                              _ we are determined to provide the funds needed to match the Commonwealth offer.                              In their budget papers of last week that figure has become $468 million - that is, they have cut funding for the Pacific Highway by $300 million on what they promised just six months ago.                              What does the National Party do about this? The Leader of the National Party goes out there and says that 2016 cannot be achieved and he would be very disappointed if duplication was not completed by 2020. He would not commit one cent of additional funding for the Pacific Highway in spite of the fact that we have already committed $4.1 billion dollars. They committed $1.3 billion over 12 long years.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Banks for that very important question. The government has been absolutely open about the impact of carbon pricing on the general price level, and we know that it will impact on inflation by 0.7 per cent, less than one cent in the dollar. We know that the great bulk of businesses will do the right thing; they always do. But, for any business that is thinking of misleading claims about the impact of carbon pricing, they will have the ACCC down on them like a tonne of bricks, because it is simply not going to be justified for people to be making the sorts of claims that were made by the shadow minister before without that going through full ACCC scrutiny.                              It is the role of the ACCC to examine unreasonable claims. It is the role of the ACCC to put in place fines if those claims are found to be false and misleading, so that is what we have done with the ACCC. We have funded them. They are establishing a hotline that consumers can call, but not just consumers, because it could be other businesses that will become the victim of this process. It is there for business as well as consumers, on 1300 303 609. As I have said, we have put in place the appropriate funding, and there can be fines of up to $1.1 million - up to 1.1 million reasons for people not to rip off consumers or other businesses.                              The opposition have been running around the place, saying that the impact on prices is going to be unimaginable; they are going to go through the roof. We have also had a further Treasury study, and this new Treasury analysis once again shows a price impact of less than one cent in the dollar in the September quarter of 2012. This is a study of what markets are expecting from the impact of the carbon price, and it has confirmed the original Treasury modelling. But, despite all of this, we have got the opposition running around with their scare campaign, whilst at the same time you have got opposition backbenchers over there investing in coal companies, which the Leader of the Opposition tells us are going to be wiped from the face of the earth.                              The fact is - and this is a simple fact - that on 1 July we will see the true test of Tony Abbott's slippery scare campaign. The fact is that 1 July will reveal the Leader of the Opposition as a dodgy snake oil salesman - nothing but deceit and negativity.              </DOC>

  There is only one of side of this parliament where there have been misleading statements made. As I was making the point before, it is on that side, and if they were running a business the ACCC would be jumping all over them for the claims that they have been making. Under the Clean Energy Act, the Clean Energy Regulator is required to publish a list of liable entities on a public information database, and that database was updated for a second time last Friday. Organisations are placed on that that are expected, on reasonable grounds, to be liable for the carbon price mechanism in the relevant financial year. The number of entities published by last Friday is 294. It includes 34 local councils and resolves issues that had fallaciously been raised by those opposite. On current information available to the regulator the list comprises 294 entities. The regulator has also advised that it is in discussion with a number of other liable entities who want to use the act's provisions allowing them to transfer liability within their corporate group or amongst joint venture partners, and that will ultimately add to the list as entities access those provisions under the act. They are well aware, however, of their responsibilities under the act.                              In relation to the issue of synthetic greenhouse gases, it was the Howard government that introduced legislation regulating and placing a levy upon the importation of synthetic greenhouse gases, and the government has ensured that a carbon price applies to those cases.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Wakefield for his question. Pricing carbon is the cheapest and most efficient way of reducing our dependence on fossil fuels and tackling the challenge of climate change. It is a significant economic reform that will drive investment in clean energy and will help cut greenhouse gas emissions by 160 million tonnes in 2020. That is the equivalent of the emissions generated by 45 million cars. At the same time, by 2020 our economy is projected to grow by around one-third, with 1.6 million new jobs being created and average incomes rising by around $9,000 per person. Because we are a Labor government we are determined to implement this important change in a way that ensures we look after hard-working Australians. That is why we are increasing payments to families, pensioners and eligible self-funded retirees. That is why we are also providing tax relief to individuals and small businesses. That tax relief not only involves incentives like the instant asset write-off, but it also involves the tripling of the tax-free threshold.                              We know that there is a lot of misleading information being spread out there about the carbon price but, for the record, the carbon price will have an average impact of 0.7 per cent, or less than one per cent. That is less than one cent in the dollar. This is less than one-third of the impact of the GST when it was introduced by the previous government. Today the ACCC has launched a new hotline and an online forum where Australians will have the opportunity to report businesses that they suspect are making false and misleading claims in relation to the carbon price. We know that most businesses will do the right thing, but rest assured that those businesses who jack up prices and falsely blame the carbon price will have the ACCC to deal with. The ACCC, of course, has the power to seek penalties of up to $1.1 million per contravention. While the government is out there trying to crack down on misleading claims, the Leader of the Opposition has been out there making a few of his own. Not only is he out there making misleading claims, he now thinks it is okay to encourage businesses to do the same. We all know he has been out there saying that price rises would be astronomical and that they would be unimaginable. He said that the coal industry would be killed off and that Whyalla would be wiped off the map. We have heard it all before from the Leader of the Opposition - first it was going to be a cobra strike, but now it is going to be a python squeeze. The only thing we can guarantee is that it would take a python to squeeze a few facts out of the Leader of the Opposition.              </DOC>

  It is quite ironic that the party that has come into this House and refused to support overseas processing then comes in and complains about an increase in arrivals. It is just quite extraordinary. They have got a real hide to come into this House after they sabotaged the Malaysian arrangement, which would break the people smugglers' model and put us in a position where we can send that message to the region about not jumping on a boat. But having wrecked that, they then come into the House and make all these others claims that we have heard from them both here and outside the parliament. There are no plans for Cocos Island from this government, but I can tell you this: we are going to hold you accountable for your failure to support in this House legislation that would break the people smugglers' model.

  I am glad that there is a side of the House willing to ask a question on this issue. It was extraordinary that those opposite were willing to damage the national interest on this issue with their talk of a 'killer attack on the way' - and we have all been waiting with suspense. Well, a major announcement was made last week. Australia has always been one of the world leaders in national parks on land. Yellowstone and the Royal National Park were the first two national parks on land in the world. Last week Australia also became the world leader on national parks in the ocean. That is something that this side of the House is very proud of and it is something on which - despite the games that are being played by those opposite - it was thought there was a level of bipartisanship. The principles and the plan were first put forward under the Keating government, but the commitments that were made internationally were made at a conference known as Rio+10 in Johannesburg, where the representative of Australia was a bloke by the name of Kemp - Environment Minister Kemp - when the other side signed up to the words that it would be a 'representative, comprehensive and adequate network' of marine national parks.                              Since then the objections have come - with Ron Boswell, interestingly, becoming the person to commit the opposition to try to tear this apart - on grounds relating to the impact on commercial fishers and rec fishers. Let us look at each of them. In terms of commercial fishing, the impact on the gross value of production is between one and two per cent of the total industry - a one to two per cent impact. On rec fishing, which has been the principal issue that the Leader of the Opposition has identified as being his concern, if you are on the east coast and you are anywhere south of Mackay, you have got to get out in your tinny almost to Lord Howe Island before you find the first area where rec fishers are not allowed to go. Even if you are in Mackay you have to take your tinny for 400 kilometres before you reach Marion Reef. Once you get to Marion Reef you are banned from fishing on it but you are still allowed to fish around it - containing the key pelagic species that the rec fishers are after. We have a situation where, in relation to the fear campaign that they have wanted to run during the last 12 months, the time is up. Rec fishers know that this is in Commonwealth waters, a long way away from the areas that they want, and Australians are proud to be the world leaders in establishing protection of the oceans.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Leichhardt for opening up the cost blow-out that was administered by the other side. The bioregional planning that is taking place takes place under national environmental law - the legislation that was introduced by a bloke you might have heard of by the name of Robert Hill. Across our oceans there is one region that was done by the previous government - one region only - and that was the south-east. When the south-east was done that provided the template for displacement policy, and that is exactly the template that the government is providing and is following through on.                              Where was the member for Leichhardt saying, 'It is an outrageous package,' when it was being implemented by the Howard government? Where was the member for Leichhardt when he was wanting to claim -                                                                     Mr BURKE:                    Not only were the principles that were arrived at by the previous government in terms of displacement policy the principles that we are now following through on, but the science which was delivered by the previous government has formed some of the scientific foundations for the principles that we followed. The south-west would be the biggest one. On the south-west document there - the bioregional profile for the science - you will see a photograph of a bloke that you might recognise. He used to be the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources.                                                                    Mr BURKE:                    The member for Wentworth authored the document that provided the scientific foundation for the south-west. The previous government authored the policies that have dictated how we will run the displacement policies throughout this process. What we have got is a situation where the opposition have decided that environmental protection is something that they need to say no to at every single location. You will not find the member for Leichhardt talking about the impact on his electorate for the dive industry, because the dive industry, a cornerstone of the tourism industry in Cairns, has been out there backing this. They know that Osprey Reef in particular - one of the top five dive sites in the world - is now on the global map in a much stronger way because it has been given the level of marine protection that it always should have had. But no - no mention from the member for Leichhardt of the benefits for some of the tourism sectors in his own electorate -                                                                     Mr BURKE:                    because, when the option to say no is there, it is irresistible for them.              </DOC>

  I would like to thank the member for Makin for his question. Far from going it alone on carbon pricing, by next year Australia will be one of more than 50 jurisdictions with emissions trading schemes. In fact, 94 per cent of OECD members have or are developing emissions trading schemes at either the national or the subnational level. The Gillard government, of course, has had the wisdom and the foresight to anticipate these developments and implement an Australian emissions trading scheme as promised by the Howard government, supported at the time by the now Leader of the Opposition. Australia's scheme is going to position our country to take advantage of the opportunities presented by the inevitable global transition to a clean energy future, and that will enable our businesses to participate in international carbon markets, a very important opportunity. Indeed, the anti-price-gouging measures announced by the ACCC will help ensure our businesses do not have their competitiveness impaired by unscrupulous business behaviour.                              There are threats to replace this market based mechanism with a centrally planned direct action scheme, and those threats are undermining business confidence. The coalition is supporting a central planning scheme and Labor is supporting a market based mechanism, so there is the irony. All of this is being done not because of a commitment to central planning - although I sometimes suspect the opposition leader has one of those - but for the basest of political motives and for that irresistible urge on the part of the opposition leader to say no, no, no. The opposition leader is a self-declared weathervane on climate change. He supported an ETS. He supported a carbon tax. He said that climate change was 'crap' and he is now supporting central planning.                              Businesses want certainty about climate change policy, not weathervane economics. They certainly do not need the opposition leader and the shadow Treasurer talking down the economy. There were good figures out a couple of weeks ago. What do we have? 'Glum and Glummer' over there always talking down the economy. The only way of getting business certainty is to support the Gillard government's policy over the rank political opportunism of the Leader of the Opposition. Say goodnight, Glum and Glummer.              </DOC>

  I thank the honourable member for his question. I am not surprised, given the distance all these zones are from Mackay, that he has gone off any questions about recreational fishers and gone to the commercials. I am not surprised at all by that. He wants to know what the commercial impact will be. When the impact on the gross value of production is in the order of between one and two per cent then that will be the impact. Between one and two per cent is the impact.                                                                    Mr BURKE:                    It is interesting when we hear the claim from those opposite -                                                                     Mr BURKE:                    about to what extent we are already importing seafood that people eat, because it is true we import extraordinary amounts at the moment.                                                                  The member for Dawson then left the chamber.                                                                                    Mr BURKE:                    The question referred to the extent to which we import seafood. It is also important to remember that, as a trading nation, we also export massive amounts of seafood. If you go through our highest value fisheries like the southern bluefin tuna fishery, we export 98 to 99 per cent of that catch. You have large amounts of export with the WA rock lobster industry as well. So to simply look at the import figures and make those sorts of assertions does not add up and shows a lack of understanding of how the Australian fisheries industries actually work. We have had similar claims about the impact by references to a large trawler that is allegedly coming into Australian waters, whereas in fact that trawler has made no application to do so at all. What we have there is the classic example of a fear campaign running off the back of one to two per cent of gross value of production.                              If we had not conducted the level of consultation that we had and simply gone with initial maps then you would find a much larger impact. But, as the consultation took place around the country, we made sure that, from the initial scientific basis wherever we could shift a boundary to minimise the impact on commercial fishers but to get a similar environment impact, we made those changes - and we make no apology for doing that. Wherever it has been possible to improve the socioeconomic outcomes without in any way reducing the environmental outcomes, we have done that. We have done that with the direct opposition from those opposite, saying it should be science based and nothing else, but that is exactly the approach which has minimised the fear campaign that the member would otherwise be wanting to refer to.                              What he is saying there ultimately has no foundation when you get to your one to two per cent across your oceans figure. What we have is an environmental outcome that is world leading and done in a way that respects the people who want to get in a tinnie and fish and the people who make a living from fishing. You only have to look at the direct impact on those who have made comments, such as ones within the electorate of Leichhardt who have said what they want now is certainty to have the negotiation with government and know exactly what the outcome is. Tourism gets its benefit and you get the economic decisions made using the template that was given to us when the south-east was done by the Howard government.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Newcastle for her question. As she knows, this Labor government is all about giving back to ordinary Australian families. We are making sure that we help those families make ends meet.                              I can inform the House that in the last couple of weeks around 1.6 million Australian families have received payments to help them with their bills and to help them over coming months. This week families will start receiving the schoolkids bonus. It will go straight into their bank accounts and make sure that families get the help that they need with the costs of educating their children.                               What we know is that it is important to also give support to pensioners, and so for those who are on the pension we have had around 3.2 million Australian pensioners also get increases straight into their bank accounts over the last few weeks. If you are a single pensioner, you would have received $250, and $380 for couples combined, so that is already providing extra help for those pensioners. This, of course, is on top of the historic increases that this government has provided to Australian pensioners of around $150 a fortnight, making a huge difference to the needs of pensioners. From March next year, we will be providing ongoing and regular increases to pensioners.                              For a family that is on around $75,000 a year with two primary school-age children, this will mean that they will get around $1,000 in tax cuts and increased payments. For this family with two primary school-age children, they will also receive the schoolkids bonus and increases in family payments next year.                              What we know is that this Liberal Party is hell-bent on clawing this money back from families and pensioners. We already see it in Victoria, where the Liberal government is clawing back their school start bonus. We know Barry O'Farrell is doing the same to pensioners in public housing: clawing back the pension increase and forcing up public housing rents. We know that this Leader of the Opposition is going to do exactly the same: claw back the pension increase and claw back the family payment increase - just like his Liberal colleagues in New South Wales and Victoria.              </DOC>

  This is part of the scare campaign that is continuing from the Leader of the Opposition. The impact of 0.7 per cent, less than 1c in the dollar, is something that he continues to deny, and he continues to go around Australia running a scare campaign by exaggerating every possible price increase and then multiplying it by 10. So that is what we are getting in the case of councils. The fact of the matter is this: we will get through this introduction of a carbon price with a strongly growing economy, with strongly growing employment and with price rises which are entirely consistent with the Treasury modelling.                              We have had some further support today, because the opposition has been asking us questions about what has been going on internationally and whether our price here is inappropriate compared to what has been going on internationally. Overnight we have had the IMF put out a report which says the IMF confirms that a starting price for carbon pricing should be around the level set by the government in our Clean Energy Act. It goes on to say that Australia, again, is a very good model. The IMF says, yet again, that this is the least-cost way of putting a price on carbon pollution.                              What we have is the opposition leader going back to his wrecking ball tactics. He walked away from them last week, and then he said: 'No, it's not going to be a cobra strike. Now it's going to be like being squeezed by a python.' But of course what we know is that he is just like that old snake oil salesman out there selling his snake oil, telling everybody: 'It'll be good for you. Buy some more.' Unfortunately, the public are not buying this argument, not buying their exaggeration of the price impacts. We are providing adequate assistance to households to deal with price increases, including when it comes to councils. If councils are out there exaggerating the impact, they will be paying for that activity and they will face the results with their ratepayers.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Blair for that question because the Australian economy walks tall in the world, and that is something that everybody on this side of the House is very proud of. The national accounts show that the economy grew by 4.3 per cent throughout the year, faster than every other major advanced economy. Something like 800,000 jobs have been created since the government came to office, during a period in which we have seen the loss of 27 million jobs worldwide. The RBA has cut the cash rate to 3.5 per cent, which is lower than at any stage under the previous government. This means that someone with a mortgage of $300,000 is saving something like $4,000 a year in repayments compared to when those opposite left office. So what we have is impressive growth, low unemployment, record investment, contained inflation, low interest rates and strong public finances.                              We do understand that not everybody is the beneficiary, necessarily, of the mining boom, and that there are many people out there who are not in the fast lane of the economy. That is why we are so determined to spread the benefits of the mining boom right around our economy. That is why tomorrow 1.3 million families will begin to receive the benefits of the Schoolkids Bonus. That is $409 for primary school students and $818 for high school students. This is vital money to assist parents with the cost of education. We do believe on this side of the House that parents really deserve that additional assistance with the cost of education. It is going to be there when they really need it - at the start of the year and in the middle of the year. So this will give more families more support. It is a very big investment in education.                              Of course those opposite voted against the Schoolkids Bonus. They do not think that mums and dads of Australia deserve this vital cost-of-living relief. They do not trust the parents of Australia to do the right thing by their kids. They would rather give Gina Rinehart control of Fairfax than trust hardworking Australians with the cost of going to school.              </DOC>

  I thank the shadow Treasurer for that question, because we know that the main driver of electricity price increases in recent years has been investment in the upgrading of the network -                                                                     Mr SWAN:                    and there have been very substantial price rises in electricity over a period of years. For example, in the last five years nationally electricity prices have risen by more than 70 per cent without a carbon price. Of course, the rise in New South Wales has been 80 per cent. We do know that nationally the carbon price is expected to add up to nine per cent to the average household bill in 2012-13. The question I was asked was, 'Given the increases in recent years, what is it?' And that is the point I made. The great bulk of increases in electricity prices have nothing to do with the carbon price, and that is the truth of it. But, of course, you want to run around the country, running your scare campaign. The truth is that in New South Wales those generators and all of those companies owned by the New South Wales government are very profitable. If they want to use the $2 billion and $3 billion they are making out of those assets to give some relief in New South Wales, let us see Barry O'Farrell go and do that. This campaign from those opposite is completely dishonest. It is the work of a snake oil salesman going around the country saying that Whyalla will be wiped out and running around the country exaggerating the impact of the price increases.

  I thank the member for McEwen for his question, because he understands that families in Australia already have enough on their plates. That is why people on this side of the parliament want to do everything we possibly can to help them out, particularly to help out those families who have children at school. That is why the Acting Prime Minister and Treasurer has indicated that from tomorrow families will be receiving the schoolkids bonus directly into their bank accounts, and 1.3 million Australian families will get extra help. That will happen from tomorrow. Of course, from next year families will get their schoolkids bonus paid at the start of term 1 and the start of term 3, just when they need it. I can inform the member for McEwen that nearly 13,000 families will get the schoolkids bonus in his electorate, and more than 22,000 children in primary and secondary school in the electorate of McEwen will benefit. I have absolutely no doubt that those families and those children - like the two million children right around Australia - will be very pleased to see this extra money come into their bank accounts in the next fortnight.                              We know that families are already very busy people. Parents are running around doing things for their kids every day, and one thing they do not need is the extra job of keeping receipts. Those opposite seem to have absolutely no connection with reality when it comes to how busy parents are. In fact, the member for Menzies said that he did not think it was a problem at all for parents to have to keep their receipts. People on this side of the parliament understand how busy parents are, and that is why we are making this change and introducing the school kids bonus, and making sure that parents no longer have to keep their receipts. They will get the money straight into their bank accounts when they need it.                              It is not only that those opposite do not understand how busy parents are; they also do not understand the financial pressures that parents are under. That is why every single one of those opposite voted no to the schoolkids bonus, just as the Liberals down there in Victoria have just abolished the school start bonus and just like Barry O'Farrell. Barry O'Farrell wants to claw back the money that this government is giving pensioners. Barry O'Farrell is going to increase public housing rents. This government wants to help families. This government wants to help pensioners while all you can do is say no.               </DOC>

  I thank the member for her question. This is a very important economic and environmental reform. Successful countries in the 21st century will be those that use energy efficiently and those that are driven by renewable energy. This is a reform which has been recognised, as I quoted before, by the IMF as being absolutely critical to economic success -                                                                   The member for Canning then left the chamber.

This is confirmed by experience in many countries. The IMF says that comprehensive carbon pricing policies can effectively reduce emissions at least cost. And she goes on in that vein. This is the reason the government has put in place this fundamental reform.                                                                    Mr SWAN:                    In doing this, there is an impact on the price level in the economy, and that is why we are providing additional assistance to households and also additional assistance to industry. We do recognise that. But this is a fundamental reform to build the resilience of the Australian economy for the future. In the same way that the great reforms that were put in place in the eighties and the nineties have contributed to our resilience today, this is a reform which will do this tomorrow. This will build the strength in our economy by driving the investment that is required in energy efficiency as well as in renewable energy.                              Those opposite want to run around the country exaggerating its impact. They do not care about the impact of this; they just care about the politics. They want to run a scare campaign which bears no relationship to the facts. The fact is that the Leader of the Opposition -                                                                                                                                                       Mr SWAN:                    The Leader of the Opposition has been running around the country preaching doom and gloom - all of it is wrong. All of the material about its impacts is out there in our modelling and it is confirmed by decisions that are taken by regulators - for example, the electricity regulators. All of the rest of it is simply exaggerated hype and a political scare campaign. The Leader of the Opposition thinks that he can somehow get to government by not having any policies, just by running a fear campaign. The fact is, running a fear campaign will not be enough for the Leader of the Opposition, because the public are onto him. He is the most aggro, aggressive, political person in this country. It is turning off the Australian electorate -                                                                     Mr SWAN:                    Yes, and I do return to the point made by the IMF. The IMF finds that setting both an initial price and the pathway for future carbon prices is important to create stable incentives for long-term clean-energy investments. The IMF goes on to say that the level set by the government in our Clean Energy Act is a very good model and the price is appropriate -                 </DOC>

  The government is very strongly of the view that a healthy and robust media is essential to our democratic process, and what has been important to Fairfax right throughout the ages has been its charter of editorial independence. Certainly, we on this side of the House support that charter of editorial independence, but I notice it is opposed by those opposite. They can even say no to a charter of editorial independence. I wonder why that is the case. The editorial independence of media organisations goes to the very core of the quality of our democracy, because the quality of our democracy does depend upon transparency. It does depend upon fair and balanced reporting. Nothing could be more important to the quality of our political debate and our national conversation than having fair and balanced reporting. And to have fair and balanced reporting you do need a degree of independence at the editorial level to make sure that it is not unduly influenced by commercial considerations. This should be just common sense and something that should be supported by everybody in this House. But it is very obvious that those on that side of the House do not care about that at all.                                                                  The government has had a couple of reviews in place, the convergence review and the supplementary media inquiry, which has reported in recent times. Journalism is now challenged by great structural changes in technology, and of course this is impacting on media organisations. I will be very, very concerned if the purpose that Ms Rinehart has is to buy influence by buying more shares and junking the charter of independence. That is what I am very concerned about and that is what the government is concerned about, particularly given the record of Ms Rinehart in calling for a greater say, not just in the national debate but also in terms of policy outcomes - the way in which she has pushed her views about getting rid of the MRRT, for example, and the way in which she has managed to get the opposition over there on side for a tax cut for her and Clive Palmer. So we are very concerned about all of those matters, and we are concerned that what will happen in this process is that that charter of independence will be lost. I certainly call on Ms Rinehart to explain, very quickly, to the Australian people what her intentions are and whether she will or will not support a charter of editorial independence                  .                              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Petrie for her question. She is very, very focused on the education that her constituents are able to secure as a consequence of the spending initiatives that this government has made in education, and I know that she, like all on this side, has a strong focus on education in her constituency and in her electorate. The fact is that raising a family can be a costly business and, when it comes to kids and to school, things like school uniforms, excursions, music lessons, extra books and so on - all of these things add up to the cost of raising a family. So I am proud to be able to provide this update to the House, because on this side we take cost-of-living pressures that families face and the education costs that they face seriously. That is why the government has delivered a schoolkids bonus.                                                                  It was voted against by the Leader of the Opposition and those opposite, but the fact is that from tomorrow $1.3 million Australian families will get a much needed boost to their budget to help with school costs, because we have replaced the education tax refund with the new schoolkids bonus. People might not know that about 80 per cent of people who were eligible for that education tax refund were not getting their full entitlements, but now it is guaranteed that families who are entitled to family tax benefit A will get the schoolkids bonus. Before June ends, we will see $409 for each primary school kid and $813 for each secondary school kid going into people's accounts. Before the end of the month, two million kids around Australia will benefit from this, and then from January next year the schoolkids bonus will be paid twice a year: once before term 1 and once before term 2. That is a guaranteed payment so that families can meet the costs of education pressures that they face.                                                                                  It is well known that the opposition derided this initiative by the government. The Leader of the Opposition was fretting about which negative line he could run on this particular initiative, and he came up with the fact that he was worried about it and he opposed it because Australian parents were going to blow it on the pokies. It is a direct quote of Mr Abbott that Australian parents would blow it on the pokies. All I can say to that is that Australian families make hundreds of decisions every week about how best to support their kids, particularly their kids who are at school. Australian families know what cost-of-living pressures are about, and they know that a schoolkids bonus will help them meet those cost-of-living pressures, particularly as the kids are starting school and then halfway through the                   year. We are committed to delivering this schoolkids bonus because we know how important education is. Shame on the opposition for opposing it and on the opposition leader for not trusting Australian families with the interests of their own children.                                                 </DOC>

                                    I most certainly do not accept his characterisation of that program at all. Here we are again with another -                                                                     Mr SWAN:                    I do not accept that characterisation whatsoever. The fact is that this government's commitment to education is there for all to see in terms of the resources that have been put in in recent years, all of the efforts to lift the quality of teaching and all of the additional resources that have been provided to disadvantaged schools. We are absolutely proud of what we have done in the area of education. I do not accept that characterisation for one minute and, from our point of view, we will continue to do everything we possibly can to lift the quality and standard of education in our country, which is already high.                              We understand, particularly given the global developments that are occurring and developments in our region, that we have to do more - and we will continue to do that. We are proud of what we have achieved in education.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Makin for his question. I am asked about forecasts about the impact of carbon pricing. Of course, that renowned forecaster of doom, the Leader of the Opposition, has claimed repeatedly that the cost impact would be 'unimaginable'. He has called it 'a deadly threat' with ramifications that are 'unthinkable' - it is beyond human capacity to think of what the implications could be! What nonsense; what rubbish. He has gone around the country saying all of this when it boils down to a very simple proposition: we are pricing carbon because it is the most economically efficient way of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and of Australia playing a fair part in international efforts to tackle climate change, and all he has done is go around spreading rubbish. We know the cost impact. It was carefully modelled by the Treasury. It is 0.7 per cent impact on the CPI - less than 1c in the dollar - and, of course, the government will assist households with an average of $10.10 a week provided to households in assistance.                              Now that we are turning from the coalition's fiction into fact about carbon pricing, it is instructive that state Liberal governments handing down their budgets are also providing forecasts of the impact of carbon pricing. The Victorian government's budget last month forecast that the carbon price will increase the CPI by 0.5 per cent in 2012-13; the Western Australian Barnett Liberal government in its budget said that it would be 0.7 per cent, which is bang on the Treasury forecasting; in the New South Wales budget - guess what? - it is entirely consistent with the Treasury modelling of 0.7 per cent impact on the CPI.                              So here we have state coalition governments and state Liberal premiers completely repudiating the rubbish and nonsense that the opposition leader has spread around this country, just as the backbenchers ignored his warnings about the doom and gloom and the death of the coal industry and instead snapped up the investments. That is what they were doing while he was forecasting the death of the industry. Just as that was happening, state Liberal premiers are also abandoning all of the rubbish that has been spread. He is trying to run away from all these things. We can see the new campaign emerging - it is putting fear into people about 2050. It is all rubbish, and, at the end of the day, you will have no credibility left whatsoever.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for his question, because the government does not apologise for its commitment to carbon capture and storage technology - not one bit - and I believe that some of the reportage of the institute has been exaggerated. The fact is that the development of carbon capture and storage technology is one that is going to be difficult, but it is one that we must absolutely do. It takes an enormous amount of research, it takes an enormous number of partners around the world to put together the right combination of people to get the outcomes that we deserve. So this institute, I believe, has done good work.                                                                    Mr SWAN:                    What we are seeing here yet again is the fact that the climate change sceptics opposite do not even accept the basic science of climate change. Therefore they cannot come to the table to have a sensible discussion about what we must do not only in terms of putting a price on carbon but also driving the essential technological development that we need for the decades ahead. Carbon capture and storage is an area where, as one of the largest coal exporters in the world, we do need to make some very substantial progress. As an economy we produce a lot of coal and we export a lot of coal. We have a very big interest in developing carbon capture and storage technology. That is precisely what the institute is doing. It is not something that those on the other side of the House understand or appreciate, but from our point of view we will not be deterred from meeting the challenges of dangerous climate change and supporting our very important coal industry.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Fremantle for the question. She has been a very strong advocate of protection of marine life and has been a very strong advocate in leading to the announcements which were made last week. In those announcements, there has been a lot of focus on what has happened on the eastern side of the country. It is important also to focus on the benefits in the south-west.                               In the south-west, for example, if you are a rec fisher, you refer to this feature as the Rottnest Trench. Environmentalists refer to it as the Perth Canyon. It is a canyon underwater that is larger than the Grand Canyon that, up until now, has had no level of formal protection over it. In taking into account that it is a popular rec fishing site, there are three different heads of the canyon. One of those three heads has gone in as a marine national park; the other two have remained available for recreational use. Similarly, in the area of Geographe Bay further south - a very popular rec fishing site - we have made sure that the marine national parks have been put in places that are away from the principal boat ramps there.                              While I give full credit to the member for Fremantle for her advocacy and the question that asks me why this protection is necessary, I think there are others who have made the arguments very strongly as well. I read from a page that used to be available through a link on the internet - that has now been taken down - calling on the federal government to take action by creating larger marine sanctuaries which would protect Australia's marine life and its habitat. It says:                               'Australia's coastal waters are filled with unique marine flora and fauna, particularly in the south west coastal waters of Western Australia, and it is important that we encourage the protection and preservation of our marine ecological environment,' Julie said.                              There was a photo of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition holding a 'Save Our Marine Life' sticker. I will not wave it around. I think it is important that I table it, though, because, even though the link has been taken down, they forgot to take down the article so it is still there on Google. You can copy but you cannot delete!                              The protection arguments have been well made throughout the whole of the 'Save Our Marine Life' campaign. It has been a major issue in Western Australia, and across the benches over there is a reason why the only opposition we are hearing is being run from backbenchers. There is a reason why it is Ron Boswell who is purporting to make statements on behalf of the entire coalition, without a single frontbencher backing his position in, and that is because scattered across the back bench of those opposite they know that we should be rightly proud of being the world leader in protection of the oceans. Just as we led the way on national parks on land, Australia leads the way on national parks in the ocean.              </DOC>

  First of all, to deal with one premise in the preamble where it was allegedly a major issue for rec fishers in Darwin, if you get in a tinny from Darwin, you travel 680 kilometres before you get to the nearest place where you cannot drop a line.                                                                    Mr BURKE:                    If you get in the average tinny and you reach that area 680 kilometres away, you probably do not have enough petrol to get back. As with all national parks, there is a management obligation that comes with the establishment of national parks, and  just as there are a number of national parks on land managed nationally by the director of national parks, so too does the director of national parks, when these are finally proclaimed, take on the obligation to see that they are properly managed. In some cases this will be done jointly with state governments. In some cases this will be done through relationships with the commercial charter recreational sector. In some cases, for example, where you have got the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority on the exact same boundary as the Coral Sea, there are a range of options as to how the surveillance is actually done. But of course when you establish a national park at sea, just like when you do on land, you take on obligations for management - of course you do. That is where you have opportunities in these areas to be able to use a range of different initiatives, which is the same thing that happens whenever marine parks are established in state waters.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Chifley for his question and for his ongoing advocacy for the 5,000 pensioners in his electorate who rely on public housing. The government is making significant payments to support pensioners as part of our clean energy household assistance package. These payments will support low-income public housing tenants in adjusting to the cost-of-living impact of the carbon price. Single pensioners will receive $338 and couples will receive $510 combined a year to help transition with these reforms. This is in addition to the historic federal government investment in New South Wales in delivering 7,000 new social housing homes and repairs and maintenance to 31,000 homes in that state.                              I have been asked by the honourable member whether there are any obstacles to delivering the money to pensioners. I am afraid that there are obstacles. I was indeed shocked last week when Premier Barry O'Farrell announced he was going to take away some of the money that was going to be provided by this government to help 84,000 New South Wales pensioners in public housing. Barry O'Farrell's decision to hike public housing rents means a single pensioner on maximum rate will now pay an extra $84.50 a year. This is nothing more than a cash grab by the New South Wales government from age pensioners, from pensioners with disability and from veterans in our community who rely on public housing in New South Wales. Barry O'Farrell has shown more regard for lining his own pocket than for helping pensioners in that state.                                                                    Mr BRENDAN O'CONNOR:                    I withdraw. But in relation to that I call upon Premier Barry O'Farrell to reverse this terrible decision that is impacting on pensioners in New South Wales and I call upon Premier Newman and Premier Baillieu not to take the money from the 36,000 pensioners in public housing in Queensland and the 46,000 pensioners in public housing in Victoria. I call upon those two premiers not to follow the despicable path of the New South Wales government by taking money away from pensioners - those who are marginalised, those who deserve our support, those who in many cases have helped build this country. What a terrible, despicable act by the New South Wales government! They have an opportunity to reverse the decision, and I call upon Barry O'Farrell to do just that.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Parramatta for her question about decent entitlements for Australian workers. It is no secret that this government stands firmly on the side of decent entitlements for Australian workers, and there are many examples of this government's actions in recent times which support this proposition. There is the increase in superannuation for 8½ million Australians, from nine per cent to 12 per cent. Indeed, in the electorate of Parramatta, 26,400 people who earn less than $37,000 a year have had the tax they pay on superannuation abolished - so on the superannuation they get there is no tax. That is fantastic news for these 26,400 electors in the member's seat.                              But of course there have been other things to support the entitlements of Australian workers. Again, we should remember the schoolkids bonus - the bonus which those opposite did not even trust parents to spend in the interests of their children. We had supplementary payments to people on allowances - $1 billion to help people make ends meet. But, of course, one of the best things that we have done to help the entitlements of workers is the Fair Work Act. An extra 2½ million Australians are now free from the tyranny of being unfairly dismissed and not having any legal remedies at all. Six hundred thousand workers get injured each year in Australia and they are able to bargain about make-up pay courtesy of this government. These are all very good entitlements.                              But I was also asked: what are some of the challenges to the entitlements of people? Let me talk about some of the most vulnerable Australian workers in Australian society - those who get injured. I am afraid I have to report to the House that in New South Wales, as we speak, the New South Wales Liberal government is going after seriously injured workers. Is there no victim that the Liberals in this country will not hunt down and hurt?                                                                    Mr SHORTEN:                   Those opposite do not like hearing this. The House will be alarmed to know that if you are severely injured in New South Wales, after 12 months in New South Wales, that is it.                                                                    Mr SHORTEN:                    If you are policeman in Orange who was injured standing up for people and protecting law and order, your medical injuries miraculously stop, according to 'Dr O'Farrell' and those Liberal quack doctors, at 12 months. Under the Liberals, if you take longer than 12 months you lose your medical benefits.                              My concern is this: if you cannot trust the state Liberals to look after injured workers, how can you trust their brothers and sisters, the federal Liberals, to look after Australian workers? Not a chance - no trust. We do not trust you on workers.               </DOC>

 I thank the honourable member for his question. I note that last week he said there were 'urgent and important' questions to answer but he forgot to ask any of them yesterday. It is a matter of public record that Mr Ali Al Abassi had been under investigation by the Australian Federal Police for some time. The Australian Federal Police did not have enough evidence to successfully refer him for prosecution and nor were there grounds - or are there currently grounds - to cancel his visa on character grounds. The member for Cook has been alleging all of last week -                                                                     Mr BOWEN:                    The member for Cook said all of last week that Mr Al Abassi had been on the movement alert list for some time and that I should have known. But again he has not checked his facts - and he has not checked his facts today and he has taken out of context things said by my ministerial colleagues. Mr Al Abassi was under AFP investigation and was on the watch list known as PACE, which is an AFP watch list. He was placed on the movement alert list, managed by my department, on 7 June.                              The member for Cook has said that the minister for immigration should be aware of every person who is on the movement alert list. Given that there are 639,000 identities on the movement alert list and 1.71 million documents on the movement alert list, I look forward to him implementing that policy if he is ever minister for immigration.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Reid for his question. Of course he knows that the carbon price will cut greenhouse gas emissions to assist us in making our contribution towards tackling climate change. Of course it will also drive investment in clean energy so that we can build a stronger economy for the future. We expect that the carbon price will have an impact on prices on average of around 0.7 per cent, or less than one per cent. Of course that is about a third of the impact that the GST had on prices when it was introduced. Power prices are expected to go up by around $3.30 per week on average, but because we are a Labor government we are determined to implement this reform in a way that is consistent with our values, and that is why we have provided a comprehensive household assistance package.                               For instance, the member would be interested to know that in the Reid electorate we are providing relief to more than 10,000 families and 18,000 pensioners, and we are delivering tax cuts to 53,000 taxpayers earning up to $80,000. We have provided the ACCC with $12.8 million to protect households from businesses that jack up the prices and falsely blame the carbon price for those price increases. But of course we note that many Australians have been doing a fair bit for some time to try to cut their power expenditure and reduce their emissions. But now, of course, it is good to see public campaigns such as One Big Switch that are empowering Australians to get a better deal out of electricity retailers. We know that the best thing for consumers is to have the power to take their business elsewhere to get a better deal.                              While we are delivering assistance to households and consumers are out there trying to do their bit, those opposite are trying to do their best to do harm. Under the Liberal government in New South Wales, in the short time that they have been in power we have seen electricity prices rise by 17 per cent in the past year. What have we seen in Western Australia? In Western Australia we have seen electricity prices increase by 57 per cent since the Barnett government came to power. You cannot blame carbon pricing for those increases, and these were increases that were inflicted upon the Australian people without a comprehensive assistance package.                               We know that the Leader of the Opposition has said that, if he gets elected, he will rip away the assistance that we are providing to households. He will rip it away. But the Premier of New South Wales is not waiting till the next election, because he already has his hand in the pockets of the most vulnerable people in New South Wales, ripping away their assistance by jacking up public housing rents. I think we all know the Leader of the Opposition has made an art form out of his relentless negativity, but if he were fair dinkum about price rises then he would pick up the phone, call Premier O'Farrell and say no to these increases.                                                                  Leave not granted.                              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Corangamite for his question. He knows that we are incredibly proud of our record of reform when it comes to ensuring that child care is more affordable, more accessible and of higher quality under this government. As the Prime Minister has recently made very clear, we are always working towards the next steps to assist Australian parents just a little bit more as they juggle their work and family commitments.                              Some of those opposite want to talk a bit at the moment about increasing childcare fees. That is fine, but they are only telling part of the story, because the truth is that you cannot talk to the Australian public about increasing childcare fees without also talking to them about the government's subsidies, which have increased even more. So if we want to have a look at childcare fees, let us do it based on the facts. The facts are that this government increased the childcare rebate from 30 per cent, as it was under them, to 50 per cent under our government. The facts are that, whilst they were happy in government to have the cap on that childcare rebate at $4,354 per family, we increased it to $7,500 per family per year.                              We know that this has had a huge impact on childcare affordability. In fact, as a result of our increased investment, analysis shows that a family that was paying 13 per cent of their disposable income on their childcare fees in 2004 is now paying 7.5 per cent of that income under our government now. Of course, we are not saying that it is not already an additional burden on families to pay their childcare fees, but what we are saying is that we have a record of putting triple the investment in the hands of Australian families, because we know how important childcare affordability is.                              As well as affordability, we know that parents want peace of mind when they drop their children off in the morning so they can be confident that they are being well cared for, and that means having the highest quality services possible. We in Australia now have more kids in care than ever before, attending child care for a greater number of hours. We also have an abundance of research which shows how critical these early years are and that 90 per cent of brain development occurs in these early years. So we believe that we need to get it right, and that is why we have worked with every state and territory government of all political persuasions to lift the quality of care and ensure that Australian children have the best qualified staff and the best attention and supervision going forward.                              Those opposite can peddle their half-truths. They can tell the public half of the situation. But, in contrast, we are getting on with the job of making real investments to ease families' cost-of-living pressures and are getting on with the job of making real reforms to give Australian children the best quality childcare services possible.              </DOC>

  The opposition leader is continuing with his campaign of deception and deliberately spreading misinformation around our community. As I explained to the House yesterday, nationally the carbon price is only expected to make up nine per cent of an average household bill in 2012-13. Those are the facts and, as I pointed out to the House yesterday, over the last five years electricity prices in New South Wales have increased by 80 per cent. We had this extraordinary statement from the shadow Treasurer yesterday about the alleged impact of a carbon price. This is what he said: 'Electricity prices in Sydney have risen 66 per cent since federal Labor came to power.' That is just a straight lie and it is just so typical of the misinformation being put around by those opposite. We on this side of the House -                                                                     Mr SWAN:                    I withdraw, Madam Deputy Speaker. But I ask this question: how can the power price rises that Sydneysiders have -                                                                     Mr SWAN:                    How can the price rises for electricity, of 80 per cent, that have been in place for over five years in New South Wales be the responsibility of a carbon price? How could that be? It is not the case. We have explained the impact of a carbon price overall - less than 1c in the dollar; 0.7 per cent. But of course there will be an impact on the overall price level, small as it is. That is the reason we are putting in place assistance to families and assistance to industry. That is what we have been doing. So we stand by all of the modelling that we have put out, including when it comes to electricity prices. We understand that there is a price impact and that is why households are getting assistance. The average household assistance is over $10 per household. The average electricity price increase is just over $3. That is a fact. There is nothing that those on that side of the House can do when they come in here to deny those essential facts.                              The Leader of the Opposition will say anything, do anything and wreck anything for political power. He is constantly talking down our economy, he is constantly misrepresenting the impact of a carbon price and it just shows how unqualified he is for high office.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Robertson for her very important question. The G20 Leaders Summit in Los Cabos is a very important meeting, particularly given the volatility in the global economy and the situation in Europe. In Los Cabos the G20 did resolve to put in place work which will support recovery in the global economy and also to progress a solution to the problems in Europe. Importantly, it is united in its resolve to support growth and jobs. Growth and jobs are what this government has always been about. The G20 agreed to the Los Cabos Growth and Jobs Action Plan, which recognises that you can support growth and jobs and maintain fiscal discipline at the same time.                              The G20 also moved to limit the continual fallout of the problems in Europe. Of course, European leaders resolved and committed to take all necessary steps to safeguard the integrity and stability of the euro area. The G20 did welcome those commitments. What we must do is limit the impact of the contagion to the rest of the world from the troubles in Europe. These are all positive steps. The fact is that Greece and Europe still confront very substantial economic challenges and they will not be resolved overnight. We will need to see further action by European leaders over the months and years ahead. Australia is not immune from these global developments, but we certainly face this global turbulence from a position of strength.                              One reason we have this position of strength is that at the height of the global financial crisis and the global recession we acted to protect jobs and growth. As a consequence of that our economy, almost uniquely amongst the developed economies, avoided a recession. We have not suffered here the impact of high and prolonged unemployment and all of the capital destruction that we have seen across other developed economies. The result is that we have the best combination of impressive growth, low unemployment, record investment, contained inflation, low interest rates and strong public finances. The result is that our economy is 10 per cent bigger than it was prior to the global financial crisis, where many other developed economies are still smaller - not even getting back to that most basic starting point.                              This is a record that everybody on this side of the House is proud of: 800,000 jobs in the period that we have been in office, and interest rates coming down - someone with a $300,000 mortgage is now paying $4,000 a year less than they were when the Leader of the Opposition was last in government. We are proud of that record. We think it is something that should be celebrated in this country and not talked down by those opposite.              </DOC>

  The information I have, which may be somewhat different from what the shadow Treasurer has quoted, says that analysts believe the price for European permits may increase by $8 in 2013 and rise to around $22 to $23 by 2015 if the EU legislates current policy proposals. So he has been caught again misrepresenting the facts.                              As I have said in this House on a number of occasions, the Europeans are reconsidering their approach to their emissions trading scheme. They are looking at making changes. What that means is that we could well see a rise in carbon price in the European Union. But this goes to the very heart of the deception that those opposite continue to put forward in this House. There is no figure they will not bend. There is no policy impact they will not exaggerate in their attempt to deny the science of climate change and to go on and deny that the price impact of the carbon price in this country is 0.7 per cent - less than 1c in the dollar.                              So, once again, the shadow Treasurer has been caught out with his figures. The Thomson report does not necessarily prove the point that he was making. What we say is that we have the right balance between market incentives and giving business certainty. And what we saw from the IMF yesterday was another endorsement of our scheme.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Capricornia for her question because, from today, 1.3 million Australian families will get some extra help with the costs of sending their children to school, extra help that families need when they have to pay out for those new uniforms, shoes, schoolbooks, computers, school excursions - all of us know the list goes on and on. And, from next year, families will get the help when they need it: at the start of term 1 and the start of term 3.                              This is going to include families like the family we visited this morning. The Acting Prime Minister and the member for Canberra and I went to Hughes Primary School and met with a family - Elizabeth and Anthony and their children Liam and Lauren. This family will receive $818 straight into their bank account this fortnight to help them with the costs of their children's education. We, of course, are sure -                                                                     Ms MACKLIN:                    We have comments from those opposite about paying it back. Well, one thing is for sure: you are going to take it back off them.                                                                    Ms MACKLIN:                    We know that those opposite will take it off them if they get the chance.                                                                    Ms MACKLIN:                    That is exactly what will happen - each and every one of you want to take this money off them. What we know is that this Leader of the Opposition talked about families having confidence in him - saying that, when it came to judging him, they could judge him on his record. He talked about the forgotten Australians, the forgotten families. Well, we know who forgot them! Each and every one of you forgot about Australian families when you voted no to the schoolkids bonus. And of course the member for Sturt has let the cat out of the bag today and made it absolutely plain that if you ever get the chance you will rip this money off families - claw it back; take the money out of the pockets of families - because it is only this side of the parliament that wants to help families. You just want to rip the money off them.              </DOC>

  I do not necessarily accept the validity of those figures at all. Just as we have had, day in and day out in the parliament, we will continue to have gross exaggerations made by those opposite. The fact is that the Leader of the Opposition has gone around this country claiming that the price rises will be unimaginable. He has said we will see the end of Whyalla. He has said we will see the destruction of whole industries.                                                                    Mr SWAN:                    As I have said repeatedly in this House, the impact on the overall price level is 0.7 percent, or less than 1c in the dollar. But it is true that it will have an impact on some costs and it will be more in some sectors than in others. That is why the government has put in place a Household Assistance Package as well as an assistance package for industry. We have done that because of those costs. But for those opposite to come into this House and exaggerate those price impacts day in, day out is simply reckless and irresponsible. What they are determined to do is talk down our economy and the hard work of millions of workers and tens of thousands of small businesses in our country.                              The Leader of the Opposition is now running away from some of his more outrageous statements about the impact. We have heard about how we are going to have not a cobra strike but a python squeeze. But, of course, we all know that the Leader of the Opposition is simply a snake oil salesman slithering around this country making all sorts of poisonous accusations.                                                                    Mr SWAN:                    I will conclude by making this point. We are providing $15 billion of household assistance over four years. That is $15 billion in the pockets of customers walking through the doors of Australian businesses.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for New England for his question. I have very much enjoyed my visits to his home town and I have been able to witness his strong commitment to his local community. My office met today with the National Rural Health Students Network - and they are in the gallery today as my guests, if they want to give us a wave. I am terrifically pleased that we have students of such high calibre who will be the doctors and allied health professionals of tomorrow.                              We know that people who come from, or study in, rural and regional communities end up working in and staying in those communities. James Ross, from Orange, is here. He is studying medicine in Geelong. He grew up in a regional town and he understands the particular needs of a regional town. Ben Croft, from Tamworth, is here. He is studying pharmacy in Armidale and, no doubt, he will one day be filling scripts for the member for New England. And also here is Simon Reid, from Wollongong, who is studying medicine in Sydney and wants to return to coastal New South Wales when he graduates. James, Ben and Simon grew up in regional Australia and want to study there. We know they will be returning to those country towns in the future and serving the needs of those towns.                              It is also great that, as well as coming down here to lobby, they have been taking time out to talk to more than 300 high school students to encourage them to think about a career in rural and regional medicine. We have a very proud record of support for rural and regional students in Australia. We fund 17 rural clinical schools. We fund the John Flynn Placement Program to support 300 students each year to undertake training in medicine, nursing and allied health, encouraging the recruitment and retention of health professionals in rural areas. This year we are offering 241 clinical placement scholarships for allied health students undertaking a placement in rural or remote locations. We are investing in medical, nursing and allied health student accommodation through the Health and Hospital Fund, with $2.6 million in Ballarat and $5.2 million in Alice Springs. As the member for New England indicated in his question, we also have a HECS reimbursement scheme for medical students. We spent $7 million on the scheme last year, with 530 participants working in rural communities. Of course, I am happy for my colleague the Minister for Higher Education to look at whether that scheme should be extended to allied health professionals also.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Moreton for the question. When the government announced the carbon price package last year, we were upfront about the modest impact of the carbon price on electricity prices - $3.30 a week for the average household, an average increase of up to 10 per cent. We were upfront about it. It is a modest impost compared with the massive increases in electricity prices around Australia in recent years. They are increases that have nothing to do with carbon pricing; they are mainly driven by investments in poles and wires. They are increases from which the state governments are reaping dividends. These are the figures. In New South Wales in the last three years, power has gone up by 55 per cent; in Victoria, 37 per cent; in Queensland, 39 per cent; in South Australia, 43 per cent; and in Western Australia, under the Barnett government, a whopping 57 per cent, or $552 a household. As prices have skyrocketed in New South Wales, the O'Farrell government has been happily accepting hundreds of millions of dollars from households when they pay their electricity bills. Last year the O'Farrell government took in $640 million in dividends, and it is forecasting over a billion dollars in dividends paid by householders through their electricity bills for next year.                              All of that has happened without as much as a bo-peep from the Leader of the Opposition. All that has gone on, with not a word from the Leader of the Opposition - a 55 per cent increase in power bills in his home state of New South Wales and a billion dollars taken in dividends next year. That is all fine, not worth a word. But a much smaller increase which is offset by an average of $10.10 a week in cash assistance to households that comes from carbon pricing is unimaginable! It is beyond human conception, that increase of 10 per cent! It is the wrecking ball! It is the death of industries! It is the cobra strike! It is the python squeeze! It is the end of the world - a 10 per cent increase, $3.30 a household, matched by $10.10 a week in assistance. But a 55 per cent increase in New South Wales and billions ripped off New South Wales householders by the O'Farrell government is just like cuddling a teddy bear! That is nothing! That is not worth a word from the Leader of the Opposition, who has nothing to say about the rest of the price rises around this country. This is the only government that is helping people with rising electricity prices. From today the schoolkids bonus starts being paid, and it makes a difference.               </DOC>

  I think there is a very clear explanation for this, because this is just another cash grab by the Liberal Party in Brisbane. That is what it is, and I think the Brisbane City Council are going to have a lot of trouble demonstrating the claims that they are making. For example, $11 million is claimed to cover a rise in inflation of 0.7 per cent, but that is based on the average price increase for households, and councils will be subjected to smaller price increases - and the list goes on.                              The fact is that those opposite are going to come into this House every day and exaggerate the impact of the carbon price because they do not have any policies in particular; they just have this reckless negativity of the Leader of the Opposition. But, of course, as we get closer to 1 July he starts to run away from his previous positions. First of all the price rises were going to be absolutely through the roof. Then Whyalla was going to be destroyed. Then whole industries were going to go down the gurgler. They are clearly not, because what we have here is not a Leader of the Opposition; we have a snake oil salesman who is slithering around the country peddling his falsehoods because he does not have any policies and he is trying to cover up the fact that he wants to rip out the tax cuts that are coming in on 1 July and to get rid of the tripling of the tax-free threshold. He has also said -                                                                     Mr SWAN:                    The fact is that what we have here is a political strategy They do not care what damage they cause to confidence or to the views of Australians about the importance of dealing with dangerous climate change. They will say anything and do anything to justify their political position, which is rapidly declining, because as we get to 1 July he is going to be running away from all of the extreme claims that he has made. He will be simply a hollow man in a cul-de-sac without any policies at all, because then he is going to have to explain to the Australian people what he is going to do about a tripling of the tax-free threshold and what he is going to do about the increase in the family payments. He has already indicated today that he is going to knock off the schoolkids bonus. We had that also -                                                                     Mr SWAN:                    On this side of the House we have put in place a long-term economic reform which will enable our economy to prosper in the 21st century, which will drive investment in energy efficiency and in renewable energy. Prosperous economies in the 21st century will be those that are energy efficient and are more driven by renewable energy. That is our motivation for our long-term prosperity. The motivation of those opposite is simply politics, not national interest but political self-interest.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Hindmarsh for his question and for his honesty when it comes to the reality of dealing with climate change and meeting the challenge of putting a price on carbon. We saw just a couple of weeks ago the Leader of the Opposition once again talking down a business in the regional aviation industry, preaching doom and gloom and disaster when it came to the impact of the carbon price. He has got some form on this.                              I am asked specifically about Whyalla. On 27 April last year the Leader of the Opposition said:                              Whyalla will be wiped off the map _                              He went on to say:                              _ Whyalla risks becoming a ghost town, an economic wasteland if this carbon tax goes ahead                              It was like a scene from Mad Max. Special Minister of State, Gary Gray, will be over in Whyalla. He is a Whyalla local. He will be going to visit his mum on 30 June to check that everything is still okay when 1 July comes through.                              For a place to become a ghost town, people have to leave it. One of the ways you leave a town is on a plane. So, as transport minister, I thought I would check on what has been going on in Whyalla. I found an article in the Whyalla News dated 4 June. The mayor of Whyalla Jim Pollock said, 'We are processing something like 75,000 passengers a year.' So I asked my department how do the numbers compare? And I found out there were 68,000 in 2011 and 64,000 in 2010. The year before there were 62,000. It is growing!                              The opposition might say that is all the people leaving town, but I checked. As many people are going into Whyalla as are leaving Whyalla. I checked also on what the local region was saying about Whyalla airport. They are making representations to the minister for regional development to expand the airport. They want a new terminal. They want to fix the runway. There they are out in Whyalla promoting the growth of a town that the Leader of the Opposition said would be wiped off the map. But now we see he is running from his over-the-top comments faster than he ran from the parliament. He could not get out of the parliament. He was beaten by the gazelle over there.                                                                    Mr ALBANESE:                    He is quick, but the Leader of the Opposition will have to run a bit faster from his comments because he says businesses will be shut down, he says towns will be shut down but on 1 July we will see the reality.              </DOC>

  I do not think we should be surprised that there is a lot of dodgy modelling around. There are a lot of untrue claims being made and we have heard a lot of them in the House today. But the truth will be there from 1 July onwards and then we will be dealing with the reality of a carbon price: what impacts it will have on the overall price level and how it will flow through our economy. We had a very good endorsement yesterday of the carbon price from the IMF, which goes through endorsements we have had and work that has been done by groups as diverse as the Productivity Commission, the OECD and many other international agencies. The fact is our economy will continue to grow, and grow strongly. Our economy will continue to generate jobs and it will continue to generate prosperity. But, in the interim, those opposite are hell-bent on the scare campaign we are witnessing today and it is not surprising to anyone on this side of the House that they are joined in that by some sections of industry, but it does not make it right. The fact is that our economy will grow strongly, wealth will be created and we will be a better country because we will be more energy efficient and more powered by renewable energy. That is a good thing for all Australians. But we have seen all sorts of exaggerations over the past couple of days. This is what the shadow Treasurer had to say yesterday:                              _ electricity prices in Sydney have risen 66% since Federal Labor came to power. This increase because of the carbon tax just adds further to cost of living pressures _                              I rest my case.              </DOC>

  I would like to thank the member for her question. She has always taken an interest in people in life who are doing it hard. I think it is important that this House notes that if you are unlucky enough to be injured at work in Australia you had better hope there is a Labor administration in charge of your safety laws and your compensation. Let me use, for example, the case of John.                              John works in the Territory at a remote mine site. In November 2009 he was injured in a motor vehicle rollover. He fractured his C2 disc, dislocated C6-C7 in his vertebrae, was airlifted to Darwin, then to Adelaide for immediate surgery. He received rehab after surgery, returned to Darwin and, thankfully, has returned to full-time work with the rehabilitation and support he has received under Comcare. He has received incapacity payments, medical and specialist treatment, surgery, medication, travel by air ambulance, aids and appliances, rehab assistance and physiotherapy. He continues to receive this under a federal Labor government.                              He can receive incapacity payments if, despite his best efforts to return to work, he remains unable to return to work in the future due to his injury. He can apply for and, indeed, receive permanent impairment payment. If you have to have an injury, which is bad, at least have it under a Labor government. But there is an obstacle -                                                                     Mr SHORTEN:                    and if people from the opposition call out 'pathetic', wait till they hear what their New South Wales Liberals are doing. Let us take the real-world case -                                                                     Mr SHORTEN:                    We don't need to exaggerate. We don't need to make up tall tales. We just tell the truth here.                                                                    Mr SHORTEN:                    Ashley is a nurse. She injured her back in 1998 moving a patient. She tried to go back to work and in 2004, again at work, exacerbated the back injury. She has struggled with chronic pain for the last 14 years. Without the support she received under the old workers comp system in New South Wales she would have had to retire, she would have been on the DSP, and people would have given up on her. Unfortunately, now she lives in New South Wales with a Liberal government. Where she is injured, unless she passes the 20 per cent whole person impairment test - which is unlikely - that is it in 12 months time: no medical help and put on the scrapheap. What this means for the 600,000 Australians who get injured is: you cannot trust the New South Wales Liberals to look after you if you get injured at work.                              Look at those people opposite - they think it does not happen. Six hundred thousand people get injured, and you cannot trust the Liberals if you are injured at work in New South Wales. What is more, you cannot trust the federal Liberals because they will not rule out doing the same thing nationally. They do not have an IR policy or a workers comp policy and we do not trust them to look after workers.               </DOC>

  Thank you very much, Madam Deputy Speaker. Well, can you believe it!                                                                    Mr BRADBURY:                    Can you believe that the Liberals would come into this place and talk about the truth of pamphlets being distributed in the Lindsay electorate? Can you believe it?                                                                    Mr BRADBURY:                    After the shameful examples of what they did back in 2007 in distributing that shameful pamphlet, can you believe it? The Leader of the Opposition shakes his head, but we all recall that when the pamphlet was being distributed -                                                                     Mr BRADBURY:                    Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. I am pleased to be able to respond to the question in relation to this government's strong economic record. We are returning the budget to surplus and we will be delivering a surplus of $1.5 billion - that is what we forecast - and it will be a surplus that will increase over time across the forward estimates. That is because we are determined to manage this economy in the interests of working Australians.                              It is always good to receive a question about the strength of the Australian economy from those opposite. You do not often hear them come into this place and talk about how strong the economy is. When they are out there, like the member for North Sydney talking to an international audience on Bloomberg, they will tell you how strong the economy is, or like the Leader of the Opposition when they are over in the UK speaking to an international audience, they want to claim their piece of the credit, but when it comes to coming into this place and acknowledging the realities of a strong economy, it is a different story. We have taken the responsible economic decisions to ensure that we are returning the budget to surplus.                                                                  The member for Cowan then left the chamber.                                                                                    Mr BRADBURY:                    For the member for Mitchell to come into this place and brandish a document, a pamphlet that has been distributed in the Lindsay electorate, after the shameful experience of what this country was subjected to during the 2007 election campaign when his cronies out in the Lindsay electorate decided to spread racial hatred in pamphlets -                                                                     Mr BRADBURY:                    When it comes to truth, I will let the facts of the record stand for themselves. We are delivering a strong economy for the Australian people, an economy that will ensure we spread the benefits of the boom so that all Australians get their fair share.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for La Trobe for her question because today the schoolkids bonus will start being paid to around 1.3 million families around Australia, benefitting over two million kids who are going to school in those families. A typical family will receive around $760 but larger families will see more. From next year the schoolkids bonus will be guaranteed - an amount of $410 per primary school student and $820 per secondary school student paid in two tranches at the beginning of term 1 and the beginning of term 3. This is because we know that Australian families do face education costs, whether it is books, whether it is track shoes for kids who are going to sport or whether it is uniforms that kids are growing out of. This will provide much needed support for Australian families raising their kids and getting them through school.                              We know that the Leader of the Opposition discounted the schoolkids bonus by simply saying that Australians families would blow it on the pokies. We know that the shadow Treasurer called it a sugar hit. Even today, we had the member for Sturt weighing in and confirming that the opposition has been totally opposed and would be opposed to providing support to families in this way when he said, 'I would be very surprised if the schoolkids bonus made it through a coalition policy process.' I am not so surprised because all they seem to be able to do on that side of the parliament is say no. In this instance they have said no to providing support to Australian families who make hundreds of decisions every week about how they want to support their kids - enabling those families to be able to support their kids with education costs.                              I am asked how the schoolkids bonus builds on significant investment this government has made in school education. It is absolutely the case that this Labor government has made significant investments in school education, almost doubling what was spent previously by the coalition. But we have also transformed schools. So when the member for La Trobe goes into schools in her electorate she can see the benefits of some $110 million spent on 118 projects which have benefited 61 schools in her electorate.                              For the first time, we have a national curriculum. For the first time, we have transparency in information on the My School website. For the first time, we have a concerted effort to lift investment in digital education by providing computers for kids in schools as well because we know, in the 21st century, those skills are so important. Opposite us in this House is a coalition that has opposed the schoolkids bonus, that wants to take $2.8 billion out of education funding. But primarily it is a coalition that does not understand that we need to significantly commit ourselves to education in this House and that is what this government is doing.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for his question. I will say it again: the government is not building or operating an immigration detention centre in the Cocos Islands and has no plans to do so, which is what I said yesterday. But when they arrive, if they are not flown off the island, they have to be accommodated for a short period somewhere on the island. That is just common sense. The government has no plans to build a detention centre on the island: I want to repeat that. This is just part of the attempt by those opposite to demonise asylum seekers and conduct their political campaign.                              Yesterday I was asked a question about rodents on the island. I am not surprised to get that sort of question because those opposite spend so much time in the sewer. I was not surprised at all. The truth is there are no plans to build a detention centre in the Cocos Islands.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Bass for his question. I know that my fellow Tasmanian understands the importance of the schoolkids bonus to the 6,900 families in his electorate and, indeed, to the more than 35,000 families in Tasmania who will be receiving this payment. I am sure the member for Bass will be interested to know that there is a total of $37 million going to families in our home state of Tasmania. This money is to help parents with the cost of essentials like schoolbooks and uniforms.                              We know, and parents know, that sending children to school is not cheap. This Labor government knows that. As the Minister for the Status of Women I know from talking to parents that it is often the mums who do the running around to get the kids ready for the start of the school year. We know that they do not want to have to keep track of their receipts or fill out paperwork at tax time to get some help with the schoolkids' costs. But it seems the only people who do not really understand that are those opposite, because we have had the member for Menzies here say he thinks it is actually not that difficult to collect the receipts for the amount of money which is required. I think he needs to get out a bit more - he should come down to my electorate and talk to the mums at the school like I did last week. They were telling me about how difficult it is to keep track of things at the start of the school year - the school shoes, the uniforms, the books and the pencil cases. Then they have to work out which are eligible deductions, keep the receipts and remember where they put them.                              This government is responding to the needs of mums and dads. We understand that they are busy. Before the schoolkids bonus, 80 per cent of families were missing out on their full entitlements under the education tax refund, and this Labor government does not want families to miss out on their entitlements - the $410 per primary school child and the $820 per secondary child. That is why we are making this change from today, and people will start receiving the schoolkids bonus in their bank accounts from today. From next year, they will receive it in two payments, in January and in July. We know that this will be great for working families, particularly for those mums who are going around at the beginning of the year helping their families out. One million families will now benefit more. A typical family will get $720 extra a year.                              But let us be very clear about what the Leader of the Opposition is saying. He does not think that mums and dads can be trusted to spend this money appropriately. He does not understand that they are busy. He does not understand that they actually make decisions day in, day out for their families. Those opposite voted against the 1.3 million Australian families who will start receiving this bonus from today, and that is because those opposite do not think those families should have the bonus. They have voted against it. They speak negatively about it. The member for Sturt today let the cat out of the bag - their plan is to scrap it.              </DOC>

 I think the member for Cook has come back to clean up the problems from yesterday, Madam Deputy Speaker. The fact of the matter is that when a visa is cancelled, or when a visa cancellation process is begun, it is a very serious matter, and it must be handled with due consideration of the facts and the case in hand. When you are considering a visa, it must be based on all the evidence before you. I asked my department to thoroughly examine the claim made by Mr Al Abbasi and then, after thoroughly examining that claim and in coordination with sister agencies overseas, the notice of intention to cancel announcement was made.                              There is a right way and a wrong way to cancel a visa. If you cancel it the wrong way, not only can the visa be reinstated but also the taxpayers of Australia can be required to pay very substantial compensation to the individuals concerned. If you want a tip on how not to do it, check with the member for Menzies.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Banks for his question. The member for Banks has an enduring interest in electoral matters and in electoral reform, and is of course Chair of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. The bills to which he refers, if passed, will enhance the integrity of the electoral system, which depends on upon a sound electoral roll.                              The Australian Electoral Commission estimates that today up to 1.5 million Australian electors are not on the electoral roll - that is, 1.5 million eligible Australians are not on the electoral roll. The ABS estimates that there are 15.7 million eligible Australians but only 14.2 million are currently on the roll. That significant gap represents an average of 10,000 people in every federal division. That gap challenges the very concept of universal adult suffrage, which has been the cornerstone of Australian electoral practice since before the creation of our Constitution. Indeed, the Constitution requires that members of this place be directly chosen by the people.                              The AEC acknowledges the gap. It has launched the Year of Enrolment and it has been working hard to get as many people as it possibly can to correct their enrolment or to enrol. Transactions have increased to 20,000 new enrollees or enrolment transactions per week since that campaign started. The two electoral amendment bills listed for debate in the other place, if passed, will help the AEC further close the gap for the 1.5 million electors. The bills respond to concerns from the AEC, which has for many years urged successive parliaments to take action to enhance the integrity of the Australian electoral roll. The bills will give the AEC the capacity to update the roll from third-party sources of information. These third parties will include the Australian Taxation Office, motor registries, and state and territory electoral commissions - effectively harmonising the Commonwealth electoral roll with those rolls in New South Wales and Victoria.                              Since the equivalent changes have been made in New South Wales and Victoria, around 100,000 new electors have been added to the roll in New South Wales alone; in Victoria, the number is probably closer to 10,000. We know that these measures work. We know that they improve the integrity of our electoral system and we know that they produce a better roll.                              It is important to emphasise that these reforms are a safety net. The bills will not change the grounds upon which a person becomes entitled to enrol and vote. I call upon all those members opposite to support these measures as the bills retain the integrity safeguards of the current system and more. The bills are fundamental to maintaining strong levels of electoral participation and ensure the strength, resilience and integrity of our electoral law. I commend them to the House.               </DOC>

  I think the best example of an endorsement that would matter to the honourable member is this one:                              To ensure the future health of the Coral Sea, the Government's final plan must be strengthened: the proposed marine national park needs to protect more reefs and more of the deep waters that provide a blue highway for whales, turtles and other ocean giants.                              _   _   _                              This is one of the biggest public consultation responses in Australian conservation history. The enormous show of support includes school children, recreational fishers, divers and tourism businesses.

Peter Lindsay used to be, as best as I remember, a member of parliament on that side who had a good understanding of the pristine nature -                                                                     Mr BURKE:                    If the honourable member believes the Liberal-National Party is not a representative organisation, I will concede the point!              </DOC>

  I thank the member for La Trobe for her question. Indeed there is a great deal of support for the National Broadband Network out there - the National Broadband Network, which people know will transform communications not just in terms of overcoming the tyranny of distance between ourselves as an island continent with a vastly spread population but also with our neighbours in the fastest-growing region of the world, right here in Asia. That is why we want to bring Australia into the 21st century after the 19 failed plans of those opposite and develop an appropriate national broadband network.                              Yesterday up in the Federation Chamber I had the opportunity, as the minister representing Senator Conroy, to hear representations about the National Broadband Network. Members will not be surprised that the backbenchers on this side of the House were pretty keen on the NBN, but what was surprising was that some people on the other side were pretty keen as well. The member for Forde was pretty keen on the National Broadband Network. That did not surprise me that much; I do not know him that well. But I must say I am surprised by the question of the member for Mitchell earlier on in parliament today which shows he pays attention to pamphlets that go out to electorates. He might like to pay attention to his own pamphlets. Here he is, Alex Hawke MP, federal member for Mitchell: 'Mitchell misses out on NBN'. 'The following suburbs: Baulkham Hills, Beaumont Hills, Bella Vista, Box Hill, Kellyville, Maraylya, Northmead, North Rocks, Rouse Hills and the vital Norwest Business Park.'                              So they come in here, they vote against it, they rail against it, they offer it up in savings even though it is off budget because it is an investment that will deliver a return to the government, but they get basic economics wrong. They are in here bagging it, but out there in their electorates the member for Mitchell is at the forefront saying, 'Give us the NBN.' You cannot have it both ways.                              This Leader of the Opposition runs, but he cannot hide, and we will hold him to account over the NBN, over the price on carbon and over all the other scare campaigns. We will also hold the Three Stooges to account for the $70 billion black hole.                                                                    Mr ALBANESE:                    I withdraw.              </DOC>

  I thank the Leader of the Opposition for that question. He has continued his long misrepresentation of the impact of the carbon price on electricity prices. I have not seen the letter, but I certainly will study it and look at it very closely. But I made the point in the House yesterday that Treasury modelling shows that nine per cent will be the increase for the average bill. That has been there in the Treasury modelling, and it has been what has been put forward by the energy regulators around the country in the last few months.                              I also went to great lengths to say to the House over the past couple of days that, if you take, say, the state of New South Wales, over five years there has been an increase in electricity prices of something like 80 per cent in that state. That 80 per cent increase has nothing to do with carbon pricing. The increase in New South Wales has been exactly in line with the Treasury modelling, but we had the shadow Treasurer going out and saying that these big increases in New South Wales were all the result of the carbon price, a blatant misleading of the parliament.                              The fact is that the opposition have no interest in the facts. They will quote any amount of dodgy modelling. They came in yesterday, talked about the Master Builders of Australia and quoted a figure which assumed a carbon price of $46 in 2020, as opposed to the $29 price that we have in our modelling. The truth is that the overall impact on prices is 0.7 per cent - less than 1c in the dollar. The truth is that our economy will continue to grow strongly with a carbon price, and we have seen the IMF backing the design of our carbon price just this week. On top of that, we have the opposition coming into this House and crying about the cost of living but then coming in and voting against the Schoolkids Bonus.                              The truth is that there will be an impact on prices from the carbon price. It will be 0.7 per cent on average. It will be greater in some areas, like electricity prices, and less in some other areas. But the opposition will continue to come into this House to run its scare campaign. We have seen the Leader of the Opposition running away from his earlier predictions that Whyalla would be wiped from the face of the earth. We have seen him running away from his predictions that the price rises are unimaginable. He is walking away from all of those things. He has now moved to the python squeeze. As I have said on a number of occasions, he is nothing more or less than a snake oil salesman.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for that question because, amid all the international gloom and negativity that is about, we should never miss an occasion to speak about how fantastic our country is. We do face challenges - no doubt about that - but we should take great pride in what a dynamic, diverse and ambitious country we are.                              Today we have the 2011 census out, and it marks 100 years since the first census. Of course, we have seen dramatic changes in our country over that 100 years: in our size, in the shape of our population and in the composition of our households, and, of course, enormous change in our way of life. The census highlights these changes that are underway. I think that what it says is that if we are a competent and ambitious country, we have to deal with change; and when we have dealt with change successfully we have become a stronger country. It has been one of the great success stories in terms of developed economies, the way in which Australian governments and the Australian people have reformed our economy to make it stronger for the future; always looking to the longer term, particularly to putting in place longer term reforms.                              Of course, those on the other side of the House resist change all of the time. They go out with their wrecking ball and oppose fundamental changes which have brought great strength to our country. But we on this side of the House embrace change. We understand that reforms are needed to keep ahead of the curve of history. That is why we on this side of the House are referred to as progressives. We believe in progress. Of course, we believe in being drivers, not passengers.                              We believe that equity and prosperity in a country and in a society are something that you have to work hard for and fight for. That is why we have put in place fundamental reforms over the years: pricing carbon pollution, reforming mining taxation, reforming aged care, reforming national superannuation and reforming the hospital system. That is why I am so proud that yesterday this parliament passed the budget, not only bringing the budget back to surplus but once again paving the way for fundamental reforms that make our country a better place and reforms which will mean that we stand out in the world. Reforms like the National Disability Insurance Scheme go to the core of the budget. So passing this fair-go budget last night shows that this country is getting on with the job of reform and staying ahead of the curve of history. That is something that we should all celebrate.              </DOC>

  I thank the Deputy Leader of the Opposition for her question, because I, like everyone on this side of the House, have always believed in pricing carbon - in putting in place an emissions trading scheme to do that. That is what we are doing with a fixed price for three years.                              Of course, there was once a time when those opposite believed in an emissions trading scheme as well - until the current Leader of the Opposition got rid of the former Leader of the Opposition, the member for Wentworth. We are getting these hysterical claims from the opposition about the fact that there will not be any investment, that the economy will not grow and that price rises will go through the roof, and they are disproved day after day after day. This is what the opposition leader had to say recently -                                                                     Mr SWAN:                    We have had many of these wild claims; one which in fact said that there will be no new investment. Well, what we have today is an announcement from Rio Tinto - an additional $4.2 billion to expand iron ore output. And we also have a pretty good statement from the head of Shell, which is investing more than $30 billion in Australia. This is what the chief executive has had to say:                              Shell as a company is actually very much advocating that we need a price for carbon on the worldwide basis and we want that to be on a market mechanism.                              So all of these predictions that a carbon price is going to kill investment, that it is going to wipe out Whyalla - all of these things are just untrue.                              But what they do is talk down our economy. Those opposite talk down our economy every day, and that is an insult to the hard work of tens of thousands of small business people and millions of workers in this country. We on this side of the House understand that putting in place a price on carbon pollution will drive investment, particularly in energy efficiency and renewable energy. That is what prosperous economies in the 21st century need; that is why we are behind it. It is in the history of reform that makes us on this side of the House progressives and you on that side of the House reactionaries, because we understand what must be done for the future so we leave our country a better place for our children and our grandchildren.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Fremantle for her question. Of course, strong economic management is important, and our economy is one of the strongest in the developed world, with low unemployment, contained inflation and low net debt. With a record pipeline of investment and half a trillion dollars worth of investment coming into the resources sector, our economy is one of the strongest in the developed world. And we are returning the budget to surplus in 2012-13 and we will be doing that in a way that spreads the benefits of the mining boom.                              I am pleased to say that, far from the commentary that we hear from those opposite, this House has already passed a number of significant budget bills. These bills will ensure that we spread the benefits of the boom to hardworking Australians. We have already passed the appropriations bills and we have passed the schoolkids bonus but, of course - no thanks to those opposite - we have always passed a number of important and sensible savings measures. But, of course, those opposite have no interest in supporting families and they have no interest in supporting responsible economic management and returning the budget to surplus.                              This week we have seen those opposite come into this place and oppose a number of key corporate tax revenue measures. These are important measures that are about protecting the tax base, and they have opposed them. They are measures like the cross-border transfer pricing rules. These are important rules that will ensure that, where corporations seek to shift their profits offshore to avoid paying tax in Australia, we will have rules in place to ensure that they pay their fair share.                              Those opposite came into this place and opposed these reforms.                                                                    Mr BRADBURY:                    Now, if they were serious about opposing these reforms, they would not just come in here and vote against them. What they would do is, they would tell those taxpayers that they would reverse these measures if they are ever elected. The problem is that if they do that then their $70 billion black hole will become $7 billion bigger, because that was the size of the revenue protection measures that they came in here and voted against - the hypocrisy of them - and then they came in and foreshadowed the fact that they will vote against our sensible reforms, to the withholding rate, when it comes to managed investment trusts. They say that they are opposed to a taxation rate of 15 per cent. When they were in power, it was not 15 per cent; it was 30 per cent. We all remember how they fought tooth and nail to oppose our efforts to lower that tax rate. Now they come in here and they cry these crocodile tears. If they are serious, they will make a commitment to repeal these reforms if they are ever elected, but that of course will lead to a $7 billion black hole on top of their $70 billion.                              The opposition leader talks a lot about a wrecking ball but the only wrecking ball Australians have to worry about is the wrecking ball to their budget.               </DOC>

  I thank the member for Ryan for her question, because what we are seeing here from the Brisbane City Council is nothing more and nothing less than a cash grab, and they are attempting to do this under the guise of carbon pricing. That is the truth of it. It cannot be justified. It is a rort for the Brisbane City Council. The mayor of Brisbane should be ashamed of what he has done, because the truth is that what he has done does not stand up to scrutiny. It is not a fair way to describe the costs of the carbon price and all he is doing is ripping off ratepayers in Brisbane.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Deakin very much for his question. As he knows, there are so many families, so many pensioners, across Australia who right now are benefiting from this government's decision in the recent budget to spread the benefits of the boom. We certainly know that these Australians are not in the fast lane and they do appreciate the additional assistance that is being provided.                              I can inform the House that -                                                                     Ms MACKLIN:                    Since the schoolkids bonus started yesterday, around 370,000 families have already seen additional money put into their bank accounts to help them with school costs for their children. Over the next few weeks, 1.3 million Australian families will see this money go straight into their bank accounts. Of course, from January next year we will see the schoolkids bonus paid at the start of term 1 and then again at the start of term 3. That is money going into families' bank accounts when they need it to help with the cost of their children's education.                              I can also inform the House that over the last month more than six million Australian households have received extra help with everyday expenses. Six million Australian households are getting extra money -                                                                     Ms MACKLIN:                    That is, six million Australian households who of course know that not one person over there supports the money that these families and these pensioners are getting in their bank accounts. They voted no to each and every one of these families, each and every one of these households, getting this extra money. We know that this side of the House is all about making sure we give families and pensioners help with making ends meet, whereas what those opposite want to do - and Liberals right around Australia are demonstrating they want to do - is just help themselves.                              Ted Ballieu down in Melbourne is helping himself. He has just abolished the School Start Bonus. Barry O'Farrell in New South Wales is hiking up the rents for pensioners in public housing. And now we see the Queensland Premier deciding to abolish the school attendance measure so that he is no longer helping make sure children get to school. That is what Liberals do, while we get on with helping parents and helping pensioners.              </DOC>

  I do not accept the claims made by the member for Herbert, but I absolutely understand the importance of the canegrowing industry to my home state of Queensland. It is a very important industry and one which we seek to foster and to support as much as we possibly can. It is going to be a very important industry for Queensland for a long time to come as we see more and more investment in agriculture in this country, particularly in my home state of Queensland.                              That investment will continue with a carbon price, because this economy will grow and it will grow strongly. It can grow and grow strongly with a carbon price, because what we can do is use energy more efficiently and also drive the investment in renewable industry. There is no industry that can be more to the forefront of that than the sugar industry, which is why we do need a carbon price. It is to encourage investment in more energy efficient practices and, in some cases, driven by the products of the -                                                                     Mr SWAN:                    Increasingly, this industry will be a very important partner in making sure that we are more energy efficient. The practices will also become much more energy efficient. I have great faith in the future of this industry. I do not have any faith in the sorts of predictions that have been made and the bodgie modelling which is produced by all sorts of organisations that do not understand the importance of a carbon price and do not understand the importance of dealing with dangerous climate change.                               What I do know is that Queenslanders up and down the coast do understand the importance of dealing with dangerous climate change in terms of protecting our Great Barrier Reef and in terms of protecting our precious environment. Nothing could be more important for Queenslanders, for our sugar industry, and particularly for people in the north than putting a price on carbon. That is very important to deal with the impacts of dangerous climate change. I know that many Queenslanders, if not the member opposite, understand the importance of this fundamental reform, for the future of our rural sector and the future of our economy and, most importantly, the future of our environment.              </DOC>

  I want to thank the member for Kennedy for the question. At least the member for Kennedy has been consistent in his view on marine parks. The member for Kennedy has not engaged in the rubbish that we have heard from others opposite that somehow marine parks are good if they are done by a Liberal-National Party government but the end of the world if done by a Labor government, and that somehow you could have a rezoning inshore, within the Great Barrier Reef, and that is fine for recreational fishers but if you put boundaries where they cannot go, 400 kilometres away, then that is the end of recreational fishing. The member for Kennedy has been completely consistent the whole way through. He has not had a view of support for marine parks. He has opposed them when they have been done by this side of the House and he has opposed them when they have been done by members opposite. There is not a hint of hypocrisy in anything that we hear from the member for Kennedy.                              He will respect that we have a different policy view to him on this. And we are proud of our marine parks role. We are proud that we have engaged in this sort of environmental protection. We do not engage in the duplicity of those opposite. But the member for Kennedy also raises the issues of, and specifically refers to, our nearest neighbour and the population there. It is the nation of Indonesia that he is referring to.                               I have to say that, when it comes to marine protection, Indonesia is really a case in point. It was President Yudhoyono who led the Coral Triangle Initiative. It was President Yudhoyono who led much of the work within the developing world, acknowledging that if we are going to use our fisheries they have to be used in a sustainable way. Indonesia, in the work on the Coral Triangle Initiative, and the partners that are part of that initiative - the Philippines, Malaysia, Timor-Leste, Papua New Guinea and the Solomons - which Australia supports, are engaging in exactly the sort of environmental work which we would hope that they would engage in. It is exactly the  sort of environmental work that acknowledges that if you trash a resource you will lose a resource.                              That is what Indonesia is absolutely leading out there. So in terms of the food security issues which the member for Kennedy points to, Indonesia is a case in point in understanding the importance of sustainability. I would remind all members of what we were talking about in last week's proposal. The impact on the gross value of production is in the order of one to two per cent. I also remind all members opposite that, when it comes to consistency on environmental protection, the member for Kennedy is upfront. He is just opposed to the creation of marine parks. He does not engage in the extraordinary levels of duplicity we have seen from those opposite.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Canberra for her question. The government is introducing a price on carbon because it is the most cost effective way of cutting our greenhouse gas emissions. And it will provide the long-term incentives for businesses to shift to low emissions technology and to bring more renewable energy into our grid.                               If we do not make these changes we are in danger of being left behind. This was a point being made by the chief executive officer of Shell, Mr Peter Voser, who has welcomed the government's carbon price package. The opposition leader's dark forecasts of doom and gloom have not stopped Shell from committing to invest $30 billion in Australia over the next five years.                               It is reported in the Sydney Morning Herald today that Mr Voser has confirmed that countries not acting to reduce emissions will fall behind. Far from being terrified by the forecasts of doom and gloom of the opposition leader - the reports also indicate something that has been known widely - Shell already uses a carbon price in their investment decisions. Apparently it is in the order of $40 a tonne. That is the basis upon which they are making investment commitments of $30 billion in the Australian economy over the next five years, notwithstanding all the investment advice from the Leader of the Opposition. Of course, the fact is that major resource companies have been pricing carbon into their investment decisions for quite a period of time. Those same resource companies are investing in Australia in the full knowledge of the government's clean energy package and the carbon price, starting on 1 July.                              The Treasurer mentioned a moment ago in question time that Rio Tinto has just announced it is investing another approximately $4 billion in its Pilbara iron ore projects. This commitment represents a huge investment and it stands in complete contrast to the Leader of the Opposition's statements about the outlook for industries like iron ore. When he was visiting the Pilbara last year he talked about doom and gloom and said:                              This carbon tax poses an increasing threat to so many of Australia's great industrial areas and very important sectors of our economy.                              That is the sort of thing he is saying, but what is going on in the real world? Multibillion-dollar investments; we are seeing massive new investments. Twiggy Forrest and Gina Rinehart do not listen to his investment advice. Rio Tinto is not listening to his investment advice. Shell is not listening to his investment advice, and neither are the backbench. They are still snapping up resources stocks, because they are good investments. It is all doom from him, but the real world has moved on from there.               </DOC>

  First of all, I make the point that those sorts of claims and pricing decisions will be subject to scrutiny from the ACCC. That is my first point, and secondly, if the claims that the member has made are anything like the claims that have been made by those opposite then the fact is that they will not have a lot of truth about them. The fact is that there will be an impact on the price level overall, 0.7 per cent on average, less than 1c in the dollar. It is true the increases in electricity prices will be bigger than that. We have said they will be around 10 per cent, and that is precisely what the modelling has found.                               We said that what we would do would be to put in place assistance for households to deal with the price increases and also assistance for industry. We are providing something like $15 billion of household assistance over four years. That is $15 billion worth of assistance into the pockets of consumers. In addition to that, particularly for small business, we have starting on 1 July the $6,500 instant asset write-off which will support up to -                                                                     Mr SWAN:                    Probably because he thinks it will disappear on 1 July. There will be a fair bit of assistance for small business and a very big assistance package which will put cash into the pockets of consumers. As for the claims made by the member, they will be examined by the ACCC.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Page for her question, because I was with her not so long ago in Ballina when we announced one of the very successful initiatives under this program, the biochar plant, which was funded jointly by ourselves and the Ballina Shire Council. Those who sit opposite and talk about the doom and gloom of climate change should listen to this, because this is an initiative that will see landfill converted to energy and to biochar which not only has the capacity to reduce emissions but can create energy through the biochar organic components that can lift the productivity of our agricultural base.                              Whilst we were there we also visited Harwood. The member for Herbert who asked a previous question about cane farmers should also be aware of the important work that is being done there to convert sugar refuse into gas.                                                                    Mr CREAN:                    He's not interested - he comes in here and talks about the plight of the sugar industry and is not even prepared to listen to positive initiatives that we are undertaking.                              That was one project of 16 that I had the opportunity to visit over the fortnight that this parliament was up. These initiatives not only improve the economic input into the regions but also address social needs as well as the environmental needs, the ones we have just talked about. These projects are important not only in their own right but also in seeing a significant cultural change in the way in which regional development is being done: first, the significance of partnerships; second, the leverage because the funding we have put in has resulted in a multiplier effect of four times; and third, the fact that we have councils and regions being prepared to join the dots. I have used this term before, but I was interested to note the other day that when my shadow, Senator Barnaby Joyce, was speaking to the Local Government Association he used the term 'joining the dots'. He's learning - he's channelling me!                               Persistence, though, is also important because 62 per cent of these initiatives were projects that failed the first round. The member for Riverina knows the initiative in Wagga Wagga and he was very proud to come and give me the editorial from the Daily Advertiser, which was ringing our praises for what we did.                              I have got them coming into my office asking how they can get access to this program. The trouble is that they want to spend the money, they do not want to fund it, because they have knocked the program -                </DOC>

  I am somewhat surprised to hear that the member does not believe in reducing emissions by five per cent because I thought that was the common target that was shared, but apparently not. The truth is we will reduce emissions by 160 million tonnes over time. That is the truth. But, of course, they want to come in and distort these facts time and time again, tell lies about the figures -                                                                     Mr SWAN:                    The truth is we will reduce emissions by 160 million tonnes by 2020, and that is there in the modelling. I know they want to come in and selectively quote figures. That is the truth of it. And because we are putting a price on carbon we are going to drive investment in renewable energy, we are going to become much more energy efficient. That is going to be very good for our economy. It will take carbon pollution out of the atmosphere; it will be good for the environment. It will be a long-term reform that will continue to see our economy grow strongly. That is the sort of tough reform that I was talking about before in my answer about the census.                              Over 100 years, because Australia has faced up to these big decisions, because we have put in place the long-term reforms, the great economic reforms of the eighties and nineties and now the big economic reforms like pricing carbon and putting in place a resource rent tax - these are the reforms that will drive prosperity into the future. But, as I said before, those on that side of the House are reactionaries. We on this side of the House are progressives because we understand you need to be ahead of the curve of history. And if you are going to maximise your prosperity in the Asian century you need to get the policy settings right. Sometimes it means taking some difficult decisions. This is a difficult decision, but it is the right decision for Australia. After 1 July so many of the exaggerations that come from those opposite will be proven to be false and we can get on and have a realistic debate about how we make this a better country, how we make our economy more prosperous and how we have a better society with a cleaner environment.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Shortland for her question. I can inform the member for Shortland and the entire House that International Monetary Fund forecasts released in April this year show that Australia's export volumes of goods and services are expected to rise by 7.6 per cent in 2012 and 6.3 per cent in 2013, in the full knowledge of the introduction of a price on carbon. To put this in context, these would be the strongest export growth figures in a dozen years. And these figures contrast with the much slower export growth, of just 2.3 per cent in 2012 and 4.7 per cent in 2013, for all advanced economies.                              We have got this doomsday prophecy: it was firstly a cobra strike, and then it was a python. But, of course, the Leader of the Opposition's variant of a python would be a 'noa constrictor'. You get it around your neck - 'No, no, no, it's trying to squeeze the life out of the Australian economy!' - the old 'noa constrictor' over there. I saw video footage of the opposition leader diving into foam - it was this bellyflop into foam. I tell you what: after 1 July it will be a much harder landing for you as you try your contortions and your gymnastics, and the world does not end. The doomsday prophecy will not have come true and then you will have to be able to explain why you have undertaken and implemented the world's greatest bellyflop, because that is what is coming your way, brother.                              I had a look today as the days just seem to be getting shorter and shorter. And over on that side they say: 'That's 'cause the sky's falling in, the sky's falling in! It's getting shorter and shorter leading up to 1 July.' Well, I can reveal: today is the winter solstice. We know why they are getting shorter. But over there: 'Oh, no, the sky's falling in.' We will have to bring in the Skyhooks - I mean, the opposition leader is living in the seventies:                              I'm livin' in the 70s                              I've just caught another disease                              _   _   _                              Got the right day but I got the wrong week,                              And I get paid for just bein' a freak.'                              That is the Leader of the Opposition.                              We are for strong growth. We are for lower interest rates. We are for falling inflation. We are for low unemployment. And I can tell the Leader of the Opposition we have an investment pipeline unsurpassed in Australia's history: a 50-year high in investment as a share of GDP, almost $900 billion in investment. The market is defying the doomsday of the old 'noa constrictor' over here. You won't squeeze the life out of the Australian economy because Labor will prevail over you.              </DOC>

  I thank the shadow minister for his question. We on this side of the House are proudly introducing a carbon price.                                                                    Mr SWAN:                    We are doing it for all the right reasons.                                                                    Mr SWAN:                    I am also very proud that we have had a long-held policy of pricing carbon on this side of the House. Those on the other side of the House once had a policy of pricing carbon, until they got rid of the member for Wentworth and installed the new opposition leader. They had a belief. Former Prime Minister Howard and former Treasurer Costello had a belief in an emissions trading scheme, so there is nothing particularly controversial about that.                                                                    Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP:                    Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. I again refer to standing order 104. I know that the Acting Prime Minister is doing the very best he possibly can within his competency but he must maintain a link to the substance of the question.                                                                    Mr SWAN:                    We have a price on carbon, which has the broad support of a whole range of industry organisations, and the broad support of the International Monetary Fund, the OECD and the World Bank. And of course any responsible industry organisation in this country understands that we need to price carbon. Peter Voser from Shell has said so very clearly today. Most of the big international companies operating in this country already have a price on carbon factored into their business plans. So the weight of evidence is behind a price on carbon. The weight of evidence globally and nationally is behind it.                              But I will tell you what we are seeing here. We are seeing here a failure of leadership from that side of the House. We are facing up to the big challenges of the 21st century - growing our economy, being environmentally responsible, making sure that what grows here is sustainable for future generations, for our children and our grandchildren, and doing it in a way which is economically responsible and economically rational. If you look at the report from the Productivity Commission, you will see they have endorsed the way in which we are putting a price on carbon. If you look at the modelling from the Treasury, it shows that the economy will continue to grow, that wealth will continue to be created.                                                                    Mr SWAN:                    We know that if we drive the investment in renewable energy and energy efficiency, we will be much more prosperous.                                                                    Mr SWAN:                    But those opposite want to take the low road - they want to play politics.                                                                    Mr SWAN:                    It is a very low road. Modern Australia was not made by the sort of political approaches we are seeing from that side of the House - the gutless, irresponsible approach of those on the other side of the House.                                                                    Mr SWAN:                    I withdraw, Deputy Speaker, but I make this point: every single time the Leader of the Opposition looks down the barrel of a camera and talks about the carbon price -                                                                     Mr SWAN:                    he is misleading the Australian people. That is very clear. That is his choice and that is the choice the Liberal Party has made. But we on this side of the House will defend the national interest and we will do it with vigour.                                                                   The member for Calare then left the chamber.                              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Wills for his question. It has been a big week in the Senate this week. Not only have we seen the budget progressing, not only have we seen the schoolkids bonus that is going out; we have after a long 11 years seen the first fair dinkum reforms to the provision of financial advice in Australia.                                                                    Mr SHORTEN:                    What we will see, courtesy of these reforms passed yesterday in the Senate, is a trifecta of improvements in the provision of financial advice in Australia. First of all we will see greater protection for consumers and people going to financial advisers. If only these changes had come in 11 years ago. I am indebted to the work of the member for Robertson and, in a rare moment of bipartisanship, assisted by the member for Bradfield. Recently in the Trio inquiry they revealed that, in that terrible matter where people lost literally millions of dollars, one of the reasons people invested in the Trio funds was that because they were induced into it by planners who were receiving conflicted commissions from product providers. What a shame. If only we could turn the clock back.                              What we are doing now is making sure that we eliminate conflicted commission structures in financial planning so that people can feel confident. But also in this trifecta of reasons why what we have done in the Senate is such a good idea is it builds upon the other changes we have made to superannuation. On the Labor side of this House we believe in the great good of a comfortable retirement through increasing super from nine per cent to 12 per cent. But what is the point of increasing compulsory super if on the way while it is being managed in investment we see the money for superannuants being frittered away in excessive fees, charges and commissions? Labor has dealt with that so there will be more money for people when they retire.                              The third thing in the trifecta of advantages of what happened in the Senate yesterday is that we will see the expansion of advice. We will see the provision of scaled advice. We will see restoration in the confidence of financial planning as a tool for wealth management for people in the future. Let me put on the record that most financial planners do an excellent job. What we are doing in supporting the professionalisation of financial planning is rebuilding confidence in that profession and seeing greater opportunities for it to expand in the future.                              So there you have it, members of the House - better protection, more wealth, greater use of financial planners. But I do wish we could turn the clock back to 2001, because at that time the current shadow Treasurer had an opportunity to introduce a best interests duty and he did not. At that time he had the chance to eliminate conflicted remuneration and he did not. Unfortunately, he was just too slow and too late to help those people at Trio.              </DOC>

  I always appreciate the contribution from government members about the regulation of registered organisations, because I know on this side of the House we understand the value of a transparent, honest and independent trade union movement and employer associations. Whilst I do not often feel this sensation, I am a little grateful to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition for talking about this issue, because it reminds me of the same theme I had in my previous answer about the shadow Treasurer. What a shame in 2001 when the then minister for industrial relations failed to put in place the laws we do now.                                                                    Mr SHORTEN:                    In terms of the propositions which the government is advancing, I am more than confident that every Labor member will support the propositions. I more than confident that fair-minded crossbenchers will support the propositions. I more than confident that the Business Council of Australia, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Australian Industry Group, the National Farmers Federation and the Road Transport Federation will. What a bunch of Marxists they must all be to support this! What a bunch of dupes you are implying they all are. What would have happened in 2001 if the then minister for industrial relations had done his day job instead of bashing unions -                                                                     Mr SHORTEN:                    I look forward to her contribution in the debate. I submit to the House that what we are doing is improving transparency. We are fixing the problems which the previous minister failed to do. And, by the way, rather than take up further time here, I will debate the shadow Leader of the Opposition - in fact, I will take any three shadow ministers - you pick the crowd, you pick the venue. Let's talk about your hidden workplace relations policy. Bring it out of hiding.              </DOC>

  I want to thank the member for Capricornia for her long-term interest on behalf of her community in the Great Barrier Reef. The UNESCO report that has come out over the last 24 hours has not yet been adopted by the World Heritage Committee, but it does contain considerable recommendations of which members should all be aware. In the first instance it refers to and distinguishes between, on the one hand, port applications and developments which are coming down the pipeline and which are already existing working harbours and, on the other hand, ones in relatively pristine sites. It is an important distinction, and it does mean that places such as Abbot Point and Gladstone - where there are already working harbours - are being viewed differently by UNESCO from places such as Balaclava Island, where it is currently relatively pristine.                              They have also acknowledged the connection between what happens on land and what happens in the Great Barrier Reef, which is an important point. I acknowledge the member for Capricornia as one of the architects, back when we were in opposition, of the reef rescue program. The reef rescue program, where the government works with cane growers and graziers to make sure that we reduce the impact of run-off to the reef, is acknowledged as a significant improvement in the protection of this great international asset.                              I am also asked about other recommendations that have been made in Australia in the last 24 hours. Anyone who saw the first two pages of today's Courier Mail would have been astonished by the comments that were made in this House yesterday by the Leader of the Nationals. The Leader of the Nationals has decided that, when it comes to the Barrier Reef, there are a number of claims of damage to the reef that he can ridicule. The ones he chose to ridicule were that there is an impact from what happens on land with run-off, that there are impacts on what happens with shipping in the ocean and that there are impacts from the crown-of-thorns. They are the three areas that he decided to ridicule.                              I remind the Leader of the Nationals to go to a very good interview with Fran Kelly which was conducted by none other than his own shadow minister for the environment and where it is apparently coalition policy that they have three pillars: 'One is the on-land work in terms of incentives to reduce sediment; two is the offshore work in terms of doing our best to protect the turtles and dugongs; and three is a real crown-of-thorns eradication program.' On all three issues, which are good policy and solid policy put through by the shadow minister for the environment, the Leader of the Nationals stands out on his own, wanting to be the last of the environmental vandals.                              The Labor Party knows that we are on the right side of history on environmental protection. Whether it is on the Great Barrier Reef, on the Daintree rainforest, on the Franklin River, on Kakadu National Park or on what we have done with protection of the oceans of the last two weeks, the National Party will continue to be dragged kicking and screaming to important environmental reforms that are only delivered by Labor.              </DOC>

  In relation to the Leader of the Opposition's question, I have been concerned, as have the members for Corangamite and Corio, about the circumstances at Alcoa. We have also been advised by the company of those circumstances, which the Leader of the Opposition has come into the Parliament and misrepresented today. The circumstances of Alcoa which have been made available to the government include pressure on Alcoa because of international prices and because of the age of some of its capital stock. We have worked with Alcoa because we believe these jobs are precious. We believe the jobs of Australian workers are precious, and that is why when jobs are being threatened in our economy - for example, by the global financial crisis - we have always worked to protect jobs. We have taken that same ethos about understanding how important jobs are to working people to circumstances at Alcoa and we are working with the company because we want to see a continuation of the company and a continuation of those jobs.                              The Leader of the Opposition, of course, is not at all concerned about those jobs; the only thing that will ever worry him is what is the best way of distorting this issue, to make it about his fear campaign. This is not about the Leader of the Opposition's fear campaign; this is about a different set of circumstances. He owes it to the workers there to be honest about it. He owes it to that region of Victoria to be honest about it. He owes it to the people of Australia to be honest about it.                              For us on this side of the parliament, jobs will always be something we work to protect. On that side of the parliament, any threat to jobs is just an excuse to try and politically profit as part of their destructive and aggressive negativity. We will work to help working people; they will keep being negative about working people and their lifetime prospects, as we have seen the Leader of the Opposition be already today.              </DOC>

  Can I thank the member for his question. As question time was coming to an end last Thursday a Border Protection Command Dash 8 aircraft spotted a capsized boat with approximately 40 people crowded on its hull, 110 nautical miles north of Christmas Island. This triggered a massive search-and-rescue effort involving Navy patrol boats, surveillance aircraft and merchant ships. By late that night 110 people had been plucked from the sea. The search-and-rescue effort continued into the night, into the next day and the day after that. Unfortunately, no more people were found alive.                              The search for survivors was suspended at 8.44 pm Saturday night Australian Eastern Standard Time. There were, reportedly, 200 people on board this vessel. We may never know for certain but it is likely that approximately 90 people may have lost their lives. The bodies of 17 people have been recovered. Initial reports were that all of the survivors were adults except a 13-year-old boy. The latest information that I have is that the survivors included nine unaccompanied male juveniles.                              All surviving passengers were transferred to Christmas Island. Four survivors have since been transferred to Perth for medical treatment. I have said that this tragedy needs to be fully investigated to ensure that everything that should have been done was done. An independent inquiry will be conducted by the Western Australian coroner. WA Police and the Australian Federal Police are investigating the incident and are also working to identify victims. Initial interviews with survivors have begun and they will continue over the coming days. A whole-of-government review will also be conducted. This will involve Customs and Border Protection, Defence and the Australian Maritime Safety Authority.                              As the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition have said, over the last few days we have again witnessed Australian men and women putting their own lives at risk, reaching out a long way from our own shore to save the lives of people they have never met and do not know. They have worked around the clock in what has been a massive search-and-rescue effort. Can I say again on behalf of everyone here, a big thank you to the men and women of the Royal Australian Navy, Border Protection Command, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority and the merchant ships who came to the rescue. Over the last few days they have seen some truly horrifying things and they have responded with remarkable work. I need to advise the House that a critical incident mental health support team has now been deployed to Christmas Island to assist these brave men and women. This is yet another terrible tragedy. It is incumbent now, on all of us, to learn from this; to work together and to act to ensure this never happens again.              </DOC>

  The Leader of the National Party has asked a question based on an entirely false premise. The assertion he is putting to this parliament is wrong. Let me repeat the words of the managing director of Alcoa. I would say to the Leader of the Opposition that if he wants to make these sorts of distorting claims then I hope he has the integrity to ring up the managing director of Alcoa and say that he is accusing the managing director of Alcoa of speaking untruths. The managing director of Alcoa has said, as I quoted in answer to my last question, that the current situation has not been brought about by the upcoming carbon price but as a result of the international price on aluminium and the high Australian dollar.                              The fact that the opposition has now degenerated into chatting among themselves and smiling shows just how little regard they have for the jobs of these workers. For them this is all just one big political joke. They do not care at all. It is written all over their faces, all over their smiles and their chatter to each other. They do not care about these jobs. These jobs, for them, are just a convenient political plaything as they come in here with their negativity and cheap politics. The Leader of the National Party has asked an incorrect question; it is factually wrong. In insulting these workers and the company they work for it is, in my view, morally wrong as well.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Robertson for her question. I know that she is interested in what happened at the G20 because she is interested in jobs and prosperity for Australian workers, including those in her own local community. Our economy is strong and one of the things very much reinforced for me, in travelling to the G20, was just how strong our economy is in an uncertain world. We can be very proud of the economy that the Australian people have built together. We can be very proud that we worked together as a government and a nation to come through the global financial crisis and ensure that our economy still has the benefit of growth and jobs.                              When I was at the G20 there were two critical concerns at the table: first, the circumstances in Europe and particularly the eurozone and, second, and more generally, the uncertainty in the global economy. Though our economy is strong we are of course not immune to events in the global economy. A stronger and more resilient global economy is in Australia's national interest.                              On the question of Europe, which caused so much concern at the G20, firstly, it was agreed that there needed to be a firm and resolute commitment to growth. There has been a debate about austerity and growth as if they were polar opposites. At the G20, both in the discussion there and during the lead-up, it became clear through discussion that we need a strategy for growth and fiscal discipline in Europe. That is what we have done here in Australia and there was a firm and resolute commitment to a strategy for growth and fiscal discipline in Europe as well.                              Secondly, there were commitments on greater banking integration and greater fiscal integration to address the issues that Europe, and particularly the eurozone, faces now. Before the end of this month we will see another very important meeting of European leaders to address these issues of growth, fiscal discipline and further banking and fiscal integration. In addition there were discussions at the G20 about the global economy and ensuring that the necessary steps are taken to safeguard it. The single biggest outcome was significantly increased resources for the IMF - all up, $456 billion. In our nation we can be proud of the economy that we have built together; but these discussion at the G20 matter for the global economy and consequently they matter to us. I am pleased that progress was made at the recent G20 meeting.              </DOC>

  It is not as a consequence of the carbon tax. Once again the Leader of the Opposition is attempting to mislead the Australian people about carbon pricing, just as he has every day, because he thinks this negativity is in his political interests. He gives not a thought to our nation or to our clean energy future; every day the only thing he is concerned about is how negative he can be today in the hope of politically profiting, and that is what motivates him to ask questions such as this one to try to mislead the Australian people.

  I thank the member for Denison for his question. I know that he is seriously concerned about this matter. I can assure the member for Denison that, contrary to a report in the Daily Telegraph on 7 June, no application has been granted for the vessel he refers to. I believe that the member for Denison's concerns were probably triggered by that report or by follow-up media occasioned by that report. There has been no application to the Australian Fisheries Management Authority by the vessel which the member for Denison refers to and which is a large, mid-water-trawl factory vessel - and the member for Denison is concerned about its size. No application has been made in respect of that vessel to the relevant independent authority, the Australian Fisheries Management Authority.                              I can also assure the member for Denison and the House in general that, if such an application were to be made, it would be subject to all of the normal considerations that the Australian Fisheries Management Authority goes through. These include catch limits - and the member for Denison's question refers, effectively, to catch limits. They can include requirements to have observers on the vessel who monitor fishing activities. They can also include issues about the kind of equipment used, including technology which, for example, can detect the presence of seals. So, should an application be made, each of these issues would be the subject of consideration. Other requirements can also be engaged in and considered by the relevant authority, including logbook reporting, satellite vessel-monitoring systems, mandatory reporting of any interactions with protected species and the like.                              I can assure the member for Denison that what determines the size of any taking of fish is not the size of the vessel - and he has referred to a large vessel - but the constraints that are put on it by the relevant independent authority, who would work through the issues should an application be made.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Parramatta for her question. The member for Parramatta refers to the outcomes of the recent Rio+20 conference which I attended in Brazil. This conference brought the world together to consider sustainable development and our environment 20 years on from the Rio Earth Summit, a very remarked-upon event in the history of the world's consideration of sustainability and environmental concerns.                              In the 20 years that have passed since the first Earth Summit we have become increasingly aware of environmental problems, including loss of biodiversity, loss of habitat, challenges for the world's oceans and the challenge of climate change. At the Rio+20 meeting, some progress was made. I would point particularly to two areas where Australia argued for progress, and progress was made. Firstly, there was agreement to set sustainable development goals. This is a comparable process to the setting of the Millennium Development Goals, which did have quite a slow generation but, once agreed, served to catalyse global efforts to address questions of global poverty. There has now been agreement to having sustainable development goals which will, we would hope and trust, play a comparable role in catalysing world activity to better address questions of sustainability and our environment. Secondly, there was progress made on the question of the world's oceans. The environmental challenge facing our oceans has become increasingly clear since the days of the original Earth Summit. There was consideration of work for our oceans and some modest measures were agreed. Australia, particularly being an island continent with such a long coastline, can see very clearly the effects of things like ghost nets and abandoned marine equipment that is drifting and killing fish and protected species, and that there does need to be progress on these areas.                              Australia would have liked to have seen more progress made at Rio+20 than was made but global collective action is not easy to harness and organise. Some progress was made, which is important not only to our nation but to the world in general. We will continue to look to build on the Rio+20 outcomes. We have a beautiful environment we want to protect and we understand the global challenges our world faces as well.              </DOC>

  The Deputy Leader of the Opposition has mistaken the purpose of the Rio+20 conference. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition is probably thinking about the climate change negotiations that last happened in Durban and will happen towards the end of this year in Doha, so she has her international processes confused.                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    On the question of Australia's carbon pricing system, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition apparently does not know or has forgotten for the moment that, in putting a price on carbon, Australia will be joining 850 million people around the world who live in nations where there is a price on carbon. We know that many nations around the world are taking steps to put a price on carbon, because they too will see their economies and their nations join the 850 million people currently covered by carbon pricing. For example, in the days I was in Mexico and then in Rio, I had the opportunity to meet with President Lee of the Republic of Korea. Korea is moving to an emissions trading scheme, to give just one example in our region, and is a very important trading partner of Australia's and a very important strategic partner in our region. And so, around the world, whether it be in Europe or whether it be in our region of the world, we are seeing people price carbon because of the global challenge of climate change. And we are seeing people price carbon -                                                                     Ms GILLARD:                    I was explaining that around the world people are putting a price on carbon or have put a price on carbon because it is the most efficient and least costly way of reducing carbon pollution and tackling the challenge of climate change. There was a time when the Deputy Leader of the Opposition was a crystal-clear advocate for putting a price on carbon. Clearly, she has changed her mind - I am getting some advice as to whether or not the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has truly changed her mind. Putting that to one side, whatever view the Deputy Leader of the Opposition currently holds she ought not to misrepresent to this parliament or more broadly how many people around the world live in countries with carbon pricing schemes.              </DOC>

  I am asked by the member for Petrie about the strength of our economy. What I can say is our economy walks tall in the world. We can all take pride from our economic strength and pride in what a dynamic, diverse and ambitious country we have become.                              We are dynamic because we, particularly on this side of the House, have put in place the long-term reforms to ensure our future prosperity and also our quality of life. We have been willing to take the long-term reforms that will make this nation a better place and that is why we on this side of the House are described as progressives - we are determined to get ahead of the game, to put in place long-term reforms. That is why those on the other side of the House are reactionaries - they are not determined to do anything to set the country up for the future.                              We know that if we want a society and an economy that is prosperous and has social justice we have got to fight hard for these reforms. That is why we are putting a price on carbon pollution. It is why we are reforming mining taxation, it is why we are reforming aged care and it is why we are reforming hospital funding. We on this side of the House understand the importance of making the big reforms for the future. On that side of the House, all we have is scaremongering. Our economy continues to be among the best in the world, no matter how much those on the other side of the House try to talk it down. We now have a $½ trillion investment pipeline in resources - up 136 per cent, or around $290 billion, since we came to office - and we continue to see announcements. Just last Friday, BHP announced US$845 million to be invested in the Illawarra. Of course, we had an investment from Rio Tinto, an additional $4.2 billion in the Pilbara. So, no matter about all of the scare campaigns, all of the talking down of our economy - none of it stacks up when you actually look at the facts.                              Of course, their scare campaign is torpedoed every day by the facts. Just like Whyalla, it will not be wiped from the face of the map on 1 July and, of course, the coal industry will continue to grow and prosper. Businesses will continue to invest in mining and, of course, so too will coalition members on the other side. So when the sun comes up on Sunday, jobs will continue to grow, the economy will be safe, the environment will be safe, the family budget will be safe, and nothing will save the credibility of the opposition leader.              </DOC>

  I thank the shadow Treasurer for his question. Clearly what he is putting to the parliament is not well believed by the opposition backbench, given how keen they are to keep investing in resources companies. The opposition backbench apparently pays as much attention to the economic advice from the shadow Treasurer as the rest of Australia - which is absolutely none.                              The shadow Treasurer, in line with the usual negativity of the opposition, has come in here now trying to talk down the Australian economy and share prices, apparently because of the minerals resource rent tax and carbon pricing. Let's actually go through the facts. The opposition, on some days, comes into this parliament and says, 'You know, the problem with the minerals resource rent tax is it's going to be so big it will be the end of the minerals industry.' Then on other days it comes in here -                                                                     Ms GILLARD:                    I am asked about prospects for the mining industry with the minerals resource rent tax and I am addressing that. On prospects for the mining industry with the minerals resource rent tax, I was pointing out the contradiction that some days the opposition say it is too big and it will break the industry; on other days they say that it will not generate enough money. The fact that they make both of those criticisms tells you something: that they are just casting around for any reason to try and attack the minerals resource rent tax.                              The reason for the minerals resource rent tax is that at this time of our nation's history, with a huge resources boom, with more than $500 billion of projects in the pipeline, it is the right time for there to be some sharing of the wealth with other Australians. We support that and we are determined that Australians see their fair share of the mining boom rather than have it channelled into the pockets of a few, which is the position of the opposition. On carbon pricing, which the shadow Treasurer raises as well, the shadow Treasurer well knows that with carbon pricing we will continue to see economic growth, we will continue to see growth in jobs and we will see our nation address carbon pollution at the lowest possible price.                              I know that the shadow Treasurer has had difficulties with these issues in the past - that he has been reduced to tweeting out, begging people to tell him what he should think about important public policy concerns. Well, to the shadow Treasurer who has that inability to analyse public policy issues, let me be crystal clear with him. We are determined to see carbon pollution cut, we are determined to see our nation seize a clean energy future, we are determined to see a growing economy with more jobs, and we are determined to help households with tax cuts, family payment increases and pension increases as well. The shadow Treasurer is determined to mislead and be negative.                               Leave not granted.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Throsby for his question, because the coal industry is extremely important to regions that he represents in the Illawarra and also to the region that I represent in the Hunter. There has been a range of forecasts about the future of the coal industry in recent months, all of them overwhelmingly positive, but there is one that has been incredibly negative, and that is from the Leader of the Opposition. We know about his economic forecasting! He has predicted from 1 July, next Sunday, the death of the coal industry. The death of the coal industry - the end of it. In the Illawarra, coalmining has gone; in the Hunter, it has gone. That is what he has predicted. But the closer we get to the introduction of a carbon price from Sunday and the more facts that come out, the more utterly ridiculous, hypocritical and misleading the Leader of the Opposition's comments have been.                              Just take the Illawarra: last Friday, BHP Billiton approved an $833 million investment in Illawarra coal. The carbon price starts in less than a week, the Leader of the Opposition has forecast the death of the industry, and here is BHP Billiton announcing an $833 million investment commitment. In fact, it is the largest capital investment that BHP Billiton has ever made in its Illawarra coal subsidiary. The new mine will support the ongoing employment of 500 workers currently employed at the West Cliff mine and generate 300 new construction jobs. With my background I have some familiarity with the industry. The coal seams in the Illawarra are relatively methane intensive and will attract a carbon price liability. Nonetheless, notwithstanding the forecasts of doom, $833 million has been committed in Illawarra coal, just days before the introduction of the carbon price.                              On the one hand, we have got the death of the industry being forecast by the Leader of the Opposition, who will be held to account for this by workers in the coal industry - they will hold him to account for what he has predicted and the insecurity that he has engendered - but on the other hand, we have got BHP Billiton and $833 million on the table. Just as the Leader of the Opposition was misrepresenting the position with Alcoa earlier in question time, so he has misrepresented systematically the circumstances in the coal industry. In fact, there has been an upward revision from $96 billion to $107 billion in the investment pipeline in coal and it has a strong future.              </DOC>

  To the member who raises the question: if the member wants to directly discuss the issue, then of course I am open to discussing with him issues in his electorate. I am making the assumption he is genuinely raising the issue in the parliament and wants to discuss it with the government.                              Can I say to the member and to the parliament more broadly: with carbon pricing, we have seen in this parliament many, many claims made which, on investigation, do not turn out to be true. Indeed, in the course of this question time, from the Leader of the Opposition and from the shadow Treasurer, we have seen a continuation of the kinds of misrepresentations which have characterised this debate. The opposition has been so negative that it has predicted a permanent depression. It has been so negative that it has predicted the death of the coal industry. It has been so negative that it has said that this will be a wrecking ball through the economy, that the increases in the price -                                                                     Ms GILLARD:                    My simple point is that we have, particularly from the opposition's frontbench, time after time, misleading claims made about carbon pricing. For the member who raises this question I will make the assumption he is raising it genuinely and I am more than happy to speak to him directly about it.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Reid very much for his question. I can inform the House that this government is continuing to act to help families and pensioners with their everyday expenses. As of today, more than 6½ million initial payments have been made before the price on pollution starts on 1 July, so 6½ million families and pensioners have already received their assistance. This is going to help with their expenses like their groceries or their electricity bills that are coming both now and in coming months.                              I can also let the House know that from today more than 280,000 self-funded retirees who are on a Commonwealth seniors health card will be receiving $250 if they are single self-funded retirees or $380 for couples combined. The one thing that they certainly are not looking forward to is this opposition clawing that money back off them if this lot ever gets the chance. I can also inform the House that the government's household assistance package is designed to support around 98 per cent of families with incomes up to $150,000. Those families will be receiving some assistance. More than half of those families will in fact get a 20 per cent buffer to make sure that they do get the assistance they need with the introduction of the carbon price.                              One thing that Australians are very good at is judging whether or not what they hear is true. What they are going to know after 1 July is that the doom and gloom that this Leader of the Opposition has been spreading is patently untrue. They will be able to judge the truth for themselves. Already we are receiving correspondence from pensioners who are saying to us how pleased they are that the money is certainly going to assist them with their winter power bills. As the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency mentioned a minute ago, pensioners do understand that the assistance they are receiving is permanent, that it is ongoing. But, of course, it is only permanent and ongoing if the government stays in power, not if people over there get the chance because we know that this Leader of the Opposition is only plotting to figure out how he is going to claw this money back.               </DOC>

  Thank you very much, Deputy Speaker. To the member's question, what the government have always said about carbon pricing is we worked with the Treasury to model the effects, particularly the effects for households. We modelled those effects and said that, on average, the additional cost for households would be $3.30 per week. As the member well knows, the jury is effectively in on that, because the regulators around the nation, including in New South Wales, have spoken and said either that the increase is exactly what the government said it would be or it would be less.                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    So, in those circumstances, the assistance that is being provided is going to assist households in the way that the government predicted - that is, we will see an average increase in electricity for households of $3.30 a week and an average assistance of $10.10 a week.                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    Thank you very much, Deputy Speaker. The member for Flinders raises with me the question of electricity prices more broadly.                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    I am answering the member for Flinders's question more broadly than households, which I have just described. Of course in modelling the impact for households, which will be less than a cent in a dollar, the flowthrough impacts from businesses were modelled into that cost-of-living rise, and households will see tax cuts, family payment increases and pension increases. I would also say to the member for Flinders, as he well knows, putting a price on carbon is the most efficient and effective way of reducing carbon pollution.                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    I was simply pointing out that whether one is talking about carbon pricing and small businesses, large businesses, households or anyone in the Australian nation, if you are going to address carbon pollution you need to work out the cheapest and most effective way of doing it. I agree with the member for Flinders when he says that perhaps the most important domestic policy decision was the decision of the Howard government that Australia would implement a national carbon trading system. He then went on to urge the government to take up that proposal for putting a price on carbon. Given his words then endorsing carbon pricing, I am a little surprised to get his question today.              </DOC>

  What the government's facts and figures show is, as a result of putting a price on carbon, we will cut carbon pollution by 160 million tonnes in 2020. The government will achieve what has been a bipartisan target about emissions reduction.                              The Leader of the Opposition, of course, has continued day after day to misrepresent all aspects of carbon pricing: to misrepresent what it will achieve; to misrepresent who pays the price - it is of course large businesses that generate carbon pollution that will pay the price; to misrepresent the impacts on Australian households. Today he has even been out trying to scare cats and dogs about the impact of carbon pricing - out at the RSPCA telling poor old Fido and Fluffy a fairytale about how a cobra and a python is coming to get them! I can assure the Leader of the Opposition that on 1 July cats will still purr, dogs will still bark, and the Australian economy will continue to get stronger. We will continue to see jobs grow and we will see Australian families with the benefit of tax cuts, family payment increases and pension increases, and the Leader of the Opposition's fear campaign will collide with the facts, with the truth.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Fowler for his question. Yesterday the parliament marked its respects and its sense of grievance and tragedy about the loss of the lives of asylum seekers in the incident last week where an asylum seeker boat capsized. As we remarked to the House yesterday, we do not know for sure how many lives have been lost but it is a considerable number and I think understandably, both in this parliament and beyond, people have reacted with a sense of loss and suffering to this news. The government remains committed to working to try and address the asylum seeker issue, and in particular to try and put an end to the spectre of desperate people risking their lives at sea. We want to put an end to the evil trade of people smuggling and put an end to that kind of evil which seeks to profit so much from human misery. I think the Australian people are asking their political leaders at this time to put politics to one side. We have in the past had discussions with the opposition about trying to find a combined way forward on this issue. We did at an earlier point in time make an offer that the government's proposed solution of an arrangement with Malaysia be combined with the opposition's proposed solution of a centre in Nauru and that we do both. We also said to the opposition at that time that we would consider establishing a review into the efficacy of temporary visas in complementing these facilities, with mutually agreed terms of reference and a mutually agreed chairperson or expert panel. We offered to the opposition that we would look at strengthening the right of redress of asylum seekers transferred to Malaysia. We also said that we would look at including an examination of ways that we could have a greater involvement from UNHCR, the United Nations Human Rights Commissioner. We put this offer to the opposition some time back. I seek to confirm here in parliament today, as I confirmed publicly yesterday, that that offer certainly remains on the table and that I am willing to talk, and the government is willing to talk, to see if we can find a compromise that enables this parliament to realise what I think is supported by all of us - that is, that we see an end to this human misery and loss of life.              </DOC>

  As I have already advised the parliament earlier today, the Leader of the Opposition was out trying to scare cats and dogs. He has moved on from human beings and now he is trying to scare animals. Presumably tomorrow he will be out trying to scare Skippy the Bush Kangaroo, and the day after he will be out trying to scare Puff the Magic Dragon, and so it will go on. To the Leader of the Opposition, whose fear campaign is growing truly more ridiculous day by day, can I advise him of the following facts, which his fear campaign, as usual, ignores. The Leader of the Opposition has never run into a fact that he was not prepared to discard in pursuit of his fear campaign, including trying to scare people at the RSPCA. The facts of the matter are these: we initiated in our carbon pricing package - our Clean Energy Future package - a $300 million fund, the Low Carbon Communities program, which is there to assist local councils and community organisations to adapt their energy use. We are encouraging charities like the RSPCA to consider applying for a grant under these programs.                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    I am, in fact, advised that the RSPCA did not apply for the first round of the Community Energy Efficiency Program, which is part of the Low Carbon Communities program. I would certainly encourage the RSPCA to apply at a future time. This is a dedicated stream of funds to assist our not-for-profit sector, who do such great work. But the Leader of the Opposition, in raising this question today and in his media appearances a little bit earlier today, should not be trying, on top of all of the fear he has already tried to raise in the community, to generate this kind of fear amongst those who do great work in our not-for-profit sector. To the Leader of the Opposition I say: this fear campaign is growing truly ridiculous, and there is no better example than this one today.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Reid for his question and his ongoing interest in media issues. It is indeed vital that the media take seriously their responsibility to report the facts with honesty and integrity. The media's main role is to report the news, not to make the news. I know the vast majority of the press gallery here do their jobs with integrity each and every day right across the spectrum, but there are some examples that should serve as cautionary tales.                              In 2009 the Godwin Grech affair, also known as Utegate, and broken by Steve Lewis of News Limited, showed that certain parts of the media were involved in the attempted sabotage of a democratically elected government. Time and the truth ultimately brought out the real story in that matter. Now we are seeing another example that should be taken extremely seriously. Members will recall the splash, again by Steve Lewis, on 20 April about allegations of sexual harassment against the Speaker -                               The convention is that, subject to the right of the House to legislate on any matter, matters awaiting adjudication in a court of law should not be brought forward in debate, motions or questions.                              As this matter is before the Federal Court it is not in order.                                                                    Mr ALBANESE:                    I am also very mindful of those issues, which is why I am referring to articles published online today as a result of a release of documents publicly by the court. An article in the Sydney Morning Herald titled ''We will get him!': journalist's alleged texts to Slipper accuser' went online today -                                                                     Mr ALBANESE:                    It is very clear that we need to draw a distinction and that people in the media need to recognise whether they are reporters or participants, observers or activists. There is an important distinction between the two that has to be upheld for the sake of the integrity of the media. The fact is that the first I knew about those allegations was when they were published in the Daily Telegraph. I am not surprised that, given the reports today outlining the active involvement prior to the publication of those allegations -                                                                   The member for McEwe                  n then left the chamber.                                                                                    Mr ALBANESE:                    I conclude by saying this is an issue which involves taxpayers directly, because we are talking about an issue that involves taxpayers' interests and whether when someone was on the taxpayers' payroll they were meeting in News Ltd -               </DOC>

  In answer to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition's question, what I believe is that we have established a way of ensuring that this nation has a clean energy future. We have established a way of this nation tackling climate change. We have established a way that this nation will join 850 million other people around the globe who are covered by carbon-pricing schemes. We will ensure that in our nation, which is an emissions-intensive economy, we at the lowest cost possible begin a journey of change to a cleaner energy future.                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    I was asked a very broad question about what I believe, and I am taking the opportunity to explain it to the House. I believe that it is important for our nation to protect our precious environment. I believe that climate change is being caused by carbon pollution. I believe our nation must address this challenge. I believe that pretending that this challenge will somehow fix itself is not only abdicating your responsibility to the current generation but also letting future generations down, our nation's children and grandchildren. Therefore I believe that it is important for our nation to start tackling this challenge, and from 1 July we will.                              This is a need that was recognised very clearly by the former Howard government. The former Howard government did not seek to have the nation believe in denial of the climate change science. The former Howard government did not pretend to the Australian people that there was any other way of doing this effectively than carbon pricing. The former Howard government stood for a comprehensive emissions trading scheme - as did the Deputy Leader of the Opposition when she was a member of that government, as did the Leader of the Opposition when he was a member of that government, and as they have on many occasions since stood for carbon pricing.                              But there was a moment of course when the opposition decided that their negativity was better for their politics than supporting a clean energy future. There was a moment when they decided their self-interest was more important than the nation's interest. There was a moment when they decided that the peddling of fear was more important than the statement of fact. There was a moment when they decided to let this generation of Australians down, the next generation and the generation beyond that. Well, the government has moved to put carbon pricing in place. The Leader of the Opposition's fear campaign runs into all of the facts on 1 July, and every hollow, irresponsible, negative campaign claim he has made will be exposed at that time as an untruth, always untrue and continuing to be untrue.               </DOC>

  I thank the member for Lyne for his question. I am aware of the comments that were reported in today's newspapers. In response I want to say the following. The GST and its distribution between states is the subject of a great deal of commentary, and one's perspective tends to be defined on where one lives. People in Western Australia will take one view and people in Tasmania and the Northern Territory another. We certainly believe that it is important around the nation that Australians get a comparable level of services, that you should not have your life's chances through the schooling system at a lesser standard in one part of the country than in another part of the country because state and territory governments have different revenue-raising capacities and different types of economies. That is why we have a formula to redistribute the goods and services tax. But I understand that this is controversial in parts of our country and could benefit from a thoroughgoing review, and that review is in train now, led by, amongst others, two former eminent state leaders, Nick Greiner and John Brumby.                              We are continuing to work strongly on Commonwealth-state reform. We moved as a government shortly after we were elected from a focus on inputs - for example, whether a school had a flag on a flagpole - to a focus on outcomes - whether or not we were actually changing the life chances of children. We have made some major steps forward not only in education but also more recently in health and, at the last COAG meeting, in skills and skills development. We are moving to a system that enables people to have an entitlement to the first qualification that makes a difference to their life chances and to a university style HEC scheme for the more expensive upper-end qualifications.                              Reform between a federal government and state and territory governments is never easy. It requires dedication and focus. We are continuing to work strongly with our state and territory counterparts. I believe we have a proud track record of getting things done. Whether it is more than an extra $16 billion into health with a profound set of reforms or the most recent skills package, we will continue to work to get the big reforms done.                              On the government's agenda for the balance of this year will be a focus on the National Disability Insurance Scheme and a focus on the work arising from the David Gonski review of school funding. So there is certainly more to do. There is more to do in the tax area as well. We are working, following last year's tax forum, with our state and territory colleagues on tax too.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Blair for his question. Yesterday marked another very important milestone in securing Australia's future growth in a carbon constrained economy. We did see the passage through the Senate of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation Bill.                              We on this side of the House understand that economies that will succeed in the 21st century will be those that are powered by clean energy, and of course a carbon price is the first step down that road. But we do have barriers in clean energy markets, and that is why the Clean Energy Finance Corporation is pretty important in removing those barriers to clean energy investment. The corporation will have a robust investment mandate and will be required to deliver a targeted return.                              But, of course, this is a measure that was opposed by those opposite. They would prefer to run around the country with their ridiculous Rocky Horror Picture Show. On Sunday morning will be waiting for the four horsemen of the apocalypse to go down the main road of Whyalla. We know what else will happen on Sunday morning: little puppies will be crying with pain. Every time this Leader of the Opposition has looked down the barrel of a camera, he has misled the Australian people. He was at it again yesterday. We were amused to learn from 7.30 that we had had another Oscar-winning performance from the Leader of the Opposition.                                                                    Mr SWAN:                    He has pretended to have a lover's tiff with Clive Palmer, because he knows -                                                                     Mr SWAN:                    Clive Palmer told him to oppose the Clean Energy Finance Corporation Bill - and it has been a bad look, going into bat for billionaires over the battlers in Australia. We on this side of the House are going in to bat for families. Payments have been made to something like 1.3 million families. We have put out something like $1.5 billion, with permanent payments to come from March.                              But the most important thing is that we will have on 1 July the tripling of the tax-free threshold - a very big tax reform which is going to look after battlers, those on low incomes and retirees. This is a very big initiative for all Australians. We know what those opposite want to do; they want to claw that back. They want to claw back that tripling of the tax-free threshold to give Clive Palmer a tax cut. It is okay for Clive Palmer to put his pollution in the air for free and it is okay for Clive Palmer to pump it into the Great Barrier Reef, but it is not okay for the battlers of Australia to get a tax cut by the tripling of the tax-free threshold. This opposition leader has sold himself to Clive Palmer and Gina Rinehart -                                                                     Mr SWAN:                    We on this side of the House stand for the families of Australia.              </DOC>

  In answer to the member's question, No. 1: the assistance provided to Alcoa as described in the parliament yesterday arises because of the particular circumstances of the aluminium industry in Australia at this time. Those circumstances were described by Alan Kranzberg, the managing director of this company, and I am sure the member is not meaning to imply that Alan Kranzberg, as manager, was saying anything other than the truth. I am sure he is not meaning to imply that. Mr Kranzberg made it perfectly clear that the circumstances of Alcoa were being determined by the falls we have seen in aluminium prices globally and by things like the high Australian dollar. He has specifically said - and I alerted the House to these statements yesterday - that the matter which he faced was not a matter about carbon pricing but a set of circumstances generally in the aluminium industry. I believe his words should be accepted by this parliament. They are absolutely the facts.                              Second, on the question of Hazelwood, I alert the member to the fact that Hazelwood did announce a refinancing arrangement. This refinancing arrangement has been done through normal commercial arrangements. The suggestions have been in the media that somehow this is an emergency or there is some sense of bailout around it - and I believe the member may have repeated those words. This is a normal commercial arrangement and normal commercial refinancing which should actually speak to this parliament and speak more broadly about the way in which our electricity generation sector will have security as we move into carbon pricing. So the fear campaigning around this, like all of the other fear campaigning - the fear campaigning around jobs, the fear campaigning around cost of living, the fear campaigning around the circumstances of cats and dogs - by the Leader of the Opposition is absolutely untrue.                              On 1 July, when the coal industry is still in operation, when electricity generation is still happening around the country, when people get their tax cuts and are spending their increased family payments and pensions, when people go to the shops and do not see the Leader of the Opposition's promised astronomical increase in the cost of living and when Whyalla is still on the map, the Leader of the Opposition's campaign will be exposed for the hollow sham it has been.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Deakin for his question. There is very strong investment in the Australian economy in full knowledge of the carbon price starting on 1 July, despite all of the efforts by the Leader of the Opposition to talk down the economy. The prophet of doom has been turning up at businesses around the country for months, predicting their demise under carbon pricing. We all know, of course, that when the Leader of the Opposition visited a Peabody coalmine and forecast the death of the coal industry - its death! - the very next day the company announced a $5 billion takeover. Some death!                              I have had a look at a few other places that the Leader of the Opposition has visited, and there is quite an intriguing pattern emerging: it appears that, if the Leader of the Opposition visits your business and predicts doom, in fact you might boom. Have a look at some of the results. Last year, for example, he visited BHP Billiton's Mount Whaleback iron ore mine and said, of course, 'The carbon price - the end of the iron ore industry; terrible outlook'. But what actually happened after he left? BHP Billiton then announced it would invest $822 million in further expanding the ore body nearby - $822 million after the prophet of doom had been there.                              Then the Leader of the Opposition went to Austal's Henderson shipyard and said it would be terrible: 'This is going to be significantly, terribly impacted by the carbon price.' What happened after he left? Since he left Austal has announced $400 million of new contracts for its facility at Henderson - $400 million in new business. He went on to Visy's Gibson Island recycling mill and said that it was going to be a victim of carbon price and the end of the mill. Yet since he left Visy has announced a $300 million waste-to-energy proposal, including a new plant at Gibson Island. This is what Anthony Pratt, Visy's Executive Chairman, had to say:                              I see clean energy as a source of future growth, energy and emissions savings and a whole new business division for Visy.                              That was said by Anthony Pratt, the head of Visy, after the Leader of the Opposition had been there forecasting doom. We all know he has forecast the death of the coal industry, but $100 billion of extra investment is coming in. All we can hope is that, after his silly visit to the RSPCA today, it will forecast a better outcome for the little puppies and the little kittens in good care at the RSPCA.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for his question because it is yet another example of all the exaggeration that we have seen from those opposite and all of the tall stories. I do not really take much at all of what those opposite say because it is generally misleading and it is inaccurate.                                                                    Mr SWAN:                    All of these matters will be tested by the ACCC and we will see where the truth lies. But I do take the words that have been uttered by the member, and this is what he had to say on 13 February 2007:                              _ the Government's role should be to create the market environment that will lead to the outcomes sought either through putting a price on CO2 or placing a cap on how much CO2 will be emitted _              </DOC>

  I want to thank the member for Lyons for drawing attention to the inclusion within the clean energy future package of the Biodiversity Fund. The Biodiversity Fund amounts to just under $1 billion over six years; the first round of that was settled some months ago and those projects are now off and running throughout the country. There was $271 million committed in the first round over six years and there were 313 projects throughout the country.                              In the electorate of Lyons, if we go just to that one area in Tasmania, there are projects such as $2.2 million for a partnership of local community groups providing revegetation and connectivity in that sort of land care work that has been passionately held for so long. The concept of corridors is one that a number of groups throughout that part of Tasmania have got behind, and the member for Lyons has been helpful in making sure that the Southern Midlands Council and the northern Tasmanian natural resource management bodies are there working with farmers through land care projects, and also acknowledging some of the shifts that have happened in that part of Tasmania where, increasingly, there are significant landholdings being used as lifestyle properties rather than for productive use to make sure that that same sort of land care work can be continuing on those properties. So the member for Lyons can proudly say that those projects are happening in his electorate. He voted for them when he voted for the clean energy future package. He is now making sure that they are happening on the ground and, just as he voted for them and delivered for Tasmania, so too are there projects in other parts of Australia, where the local members voted against them and are promising at the next election that they want to see them abolished.                              We go from one end of the country in the southernmost part of Tasmania to the northernmost parts of Australia, to the electorate of Leichhardt. There are $12.3 million of projects in the electorate of Leichhardt that were part of the first round alone of the Biodiversity Fund, which the member for Leichhardt voted against. There were $12 million worth of projects in the Far North which the member for Leichhardt will take to the next election with a promise to abolish. These are projects such as the $3.6 million for the traditional owners of the Wik and Kugu areas of their lands to be involved in management of their parts of the Far North. There is the $2.8 million to Balkanu for Indigenous rangers in Hope Vale, something which the Leader of the Opposition should be somewhat aware of, in that his party goes to the next election promising to abolish that funding. There is Rainforest Rescue. Why is it any surprise that they are promising to abolish funding for the Daintree? They opposed the World Heritage listing of the Daintree all those years ago. And now the biodiversity work being done on the ground as part of the clean energy future package, they have voted against project by project, each and every one of them, and they go to the next election promising to abolish them.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for the question. It enables me to explain to him both in respect of refrigerant gases, and generally, the way in which this will work. We had a discussion about this in question time yesterday when I was asked some questions about small businesses, and I think that it is very important that members of this parliament are out there giving people the facts, not making things up.                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    The facts are that there is a limited number of businesses that will pay a carbon price, well less than 500. They are the only businesses that will be required to directly pay the carbon price. When examples of small businesses have been raised with us, and the member raises an example of a small business now, they are not directly paying the carbon price.                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    We have always said to the Australian people that there would be a flow-through impact from carbon pricing into the costs of things that households buy, and most particularly we have pointed to the increase in household electricity, which will be on average around $3.30 a week, whereas on average household assistance is $10.10 a week.                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    In respect of small businesses, an example was raised yesterday about electricity. The member is raising a different example with me today. Yes, for small businesses there will be some price impacts, but it is very important to keep a sense of scale here and also the ability of businesses with these price impacts to pass them on to consumers who are receiving the benefits of tax cuts, family payment increases and pension increases. Yesterday we had a lot of fear raised about electricity and small businesses. The Council of Small Businesses of Australia has advised the relevant minister, Minister Combet, that the electricity cost of a typical small retail business makes up less than two per cent of total costs and, if you work that all the way through, the Council of Small Businesses says that the typical small business power bill will increase by around $5 per week. On refrigerant gas costs, as the member would probably know, these are only used intermittently, not as a continuous cost.                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    Once again, there is a sense of scale that needs to be got into dealing with these price impacts. We are seeing time after time from the opposition exaggeration to try to raise fear. On 1 July we will see the truth.                              Leave not granted.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Moreton for his question. The carbon price will cut greenhouse gas emissions to help tackle climate change and will drive investment in clean energy so that we can build a stronger economy for the future. We all know that the impact of the carbon price will be approximately 0.7 per cent on prices on average. That means that prices will go up on average by less than 1c in the dollar. Power prices are expected to go up by around $3.30 per week on average, but we are providing households with assistance of up to $10.10 per week on average in the form of increases in family payments, increases in pensions and tax cuts.                              We know that there has been a lot of misleading information disseminated about the carbon price. That is why we have provided the ACCC with $12.8 million to protect households and small businesses from people who jack up their prices and falsely blame those price rises on the carbon price. Customers and small businesses who have any concerns in relation to pricing can contact the ACCC. We have established a new hotline. We know that most businesses will do the right thing, but those businesses who do not will have to face the ACCC.                              While the government is out there trying to crack down on misleading claims, the Leader of the Opposition is out there giving the green light to businesses to jack up their prices and to falsely blame the carbon price. I see that in the last couple of days the Leader of the Opposition has written a letter to businesses and he has enclosed one of his dodgy Liberal Party pamphlets. This particular pamphlet -                                                                     Mr BRADBURY:                    Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. I am talking about this dodgy Liberal Party leaflet. This particular leaflet -                                                                     Mr BRADBURY:                    This particular leaflet at least is authorised. It is written and authorised by none other than the member for Dunkley. The Leader of the Opposition has written to businesses and has asked that this dodgy Liberal Party leaflet be put up in their windows. He wants to see businesses jacking up their prices and he says that putting this up in the window will tell customers that the prices have increased as a result of the carbon price. I would say to all businesses around Australia, be very careful and very wary of the Leader of the Opposition. Do not allow him to drag you into his cynical scare campaign because the consequences of that are very serious. Of course, I remind all businesses that, whatever you do, be very careful about making false or misleading claims because if you do mislead your customers you could face fines of up to $1.1 million. I would also say to all customers, look very carefully. Make sure that if anyone makes dodgy claims you pick up the phone and call the ACCC.               </DOC>

  I thank the shadow Treasurer for his question and I thank him for the fact that in the past he has very clearly said things like, 'Inevitably we will have a price on carbon, we will have to.' He has proudly talked about how the Howard government were the initiators of the idea of an emissions trading scheme and how they went to an election promising it and so on. I thank the shadow Treasurer for his fulsome support of carbon pricing and, no doubt, it drives his interest in internationally linked carbon markets.                              When we look at carbon pricing around the world, we obviously see a variety of prices in different schemes. We have seen volatility in prices in Europe. That is unsurprising, given we have seen volatility on all markets in Europe, given the nature of the economic circumstances there. What the government has done in addressing the starting price for our carbon pricing scheme is to work out the appropriate price to drive a change in our economy to a clean energy future at the least cost. I am sure the shadow Treasurer is very distressed, given his support for emissions trading and carbon pricing, that instead of this most efficient, effective and least cost approach he is committed through the Leader of the Opposition -                                                                     Ms GILLARD:                    Madam Deputy Speaker, thank you. I was making the point that having a mechanism of carbon pricing, as the shadow Treasurer well knows, is always the most efficient approach as compared to the wasteful policy with higher cost that the Leader of the Opposition has committed his political party to. On prices around the world, the average EU price over the past four financial years comes in directly at A$23 a tonne. Over the next few years the Climate Institute expects Britain will have a carbon price of $24 to $30 a tonne; Sweden will have a price of $130 a tonne; Switzerland, $30 to $60 a tonne; Norway, $53 a tonne; Ireland, $24 to $37 a tonne - and the list goes on. And of course, as the shadow Treasurer would well know, we are seeing moves to emissions trading schemes in our region, including the recent decision by the Republic of Korea to move to an emissions trading scheme, the trialling of emissions trading schemes in provinces in China, and the list goes on. I say to the shadow Treasurer: he ought not to risk his own reputation by joining the Leader of the Opposition in this stupid, cynical, negative fear campaign. He has in the past stood up for carbon pricing; he should have the integrity to do it now.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Kingston. I know what a champion she is not just for regional Australia but for her own community, and the initiatives we have put in there - the new library, the trade training centre - and the way the National Broadband Network is working for her is testament to that work. Hers is a region where, every time you go to it, it contrasts the negativity that you get in this House from that side of the chamber. Everywhere you go in the region you have people that are positive about the future - challenged by it, yes, but they see opportunity in it and they are not buying the fear campaign. In her home state this cannot be told better than by the city of Whyalla.                                                                   The member for Casey then left the chamber.                                                                                    Mr CREAN:                   This, after all, was the city that the Leader of the Opposition went to on 27 April 2011 and had this to say:                               Whyalla will be wiped off the map by _ carbon tax. _ Whyalla risks becoming a ghost town, an economic wasteland _ it's also true of Port Pirie _ Gladstone _ Hunter Valley _ Illawarra _ Kwinana _ Latrobe Valley, Portland _                              There'd be nothing left under this bloke. This is the doom and gloom that he preaches.                              But what are the facts? It is interesting that the leader has not been back to Whyalla since he made that prediction. I have been back four times and I have seen the magnificent growth that is taking place there. The rare earths industry -                                                                     Mr CREAN:                    I was making a point about the rare earths industry, the port development, the fertiliser and nitrate plants. This is hundreds of jobs and billions worth of investment taking place. In fact, it is very interesting that today in the Whyalla Times we have 'Population on the rise in Whyalla'. Some ghost town, some wipe-out - and this is what the gloom and doom that the Leader of the Opposition preaches is all about! I would suggest that he stops the fear campaign, that he understands there is a responsibility on all of us in this chamber to face the challenges that this nation faces, but to do it constructively, do it with a spirit of enterprise, do it with a spirit of conviction and do it with a spirit of purpose and opportunity, not the fear campaign.                              The Leader of the Opposition is a hollow man. The Leader of the Opposition stands for nothing. He opposes everything. What regional development wants is a positive constructive approach. They will get it from us, but they will not get from you.              </DOC>

                                                      To the Leader of the Opposition: I have answered questions like this in comparable terms from the opposition before. I would ask the Leader of the Opposition to direct his attention to the facts: that a number of economies have carbon pricing; to the fact that 850 million people live with carbon pricing; and to the fact that new nations are agreeing, in their domestic economies, to put a price on carbon. Nations such as the Republic of Korea have agreed in recent times to putting a price on carbon in their economy. We have also seen pilot programs being developed in provinces in China, and these are joining the scheme. Countries across the European Union and a number of American states - and of course we are talking about very sizeable economies - also have carbon pricing. And the list goes on.                                                                                  On 1 July, when our nation moves to carbon pricing, we - more than 20 million of us - will join 850 million other people on our planet who live in economies with carbon pricing. People will of course see tax cuts, family payment increases and pension increases and a nation with a clean energy future. What they will not see at any point are any of the predictions of the Leader of the Opposition come true.                              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Robertson for her question. I know she, like so many members across the parliament, has been concerned to see this parliament work together to achieve change and to enable our nation, following the High Court case, to have offshore processing of asylum seekers. We saw in this parliament yesterday just how deeply many members of this parliament feel about this issue, and no-one can fail to have been moved by the tragedies that we have seen in recent days with the loss of life at sea. I think across this parliament we are rightly fearful that we will see more losses of life at sea if people continue to get into boats, many of them unseaworthy, having paid a people smuggler to try to get to our shores. So it is the right thing to do to send an effective message of deterrence. It is the right thing to do to seek to deter people from making those dangerous journeys. And all of us want to see the evil people who ply a people-smuggling trade and profit from it brought to book and taken out of working that kind of evil and seeking to profit on misery.                              This has been the subject of much heated debate in this parliament, but the time for that kind of heat is gone. Now is the time to get an effective outcome to the parliamentary deliberations. Yesterday the House of Representatives expressed its will about new laws to enable offshore processing. The new laws that the House endorsed do not represent the government's plan. They do not represent the opposition's plan. They bring together the key elements of both the government's plan and the opposition's plan. That means that that bill was asking everybody to take a step forward, to move from a rigid position and to embrace compromise and change. That bill - that compromise proposition moved by the member for Lyne - was adopted by this House and is now before the Senate. We are now in a very straightforward situation: either we can leave this parliament with laws that enable offshore processing at the end of this parliamentary day or we can fail the test of getting laws in place. It is a yes or no divide now, and I urge every senator, no matter their party political persuasion, to work today with their fellow senators to ensure that we see these laws adopted and that parts of the government's plan combined with parts of the opposition's plan can be put into effect in the weeks ahead.              </DOC>

  To the Deputy Leader of the Opposition's question: I remember the time that Premier Barnett in Western Australia was making positive statements about emissions trading. That would have been the same time that the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition were making positive statements about putting a price on carbon. In Western Australia, as I understand it, the Leader of the Opposition has been saying to the Premier of Western Australia that he is concerned about the large-scale electricity price rises that are being imposed on the Western Australian people because of actions of the Barnett government. The Leader of the Opposition in Western Australia has been making the point that Premier Barnett today, even though he has made positive statements in the past about emissions trading and as I understand it went to see an Al Gore speech when Al Gore was here a number of years ago, has now, like the Leader of the Opposition himself, changed his position. The Leader of the Opposition in Western Australia has been making the point that it is one thing for Premier Barnett to criticise the federal government when the federal government is providing extensive assistance to households; it is another thing for Premier Barnett to answer up to the fact that he is rapidly increasing electricity prices for the people of Western Australia - nothing to do with carbon price but all about the actions of the state government in Western Australia - and he, Premier Barnett, is not offering families effective assistance. That is the point of the Leader of the Opposition in Western Australia, and I can well and truly understand why he is making it -                                                                     Ms GILLARD:                    given the price rises that Premier Barnett has imposed on the people of Western Australia.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Fraser for his question. It is a very important one as we wait for the vote in the other place, as we wait to see whether we can put an effective deterrent in place against people smugglers. The member for Lyons's private member's bill is the best chance of legislation to pass this parliament that would allow offshore processing. This bill is a compromise. It is a private member's bill that would allow for the implementation of the Malaysia agreement and the opening of a detention centre on Nauru. It is in line with the compromise offer made by the government to the opposition last year. The coalition says, of course, it is the party of offshore processing. Today they have an opportunity to be the party that votes for offshore processing.                              I am asked what compromises were put on the table to see this bill passed. They have all been put on the table by the government. The only change we saw from the opposition yesterday was an attempt to stop one of their own MPs crossing the floor to support the bill. The only change we have seen from them has been an attempt to block a bill being passed, not an attempt to see a bill passed and implemented as law. The coalition's amendment is explicitly designed to try to stop the implementation of government policy.                              Does the opposition seriously suggest that future governments should be authorised to send asylum seekers to Iran, Afghanistan, the Congo and Somalia - all signatories to the refugees convention - but not a regional neighbour prepared to work with Australia and the UNHCR to improve protection outcomes and provide a deterrent? We heard a lot from the opposition yesterday about the treatment of children and we heard a lot of contradictory and false things from the opposition yesterday about the treatment of children. But there were some opposition members raising, I am sure, legitimate concerns about the treatment of children in the Malaysia agreement. For those members who raised those legitimate concerns, they are justified to go to the Leader of the Opposition today and demand that he immediately drop the tow-back policy - that he immediately abolish his policy of returning boatloads of people, potentially full of children, to a country which is not a signatory to the refugee convention, with no protections guaranteed or negotiated at all. That is their policy. That is the policy they repeat constantly -                                                                     Mr BOWEN:                    and opposition members are entitled to demand its dropping immediately on the basis of those concerns.                              The Malaysia arrangement provides a massive disincentive to make that boat travel to Australia. The Nauru detention centre alone does not. That is why, after Nauru was opened in 2001, people continued to arrive in Australia. The SIEVX arrived after the opening of the Nauru detention centre, with the drowning of 353 men, women and children. We want a real deterrent in place. That is why we are passionately arguing this in this House and the other house.              </DOC>

  I thank the Leader of the National Party for his question. Can I say to him, absolutely, the carbon price is being paid by less than 500 businesses in Australia -                                                                     Ms GILLARD:                    and no amount of squealing by the opposition frontbench changes that fact. The Leader of the Opposition today and on other occasions has referred to the Australian scheme as an economy-wide carbon price. He is obviously trying to create the false impression in the minds of people that small businesses are paying this price or households are paying this price, whereas the price is paid directly by less than 500 businesses. Indeed, if you take an economy-wide look in Australia, Australia will have around 60 per cent of its emissions covered where other nations, including Denmark, Norway, Switzerland and Sweden, have broader schemes which cover 70 per cent or more of their emissions.                              On the synthetic greenhouse gases that the Leader of the National Party raises with me, and these include some gases that are used as refrigerants, the issue here is an import levy for these gases which was first introduced by the Howard government in 2003. Let me repeat that in case anybody has missed it: these levies began under the Howard government. When they began under the Howard government, Dr Kemp, the then Minister for the Environment and Heritage - many of us remember Dr Kemp from his days in the parliament - said this:                              As a party to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Australia is required to adopt policies and measures to mitigate climate change. The amendments introduced by this bill will deliver on this government's -                               that is, the Howard government's -                               commitment to manage synthetic greenhouse gases -                                                                     Ms GILLARD:                    I believe the member was in parliament in 2003, so he would have voted for this piece of legislation which imposed this levy. If he is unhappy with his vote now he might want to ring up Dr Kemp or Mr Howard and explain that he no longer supports Howard government policies.                              What we see, of course, is the use of these gases in things like domestic refrigeration. There is a price. In terms of refrigeration we are talking about $4 when you re-gas your fridge. As people know, you do not re-gas your fridge every day.               </DOC>

  I thank the member for New England for his question. I can get a question from outside of the chamber; it is just that it is always from the crossbenches.                              The member for New England has indeed made strong representation, as have other crossbench members from regional communities, to ensure that there is continued access for regional services into Kingsford Smith airport. That is absolutely vital and it is critical when that access is there. It is critical that it be during peak periods so that people in rural communities, be they from Tamworth, Port Macquarie or Armadale, can get access into Sydney in the morning, do work and get home in the evening. This government is absolutely committed to making sure that that is the case.                              The slots used by regional airlines for intrastate services at Sydney Airport are protected under the Slot Management Scheme. Regional airlines currently hold about one-quarter of the slots between 7 am and 9 am. These airlines use smaller aircraft, such as the 34-seater Saab 340s and the 30-seater BAe Jetstream J41s through Brindabella.                               There will be no change to that under this government because it is absolutely vital that regional services continue to have that protection. I know that there are members on the other side, including the member for North Sydney, who understand how important this is. But what we know is that if the services are going to grow we need a second airport for Sydney. Unless we have that, the pressure will continue to be on.                              We know that Sydney Airport is full, but there is some support across the parliament for a second airport. The real concern is those people who do not support a second airport, be they the owners of Sydney Airport or those supporters of Max Moore-Wilton, who do his bidding and who think that is more important than access for regional communities.                              The Leader of the National Party had this to say on ABC Illawarra on 16 April. He said two things. One: 'We want larger aircraft in.' Secondly, he said that the extension of KSA can occur 'through better use of neighbouring airports in places like Bankstown'. They will not be A380s going into Bankstown; they will be smaller aircraft, which is what some of his plan is. That is what Sydney Airport would like to do. Under this government it will not occur, but the National Party need to make very clear to people in regional communities why it is that they will stand up for the owners of Sydney Airport and not stand up for their interests -                </DOC>

                                    I thank the member for Moreton for his question. Yesterday another boat sank and more people died. At 9:30 pm yesterday, the search-and-rescue effort was suspended. The advice of Border Protection Command is that there were 134 people on the boat. One hundred and thirty lives were saved - 113 men, three women, 12 boys and two girls. The body of one person who died has been recovered; three more have not been found.                              Yesterday, as we were debating here in this chamber, there were reports of another vessel that was in distress some 20 nautical miles off the coast of Indonesia. I am advised that this appears to have been a false alarm. Late yesterday, at about 10:30 pm, another boat arrived, carrying another 100 people who put their lives at risk trying to get to Australia. They arrived safely, but in the last 12 months more than 300 people have not been so lucky. Two hundred people died in December; 11 died in February; 90 died last week; four died yesterday. We can stop this.                              Yesterday the debate here was about Malaysia or Nauru; today the debate is about whether we do both or whether we do nothing. It is not good enough when people are dying to just vote no. We have made compromises, and it is time for the opposition to do the same. We have made compromises -                                                                     Mr CLARE:                    We are all taught when we are young that, if there is an ambulance with its sirens on, we have to move; that we have to change lanes -                                                                   The member for                   Dickson                   then left the chamber -                                                                                     Mr CLARE:                    and give a bit of ground. It is on its way to an emergency and, if we let the ambulance through, it can save lives. That is what the opposition needs to do today - let the bill through to save lives.              </DOC>

  Once again the opposition misleads about the nature of carbon pricing, and once again the opposition is there trying to scare and confuse people. We are very focused on making sure that we assist pensioners. That is why as a government we have been proud to deliver an historic increase in pensions. We understood how difficult pensioners find it to make ends meet - we well and truly understood that. An historic increase in pensions has been delivered under this government.                              When it came to putting a price on carbon, having delivered that historic increase to pensioners, we of course wanted to make appropriate arrangements to ensure that we were helping pensioners. So we have provided and will continue to provide additional money to pensioners, which means that pensioners will see more assistance than they require for the average impact of carbon pricing upon them. We have deliberately designed the scheme to provide an extra 20 per cent because we wanted those Australians who are of limited means to have the additional assistance.                              Pensioners are seeing an increase, for example, of $338 in the single pension. We have prepaid that increase. Pensioners around the country in their millions have received money already, and they will keep receiving money from March next year. Three million pensioners have already received assistance, and in March next year they will keep receiving assistance because we want to make sure that we are always looking after our pensioners.                              So, in terms of the prices in aged care, of course any adjustments there have been factored into the very modest cost-of-living increase from carbon pricing - less than a cent in a dollar - and assistance has been provided to pensioners so that they are receiving more assistance than they need for the average impact of carbon pricing.                              The real risks for Australian pensioners are from the opposition's plan to claw these benefits away and then the opposition's plan to slash the kinds of services older Australians rely on, such as health services, by $70 billion.

  I thank the member for Reid for his question. The member knows carbon pricing starts on 1 July; and the member knows that on that date Australians, who are a very practical people, will have the ability to judge for themselves what the impact of carbon pricing is. They will be able to assess the claims that have been made about carbon pricing by the Leader of the Opposition and the opposition front and back bench teams. Australians, as a practical people with common sense, will be able to see the impacts of carbon pricing.                              After 1 July they will be able to assess: has the coal industry been brought to an end? Is no-one working in coal anymore? Is there no more investment in coal? Or will they in fact see coalmines continue to work and our coal industry continue to expand? They will be able to assess whether the town of Whyalla is still functioning or has been wiped off the map. They will be able to assess whether the price increases at their local supermarket have been astronomical, as promised by the Leader of the Opposition. They will be able to assess whether Australia has immediately entered a 'permanent depression', as the Leader of the Opposition has claimed. They will be able to assess whether all of the claims of the Leader of the Opposition - whether it is a wrecking ball through the economy, squeals of pain from puppies or any of these things - are coming true on 1 July.                               In fact, what they will see is our economy transforming over time into a clean energy economy. They have already seen increases in family payments, and that assistance will be continued. Pensioners have already seen assistance turn up in their bank accounts, and that assistance will be continued. From the pay period after 1 July many Australians will see tax cuts. People earning less than $80,000 a year will see a tax cut and some people who pay tax today will pay no tax - because if you earn $18,200 or less you will not give a cent of that to the tax man.                              These are the changes that Australians will see. These are the facts about carbon pricing. What is it all about? It is about cutting our carbon pollution in the most effective and least-cost way. That is what Australians will see from 1 July. The Leader of the Opposition will then be called to account for every false statement he has made to the Australian people as a result of his relentless negativity.              </DOC>

  In response to the member's question, poorer Australians - people who live on fixed incomes such as, for example, the pension - will get more assistance than they need to deal with the impact of carbon pricing; 20 per cent more. The Australians he says he is concerned about will actually have more money in their pockets as a result of the extra payments that are flowing through to them. That is a fact. I am sure that, if the member is genuine and serious in his concern for these poorer Australians, he would want to see these poorer Australians with more money in their pockets, and that is what this government has determined to do. That is what is happening right now with people getting prepayments, for example, of additional moneys going into their pension.                              The member who says he is concerned about these issues ought to direct his attention to the right place: not to this government which, in the course of carbon pricing, has sought to benefit low-income households, but to state governments which have had huge electricity price rises without a cent of assistance to Australians and, most particularly, poorer Australians. He might then like to direct his attention to a state government like the O'Farrell government in New South Wales which wants to engage in a public housing rip-off. Barry O'Farrell wants to grab money that we sent some of the poorest Australians - those who are most at risk - out of their purses and wallets and stuff it into his budget because he cannot make it add up. So if the member is genuinely concerned about the poor then he should get on the phone to Barry O'Farrell today and say, 'Don't steal money from people in public housing.' When he is finished with that call he might say to Barry O'Farrell, 'Do something about the increases you are putting on electricity.' Then he can ring Premier Newman, Premier Baillieu and Premier Barnett on exactly the same point.                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    Let me clearly say, my concern is that we will continue to see state Liberal governments smashing into these households. Premier Newman, for example, has given absolutely no guarantee about not ripping off money from public housing tenants. They may well be under attack from state Liberal governments, but they will see extra assistance and help from this government every step of the way because we are a Labor government and that is what we do.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Capricornia for her question. She represents one of the great engine rooms of the Australian economy, with a very important coal industry in that area which is growing all the time. Despite all of the volatility in the global economy, we received another stunning vote of confidence in the future of our economy yesterday. We had a report from the Bureau of Resources and Energy Economics which looks at the pipeline of investment in resources, and they forecast that our resource and energy export earnings will reach a record high of $209 billion in 2012-13. That is underpinned by strong growth in iron ore, in coal and in LNG. And we know there is more to come, because we have a pipeline here that is worth up to half a trillion dollars.                              Just today we have seen Yancoal list on the Stock Exchange for $4 billion. This is an industry that the Leader of the Opposition said is going to be annihilated on Sunday. Yancoal listed for $4 billion today. Also, we have had the announcement from Santos that they are going to bring forward $2.5 billion of capital expenditure on a major project at Gladstone right through to now. This is another huge vote of confidence, particularly in our resources sector but most particularly in our economy and in the policies of the government.                              All of this deals a very serious blow to the scare campaign from the Leader of the Opposition, because the world is not going to end on Sunday. As the Prime Minister said, the sun is going to rise in Whyalla - and of course the Special Minister of State will be there with his mum - and the coal industry is going to continue to expand. For the Leader of the Opposition, Sunday is going to be the equivalent of the Y2K virus. He has told Australians to build up their stores of bottled water and head for the bathroom in the morning. None of these things will be necessary because none of the doom and gloom that has been promised by the Leader of the Opposition will come to pass.                              Our economy will continue to grow and, of course, we will continue to provide the assistance in the Clean Energy Future package to the pensioners, wage earners and families of Australia. We will do all of that, but that will be ripped off by the Leader of the Opposition should he come to power so he can give a tax cut to his mate Clive Palmer. We know they have had a lovers' tiff, but I have heard they made up overnight. There has been a fix put in. They had a little sandpit tantrum the other day but they are friends again. The truth of it is this: the Leader of the Opposition will go in to bat for billionaires -                </DOC>

  Thanks very much, Madam Deputy Speaker. It is just a shame they did not get the member for Mitchell to ask this one. The pamphlet that was enclosed in the letter that has been distributed to small businesses all around this country is a pamphlet that has the potential to mislead consumers. The ACCC has made it clear that businesses that jack up their prices and falsely blame the carbon price for those price increases may be subject to the provisions of the Competition and Consumer Act. The sanctions that apply to offences under that act include a fine of, in the case of individuals, up to $6,600 or, in the case of a corporation, $1.1 million. This is a very serious matter. The truth of this particular matter is that the Leader of the Opposition, in encouraging businesses to put up a pamphlet that suggests that any price increases that the businesses may pass on may in fact be a direct result of the carbon price, is potentially misleading. The ACCC has confirmed as much.                              What is most important in relation to this matter is that the people who are likely to be in the firing line include, in fact, not the Leader of the Opposition - we know that he has been misleading at every stage of this debate - but the people who could unwittingly be drawn into this particular matter are those small businesses that may, if they act upon the advice of the Leader of the Opposition, put this pamphlet up in their window. If they increase prices by more than what is attributable to the carbon price, in those cases they may well be guilty of misleading their consumers.                              We make no apologies on this side for standing up for the rights of consumers. We do not believe that it is appropriate for businesses to jack up their prices unfairly and to falsely blame that on the carbon price.                                                                    Mr BRADBURY:                    The difference between the government and the opposition on this issue is that the Leader of the Opposition wants businesses to jack up their prices. He has decided that it is in his political interest for businesses to jack up their prices so that his campaign of gloom and doom -                                                                     Mr BRADBURY:                    which we all know has been hyperbole, can have some justification. The fact of the matter is that 1 July is coming around very soon and we will see that it will not be the cobra strike; it will not even be a python squeeze. At that point the Leader of the Opposition will be exposed for the fraud that he is.                              Leave not granted.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Parramatta for her question. When it comes to important economic and environmental reforms like carbon pricing, the community expect leadership and they do not expect the silly sort of nonsense that the Leader of the Opposition has gone on with. What we have heard over the last 12 or 18 months from the Leader of the Opposition is an extraordinary number of reckless, irresponsible and downright deceitful statements about carbon pricing. With carbon pricing coming in from this Sunday -                                                                     Mr COMBET:                    and with his two-week tour of doom and gloom that we have heard about upcoming, it is worthwhile just reflecting upon some of the deceitful statements that the Leader of the Opposition has made. Let's start with the contention that carbon dioxide has no weight at all. We are trying to encourage students into maths and science. What sort of leadership is that type of silliness? A year ago he forecast that, from Sunday, 45,000 jobs would be lost in energy intensive industries and another 126,000 jobs lost mainly in regional Australia. They are all gone from Sunday - nearly 200,000 jobs gone from Sunday, forecast by the prophet of doom. The facts, of course, are pretty different. The economy is in good position. It is growing well. Jobs are forecast to grow by 1.6 million through to 2020. Jobs will grow under carbon pricing.                              Another one of his claims is:                              I've never been in favour of a carbon tax or an emissions trading scheme.                              But, in fact, on the record, on camera, he has supported both on different occasions. Try this old favourite. He said that the price increases from carbon pricing will be 'unimaginable'. It might betray a lack of imagination, but really it is just completely deceitful, because we know, of course, that the price impacts will be very modest. According to reports just yesterday, both Coles and Woolworths, from which most Australians buy their produce, have ruled out price increases on 1 July and have said that energy savings will allow them to absorb the costs. It is not any wonder that the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow minister for small business are now trying to incite price rises, because their position is so fraudulent and so deceitful. They should be ashamed and they will be exposed.              </DOC>

  There are synthetic greenhouse gases that have a global warming impact more than a thousand times more potent than carbon dioxide. The Howard government had the courage to recognise that and impose a levy -                                                                     Ms GILLARD:                    I see, so they are into an amount of money that businesses pay for the Leader of the Opposition. He voted for it, he supported it when he was in government - more hypocrisy, more ridiculousness from the Leader of the Opposition and his team.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Makin, a proud South Australian. Shell is investing $30 billion in Australia, in the full knowledge of a carbon price; Rio Tinto, another $3.7 billion in the Pilbara; and BHP, $833 million in the Illawarra. However, I am asked about the effects of inaccurate claims. We have heard that the following places will be wiped off the map on Sunday: Whyalla, Gladstone, Kwinana, Portland, the Latrobe Valley, the Hunter Valley and the Illawarra. The opposition leader is trying to terrify these communities, destroy jobs and destroy confidence in them. The 'great Whyalla wipe-out' will not occur on Sunday but, just to be sure, I will be going to Whyalla with the Special Minister of State and I will be meeting his mum. I will be taking my sky-high measuring device -                                                                     Dr EMERSON:                    We will be checking the height of the sky, because Chicken Little will be proved wrong. The sky-height measuring device will show that Chicken Little is wrong: the sky will not fall in. Obviously an indication of a falling sky would be failing light, so I will be taking my light meter too. When I try it, I go to the opposition and it is dark; here, it is light - forces of darkness, forces of light, forces of darkness, forces of light!                              We will be doing everything we can to ensure that these communities are protected. The light will be good. It will be game on, and game on means the end of the fear and smear because the Gillard Labor government is a triumph of hope over fear, of ideas over smear, and we will prevail.              </DOC>

  As to the Leader of the Opposition's question, the government has endorsed in principle the recommendations of this report here, a report put together by three very eminent Australians - Angus Houston, a former Chief of the Defence Force; Michael L'Estrange, a foreign policy expert; and Paris Aristotle, an expert in refugee and asylum seeker issues. It is this that has guided the government and I want to take this opportunity to thank those three eminent Australians for their work. Yesterday of course we saw people, out on the politics, claiming what the scoreboard was out of this report. The truth is that for every political party in this parliament, including the government and including the opposition, aspects of this report endorse parts of their policy and aspects of this report reject parts of their policy. That is the truth of this report. I say it frankly about the things that the government has advocated. It is also true about the things that the opposition has advocated.                              That is the conclusion of Angus Houston's panel and its work. I think it is incumbent upon us now to put aside those political scoreboards and that point-making, to put aside the shouting and the rhetoric that has characterised this debate, and to actually get on with the job of enacting the recommendations of this report. So the government will later today introduce amendments to the legislation already on the Notice Paper, the government's bill, to amend asylum seeker and refugee law. We have had this morning good faith discussions -                                                                     Ms GILLARD:                    The government later today will seek to introduce amendments that will enable us to commence processing on Nauru and on PNG in the form recommended in this report. There have been good faith discussions between the government and the opposition about these amendments today and I welcome that. It is time to get this done. That is what the Australian nation wants to see.                               On the Leader of the Opposition's question, he would be well aware that this report does not endorse temporary protection visas, that this report says it is not possible to turn boats back in current circumstances. Consequently, because those policies have been rejected by this report, they will not be enacted by the government. We will be guided by this report. We have in principle endorsed each and every recommendation in it and we are determined to get on with the job.               </DOC>

  I thank the member for Greenway for her question and note that she is back from maternity leave and that baby Octavia is in the gallery watching Mum at work. It is great to see baby Octavia and husband Michael there. How intriguing question time is for young children, we are about to test, I suspect. But it is good to see them in the gallery today.                               The member for Greenway, on her return from maternity leave, has asked me a very important question. As I just indicated in answer to the question from the Leader of the Opposition, three eminent Australians who deserve our thanks have delivered a very important report, and the government has endorsed in principle the recommendations of this report.                               We are seeking urgently to amend legislation so that we can, as recommended by this report, commence offshore processing in Nauru and on PNG. We are seeking to do that urgently, as recommended by the report. I have today been briefed by the chief of our defence force, who has advised me that, if the parliament works to pass the legislation recommended by Angus Houston and his team this week, it will be possible for the Defence Force to deploy reconnaissance teams on Friday to Nauru and to PNG. The work of those reconnaissance teams would be to scope the task of constructing appropriate facilities in both locations.                               I have today spoken to the President of Nauru and the Prime Minister of PNG. I have explained to them the findings of the Angus Houston report and that the parliament is considering legislative amendments this week. I have received from both men an assurance that they are prepared to work with Australia on their nations hosting regional processing centres, as recommended by the Houston report. They have also indicated to me that they would welcome the reconnaissance teams on Friday and that they would be prepared to see early construction works of temporary facilities following the work of those reconnaissance teams. Of course, we need to work with those nations in order to secure a comprehensive agreement for these centres.                               That means that if this parliament can act this week then action on the ground will be starting as soon as the reconnaissance teams land into PNG and into Nauru on Friday. I believe this parliament should not fail the test of putting those reconnaissance teams in that position so that we can get on with the job of saving lives at sea, of a better approach to refugee and asylum seeker issues.               </DOC>

  As the shadow minister is well aware, for some time now the government has indicated that it has been prepared to compromise in order to secure offshore processing. In particular, for some time now the government has indicated that it was prepared to compromise and to have a detention centre in Nauru, to embrace that aspect of the opposition's plan in order to see action and change. Whilst the government was prepared to compromise, that was not met by compromise from the opposition; in those circumstances, where the parliament was gridlocked, I asked three eminent Australians to provide a report to chart the way forward, and they have done a very good job indeed.                               Consequently, we are now prepared to act. We are prepared to act in the terms of this report. We have been prepared for some time now to have offshore processing. Having received this report, we are now determined to see offshore processing in the form recommended by Angus Houston and his team.                              As the member who asked the question would be well aware, Angus Houston and his team are recommending an integrated package. They are recommending a package that has a different approach to Nauru and PNG than that taken in the past. In particular, they are very clear on the need to ensure that there are no incentives for people to get into boats, and consequently they have made a recommendation, controversial in the eyes of many, that you equalise times on Nauru and Manus Island to the times that people would have experienced in processing and resettlement if they had not got on a boat. This different approach to Manus and PNG is part of an integrated package, which includes lifting the number of refugee places for refugees who are resettled in Australia and a different approach to family reunion, building on the work already done for the Malaysia agreement. This is a comprehensive report with an integrated package of recommendations, and that is why the government has endorsed it in principle as a whole.                              I would say to the opposition that they have the opportunity today to work with the government to enable offshore processing to start on Nauru and in PNG. The Australian public do not want to see further politicking on this; they want to see action. We are prepared to engage in further compromise in endorsing in principle the recommendations of the Houston report. I know we are working in good faith with the opposition. I think that is a good thing in Australia's national interest.              </DOC>

  I thank the honourable member for his question. I am sure the whole House would like to thank Angus Houston, Michael L'Estrange and Paris Aristotle for their fine work and their very thorough report - three men with very different backgrounds but with one common objective: to find a way to save lives. And, just as the Prime Minister and the government hoped when this report was commissioned, this expert panel of non-political, eminent Australians has presented a new way forward. It presents a new opportunity for this House and, importantly, for the other house to stop the flow of boats and to stop people dying at sea. The time for action was long ago but certainly cannot be delayed any further.                               Saving lives has been what this is all about. Nobody could stand at the memorials at Christmas Island, as I and other members have done, and look at those memorials and not be moved to act about the loss of life. Nobody could talk to somebody who has lost their children in a boat tragedy or talked to a child who has lost their parent and not be committed to doing everything possible to save lives at sea.                              We want to give more vulnerable people, more persecuted people, the chance of a new life in Australia. Australia already takes more processed refugees than any other country in the world bar the United States and Canada, and our move to increase our resettlement program to 20,000 will mean that we are the second biggest recipient of refugees in the world - a very good thing. But the Australian people rightly want a fairer system and a safer system in providing haven to the world's refugees.                              The underlying thesis of this report, as the Prime Minister has said, is that people who arrive in Australia by boat should not be advantaged in their efforts to seek resettlement. Now, that is controversial, but in my view it meets the test of common sense and it meets the test of fairness. I do not think this House or the other house should take the view that people who arrive by boat should be advantaged over those in camps in difficult situations around the world, wanting the chance of a resettlement place in Australia.                              It is unacceptable to do nothing. We have to accept this advice and act in the national interest today. And that is why I will move these amendments this afternoon. We would appreciate the assistance of the opposition in their passage through this House and the other house. This is an opportunity that cannot be missed, and we will look to get on with the job not only of implementing the panel's recommendations of increasing the refugee intake and of centres on Nauru and PNG, but also of implementing the arrangement with Malaysia, as recommended. We cannot let this opportunity pass. The Australian people expect no less -                </DOC>

  The member backs in the point I was making in answer to the earlier question, which is that the government were well and truly prepared to compromise in the last parliamentary session in order to secure legislation so that we could commence offshore processing. We were prepared to compromise. That is the history of this matter, but I do not think the Australian people are interested in who said what. They are interested in action. They are interested in change. They are frustrated when they look and do not believe that the people in this parliament have been able to work together to get change.                              The Australian government have been prepared to compromise, and we are prepared now to endorse in principle the full set of recommendations of the Houston report.                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    As I was just about to say on the question of processing on Nauru, the government received advice about what the impact of having a detention centre on Nauru would be if it took that step. We received that advice; the Leader of the Opposition received that advice. The advice from the Houston report takes a different approach. The advice from the Houston report does not recommend one strategy; it recommends an integrated package. The aim of the integrated package is to ensure that if people risk their lives at sea, if people give their money to a people smuggler, they get no advantage from it. So one element of that integrated package is a regional processing centre on Nauru which would operate in a different way than detention centres in Nauru have operated in the past, and, in particular, the operation in Nauru would have built into it the same amount of waiting time to get a resettlement opportunity as people would have experienced before they risked their life at sea, before they gave a people smuggler their money. That is the difference: the breadth of the package, the interlocking nature of the recommendations, and the change to the recommendations about what should happen on Nauru and on PNG.                              The real question before the parliament today is not these political calibrations as they are being played out now and as they were played out yesterday by so many politicians who wanted to front a television camera to tell the TV audience who had won and who had lost. That is not what the Australian people are looking to us to do.               </DOC>

  I thank the member for Melbourne for his question. He is going to an aspect of the Houston panel's work which I know lots of people find very, very challenging. It has been the subject of discussion between members of the government who are finding it challenging. It is a challenging recommendation. Angus Houston and his team are asking us to take some advice, including from UNHCR, to work out what kind of time people would have waited to be processed and get resettlement opportunities if they had not moved - if they had not paid a people smuggler, if they had not got on a boat - and to use that time so that people in Nauru and PNG do not get a resettlement opportunity before that time has expired. That is a challenging recommendation, but I think people can see the policy merits of it, as pointed out by the panel, which are to ensure that people do not get an advantage from having risked their lives at sea, with so many people of course losing their lives at sea, or from having paid a people smuggler.                              To the member for Melbourne: we in the government are of course going to work this through to ascertain what the appropriate time is. In doing that, we will be guided by the advice of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. We cannot today, having received this report at 7 am yesterday, give the member for Melbourne or anybody else in the parliament a concluded view about that. We will need to work with UNHCR, as recommended by the panel, to work out those times that people are likely to be on Manus Island or on Nauru. I know the member for Melbourne is likely to have a very different view from me, but I would say to him that when we are seeing so many people lose their lives at sea we have got an obligation to act. Some of that action does challenge people, but I believe the panel has charted a comprehensive way forward, and that is why the government has provided in-principle support to each recommendation, including that one.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Robertson for her question. I know that she, like all members of the government, is concerned about the impact of electricity prices on family budgets and that she would hear very, very routinely from the people of her electorate about the impact of a more than 60 per cent increase in electricity prices in New South Wales over the past few years. That electricity price increase has not come with any form of assistance to the community in general. People have not been supported as electricity prices have skyrocketed and, at the same time, the dividends being paid by electricity assets owned by the New South Wales government to the government itself have skyrocketed as well.                              I am concerned about this impact of electricity pricing. Of course, there are a number of factors at play here. There is the investment in the -                                                                     Ms GILLARD:                    There is investment in infrastructure, which is necessary because there is a backlog of investment. There is growth in peak demand. There are changes that have raised reliability standards and that have come at a high price, and there is the patchwork design of the National Electricity Market itself. I am also concerned about the dividend gouging of state governments, and I am concerned about a market design which means that if you overinvest in the poles and wires you earn more dividends and you pass that price through to the community. We are concerned about this and determined to act, and that is what the Council of Australian Governments should do and will do at the end of this year in December.                              We have always been very up-front with the Australian people that carbon pricing would increase electricity prices by 10 per cent, and we have also said to the Australian people that we will ensure that they get tax cuts, family payment increases and pension increases, which means that the majority of Australian households will come out in front or square. But I am deeply concerned about these 50, 60 and 70 per cent increases that families have had to bear without a cent of compensation or assistance from state governments. So we are determined to see action at the Council of Australian Governments meeting in December. We would prefer to do that with the cooperation of states and territories, but, if that cooperation is not forthcoming, we are determined to get this done for Australian families.              </DOC>

  The member who asked the question, who is a former minister for immigration and consequently has a great deal of experience in this policy area, is aware that the government was elected to government with a set of policies about offshore processing and the treatment of refugees and asylum seekers which he did not agree with. That is a matter of history that the member is very well aware of.                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    The government implemented those policies, as the member is aware. The government then determined that it was appropriate to have an approach of breaking the people smugglers' business model through the agreement with Malaysia. As the member is well aware - and he had this experience too when he was minister - there were difficulties in the High Court with that approach. The member can probably give chapter and verse about experiencing such difficulties as the minister for immigration. In those circumstances, we came to this parliament in order to amend the relevant legislation. We faced political gridlock, despite offering compromises -                                                                     Ms GILLARD:                    To the member's question: the government then came to parliament to change legislation to enable offshore processing, and we know that we faced a gridlock in this parliament. We sought compromise. We offered compromise and that compromise was not accepted. People will have their views about that history and people will pursue their views in the public arena about that history, I am sure. But I say to the member who asked the question and to others more generally today in this parliament that I believe the time for politicking about this is at an end. The time for action is here.                              I am disappointed that it is apparent that some in this House do not share that view. That is particularly disappointing when we know that people are losing their lives. It is disappointing when we know that people are losing their lives at sea and that we need to act. This parliament has an opportunity to act. I would like us to seize that opportunity to act as early as later today. That is the choice that is now in front of this parliament. I think we should get on with it.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Parramatta for her question, because in recent weeks we have seen more evidence of the outstanding economic performance of the Australian economy and I know it is something that everybody on this side of the House is very proud of. Last week we saw the jobs data. We saw that our unemployment rate had declined to 5.2 per cent. We saw that 14,000 jobs were added in July. We welcome that, but the Leader of the Opposition could not bring himself to welcome that and he had to talk the economy down yet again. We have also seen that headline inflation and underlying inflation have got to their lowest levels in 13 years. The underlying inflation is now at the bottom of the RBA's target band. We have also seen signs of pretty healthy consumption and we have seen some strong retail sales and volumes - some of the strongest we have seen in the last few years.                              So we have had reasonably impressive growth, so much so that our economy is now 10 per cent larger than it was prior to us coming to government. Think about that. When other developed economies around the world have not got back to where they were prior to the start of global financial crisis, our economy is 10 per cent bigger, and you see that reflected in the job creation record that we have had in Australia compared to what is going on in other developed economies around the world. Over 800,000 jobs have been created in the time that this government has been in power. That is something everybody should be proud of, because what it means is that we as a nation have avoided the corrosion that destroys communities that comes with high unemployment. We have avoided the capital destruction to small business that has gone on in so many other developed economies. What it has given us as a country is a resilience and an underlying strength that few other developed economies have.                              Of course, we have a record investment pipeline as well and we have a low cash rate. At 3.5 per cent, it is lower than it was at any time under the last Liberal government. What that means is that, if you have a mortgage of, let's say, $300,000, you are paying something like $4,000 a year less than you were when that crew over there were last in power - $4,000 a year less. We have had the Statement on monetary policy from the Reserve Bank, who are now expecting growth this year to be above trend, to have strengthened. They are also forecasting stronger employment growth on the back of increased productivity growth. So we do have challenges in our economy that flow from a higher dollar, from technological change, from a cautious consumer. But we on this side of the House are proud of the gold-medal-winning performance of the Australian economy.              </DOC>

  I counsel the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to study this report in detail. What she will find when she studies this report in detail is that it is not saying to us: 'Just exactly redo what was done in the past.' It is not saying that. She is consequently verballing the eminent Australians who put this report together, and I suggest she apologise for that.              </DOC>

  The whole point of putting a price on carbon is to reduce carbon pollution, and you do that by sending the biggest polluters a price signal by charging them a price per tonne for the amount of carbon pollution that they put in our atmosphere. At base, it is a very simple concept - one caught by my statement in February, which I will re-explain now for the benefit of the Leader of the Opposition.                              Prior to putting a price on carbon, it was possible for some of our biggest polluters, who generate a lot of carbon pollution, to put that pollution into the atmosphere for nothing; there was absolutely no incentive for change.                              Once you put a price per tonne on carbon pollution, there is an incentive for change because big businesses will want to reduce the impact on them of that price. We already know that there are many businesses and I have met many business leaders who are contemplating changes to the way they run their businesses to reduce the amount of carbon pollution they generate. As a result of putting a price on carbon, we will see less pollution in our atmosphere and we will see a greater use of renewable and clean energy. Yes, there are some flow-through price impacts for the things that people buy and use in their own homes, including electricity, and that increase, which we have always said would be 10 per cent, is 10 per cent. That is why we have provided families with tax cuts, family payment increases and pension increases, which means that the majority of Australian households will come out square or in front.                              I have been talking about power pricing over recent days and I have made it very clear that my concern is that some of the 50, 60 and 70 per cent increases people have seen, without any real attempts at assistance, have been generated by the decisions and conduct of state governments. That Leader of the Opposition now finds himself in a position where he apparently does not care less about a 50, 60 or 70 per cent increase, which does not come with any real assistance, but continues to focus on his scare campaign about carbon.                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    I was making the simple point that we obviously care about these impacts on working families; the opposition has not indicated that they care about those 50, 60 or 70 per cent rises. For the Leader of the Opposition, pricing carbon is about tackling carbon pollution and climate change. It is about sending a price signal to big polluters. He should know because he used to support putting a price on carbon.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Greenway for her question. Today the House has put in place arrangements for offshore processing. Today the House has done what the Australian people have wanted us to do for a long time. We have worked together to get this done. This has happened for two reasons. Firstly, Angus Houston and a team of eminent Australians have provided the parliament, the nation, with a very important report on refugee and asylum seeker issues. I thank them for their work, which is of the highest quality. The report charts a path of change that is very important for our nation, which is why the government has endorsed its recommendations in principle and in full.                              Secondly, the priority recommendations of that report were to establish regional processing centres on Nauru and on Manus Island in PNG. We have been able to do that because the political parties have worked together - the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship working with his counterpart the shadow minister for immigration - on the wording of the amendments that the House has passed. The House has come together in a spirit of compromise, which is what I believe the Australian people wanted to see from us, so that we can get action under way. Action will be under way as soon as Friday, subject to this legislation passing the Senate, with reconnaissance teams deployed to PNG and to Nauru to begin setting up the facilities that will be needed there.                              Today as a House, we can send a very clear message to people smugglers who would seek to prey on other human beings and to seek to persuade them that they are able to sell to them a passage to Australia. Those people smugglers can no longer pretend to those desperate people that they can guarantee them a journey to Australia. This House today can send a very clear message, too - and it has - to asylum seekers who are contemplating risking a voyage at sea. That message very clearly is: do not risk it, do not give your money to a people smuggler because you will not be better off as a result of having taken that step.                              It is important that this parliament has worked together and that today is the day this House has said enough is enough. Today is the day that this House has risen above the politics of this issue and taken the action to save lives.              </DOC>

  I appreciate the question from the shadow Treasurer. He was the parliamentarian who tweeted asking Australians what he should do about climate change, particularly when he has had a lifelong support for a price on carbon.                               So enough of the hypocrisy from the shadow Treasurer - enough of that. We on this side of the House have always believed in putting a price on carbon and, until the leadership of the Liberal Party changed, so did they. The member for Wentworth, when he was Leader of the Opposition, believed in putting a price on carbon. And there is a very good reason for that: so we could encourage investment in renewable energy, because no prosperous, first-world country in the 21st century can remain so unless they price carbon. That was a bipartisan consensus in this parliament.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Moreton for his question, because overnight we did receive more disturbing data from Europe. The euro area GDP contracted by 0.2 per cent in the June quarter, to 0.4 per cent below its level of a year ago. This means that Europe's economy is now two per cent smaller relative to its pre-GFC levels four years on. There could not be a starker contrast between what is happening in Europe and what is happening in our country.                               Our country is now 10 per cent bigger than it was when that crew over there was last in government. One of the reasons it is 10 per cent bigger is the policies we have put in place to protect small business and to protect workers in this country during the global financial crisis and the global recession. Because we did that we are a more prosperous community, but we are also a fairer community. We protected small businesses and we protected the workforce at a time of international contraction, so much so that we have an unemployment rate of 5.2 per cent in Australia - half the rate that is seen in Europe of 11.2 per cent. A total of 800,000 jobs have been created in this country under the government. Of course, we are not weighed down by excessive debt. We have a gold-plated, AAA credit rating from three major global agencies for the first time in our history.                               It does not matter how high our economy jumps, the Leader of the Opposition is always trying to tear it down. Now he has been joined in that endeavour by the Premier of Queensland, who goes out talking down the state economy in Queensland - joining here with the Leader of the Opposition to talk down our economy. That is shameful, because in this environment we have a world-leading economy. Yes, we have challenges, we have a higher dollar, we have cautious consumers, but we understand that we have a bright future - not only creating prosperity but also spreading opportunity. That is why we on this side of the House are supporting tax breaks for 2.7 million small businesses. Who is opposing that? The Liberals. That is why we on this side of the House are supporting families to get their share of the mining boom with additional family payments. And it is why we are providing an additional boost to superannuation for over eight million workers in this country, because we understand how important it is not just to create prosperity but also to spread opportunity right around our country. Every time we put in place policies to do that, we are opposed by those opposite who talk down our economy and who want to give a tax cut to the big end of town by getting rid of the MRRT. They would rather give a tax cut to Clive Palmer than support Australian workers - and that says a lot about their priorities.               </DOC>

  I had the opportunity last night to address the forum that the member for Goldstein is speaking of and had the opportunity when I was there to talk to them about the strength of the Australian economy. Amongst other things, I talked about the strength of investment in Australia. I think it is important to have the facts on the table, so let us get them on the table.                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    Since the government came to office in late 2007, there has been a staggering $919 billion of private business investment that has been happening despite the global financial crisis. New private business investment has been growing by more than 20 per cent over the year since last September - its fastest rate in a decade. Let me repeat that for the member for Goldstein: since last September it has been growing at its fastest rate in a decade. In the March quarter of this year private business investment as a percentage of GDP reached its highest level in the past 40 years, at 16.7 per cent, and we expect it to rise further this financial year and next financial year. We are seeing a huge investment pipeline into our country and there is more to come.                              Of course, because of this huge investment pipeline and because of the strength of our resources sector we have also seen a considerable appreciation in our currency, a very strong Australian dollar. When you talk to people in manufacturing it is the strong Australian dollar that they identify as putting pressure on them. The government has been working with the manufacturing sector for some time now. For example, we have been co-investing with some manufacturers to ensure we continue to make cars in this country, something the opposition wants to slash and burn. We have been investing in skills because they are so important to manufacturing. We have been rolling out the National Broadband Network, because the best of new technology is important to manufacturing.                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    We have been investing in traditional infrastructure too: shortly, I will receive the report from the manufacturing task force that I put together in order to provide the government with further perspectives. On the question of uncertainty and the concern of investors about uncertainty, the member for Goldstein must understand that the source of that uncertainty is the opposition's plans to rip up every economic reform in this country that is contributing to our prosperity.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for La Trobe. I do indeed have some good news for the House: today the highest court in the country has confirmed legislation that was passed by this parliament. That means that Australians will no longer be subjected to tobacco being sold in packaging which is attractive to young people and which entices them to take up what is a deadly and addictive habit. This decision is good news for every parent who worries about their child taking up this habit. I think that it is a good thing for Australia now to be leading the world as the first country to mandate plain packaging of all tobacco products.                              I thought it would be timely to reflect on what has been a long battle with the big tobacco companies. This House would remember the billboards and advertising campaigns that big tobacco took out. Just as an example, I have one that was used. It reads: 'Will plain packaging costs taxpayers billions of dollars?' Of course the court, in deciding today that this was a constitutional act of this parliament, has answered the question tobacco companies asked when they took out an ad, put up billboards and donated money to the Liberal Party - when they said, 'Do not let the taxpayer foot the bill for a bad bill.'                                                                    Ms ROXON:                    I think it would interest the House and the public to know that not only was the law upheld but the big tobacco companies have been ordered to pay the legal costs of the Commonwealth.                                                                    Ms ROXON:                    This time, for the first time, it is big tobacco's turn to cough up. It will not be taxpayers who are footing the bill for this; it will quite rightly be big tobacco. I am intrigued, to be honest, that those opposite would be interjecting on this. This is a bill that the opposition supported, although they were dragged kicking and screaming. I know there are members opposite who believe that this is an important public health measure. Unfortunately, they are not among those on the front bench, who are interjecting about this matter.                              We now know - and this is an important message - that governments can stand up to big tobacco and win. This is an important message not just in Australia but around the world as other countries decide what is the right tobacco control measure for them. When they say, 'We can't take this action because big tobacco will bully us or outspend us,' we will have proved them wrong. I am delighted to be able to say that the High Court has supported this piece of important legislation.              </DOC>

  I think there was an added cruelty, Madam Deputy Speaker, by the acknowledgement of Richmond and the tie, given Sunday's game and the margin involved! But I will answer the member's question on the cost of living for Australian families. Yes, as Prime Minister I am concerned about cost-of-living pressures on Australian families. That is why when we moved to price carbon we also ensured that we tripled the tax-free threshold so people earning less than $80,000 a year would see a tax cut. A number of part-time workers, many of them working women, will see a tax cut of $500. Many will see a tax cut of $300. People who are bringing up children who receive family payments have seen increases in those family payments. And, of course, we have built on our historic increases to the pension with more money for pensioners. These tax cuts, the pension increases and the family payment increases go on. That means that the majority of Australian households will come out either square or in front as a result of the arrangements we have made around carbon pricing.                              But, of course, our cost-of-living concerns about families go well beyond that. That is why we moved away from the Howard government's system of supporting people with childcare costs to a new system where we meet 50 per cent of out-of-pocket costs and make a real difference to the cost of child care. That is why we have introduced the schoolkids bonus in its current form. It is so people see cash in their hand at the time that they need to go out and buy the kids things for school. That is why we are also promising increased family payments, funded by the minerals resource rent tax. Australians are entitled to see their share of this resources boom. That is why over a number of years we have provided tax cuts to people. It is in order to help working Australians with the cost-of-living pressures upon them. We will continue across the board to be working with Australian families to support them as they go about the hard job of raising children and the hard job of getting to work every day.                              As a Labor government, we have a particular concern for those on low and fixed incomes. That is why things like the historic pension increase were so important to us. So, yes, cost-of-living concerns are very important to this government. We have assisted in a range of ways, and we will keep working on cost-of-living pressures, including the unnecessary costs of electricity that have driven prices up by 50, 60 and 70 per cent.              </DOC>

  To the Leader of the Opposition I say, as he well knows - and perhaps he should ask a pensioner about this - we have made sure that pensioners have 20 per cent over and above what they need for the average impact of carbon pricing.                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    That question from the Leader of the Opposition concluded by asking why I do not act to make people, as he said, better off by getting rid of the carbon price. That is what he said. I point out to the Leader of the Opposition - and it may be unpalatable for him - that his so-called plan to repeal carbon pricing, which we all know will never happen, would make pensioners worse off. His so-called plan would make households - including, for example, those with part-time working women who are benefiting from a tripling of the tax-free threshold - worse off. The Leader of the Opposition needs to acknowledge these basic facts.                              We know that the Leader of the Opposition's claims about a carbon price repeal are hollow and that every living Liberal leader has supported a price on carbon. He should at least be explaining to working families that his plan is one which would make millions of Australians worse off.

  I thank the member for Petrie for her question. I know this is an issue very close to her heart. Today's victory in the High Court will save countless Australian lives. It will mean that big tobacco will not be able any longer to use tobacco packages as mobile billboards for their product. It will mean that fewer Australians will ever take up this deadly habit.                              Every year, smoking kills around 15,000 Australians. It accounts for about 10½ per cent of deaths in this country. That is more than 10 times the number of people that died on our roads last year. It is about 30 times more people than the tobacco industry employs in Australia. Because of today's decision, cigarette packages will no longer be able to go with branding that looks cool or sophisticated or macho or feminine. Instead, this is what cigarette packs manufactured from 1 October will look like.                               Because of today's decision, cigarette companies will no longer be able to appeal to young people and get them hooked for life. We know that the tobacco companies' business model relies on getting young people hooked. In fact, 80 per cent of smokers were addicted before they turned 19 years old, and 99 per cent of smokers were addicted before they turned 26. The reason that tobacco companies have to target young people is that their older smokers keep dying. In fact, half of smokers end up dying from smoking.                               We know that young smokers are most responsive to two things. They are responsive to price and they are responsive to packaging. We have done a lot in the area of price, by increasing excise in the recent budget and by reducing the number of duty-free cigarettes that people can bring into Australia. We have listed nicotine replacement therapy on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. We have restricted advertising at point of sale. We have increased the graphic warnings on packets. We have seen bans on smoking in restaurants, workplaces and so on.                               Over the years, this combination of measures has made dramatic inroads in smoking rates in Australia. In 1988, about 30 per cent of people over the age of 14 were daily smokers. We have got that rate down to half that now - about 15 per cent of Australians still smoking. Fifteen per cent is still too high, and we have got a target of getting that down to 10 per cent.                              While we have won this battle today, the war is far from over. Almost half of Aboriginal people still smoke, and about 20 per cent of them die from smoking. We know that a third of teenage mums smoke while they are pregnant. So we still have a lot to do, but today is a great victory.               </DOC>

  As it happens, I know the Belair Hotel and so I would be very interested in seeing the account that the member for Boothby is referring to. It seems to me that the member for Boothby might want to make some inquiries about the impact of escalations in electricity prices in South Australia that have nothing to do with carbon pricing. As the member for Boothby would be aware, the people of South Australia have seen, even before 1 July, very big increases in power prices. The Premier of South Australia has actually acknowledged -                                                                     Ms GILLARD:                    I am very directly talking about electricity prices in South Australia for businesses, including the Belair Hotel, about which I was asked. I am prepared to make some inquiries about the Belair Hotel, as I have just stated. But I am also alerting the member for Boothby, who asked the question. As he would be aware, as other South Australians are, there have been increases in power prices in South Australia that are nothing to do with carbon pricing but raise my concerns about things like overinvestment in poles and wires. The Premier of South Australia has also indicated his concern about the so-called gold-plating of the system. So the member for Boothby may want to think about those factors.                              On the impact of carbon pricing on small business, or even businesses of the size of the Belair Hotel, to the member of the Boothby and to the House in general, we have always indicated that small businesses will be passing through those costs, and that is why we have assisted consumers with tax cuts and family payment increases and pension increases. That is why we have always said, under the modelling, that people would see an increase of 0.7 per cent in the cost of living. That is less than a cent in a dollar.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Kennedy for that very important question. The government does take very seriously the issue that there is inadequate supply of finance to our rural sector. When I was in tropical North Queensland with the member some weeks ago, this issue was raised with me by a number of representatives from the farming community in the areas we visited. It is something I also have heard elsewhere in the country.                              Whilst we had a very good flow of finance, considering global conditions during the global financial crisis, one of our strengths was the strength of our banking sector. So, prudent lending is also very important. I also know from the people I spoke to when I was with the member for Kennedy that there are many people out there with very good businesses who are currently experiencing some challenges in terms of raising finance. That says to me that there is really an issue here. Therefore, I think it is a good idea that we get some representatives of the rural sector together with the banking sector and sit down and talk our way through some of these issues. So, I am pleased to say to the member for Kennedy that we will be having a rural finance roundtable as soon as we can in the coming months, most probably in Brisbane, to sit down and discuss these issues. It is also a broader issue. It is not just about the rural sector. It is also about many people in small business who are having these challenges. So I will take the opportunity to broaden some of those discussions out.                              I take very seriously the challenges to our farming community because I think that in this country our farming community has a very, very bright future. The demand emerging from the growing middle classes in Asia is going to be a very important source of jobs and activity and wealth creation in our rural sector, if we get all of the other policy settings right. It is not just a question of the flow of finance. I also acknowledge that there are questions about market power and a whole host of other questions we are looking very closely at. We have great faith in the future of the rural sector.                              We also know that there are some particular challenges to the rural sector at the moment, particularly in my home state of Queensland - for example, the decision by the Newman government to slash 200 staff from the department of primary industries. I think that is very challenging for the rural sector in that state. Also, their decision to scrap the new biosecurity facility planned for North Queensland, for $18 million, is a dagger to the heart of the rural sector in Queensland. They are also closing the doors of an existing facility in Townsville. These are big challenges for regional Queensland, the slashing of jobs right across our great state by the Newman government, completely contrary to a promise they gave to the people of Queensland.                                                                    Mr SWAN:                    But we will work with the member for Kennedy because we come to the table in good faith.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Deakin for his question. On 1 July the carbon price came into effect. The carbon price is responsive to the climate science. It will cut our carbon pollution and it will drive investment in clean energy. It is already evident that the Leader of the Opposition has run the most mendacious, deceitful campaign in living memory against an important environmental and economic reform. Time will throw further light on the extent of the deceit of the Leader of the Opposition and those opposite in relation to this issue.                              As the Treasury modelling demonstrated, the facts are that the economy will grow with a carbon price in place. Jobs will grow, income will grow and the price impact will be less than one cent in a dollar. And, of course, the government instituted a household assistance package that will provide and is providing an average of $10.10 per week in cash assistance. What that will mean is that millions of households will be better off under the carbon price arrangements.                              The Leader of the Opposition has made a vast array of deceitful claims. Most notable amongst them is that there would be unimaginable price increases. Wrong. Last week the data started coming in. The TD Securities-Melbourne Institute price index showed that prices had risen by just 0.2 per cent, or one-fifth of one cent, in the month of July.                              And it is important to note that that 0.2 per cent increase in consumer prices takes into account all electricity price movements coming into effect from 1 July, including the network costs and other costs. In fact, as the Treasurer pointed out yesterday, underlying inflation is at its lowest point in 13 years. The opposition leader has made other claims - the death of the coal industry: wrong! I have a lot of them in my electorate. Two are currently expanding! And there is $100 billion of investment coming into the coal industry. The Leader of the Opposition claimed there would be no fewer than 45,000 job losses in energy-intensive industries and 126,000 job losses in regional Australia - wrong! During July employment grew by 14,000. He is patently going it alone with carbon pricing.                              While the Leader of the Opposition was in China recently, Shanghai province announced their carbon pricing plan, through an emissions trading scheme that will come into effect next year. At every step of this campaign, the Leader of the Opposition has made deceitful claims, and he will be judged very harshly by people for that.              </DOC>

  I thank the member very much for her question. I am concerned about the 70 per cent price rise in electricity the people of New South Wales have suffered because of, largely, decisions made by the New South Wales government. I am concerned about that. The Leader of the Opposition says that that simply doesn't exist, that the 70 per cent price rises, before 1 July, somehow did not happen. I know that is the position of the Leader of the Opposition but I am surprised that an otherwise intelligent woman would fall for this nonsense. The member knows that she has just quoted a figure that is about electricity price rises from all sources. She knows that the people of New South Wales, and the businesses of New South Wales, have put up with a 70 per cent price increase over the last four years because of actions of the state government largely, because we have problems like dividend gouging, with dividends going to the state government of New South Wales going up by 60 per cent; a continual incentive to invest, and to keep investing, and over-investing, in the poles and wires, so those dividends just keep going up. The member who asked the question knows that. So if she is concerned -                                                                     Ms GILLARD:                    The member who has just raised that point of order completely misunderstood the question and is going down the same deceit campaign we have seen in the past. I was just presented with an electricity figure with an increase from all sources, and I am pointing out that one of the big sources of electricity price rises that the business the member identifies is suffering has been caused by the government of New South Wales and has a lot to do with the dividends that are going into Premier O'Farrell's budget. So, if the member is in any way serious with her concern about this business, I suggest she rings her Liberal mate in New South Wales.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Corangamite very much for his question and for his advocacy for a National Disability Insurance Scheme - and particularly to see a launch of the scheme in his area in and around Geelong. I take this opportunity to also thank the member for Corio for his advocacy as well.                              What both of these members know is that the National Disability Insurance Scheme is being built by this government, and we are very pleased that it is going to start in the area of Geelong. We know that a National Disability Insurance Scheme is very important - very important for people with a disability, very important for people who are caring for those with disabilities.                                                                    Ms MACKLIN:                    We are hearing interjections from the member for North Sydney, who can only say negative things about the National Disability Insurance Scheme. On this side of the parliament we know how important a National Disability Insurance Scheme is. That is why we asked the Productivity Commission to do the major inquiry that it delivered to us just one year ago. The Prime Minister released the report, and of course it showed that the system of care and support for people with disabilities in this country is broken, badly broken, and leaving people with disabilities and their carers to just wait and wait and wait - wait for a wheelchair, wait for a place in respite, wait for the care and support that they need. We are determined to end that wait. That is why, in the most recent budget, the Treasurer announced $1 billion to start the National Disability Insurance Scheme.                              As a result of our commitment we will see the end of a cruel lottery that has existed for far too long right around this country - a cruel lottery that says to people with disability, 'It depends where you live and how you got your disability as to what level of care and support you will receive.'                               I can announce to the House that, in the last fortnight, we have seen New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Tasmania and the Australian Capital Territory agree to be part of the launch of the National Disability Insurance Scheme. People who live in these parts of Australia will see this Labor government deliver a National Disability Insurance Scheme. Just like we delivered Medicare, this government will deliver the National Disability Insurance Scheme.               </DOC>

  I must admit I am not surprised by the Leader of the Opposition's question and I would say to the Leader of the Opposition that if he wants to talk about anniversaries then it is six weeks from 1 July when all of the reckless claims he has made about the Australian economy and the impact of carbon pricing have been proved to be wrong. On 1 July -                                                                     Ms GILLARD:                    Of course, since carbon pricing started on 1 July, according to the TD Securities Melbourne Institute price index inflation has been at 0.2 per cent. That is one-fifth of 1c for every dollar spent. The Leader of the Opposition promised astronomical price rises. Since 1 July, in July we saw 14,000 new jobs created. The Leader of the Opposition promised a wrecking ball through the economy. The Leader of the Opposition predicted the death of the coal industry. Our industry is strong and expanding. He predicted that Whyalla would be wiped off the map and of course the town of Whyalla is still there, despite the Leader of the Opposition's false and wild claims.                              Australia needs a price on carbon in order to reduce carbon pollution, tackle climate change and seize a clean energy future. Prime Minister John Howard understood that because it is basically five years since he said he would put a price on carbon. When Brendan Nelson was Leader of the Opposition, he was committed to a price on carbon. When the member for Wentworth, Malcolm Turnbull, was Leader of the Opposition, he was committed to a price on carbon. And the truth is: the Leader of the Opposition has been committed to a price on carbon in the past and has engaged in this scare campaign for political purposes. Our economy needs a price on carbon. We need a price on carbon for a clean energy future. We need it to reduce carbon pollution. And the Leader of the Opposition should come clean and acknowledge to Australians that, if he were ever Prime Minister, he would keep carbon pricing. He has been in favour of it in the past. Every living Liberal leader is in favour of carbon pricing, and the Leader of the Opposition should be clear with the Australian people that, whether or not he is Prime Minister, carbon pricing is here to stay.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Deakin for his question. The member for Deakin, I am sure, as someone very interested in jobs for Australians in manufacturing today and jobs in manufacturing tomorrow, would be pleased to hear that the report of the non-government members on my manufacturing task force was released today. I thank all of the people who have worked so hard - people from businesses, people from trade unions and people from industry associations like the Australian Industry Group. I particularly thank Innes Willox and Dave Oliver for accompanying me and the Minister for Industry and Innovation at the release today.                              This is an important report about the jobs of one million Australians. One million Australians work in manufacturing. These are good jobs for Australian working people - blue-collar jobs that families have relied on sometimes for generations. I can assure the House that during this time of change in manufacturing we will be working with our manufacturing sector. I want to see strength in manufacturing today and I want us to have a strong manufacturing industry in the future and past the days of the resources boom.                              The people who know about manufacturing know that the pressure on manufacturing today is the strength of the Australian dollar. That point was made very graphically by Innes Willox from the Australian Industry Group at the press conference today, where he said it was the single biggest factor for manufacturing. A strong Australian dollar is there because of the strength of our economy, the strength of our resources sector, the fact that many around the world view us as a safe haven. So our economy is a world leader, but it is putting pressure on manufacturing, and so we want to keep working with manufacturing.                              We already have a range of policies to support the jobs of manufacturing workers: our work with the car industry - to which, of course, the opposition is opposed - and our work on skills, our work on a clean energy future, our work on the National Broadband Network, our work on traditional infrastructure, our work on Australian industry participation, our work on encouraging people to buy Australian, and our work with our great scientific organisations like the CSIRO. But we believe that more can and should be done. I thank the members of the Prime Minister's manufacturing task force, my task force, for their quality work and for their powerful vision of Australia's manufacturing future.              </DOC>

  The carbon tax is designed to decrease carbon pollution. The carbon tax is designed so that our biggest polluters pay a price on carbon pollution.                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    The carbon price is designed to reduce carbon pollution, just as when Prime Minister Howard announced that if he was re-elected in 2007 he would legislate an emissions trading scheme. The purpose of that price on carbon was to reduce carbon pollution, just as when Brendan Nelson was Leader of the Opposition and he was in favour of putting a price on carbon. The purpose of it was to reduce carbon pollution, just as when the member for Wentworth was the Leader of the Opposition and he advocated -                                                                     Ms GILLARD:                    I was asked what the carbon price was designed to do and I am explaining that. I am also explaining that former Prime Minister Howard, Brendan Nelson, the member for Wentworth and, for much of the time that he has been in the Australian parliament, the Leader of the Opposition fulsomely agreed with that proposition. He was in favour of carbon pricing, out there loud and proud, and of course he will return to that.                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    Thank you, Deputy Speaker. In terms of the impact on electricity prices, the government has always been crystal clear about this. We said Australian households and Australian families should expect to see a 10 per cent increase in their electricity prices. They are seeing a 10 per cent increase in electricity prices, and because of that we have provided them with tax cuts, with family payment increases -                                                                     Ms GILLARD:                    The government has always said carbon pricing would affect electricity prices that families pay and that effect would be 10 per cent. It is 10 per cent, and because we knew that there would be that price flow-through we have provided tax cuts, family payment increases and pension increases. What that means is that on average families will see assistance of $10.10. The costs that they will see for electricity are $3.30 a week, the average assistance $10.10 a week.                              Of course, people have struggled with electricity price rises - the 50, 60 or 70 per cent that have proceeded because of the nature of the current electricity market and decisions taken by state governments. I am very concerned about the impact of that on Australian families, pensioners and people with fixed incomes and we intend to act on that.                              Of course, the Leader of the Opposition has described that as a furphy, in stark contrast to what is being said by his state colleagues.                              So we will act on electricity price rises that have come without any real assistance for people. The Leader of the Opposition well knows that carbon pricing has a flow-through impact for electricity - heavens above, he used to be in favour of it.              </DOC>

  In the face of ongoing global uncertainty the Australian economy continues to outperform virtually every other advanced economy. In the year to March our economy has grown by 4.3 per cent. That is more than twice that experienced by other major advanced economies. So far this year 100,000 jobs have been created in Australia - 800,000 jobs during the period of the government.                              And over the year to March, private business investment has grown by 20 per cent, to be at its highest level of GDP in 40 years. And in the past year the advance stage of the investment pipeline in resources has grown by nearly $90 billion. Consider that: over the past year, investment in resources at the advanced stage has grown by $90 billion. All of this has happened in the full knowledge that a carbon price was starting on 1 July.                              All of these facts about economic growth, about the performance of our economy over the past year, absolutely torpedo all of the lies that have been told by the Leader of the Opposition - absolutely torpedo the scare campaign that he has been mounting over the past year.                                                                    Mr SWAN:                    I do withdraw, Madam Deputy Speaker. Over the past year the Leader of the Opposition has been running around like Chicken Little, saying the sky is going to fall in. And, of course, in that time, our economy has gone from strength to strength to strength. So when you look at that data, and see the performance of the Australian economy, and you reflect on all of the distortions that the Leader of the Opposition has been putting in place, you can see that he is unfit for high office - because he is constantly at war with the facts; he does not have the temperament and he does not have the ability to understand what is happening in our national economy. He would rather see the country and the economy fail than this government succeed, because he can never take a position in the national interest. For our part, we are focusing on policies which will grow our economy and spread the opportunities right around the whole of Australia. We understand how important it is to help households, and to help small businesses, that are not in the fast lane of the mining boom.                              We had a motion in the House this morning that celebrated our strong economy, moved by the member for Fraser, and the Leader of the Opposition could not even bring himself to vote for that. This just shows how unfit for high office the Leader of the Opposition is.               </DOC>

  To the Leader of the Nationals question: we have always said we were providing assistance to nine out of 10 households. As a Labor government, in the provision of assistance, we of course have sought to benefit middle- and low-income families. We have sought to benefit people in Australia on fixed incomes, like pensioners; we have sought to benefit those who need that assistance the most. That is what Labor governments do. That is why we have provided a tax cut by tripling the tax-free threshold - because I believe that working Australians who earn less than $80,000 a year should see a benefit, and I believe that part-time working Australians, many of them working women returning after the birth of their children, should see the biggest benefit, and many of them will go from paying tax to paying absolutely no tax at all. Many of them will see themselves $500 or $600 better off.                              Then, of course, we are concerned about those on low- to middle-income families raising kids. It can obviously be a struggle. That is why we have done things separate to pricing carbon, like the schoolkids bonus and like increasing the amount of money for childcare costs. But, as we have put a price on carbon, we have increased family payments and we are intending to do it again, through the minerals resource rent tax, so those families too can get a share of the resources boom.                              Then, being the government that provided an historic increase to pensioners who had waited far too long for that increase - and who certainly had not seen it considered by the former government - we determined to provide pensioners with 20 per cent more than the average impact of carbon pricing on them, because we wanted to make them better off.                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    I know the circumstances of working Australians, pensioners and people raising kids might be a matter of comedy for the opposition, but for the government it is deadly serious business. We will continue to do everything we can to work with those Australians to ensure that we keep the economy strong, to ensure that we manage it in their interest and to ensure that we work with them on the cost-of-living pressures they face - like the big escalations in electricity prices that the Leader of the Opposition is pretending do not exist, because he is worried about offending his Liberal mates in states around the country.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Denison for his question. The member for Denison is raising with me, effectively, a legal issue about the operation of the Australian Fisheries Management Authority. As I am advised, the Australian Fisheries Management Authority has acted in a lawful way. What he is referring to is the work of the advisory committee. It is not the advisory committee that makes the relevant decisions and industry members do not make the relevant decisions; the Australian Fisheries Management Authority does that independently. But perhaps I can say to the member for Denison more broadly that I certainly do understand that there is a -                                                                     Ms GILLARD:                    I am not promising a legal opinion; I am referring to some advice I have received about the Australian Fisheries Management Authority working within the ambit of the Fisheries Administration Act.                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    I was just about to say to the member for Denison that I am well aware of concerns about this vessel, this super trawler, because they have been raised with me by Tasmanian members of the government, and raised with me very clearly. They have heard community concern about this matter, and they have relayed that community concern to me. And I understand that the member for Denison is concerned about the matter too.                              I would just say to the House that the size of a fishing catch is not determined by the size of the vessel; it is determined by the Australian Fisheries Management Authority on what it believes to be the available science on sustainability of the fishing stock. Having said that, there are issues with vessel size in the sense that the bigger the vessel the more fish it can take from a localised area - and I know that is causing some concerns for the community of Tasmania.                              Because we have heard those concerns, the fisheries minister, Senator Ludwig, and the parliamentary secretary, the member for Braddon - who is a Tasmanian himself - have established a special working group to facilitate discussion between the company and interested parties, including recreational fishers. The potential for that localised depletion of fish stocks is one of the areas of discussion and one of the matters under consideration because of these concerns.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Greenway for her question. Last year, acting on the scientific advice, countries around the world, including all the major emitters and including Australia - committed to take on legal obligations from 2020 to reduce greenhouse gas emissions - and of course that is further to the pledges they have made to reduce emissions up to 2020.                              As part of this mendacious and deceitful campaign that the coalition and the Leader of the Opposition have run, the Leader of the Opposition has been claiming that Australia is somehow acting alone: that we are on our own; the rest of the world is doing nothing; nothing is going on; there are no agreements to cut emissions. In fact, last year the Leader of the Opposition had this to say: 'There is no sign, no sign whatsoever, that the rest of the world is going to do things like introduce carbon taxes or emissions trading schemes.'                               At the time that statement was made, New Zealand had an emissions trading scheme and more than 20 countries had had emissions trading for six years. The Kyoto Protocol had been place for quite some period of time. But in that context the Leader of the Opposition's take on international affairs is that the US is not a foreign country. It has all the credibility and quality of his foreign policy observations. In this context I was very surprised to read this morning that the member for Flinders, the shadow minister, has in fact committed the coalition to sign up to the international agreements to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. These are the same agreements that the opposition leader says do not exist - that no-one is committed to. No-one is doing anything! But the fact of the matter is that, try as he might to deny it, many countries are taking action to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions.                               All 27 European Union member countries, including the UK under the conservative government, are cutting emissions. China, Korea, Switzerland, Norway, Sweden, New Zealand and South Africa, are all introducing moves to carbon pricing arrangements to cut their emissions. Those countries know it is the most efficient way to go about all of this. The coalition knows it, and that is why their campaign is a massive fraud - a complete litany of lies; a completely mendacious campaign.                                                                    Mr COMBET:                    I withdraw, Deputy Speaker. Make no mistake about this: the carbon price has come in and people are starting to realise what a fraudulent campaign this is. And they also know that the greatest fraudulent claim of all is that the coalition will repeal it, because everyone knows that the coalition will not and cannot repeal -                                                                     Ms ROWLAND:                    I rise to ask a supplementary question. The minister's answer -                                                                     Ms ROWLAND:                    The minister's answer outlined why facts are important in our efforts to tackle dangerous climate change. Can he give more examples of why this is important.                                                                    Mr COMBET:                    Factual information is very important. Take, for example, the assertion made by the member for Boothby yesterday in relation to the Belair Hotel. It is fascinating that on having a look at the bill the carbon price is, in fact, less than 10 per cent of the cost of the bill - exactly what the government indicated it would be. It is exactly consistent with the Treasury modelling. Misrepresentation, deceit, mendacious claims. The coalition is very fond of anniversaries -                                                                      Mr COMBET:                    The coalition are very fond of anniversaries; that has been raised today. It is three years since the Leader of the Opposition said he supported a carbon tax. That is what it is: it is the third year anniversary of the Leader of the Opposition saying on television that he supported a carbon tax. It is five years since the Howard government indicated that the coalition would introduce a world-leading emissions trading scheme. What hypocrisy! Twelve months ago the Leader of the Opposition said that upon introduction of the carbon price, food prices would go up five per cent. What did we indicate yesterday? TD Securities found a 0.2 per cent increase in consumer prices during July and in that survey they found that food prices were unaffected by the introduction of the carbon price. That is TD Securities and the Melbourne Institute -                </DOC>

  Thank you very much. To the member for Hinkler I say that this is a bit like the discussion we had about the Belair Hotel and the claims that were made in this parliament yesterday. The fact, of course, is that that hotel has experienced an increase in its power price of less than 10 per cent, and that is what we predicted as the price impact on power for Australian households. We made predictions through the modelling and those predictions have come true.                              To the member for Hinkler: I say to him - once again looking at the power price impacts - that we know what the power price impacts are. They are the same as what we said they would be when we announced carbon pricing. And, because of those impacts, we have put more money in people's pockets, including the people who go to the club that he refers to. There is more money through tax cuts. A million Australians are not paying tax any longer, or keeping $18,200 before they pay a cent of tax -                                                                      Ms GILLARD:                    And members of that leagues club would be benefiting from those tax cuts. Members of that leagues club would be benefiting from the family payment increases. Members of that leagues club would be benefiting from the arrangements that we have made for pensioners. We have deliberately calculated the amount of assistance because we wanted to see pensioners come out in front, and so they were given 20 per cent more than the average impact of carbon pricing upon them as it flows through.                              So, to the member who has raised the question with me, I would say the following. He would acknowledge, I believe, that the government's modelling has accurately predicted the effects we have seen in the community. They are nowhere near the same as the scare campaign that has been run predicted. People in his electorate would have those tax cuts, family payment and pension increases. The member who asked the question, as a member of long standing in this House, would recall that he stood in the 2007 election campaign promising to put a price on carbon, exactly as the Leader of the Opposition did - promising to put a price on carbon. And the Leader of the Opposition, should he ever be Prime Minister, will keep that price on carbon.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Reid very much for that question. He knows that this Labor government is all about making sure we do everything we possibly can to support families and to support pensioners in the challenges that they face every day to make ends meet. That is why we made the priority in our household assistance package helping those families and helping those pensioners. I can inform the member for Reid that, in his electorate alone, 37½ thousand households received extra help in the last couple of months.                                                                    Ms MACKLIN:                    The member for North Sydney interjects. Of course, the member for Reid will be able to inform his electors that if the member for North Sydney gets his way they will claw back every single cent of the money that the member for Reid made sure they get.                              This government has introduced a price on carbon and we have done it, as the Prime Minister has indicated today, because we do want to build a strong, clean economy, not just for today but for the future. I want to acknowledge the students from Loyola College in my electorate that are in the gallery today. This is all about making sure that young people, in the future, have the opportunity to live in a clean economy. We are of course also delivering to millions of other Australians. We have made sure that 6.7 million households receive extra assistance, whether it is pensioners, students, self-funded retirees or other people on low incomes. They are all able to use this money to help with everyday costs, whether for groceries or electricity. One of the other major changes that this government has delivered is to make sure that seven million Australians have received a tax cut. People earning up to $80,000 have received a tax cut from this government.                              So, six weeks in from the introduction of the carbon price, we see that the sky has in fact not fallen in. Families are still getting up every day, making sure their children go to school and going off to work themselves, and they have been getting the extra help from this government. What we know from the Leader of the Opposition is that he has a very, very clear plan to claw this money back from those families and those pensioners.               </DOC>

  To the member for Boothby's question, the member for Boothby yesterday raised an issue about electricity pricing and the Belair Hotel. When that matter was looked at, what was clearly found was the increase in the price paid by the Belair hotel, when they paid their power bill, was less than 10 per cent. That is as the government had predicted. The member for Boothby ought to acknowledge that fact.                              The member for Boothby is now referring to another business in his electorate. Let me say after yesterday's experience, one would want to check the facts. The member for Boothby is also of long standing in this House. In 2007 when the member for Boothby's sought re-election, he did it on a platform of pricing carbon. The policy document that he stood on at that election said that the coalition's plan to price carbon would lead to higher fuel and energy costs for households, community facilities and small businesses.                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    I am talking about carbon pricing and the facility that the member for Boothby refers to. In 2007, the member for Boothby presumably went to that facility and said that his policy, the coalition's policy, was to put a price on carbon, which would lead to higher fuel and energy costs for households, community facilities and small businesses.                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    The Leader of the Opposition is interjecting. He would well remember designing that policy as a member of Prime Minister Howard's cabinet. He would have seen all of the documents. What of course the coalition did not talk about then, which this government has ensured has occurred, is that households have benefited from tax cuts, family payment increases and pension increases. We wanted them to have that money because we knew that there would be a flow-through impact of carbon pricing.                               Talking about electricity, the average assistance is $10.10 per household while the average impact is $3.30. To the member for Boothby, to the Leader of the Opposition, to coalition members opposite, it is about time they actually acknowledged that their plan in the past was carbon pricing, their leader has been in favour of carbon pricing and, if they were ever in government, they would keep the price on carbon.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Blair for his question. The member is right to ask questions about false and misleading claims that have been made in relation to the carbon price because there have been many. In fact, most of them have been made by the coalition. As we all know, the carbon price came into effect on 1 July.                                                                    Mr BRADBURY:                    What have we seen in that time? Have we seen the wrecking ball through the Australian economy that the Leader of the Opposition promised? No. What we have seen in that time is the ASX 200 rise by 4.6 per cent. We have seen 14,000 jobs created in that time and we have seen the TD Securities Melbourne institute inflation gauge record its lowest reading in almost three years. While there have been some false and misleading claims made, the good news is that most Australian businesses, the vast majority of Australian businesses, are doing the right thing.                              For that small proportion of businesses that have been making false and misleading claims, the ACCC has been taking prompt action. So far we have seen enforcement action taken against a gym in Melbourne for using claims about the carbon price to try and lock its customers into long-term contracts. We have seen enforcement action taken again against Brumby's bakeries. We have seen enforcement action taken against a company that was making false claims about refrigerant gases, claims which those opposite have been recklessly seeking to beat up in order to make some political gain.                                                                    Mr BRADBURY:                    While some of us have been out there trying to crack down on these price rises, the Leader of the Opposition has been mounting the mother of all scare campaigns, trying to give businesses the green light to jack up their prices and to blame it on the carbon price.                                                                    Mr BRADBURY:                    But, thankfully, most Australian businesses have been turning their back on the invitation to join the Leader of the Opposition's reckless scare campaign. We all recall the dodgy pamphlet that was distributed by the Leader of the Opposition to butchers all around this country. We remember that pamphlet.                              The Australian Meat Industry Council represent butchers all around the country. This pamphlet was drawn to their attention and they decided to write to their members in their newsletter and comment on it, saying: 'The federal opposition leader recently provided a flyer to many small business owners allegedly providing encouragement to increase prices as a result of the carbon tax.' Further, they say, 'AMIC strongly recommends that you do not claim that price increases are a direct result of the introduction of the carbon tax' - and, wait for it -                                                                     Mr BRADBURY:                    'or display material to this effect which may have been provided by third parties' - third parties like the Leader of the Opposition. The Australian Meat Industry Council respect their customers and they respect the law and that is why they are asking their members to give your scare campaign the big chop.               </DOC>

  The goods and services tax, of course, is a tax on the final cost of the supply of goods and services. You ought to know about it because you introduced it. You introduced it after the former Prime Minister said he would never ever introduce it.                                                 Mr Hockey then left the chamber.                                                                                    Mr BRADBURY:                    When legislation was introduced in order to give effect to the carbon price we specifically excluded the carbon price from the imposition of the GST. The GST of course is a tax on the final cost of the supply of goods and services. If the introduction of the carbon price were to lead to some sort of windfall in the GST then your state Liberal premiers would be the first to be out there leading the cheer squad in support of its introduction.                              The truth of the matter is that GST revenues have been written down. Go and talk to your state Liberal premiers. Member for Flynn, go and have a word to Mr Newman and ask him about whether or not he is receiving some sort of GST windfall from the introduction of the carbon price. He will do what the state premiers do every day of the week: whinge and whinge and whine, and they will keep doing that until a federal government - not this one - accedes to their request to jack up the price of the GST.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Hindmarsh for his question. He, along with many other members on this side of the House, has campaigned hard for this reform and, as a reformed smoker himself, I know that he has had a particular interest in it. I think many people would have been surprised about the enthusiastic response that was received around the world for this measure that Australia is taking as a world leader.                              I thought the House might be interested to know that organisations like the World Health Organization, along with the US based Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, the South African health minister, the New Zealand health minister, and reporters from the BBC, CNN, the Bangkok Postand the Pretoria News all have welcomed this decision of the High Court because they see that there is an opportunity for them to follow Australia and introduce harsher tobacco control measures themselves. It is obviously good news for those who have been fighting for many years for this change.                                                 I am asked about both the international response and the local response. I fear I do have to report an error that was made yesterday in the House. I need to make an apology to the opposition because I said yesterday that there were some members opposite who welcomed this measure but they were all on the backbench. I have to tell you that following yesterday's decision I received many calls from people on the frontbench and the backbench of the opposition, and they were very welcome. I wanted particularly to share a note with you; I checked that the member for Fairfax was comfortable with me saying this. He sent a lovely note which said that, when he first joined the Public Service nearly 50 years ago, he turned up for his first day of work and presented at the office that issued material for your office. He said: 'I was given three things. I was given an in-tray, I was given an out-tray and I was given an ashtray.' Not many of us can imagine a world where that was the norm for every public servant. I am delighted that there are so many people across both sides of this House who can see that this is an important change.                              However, there are three members - the member for Indi, the member for Sturt and the member for Goldstein - whom I have not heard anything from, and I wonder whether this is because each of them has received thousands of dollars in donations from the tobacco companies since this was reported. They have shown no interest in being prepared to support this important public health measure. Donations keep flowing in, and, since we are particularly talking about two-year anniversaries, I thought that people might like to know that today is the two year anniversary of the Leader of the Opposition telling a Q&amp;A audience that he intended to keep on taking those donations for as long as tobacco was legal.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Fraser for his question. Today I had the opportunity to speak to the Association of Independent Schools and I very much welcomed it. I also had the opportunity to attend in front of Parliament House to meet with public school advocates, principals from public schools and the Australian Education Union. So I have had a morning where I have had an opportunity to speak to great principals from independent schools and from public schools. I have spoken to them about the determination I share with them to improve every school in this country because we want to see a better education for every child in this country.                              The government's reform agenda for Australian schools is about every child in every school. We have an opportunity now, after the work of the independent review panel on funding, to look at the question of funding for the first time in 40 years, but, as I made very clear when I spoke today to independent school principals and to public school principals, we intend to drive a school improvement agenda because we want every child in every school to have a better education and a better opportunity in life and that is what our economy will require for the future. It is what fairness demands of us.                              I was very disturbed, in fact I would say angered, by the approach that the Leader of the Opposition has taken to this very important question. He, too, went to address the Independent Schools National Education Forum, and what he told them is that public schools have too much money. Just in case anybody missed the sound bite, he repeated it twice. The Leader of the Opposition thinks public schools have too much money. And, in case anybody thinks it is one of his periodic stumbles, these were prepared and scripted remarks - that public schools have too much money.                              The opposition are very fond of throwing around allegations about hit lists. Today it has been revealed that every public school in this country is on an opposition hit list and is slated for a reduction in funding. Every public school in this country is on their hit list and is due for a funding reduction. We should not be surprised when the member for Sturt says he will take one in seven teachers out of classrooms and is quite happy to see increases in class sizes.                              That is the difference between both sides of politics. We will give every child and every school a better future. On the other side there is the politics of division, and cutbacks for Australian public schools, bigger class sizes and fewer teachers, and no-one over there cares.              </DOC>

  In answer to the Leader of the Opposition's question, he has had a bit of a morning this morning. He has not only gone out and threatened to cut every public school in this country; he has finally come clean on electricity prices. He has said today that it is true that the carbon tax is not the only factor in the dramatic rise in power prices. It was a complete backflip compared with his statement in the run-up to parliament that everything else except carbon pricing was apparently a furphy. So the Leader of the Opposition has finally smacked into the reality that state Liberals do not agree with him, experts do not agree with him, the regulators do not agree with him and members of his own team do not agree with him. He has finally come clean that, yes, the dramatic increases in power prices are not about carbon pricing but are about other actions. So, for the small business -                                                                     Ms GILLARD:                    And of course the level of abuse is always correlated with their lack of ideas.                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    Now the Leader of the Opposition has admitted that it is the actions of state governments and others - it is factors beyond carbon pricing - that have led to dramatic increases in power prices. To his question and to the business he talks about: presumably he will get that business on the phone and say that he, the Leader of the Opposition, now understands that that business -                                                                     Ms GILLARD:                    That business would have seen a 50 per cent increase in their power prices, and it is nothing to do with carbon pricing. Presumably he has explained that to them, now that the penny has dropped.                              Presumably he would also explain to them that the impact on electricity prices is exactly as the government predicted it. That means that small businesses are in a position to pass those costs through, because they are dealing with consumers who have had the benefit of tax cuts, family payment increases and pension increases.                              If the Leader of the Opposition were genuinely concerned about the circumstances of this business, instead of continuing his reckless fear campaign he would be working with the government, now that he has admitted he was wrong in the run-up to parliament and that there are other factors causing the rapid escalation in electricity prices, and would be instructing his state Liberal colleagues to do the same so that they come to December COAG ready to act on electricity prices. That is what he would do if he were interested in anything else except the reckless fear campaign.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Corangamite for his question. Central to this government's values and principles about education is recognising that all Australian students need to get support in the schools they are in, regardless of where they live and regardless of how much money their parents earn. A student can only live a fulfilling life if their education is good, and the country can only have a sustainable productive economy if our education is good for our students.                              This is smack bang in the middle of what we as a government believe in. Because of the pace of reform you can see that commitment. We have seen more reform in education nationally than we have ever seen in our lifetime, whether it is the national curriculum, national professional standards for teachers, the MySchool website or the investment in modernised facilities in every single school. This is all about investing in the future, and it is absolutely central to this Labor government's vision for Australia.                              The next step for us is to continue that journey. The findings of the Gonski panel that have been talked about are challenging for us because they show that between 2000 and 2009 our best students fell behind those in neighbouring countries. They also find that there is a persistent gap, sometimes called the equity gap, between our top and bottom student achievers. We are leaving too many young Australians behind.                              We are committed to delivering a national plan for school improvement that will benefit each and every school. It will focus on teacher quality, on funding and on the needs of students in those schools. We do that on the basis of a record level of investment and the big reforms underway already.                              I am asked about the principles of education funding. They are our principles. But when I look to the other side of the House all I can see is the persistent, hard-wired negativity of the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow minister - $2.8 billion worth of cuts on board. But not only that; there is no willingness at all to engage in this reform. The shadow minister dismissed the Gonski review within half an hour of its release, and then, when it comes to Gonski, I could not help but notice that there are other members on the opposition side who do not seem to have been listening to the Leader of the Opposition, and particularly his speech today.                              Here we have the member for Bowman - and here is a photograph: 'Andrew Laming gives a Gonski'. At least someone on that side of the House recognises the deficiencies in the approach of the Leader of the Opposition and the delinquency of the member for Sturt in the cavalier, negative approach that they have taken to school funding.                              We understand that we need reform and investment. We are committed to national school improvement, and we will get on with this job now and in the future.              </DOC>

  I am very glad that the member raises the question of how best to support schools. We are a government that have doubled the amount of funding going into school education. And, as the member should know, because of the way that money is indexed -                                                                     Ms GILLARD:                    As I was just about to say to the member who asked the question, we have doubled the funding for school education. That funding is indexed. The way in which the index works is that it takes into account increases, like the 10 per cent increase for electricity prices, which are flowing through into schools. That is taken into account in the index. I wonder if the member has ever got the New South Wales state government on the phone and asked them about the impact of the 70 per cent increase in electricity prices that will have hit the school in his electorate? I wonder if he has ever done that -                                                                   The member for North Sydney and the member for Dickson then left the chamber.                                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    I wonder whether the member who asked the question was embarrassed to stand alongside the Leader of the Opposition at the last election and promise to cut quality teaching money, promise to cut computers in schools and promise to cut trade-training centres. And I wonder now whether the member is embarrassed to sit behind the Leader of the Opposition, who today has said to that public school that he is coming for it. Like Jack the Ripper, he is going to be there wielding his knife to cut money out of that public school. That is what he has promised today.                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    I withdraw, Deputy Speaker.                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    I wonder how the member who asked the question feels about sitting behind this Leader of the Opposition, who is coming to that school to cut its funding. He has promised that today. Whatever label one wants to put on it, what that means is that that school would have less money for the education of children. The Leader of the Opposition in his own words today, in a carefully scripted remark, has said that he is coming for public schools to cut back their funding. Every public school in this country, every parent who sends a child to a public school, and every community member who cares about the quality of public education needs to know from today that the Leader of the Opposition is coming for them. He is coming with cutbacks, and he is coming to destroy the opportunity for those schoolchildren -                                                                     Ms GILLARD:                    for a decent education and a decent life.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Dobell for the question. Tuggerah Lakes has been an iconic project for many years across the Central Coast and an area iconic not only for people on the Central Coast. You would not find too many people who have grown up in Sydney who have not had many of their holidays up there, gone prawning in areas of Tuggerah Lakes and seen the magnificent seabirds there, in particular the pelicans but also a series of endangered species.                              The $20 million commitment that the member for Dobell refers to was put into two stages. The first was about $7½ million, and then there was a second stage. The first has been fully expended. It feeds from two rivers - the Wyong and the Ourimbah. The work is actually being done, led by the council there, by a whole lot of volunteers, in part - hundreds of volunteers - working in revegetating the area.                              You have real problems in Tuggerah Lakes with run-off and nutrients coming through the catchments down into Tuggerah. The work of volunteers being led by the council - he mentions Bob Graham - has been work that has made a real difference in the water quality and the native vegetation of the area. I understand there are two milestone payments still to be made. All the advice that I have received is that they remain on track to be made. I think the next one is due in September.                              The member also asks about future funding for Tuggerah Lakes. It is something that he has raised in question time today, previously in the parliament and directly with me. Funding for Tuggerah Lakes has been coming out of Caring for our Country. Members may be aware that Caring for our Country has finished its first five years, and the review is taking place to determine the future of Caring for our Country and the exact way that that will be configured. Submissions for that funding review closed three or four days ago, so it will not be long before the government is in a position to make announcements about the exact nature of Caring for our Country, as to which programs it gets broken up into in the future.                              I have to say, looking at the progress over the last five years, Tuggerah Lakes has been one of the great success stories of the project. It has been a great example of community engagement and a great example of substantial environmental improvement in something that is iconic to the people of Central Coast and beyond.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Blair for that very important question, because our economy does walk tall in the world. It is 10 per cent bigger than it was prior to the global financial crisis, and it is stronger than every other major developed economy. We have seen the creation of something like 800,000 jobs in the period this government has been in office - a remarkable outcome, given what is going on elsewhere in the world. But also we have seen really strong private business investment. Private business investment has grown by 20 per cent to be at its highest percentage of GDP in something like 40 years.                              Of course there is a really strong pipeline of investment in resources as well. That advanced pipeline of resources investment has grown by nearly $90 billion in the past year alone. This private investment, along with all of the public investment that the government has been making in infrastructure but also in skills and education more broadly, is what strengthens our economy. It gives us the resilience we need to meet the challenges of the future. That fundamental investment drives the strength of our economy as we go forward, because these investments have been put in place.                              Of course we do need to reverse the decade-long decline in productivity which we inherited from the other side of politics. That is why we are investing in these areas which they refused to invest in. As the Reserve Bank said, their failure to invest in these areas led to something like 10 interest rate rises in a row. We are committed to investing in education. We are committed to investing in infrastructure because we understand that if you invest in the future you strengthen future prosperity. We want to build our economy up, and those Liberals on the other side simply want to tear it down. We have a $3 billion skills package. We have a huge increase in the number of people in tertiary education. And we have doubled our investment in infrastructure - road, rail and port. This is all driving growth and productivity.                              So we have a plan for the future to support jobs, whereas those on the opposite side of this House do not have a plan to do that. They have a plan to do the reverse. The shadow finance minister let the cat out of the bag up at Hayman Island the weekend before last. He said the opposition were not going to make the mistake that John Hewson had made, where he put out all the fine detail of slashing and burning in health and education. They were not going to put that out as they went to the next election. They were going to do a Campbell Newman and hide it from the Australian people - the impact on jobs, the impact on education. There is a hidden agenda from those opposite to slash, cut and burn health and education and to cut away the productive base of the Australian economy. We will support working families. They have nothing but contempt for them.               </DOC>

  To the member for Casey: it may be that the example he quotes was an example used in one of today's newspapers. I have seen some of those reports, and in some of those reports we have prices referred to, like tomatoes going up from $5 a kilo a couple of weeks ago to $8.99 a kilo now. I would say to this House and I would say to people reading those newspapers: if there is anyone in this country who is representing that that increase is anything to do with carbon pricing, then people should ring the ACCC and get that addressed because that is clearly wrong and meant to deceive and mislead.                              For the real circumstances of small business, small businesses do not pay the carbon price. That is paid by the big polluters, who generate the most carbon pollution.                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    We have always said that some of those costs would be -                                                                     Ms GILLARD:                    passed through to small businesses, particularly in the form of an increase in electricity, and we have talked very clearly with the Australian community about us predicting a 10 per cent increase in household electricity bills, for example - an increase of $3.30 a week on average - and that is why we have provided assistance of $10.10 a week on average. To the small business involved, I would therefore say that that small business is dealing with consumers who have received tax cuts, family payment increases and pension increases because our anticipation was that small businesses would pass these modest price impacts on. When we are talking about modest price impacts, let's remember that the Treasury modelling, which has proved accurate on things like electricity prices, says that the impact overall will be 0.7 per cent of CPI - that is less than a cent in a dollar.                              To the member, who may have a genuine concern about price impacts for this small business: I presume he is talking to them about the price impacts flowing from electricity increases that have absolutely nothing to do with carbon pricing. Now that the Leader of the Opposition has admitted that there are dramatic power price increases, nothing to do with carbon pricing, the member should feel empowered to have a frank conversation about the facts. You no longer have to go around pretending, in order to be loyal to the Leader of the Opposition, that this is all about carbon pricing. Today he has given the game away and he has pointed to the other sources of big power bills, and I trust the member who asked the question will do precisely that for the small business involved.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Capricornia for her question. Of course, this federal Labor government has continued to roll out its record Nation Building Program, doubling the roads budget, increasing the rail budget by more than 10 times and committing more to urban public transport than all governments combined since Federation. In addition to that, we are committed to spreading the benefits of the mining boom. That is why we have established the $6 billion Regional Infrastructure Fund.                              I am asked about the Bruce Highway, which has benefited from both our Nation Building Program and the Regional Infrastructure Fund.                                                                    Mr ALBANESE:                    Recently, as the Leader of the Nationals interjected, he embarked on the equivalent of National Lampoon's Vacation. He went up the North Coast, up the Bruce Highway. As he went up the Bruce Highway, all loaded up in the car were the member for Gippsland and other people over there, who were not sure what seat they were from. Some of that mob over there were loaded into the car, some on the roof, some strapped in, going to look at the work that is taking place on the Bruce Highway.                              As the Leader of the National Party left his seat going up north, he would have hit the Cooroy to Curra section - the section which he had previously said had the worst road in Australia. He had said that and he should have known. At the time he said that, he was not only the local member; he was the transport minister, and he had done nothing about it. But at the end of last year he would have seen the work underway that will be completed and opened. When he hit the member for Capricornia's seat he would have seen the work that is taking place on the Yeppen Lagoon Bridge and the Yeppen Roundabout - $40 million coming from the Regional Infrastructure Fund that he would abolish.                              If they had got their timing right, they could have been with me and the member for Herbert when we opened the $110 million Douglas Arterial. He could have asked the member for Herbert what he thought, because the member for Herbert said:                              I'll give Labor a pat on the back and say they have spent more in their four or five years on the Bruce Highway than we did before.                              That is what the member for Herbert had to say.                              Throughout his journey he could have seen the work that is underway, including under the $210 million from the Regional Infrastructure Fund. We have spent $2.8 billion over six years; he spent $1.3 billion over 12 long years. So it is no wonder that, as they got to Cairns - as they got to Walley World - their final destination, he got asked, 'What are you committing?' The LNP members spent a whole week strapped in this car and on the roof. When they got to the end, they proposed not one cent of additional funding - not one single cent of additional funding from those opposite.              </DOC>

  To the member who raises the question I say that, as the member would be aware, we have always said that in carbon pricing the price would be paid by the big polluters, there would be a flow-through impact on electricity pricing -                                                                     Ms GILLARD:                    The member yelling out is agreeing with me, I see. We have been very clear about what that impact would be and the modelling has been proved to be right. Small businesses are not required directly to pay the carbon price and are not required to fill in any additional forms. Unlike the paperwork burden that came their way with the Howard government's GST, they do not pay the carbon price, and they do not fill in additional forms. They will see some flow-through impacts for things like electricity prices, which is why we have put consumers in a position for them to pass that on. Consumers are there with their tax cuts, their family payment increases and their pension increases.                              I would say to the member who asked the question: what has she said to this business about the large electricity prices -                                                                     Ms GILLARD:                    She may well have said that, but I hope she has also said that the Leader of the Opposition today has now acknowledged that the biggest impact on electricity prices is not carbon pricing. Having finally moved from a position that everyone knew to be ridiculous -                                                                     Ms GILLARD:                    when he tried to pretend that all electricity price increases were somehow the fault of carbon pricing, he was repudiated by state Liberals, repudiated by this front bench, repudiated by the regulators. So today he has actually acknowledged that there are other sources of power price increases. What does the member, on behalf of the Leader of the Opposition, say to the small business involved about that?                              I would be in a position to say that we will drive change at the Council of Australian Governments meeting at the end of this year. Is the member in a position to say that this Leader of the Opposition will get Ted Baillieu on the phone, Barry O'Farrell on the phone and Campbell Newman on the phone and say, 'It's about time that the Liberals worked with us to address these electricity price increases at the end of this year'?                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    I am not going to join the member in this fear campaigning. If she is genuinely interested in this business she would be looking at costs from all sources, including the bigger electricity costs flowing from sources other than carbon pricing. If she is not doing that, she is not serious about this business or the 400 jobs she is talking about, and I think her constituents would be very interested to know that she is not serious about 400 jobs in her electorate.                              Leave not granted.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Deakin for his question, because underlying inflation is actually at a 13-year low, and the carbon price will have quite a small impact on inflation. We have stated many times in this place that the Treasury modelling found that the impact on the CPI would only be 0.7 per cent in financial year 2012-13. That is less than one cent in the dollar and certainly much less than the CPI impact of the introduction of the GST, which was 2.5 per cent. It is nothing like the hysterical claims made by the Leader of the Opposition of unimaginable price increases - far from it.                              The carbon price has now been in place for approximately seven weeks, and during this time TD Securities' inflation gauge has shown that the overall inflation impact during the first month of the carbon price was just 0.2 per cent in July - one fifth of one cent.                               There is certainly no unimaginable price increase in that, as claimed by the Leader of the Opposition, and nothing to support the ridiculous three-page beat-up today in the Daily Telegraph.                              But we have also seen in the past week an analysis of inflation expectations on financial markets from financial markets. This confirms the Treasury modelling. Investors, of course, when considering these issues, back their predictions up with their money. They are saying that the impact of carbon pricing on inflation will be in the order of 0.6 to 0.7 per cent. That is bang on the Treasury modelling. In the face of all of these facts, in the face of all of this evidence that is mounting, what do the coalition resort to as part of their mendacious, ridiculous, hysterical fear campaign? They resort to exhorting people to price gouge.                              Here is a classic example. A refrigerant company, Equipserve, has been pinged by the ACCC after it replicated a statement, in effect, made by the shadow industry minister, the member for Indi. She wrongly attributed increases in refrigerant gas prices to the carbon price - the entirety of the increase to the carbon price. They are the very same statements that were found to be in breach of the consumer laws and that led to the giving of an enforceable undertaking by that company to the ACCC.                              This is the conduct the opposition engage in. They go around misrepresenting, making ridiculous, deceitful claims, encouraging businesses to price gouge. The meat industry has had to disown the silly leaflet that the opposition have put out. Their whole campaign is a fraud and their claim to repeal it is also a fraud.               </DOC>

  To the member who asked the question: the parliamentary secretary would have been making the simple point that it is only big businesses that generate a lot of carbon pollution, thousands and thousands of tonnes of carbon pollution - indeed, 25,000 tonnes or more - that pay the carbon price. That is the point he would have been drawing out in that debate. To the member who is continuing his question after a series of questions today: what we are seeing today is an opposition determined to continue its fear campaign, even though - day by day by day - the facts are proving this fear campaign wrong.                              Whyalla was going to be wiped off the map. That is wrong. Price rises were going to be unimaginably large. That is wrong. Electricity bills were going to skyrocket - even the Leader of the Opposition has had to acknowledge that was wrong today.                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    To the member who asked the question: No. 1, of course we would be checking the assertions in the question - when they come from the opposition we need to; No. 2, I have described on more than one occasion in question time today the circumstances of small business; and, No. 3, the continuation of this fear campaign today, in the face of the facts, I think is because the Leader of the Opposition this morning and his opposition team are now desperate to distract from his pledge this morning to cut the funding to every public school in the nation - because he does not want to have public debate focused on his cuts to public schools. Here we go with the fear campaign and the ridiculous points of order.                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    I am making the very simple point that we continue to see the fear campaign despite the facts. And the fact they want to distract from today is their plan to cut public schools.

  I want to thank the member for Petrie for the question. The member for Petrie has been talking to me for some time about the importance of making sure that we got the balance right in the marine national parks proposals, to make sure that we took account of the recreational fishers - who are very strong in her electorate - without in any way compromising the strong environmental outcomes that we could achieve.                              We ended up with a proposal, particularly down that east coast pathway, that met those requirements precisely. It is one where we were able to become as a nation the world leader in ocean protection.                              It was a situation where, as a nation, whenever we were given a choice to deliver the same environmental outcome but to minimise the impact on recreational fishers, we took that option. Wherever we could get the same environmental outcome but minimise the impact on commercial fishers, we took that option. That is why the Coral Sea, for example, which I have previously described as the jewel in the crown of the whole proposal, is one area where the highest level of protection is in the areas furthest out. But in the areas that are closer - between the Great Barrier Reef and the beginning of where the Coral Sea is - you have one area of particularly high value for commercial fishers, which is reserved, and trawlers are allowed in. An area in the north of that entire central band is open to recreational fishing, and the southern part is also open to longliners to make sure that we deliver the environmental outcome in a way that minimises the challenges that might be otherwise there for the rec or commercial sectors.                              That is why I was surprised to see that part of the material being distributed during the current consultation phase involved a leaflet - I am not sure what sort of image this was trying to invoke - with a symbol of fish and chips wrapped in the Australian flag with the entire Coral Sea reserve described not as it is in the draft maps but as a no-go zone. This leaflet can only be described as nothing other than a lie.                                                                    Mr BURKE:                    About a leaflet?                                                                    Mr BURKE:                    That is fine.                                                                    Mr BURKE:                    I withdraw.                                                                    Mr BURKE:                    I just did withdraw. The map that is on the leaflet is entirely incorrect. It is trying to do one thing - that is, mislead the people of Queensland - and nothing more. It is authorised by Queensland LNP Senator Sue Boyce. It was put out as fake information to deceive Queenslanders, and the Leader of the Opposition should himself disown it.              </DOC>

The member who asked that question may want to explain to that business that the 50 and 60 per cent increases that people have seen in electricity prices in Queensland are nothing to do with the carbon price. The Leader of the Opposition today has acknowledged that there are dramatic increases in electricity that are nothing to do with the carbon price. The member might not like the fact, and the Leader of the Opposition might have been dragged kicking and screaming to the facts, but they are facts.                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    I misunderstood. I thought the member was referring to a business. What I have just said is correct for businesses: the big increases they have seen in power prices in Queensland come from other areas, not the carbon price. The Leader of the Opposition has acknowledged today that there are other sources of dramatic increases in power bills.                              What we have always said for Australian families is that they would see a 10 per cent increase in their electricity bill, and that has been acknowledged by the regulators as right. They will see a 10 per cent increase in their electricity bill, a 10 per cent increase in what they pay. Because they will see that 10 per cent increase, which on average for families is $3.30 a week, we have provided, on average, assistance of $10.10 a week in the form of tax cuts, in the form of pension increases and in the form of family payment increases. These are the facts and no amount of fear campaigning changes those facts. No amount of fear campaigning today will distract from the Leader of the Opposition's plan to cut funding to every public school in the member for Ryan's electorate.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Wakefield for his question and his commitment to regional development generally but particularly in his electorate. The Regional Development Australia Fund that he refers to is an important commitment on the part of this government, a billion-dollar fund over its term to assist regions to make economic and social infrastructure adjustments.                              In the member's seat recently, in round 2 we were able to ensure the funding of the Wakefield-Auburn pipeline. This is a water infrastructure initiative, and it is essential to ensuring the development of housing as well as farmland expansion in that area. Without this investment, the housing and the farmland development would not have taken place. The farmland development is very important to support the continued growth of the poultry industry in his electorate, so you can see that this has both social and economic impact.                              Our approach, of course, is, 'Stronger regions equal a stronger nation,' and that is why we are committed to strengthening regions in our country, across the country. This was one of seven programs funded in South Australia in the second round and 46 over the country. A new culture has developed. We have gotten away from the rorts that personified regional development under the previous government, to a culture of genuine partnership. In fact, the $200 million that we funded in this second round leveraged $800 million, so the multiplier is four to one. We have got a lot in this round who did not get up in the first round but persisted in making their projects stack up, and they got supported. They also paid attention not just to where this proposal would be located but to the wider regional significance.                              I am also asked about the future of this fund. The future of this fund under us is now secure, because we have secured passage of the minerals resource rent tax, a means by which we want to spread the benefits of the mining boom to the rest of regional Australia to ensure that they get their fair share. Under us, there will be three more rounds. But, as to the future, these rounds would not go ahead if those opposite were in government, because they are committed to abolishing the tax and therefore the means by which they fund this proposal. The challenge on the other side is to either be honest with the Australian electorate and say that you are going to keep the tax or to tell us where you are going to get the money from to fund a program that is benefiting regions.               </DOC>

  I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question - breathtaking in its originality. I could not possibly have predicted that! This is the second anniversary of the election in 2010, and since the two years passed, we have moved to put a price on carbon because that is the right thing to do in Australia's national interest. The Leader of the Opposition proudly stood on that platform in the 2007 election himself. We have put a price on carbon so we cut carbon pollution, so we tackle climate change; we have done it in a Labor way, in a fair way, by providing benefits to working families: tax cuts to people who earn less than $80,000 a year; an increase, again, to the pension we had already provided - an historic increase, too - and more money in family payments for people who are doing the hard work of bringing up children.                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    Thank you very much, Madam Deputy Speaker. There are no number of points of order, no measure of reinterpretation of the question, that gets away from the single fact at the heart of this: there is bipartisan support in this country to cut carbon pollution by five per cent by 2020. There used to be bipartisan support to do that in the cheapest way, by putting a price on carbon. The Leader of the Opposition used to believe that - indeed, in his heart of hearts, he still does. For two long years now he has been involved in a destructive, reckless, negative fear campaign, and the Leader of the Opposition can see the time now where his destructive, negative fear campaign is going to run out of puff.                              To the Leader of the Opposition I say: we will continue, as a Labor government, doing the great Labor things that built this country - strengthening our economy, so that people have jobs; improving the healthcare system, and long-neglected areas like mental health in aged care; improving our children's schools, and not allowing the Leader of the Opposition to rip money out of public education; ensuring we are ready for the challenges of the future, whether it is broadband, new infrastructure, a clean energy future or a new approach to skills; and we will deliver the National Disability Insurance Scheme, because it will be a great Labor reform. For another year, what the Leader of the Opposition will do is what he has done for the last two: just say no.              </DOC>

                But we have never taken anything about the future of our economy for granted. We have worked each and every day to make sure Australians have the benefit of that prosperity in the future. That is about delivering the infrastructure our nation needs, including the National Broadband Network. It is about building a clean energy future. It is about making sure we meet the demands of employers for skills so people can have jobs. It is about extending university places to more Australians, including those from poorer households. And of course the list goes on of how we have prepared for a strong economy for the future.                              But there is nothing more important in that preparation than what is happening in Australia's schools. What is happening in Australia's schools today will define the strength of our economy in the future. That is why we are so determined to take the opportunity, following the independent review - the once-in-40-year opportunity - to drive school improvement, and to ensure that we drive school improvement for every school in the country. We want to see Australian children - each and every one of them - in a great school. We want to see improvement in every school. This is our perspective, and I shared it with the Association of Independent Schools yesterday. I took that opportunity to talk about the benefits for every child in every school.                              The Leader of the Opposition took the opportunity to outline that every public school is on his hit list. He said current funding for private schools is an injustice.                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    The Manager of Opposition Business, who has just raised the point of order, said today:                              The current level of funding for independent schools and government schools is appropriate.                               That is, there is no need for more. Yesterday the Leader of the Opposition said that the current -                                                                     Ms GILLARD:                    That builds on the Leader of the Opposition saying yesterday that the current level of funding for public schools is an injustice - that is, that they should get less. A plan for cuts, a plan for no increases - that is what the Liberals stand for on public schools.                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    I know many find quoting the Leader of the Opposition offensive, but he did say 'injustice' and by that he meant cutbacks for public schools -                </DOC>

  To the member's question, as I have indicated in this parliament on more than one occasion, I am concerned about businesses that are suffering with high electricity prices, with the 50, 60 and 70 per cent we have seen flowing in various states across the nation. I am concerned about that, which is why I am driving a process for change at the Council of Australian Governments meeting in December. I am concerned about that. I presume if the member is genuine about his question, he is concerned about that too.                              On the impact of carbon pricing on electricity, we have always been very clear about that and always been very clear that that is why we are providing assistance to households and why we are providing support to businesses, including support to manufacturing businesses, through the ability to work with us for cleaner energy processes, a cleaner energy way of working.                              I would remind the member that since the announcement of the carbon price GDP in our nation has increased by three per cent, household consumption has increased by three per cent and new business investment has increased by 20 per cent. That is -                                                                     Ms GILLARD:                    As the member well knows, as someone who stood in the 2007 election, he has been in favour of carbon pricing. Let me quote his exact words. He said:                              It was actually the coalition that instigated work on the emissions trading scheme. _ in _ a report that I helped author back in 1998 which talks about regulatory arrangements for trading in greenhouse gas emissions - 1998!                              _ _   _                              The coalition's commitment to an ETS is demonstrable.                              So, like me, the member supports a price on carbon. The member should therefore say that in supporting a price on carbon it is important to work with businesses as they adapt to carbon pricing, and we are prepared to do so. What is not appropriate is to engage in a fear campaign not based on the facts, and it is not appropriate for the member who supports a price on carbon to come into this parliament now or to say to that business that he does not do so.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Deakin for his question because in his schools he is already seeing the benefit of this government's investment in education. There are about 40 schools there that have had an investment of around $78 million, and members on this side of the House know how important a role schools play, particularly when they are well invested in and have good facilities in educating Australia's students.                              You can see the commitment to education reform from what this government has done. The pace and depth of reform has been extraordinary - a quality national curriculum, investing in teacher quality and doubling the quantum of investment. But the point that is most important in all of this is that these investments and reforms have been intended for all students in all schools. That is the point. Whether it is in a Catholic school, an independent school or a government school, national partnerships that we have delivered -                                                                     Mr GARRETT:                    have been based on the need of these students. Our approach to national school improvement will be the same.                              The Leader of the Opposition does not agree. He sees injustice in the way independent schools are funded, but how he intends to treat that injustice is difficult to figure out, because the only thing on the record are cuts from the opposition of $2.8 billion to these national partnerships. Then we have the member for Sturt, who is in the House for a change, saying that class sizes do not matter and there is no need to worry about equity, and asking 'Why don't we sack one in seven teachers while we're at it?' - all on the record.                              Our approach is clear. We want to build on the reforms underway and have an education funding system that is transparent and effective. That is why we commissioned the Gonski review panel, as the Prime Minister said, an important education review - incidentally, made up of eminent Australians from across the political and educational spectrum -                                                                     Mr GARRETT:                    and endorsed by many in the community. Interestingly enough it was endorsed, I saw, by the member for Calare, who on his website was kind enough to observe:                              There is widespread acknowledgement that every child should have access to the best possible education _                              He got that part right. Then comes the punchline:                              The Coalition hopes that the Gonski Review will lead to better school systems across Australia _                              I could not have said it any better if I had tried. But at the end of the day let's not forget what this panel said. They found:                              _ differences in educational outcomes should not be the result of differences in wealth, income, power or possessions.                                                                    Mr GARRETT:                    We on this side of the House could not agree more, and that is why we will continue with these significant and important education reforms.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for his question. As I have said in answer to a large number of questions, small businesses do not directly pay the carbon price. That is paid by the nation's biggest polluters.                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    No amount of shrieking and screaming from the opposition changes that fact. Of course we see the opposition so desperate to continue their negative campaign that there is no fact they will not deny if it gets in the way of their negativity. The fact is that the carbon price is paid by a relatively small number of businesses that generate a lot of carbon pollution. We have always said that some of that price would be passed through, including in the cost of electricity. Understanding that, we have always said to small businesses that we have put consumers in a position where they have available to them increased money in their pay packet because of tax cuts and increased money in their bank accounts because of an increase in the pension or an increase in family payments. So we have said to small businesses that we understand that they will pass these costs through.                              At the same time, we are working to support the competitiveness of Australian businesses and their transition to a cleaner energy future. This is important for our nation's future. It is important for us to move to a cleaner energy future - to seize the natural advantages that come from abundant sunshine and from wind, tidal, and geothermal power - from having access to sources of clean energy. Indeed, I want our nation to be a world leader when it comes to clean energy technologies. That is one of the many ways in which I believe our nation will make our fortune -                                                                     Ms GILLARD:                    Thank you very much. For small business owners like Ben and for business owners around the nation we want to see our national economy modern, transformed, ready to seize the opportunities of the future. A clean energy future is a significant part of that. Prime Minister Howard believed that. The member who asked the question believed it when he stood in the election campaign in 2007. And no amount of embracing destructive negativity since takes away from that simple fact. The member who asked the question has been in favour of carbon pricing in the past and, once he gets through this negative bluster, he will be acknowledging he is still in favour of carbon pricing now, as is the Leader of the Opposition and every other living Liberal leader.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Lyne for his very important question. It goes to the heart of the sustainability of our tax system and the future prosperity of our economy. This government has already delivered three rounds of personal income tax reforms - or cuts, if you like - and we did put in place a comprehensive review of the tax system, encompassing both federal and state matters. So all of that is on the public record. And one of the first recommendations of that report in terms of priorities was putting in place a resource rent tax, which we have done and which we have passed through the parliament. But the revenue from that is also funding further tax reform - for example, the $6,500 instant asset write-off is being funded from that fundamental tax reform.                              The government has also embraced loss carry-back, a fundamental reform, particularly for many small businesses which are facing structural pressures in our economy. We have also boosted our national savings, which I think is very important not only as a part of tax reform but also in ensuring that we have national savings to buttress our prosperity into the future. Most fundamentally, we have tripled the tax-free threshold. You do not pay a dollar of tax until you earn something like $18,200. The other thing we have done is to keep tax as a share of GDP below the level that we have inherited. Tax is 22.1 per cent of GDP - well below the 23.7 per cent of GDP that we inherited. In fact, if we were taxing like those opposite were taxing, revenue would be up by well over an additional $20 billion.                              But we understand that there is a need to continue with tax reform, and the member would be very familiar with the tax forum that we held last year - a very constructive process. And coming out of that, we have put in place the Business Tax Working Group, which is looking very seriously at how we progress tax reform in the company tax area. We also have the superannuation roundtable going, which is looking, in particular, at ways to target and deliver concessions within the superannuation system, as well as the Not-for-profit Sector Tax Concession Working Group.                              As the member would also be aware we have the GST review, which is having a look at how the GST distributions impact on state tax reform. Finally, we have the work which is being done by Mr Baird and Mr Snelling - having a look at how we harmonise state taxation and how we reinforce state taxation bases. I am looking forward to seeing a report from them in the not-too-distant future about what the states intend to do in all of those areas.                              This is a pretty fundamental agenda. We have gone a long way down the road for tax reform but, as the member has indicated, we have got some way to go. Of course there is a very stark contrast with those opposite, who are proposing to put up company tax -                </DOC>

  I thank the member for Reid for that question. The reforms of the past have helped deliver the prosperity that we have today, and the reforms of today will help deliver the prosperity of tomorrow. That is why, for example, the mining resource rent tax is so important to deliver those reforms that I was talking to the member for Lyne about before. The $6,500 instant asset write-off is a fundamental reform for up to 2.7 million small businesses. We are all proud of that. We on this side of the House are proud of putting a price on carbon so that our children and our grandchildren can have a clean energy future. I am proud of what we have done in terms of workforce participation - a tripling of the tax-free threshold, a fundamental reform to lift workforce participation. I am proud of the doubling of investment in infrastructure - most particularly the NBN but also road, rail and port. All of these are very big reforms.                              But there is no reform that I am prouder of than what this government is doing not just in skills and training - including the $3 billion on the table in the last budget - but in education more generally. We have got an additional 150,000 students in our tertiary system. It is about what we are doing and will continue to do in our schools, both primary and secondary. Nothing matters more to our future prosperity than the investment in the education of our young people, and that comes through primary and secondary education. In those areas, in those schools, not only do we get the productivity of the future, what we get is opportunity for all of our students.                                                                    Mr SWAN:                    We know that the opposition does not support investing in better schools. We know that the Leader of the Opposition wants to get the axe out and axe funding for public schools. That is what he meant yesterday when he was talking about 'the injustice'.                                                                    Mr SWAN:                    Everybody in this House knows that there is a $70 billion crater in the budget bottom line of the Liberal and National parties because the shadow Treasurer said so on breakfast television. We know that they have a secret plan to slash funding for health and education because of that $70 billion crater they have in their budget bottom line. What we now also know from the shadow Treasurer today is that he says they have got all their policies costed - they are all actually out there.                                                                    Mr SWAN:                    It is very simple. We on this side of the House understand the importance of investment in schools when it comes to productivity and opportunity in our society. They do have a plan to slash public funding of schools and they are now going to run a campaign, not unlike what they ran when it came to carbon pricing, but their scare campaign is going to fall apart all around.              </DOC>

  To the member who asked the question, we have just seen the Treasurer deal with the so-called facts from a question yesterday and, clearly, what the opposition said then was wrong so, of course, I will check what the member is putting today. But I would say to him generally, he would be well aware of what I have said in this place about small businesses over a long period of time now and the expectation we have that small businesses, including people who sell fish, are in a position to pass through costs because we have put more money in the hands of consumers.                              When Prime Minister Howard was in office, he acknowledged all of these impacts of a carbon price and said it was still important that we had a carbon price in our nation so that we could reduce carbon pollution, tackle climate change and get onto using cleaner energy sources. The members of the front bench who were here in 2007 stood on that platform of supporting carbon pricing. Ever since, we have seen fear raised in the community and I am not surprised that a local business person in the member's electorate may be reflecting some of that irresponsible fear campaign because people have had to deal with a lot of nonsense over the time period since we announced our intention to price carbon. When you stand back and look at the facts of what has happened since we priced carbon, for some reason today the opposition is saying - first time ever - that it is interested in facts. Well, if it was interested in facts it would know Whyalla has not been wiped off the map, we continue to mine coal and we have seen the modest cost-of-living impacts we predicted. We have seen -                                                                     Ms GILLARD:                    It is a long way away and still there. That is my point. It is a long way away and still there, despite what has been claimed about carbon pricing. We always said to small businesses like the one the member refers to that there would be an impact on electricity and we would anticipate that being passed through to consumers. We have also said that we are very concerned for those small businesses. The electricity price impacts, the bigger impacts, they are seeing coming from other sources, and we are working on that as we move towards the December Council of Australian Governments meeting. Because we care about businesses like the one the member refers to, we have put in place a broad range of new policies for small businesses, including the instant asset write-off - opposed every step of the way by the member who asked the question and the opposition.              </DOC>

  I thank my friend the member for Banks for his question, because today the Climate Commission has released a new and independent assessment of international action on climate change. It concludes that every major economy is tackling climate change. No fewer than 90 countries, representing 90 per cent of the world's economy, have put programs in place to cut greenhouse gas emissions. From next year, the report finds, around 850 million people will live in countries or states with a carbon price set by an emissions trading scheme. Of course, the international community has committed to binding emissions reduction obligations to take effect from 2020, and countries are starting to move to that position. Notwithstanding all of these facts and this new independent report by the Climate Commission, the Leader of the Opposition is still on the record as saying: 'There is no sign, no sign whatsoever, that the rest of the world is going to do things like introduce carbon taxes or emissions trading schemes.' That flies completely in the face of all the facts and all of the measures that countries around the world are taking. You have to ask yourself: is it ignorance or is it pure mendacity that we are dealing with here?                               Whatever it is, it is a virus that is infecting the coalition. Yesterday the member for Hughes - I think it was - for example, cited figures from a Sydney high school to attack the carbon price and, within an hour of question time concluding, the school's deputy principal had this to say: 'We know nothing about it. I don't know where they got those numbers.' When subsequently questioned by the Financial Review, the member for Hughes's office had to say they did not know where the figures came from. They did not know, but the figures were put up in question time.                              Yesterday the opposition also tried to mislead over the carbon price impact on the electricity bill of a meat-processing facility called Australian Country Choice. The carbon price impact - this is a fact - would equate to less than one cent for every kilogram of beef that is produced from that facility. Coles are currently selling a Country Choice steak for $19.48 a kilo, and less than one cent of that is attributable to the carbon price impact. This anti-carbon-price crusade run by the coalition is littered with nothing but deceit and fraudulent claims. You should try telling the truth for once.              </DOC>

  To the member's question: first and foremost I would refer him to the answer just given by the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency, who has explained very clearly and in great detail the circumstances of the meat industry.                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    He has just explained the circumstances of the meat industry and some of the opportunities there are for people in the meat industry because of the way we put a price on carbon and because of the way the programs that we have set up to work with this industry are able to work with meat producers. If the member is directly concerned about the circumstances of this meat producer he should be referring to the minister's answer and to those opportunities.                              To the member who asked the question: I am not surprised to receive this question from him, when he has said in this House in the past that there is no evidence that CO2 in the atmosphere controls the climate - that is, he denies the science; he denies that we need to do anything about carbon pollution. We know that there is a healthy constituency of deniers -                                                                     Ms GILLARD:                    Certainly there are opportunities for people in the meat industry; I refer the member to them. We are determined to cut carbon pollution. We know that the Leader of the Opposition supports putting a price on carbon and that he would keep this carbon price if he were ever Prime Minister - that is, he shares the belief of every other living Liberal leader. I understand the member who asked the question may have a different view about whether carbon should be priced, but this Leader of the Opposition certainly believes in pricing carbon and he will keep this carbon price if he is ever Prime Minister.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Moreton. I got a little bit excited when the member for Dickson got up earlier; I thought I might have got a health question from the member for Dickson. It is 252 days since I have been health minister, and there has not been a question yet from the member for Dickson. In fact, it is 1,098 days since the shadow minister for health has asked a minister for health a question - that is 155 weeks; nearly three years.                              Human history is about builders and wreckers. We are the builders; they are the wreckers. Nowhere is that more obvious than in our health system.                                                                    Ms PLIBERSEK:                    The Gillard government investment in health means 2,000 more nurses in our emergency departments, 5½ thousand more GPs in practice or in training, 1,300 extra subacute beds, more than 60 GP superclinics and more than 420 infrastructure grants. In fact, the GP infrastructure grants and the GP superclinics have been welcomed by many opposite - usually in their electorates, not in here. I saw that the member for Gilmore was welcoming, quite rightly, one of these marvellous investments in her own community recently. Unfortunately, this is one of the programs that the Leader of the Opposition says he would cut - a $355 million cut. You simply cannot have it both ways. As health minister, the Leader of the Opposition cut $1 billion from our public hospital system. That meant longer waiting times for emergency and for surgery. He saw the GP shortage blow out and bulk-billing rates at rock bottom. In the 2010 election he promised to cut $5 billion from health spending. You only need to look around at the states and territories to see what that sort of cut would mean: in Queensland, cutting breast screening services, $80 million coming out of hospitals and 4,000 health workers cut; in Victoria $25 million from community health services, including $1 million out of women's health; and, in New South Wales, cuts to emergency after hours - I know that up at the Mullumbimby hospital they are going to lose their after-hours doctor - and 3,600 staff from the health department are reported to be cut.                                                                    Ms PLIBERSEK:                    It is under the New South Wales government, which manages the New South Wales health system. In fact, under this government we see historically high rates of bulk-billing, we see PBS reforms that have reduced the cost of 1,000 medicines by as much as $15 a packet and we see a GP hotline providing after-hours care to more than 100,000 people in their own home. I have to say that this government is for building; those opposite are for wrecking, and we see it in health more than anywhere.               </DOC>

  To the member's question: first, the question asserts something which is false. It is misleading to attribute, as the member has, the entire electricity price rise experienced by football clubs, or indeed any other entity, to the carbon price.                              Indeed, the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency's office spoke to the West Adelaide Football Club this morning, who confirmed that around half of the price rise quoted in the Advertiser was due to network costs - that is, it is due to the kinds of costs I have been raising publicly and that initially the Leader of the Opposition denied existed. It is due to those kinds of costs.                              As the member who asked the question may know from my statements and the government's statements, we are concerned about the impact of those network costs. The Leader of the Opposition denied their existence and then backflipped on this yesterday and said that there are substantial price rises due to things like this. We are determined to make a difference to these problems in our electricity system. That is why I am determined to drive a process of change at the Council of Australian Governments meeting.                              Firstly, the question is misleading. Secondly -                                                                     Ms GILLARD:                    I understand that the opposition would be embarrassed when once again their fear campaign has been shown to be false, but I do believe I have an obligation to the House, when a question that contains a falsity is asked, to correct that falsity. I say to the member who asked the question that Treasury modelling has estimated that the carbon impact price on sport and recreation is at 0.3 per cent or around 20c per week. This includes the impact on football clubs. This means that clubs can very slightly raise ticket prices. We are talking about a couple of cents against a background where we have provided an average assistance to households of $10.10 a week. So, in terms of carbon pricing, the people who attend that sporting club will have seen the benefit of tax cuts, pension increases and family payment increases.                              I have indicated the modest impact of carbon pricing. Fifty per cent of this increase is about the network cost, and the member has offered no answer to that. The Leader of the Opposition until recently denied its existence. But we are determined to get on with the job of making a difference for these kinds of power price rises for the future.                              Leave not granted.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for La Trobe for her question because I can assure her and all members of the House that we are standing up for everyday Aussies, that we are standing up for ordinary people when it comes to jobs and skills. I am pleased to report to the House that, when it comes to jobs, since this government was elected in 2007 there have been 810,000 new jobs created in Australia. I am also pleased to report to the House that it is forecasted that in the next five years there will be another 830,000 jobs created.                              I am also pleased to report to the House that the work on skills is continuing, courtesy of this government. In the next four years, 375,000 people will receive vocational education qualifications, courtesy of the funding of this federal government. I am also pleased to report that there are 462,000 trainees and apprentices currently being educated, courtesy of the support of this government. This is what good governments do to help training and skills.                              I am pleased that in the member for La Trobe's own seat, courtesy of the Building the Education Revolution, Timbarra Primary School, Narre Warren North Primary School and Hillcrest Christian College have all received valuable support and infrastructure which they would not have got but for the fact that Labor is in power.                              Then I am asked about what risks there are to jobs and skills in the workplaces of the future. Of course, there is always a risk. The risk is a political party seeking to form government who will not reveal their policies on workplace relations. I think we all know where this part of the answer is going, don't we? What a conniption those opposite had last week when Senator Xenophon belled the cat. At least he talked about what those on the far right want to talk about. He has proposed scrapping penalty rates unless you work for 10 hours a day or after the first 38 hours in a week. That is what Senator Xenophon said. I do not agree with what he is saying, but I respect the fact that he is not too frightened, unlike those opposite, to reveal what he actually thinks.                              But if those opposite lack the ticker to reveal their policies then we have to go searching for their policies. Where they are best found is in the antics of the east coast premiers. Who on earth dreamed up in Victoria cutting $300 million to TAFEs? A Liberal Premier dreamed that up. Who on earth dreamed up cutting workers compensation -                                                                     Mr SHORTEN:                    Who dreamed up cutting workers compensation in New South Wales? It was a Liberal Premier. Who in Queensland dreamed up cutting 25,000 jobs? It was an LNP Premier. These people in Queensland, where you have Jeff Kennett-lite trying to run the state, show the real truth of the opposition. You cannot be trusted to run the government because you are no good for skills or -                </DOC>

  I have to say I am admiring of the member for North Sydney's gumption. He obviously thinks the best means of defence is attack. This government will bring the budget to surplus. The opposition has $70 billion unaccounted for. The shadow finance minister has acknowledged that on TV, and the way they will find that is by cutting health and education -                                                                     Ms GILLARD:                    We will fund our Labor agenda by finding offsetting savings and making the necessary arrangements in the government's budget, as we have shown our ability to do, and we will bring the budget to surplus. We will do those things just as we have done. We found $100 billion of savings to fund key aspects of our agenda. We will continue to work to manage the government's budget responsibly at every step of the way and to bring the budget to surplus. The risk to the budget, of course, is the plans of the Leader of the Opposition - the $70 billion that he intends to cut out of schools, cut out of health, cut out of support to families. This week we have had revealed to us one of the big targets, and that is state schools.                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    Let me say to the member for North Sydney again: next time he wants to ask a question like this, bring in what shows where your $70 billion worth of cuts are going to fall. Bring in how much money is going to be cut out of each public school.                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    The Australian people are entitled to know that. What they will know from us is we will manage the budget responsibly.              </DOC>

  We believe that the Olympic Dam project is a very important project for the future of South Australia, which is why every step of the way we have worked strongly with BHP, the proponents of Olympic Dam, in order to see this project realised for South Australia. Of course, BHP has to go through all of its internal processes and decision making, as is proper, but the government has worked consistently with BHP and will continue to do so.                              The Leader of the Opposition refers to a statement from Mr Jac Nasser about uncertainty in tax policy. The source of that uncertainty is the Leader of the Opposition. The tax policies and plans of this government are clear and are there for all to see. We have legislated the minerals resource rent tax. There is no uncertainty: every mining company in Australia is well aware of the rules. We have legislated carbon pricing. There is no uncertainty: every mining company, indeed every business that has to pay a carbon price - a very limited number of them, well under 1,000 - is well aware of the rules. We have set up a business tax working group. You could not take a more consultative approach to the future of business taxation.                              We on this side of the House wanted to deliver a one per cent reduction in the company tax but ran into the destructive negativity of the Leader of the Opposition, who has prevented businesses around Australia, whether BHP or any other, from realising that one per cent tax cut. The Leader of the Opposition actually plans a company tax increase for businesses like BHP. So, on this side of the parliament there is responsible economic policy, a budget coming to surplus, certainty for the business community and a consultative approach about the future; on that side of the parliament, yes, there is risk - you betcha!              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Greenway for her question and I thank her for her concern and representation of her local community. She understands that it is the obligation of government to work as hard as it can to give people in communities like hers the benefit of jobs and prosperity. That is why we have made the right choices to keep our economy strong. We made the right choices during the days of the global financial crisis to keep people in work. We have created 800,000 jobs, but we have also understood that there is nothing about the future that can be taken for granted. If we want to be a prosperous country in this changing world, if we want to be a prosperous country living as we do in this incredible region of change, we have to take the right decisions now to build that prosperity. The right decisions, now, include increasing the skills and capacities of the Australian people - there is nothing more important than investing in education and skills for the prosperity of the future. They include building our infrastructure - traditional infrastructure like roads, rail and ports - but also having broadband around the country because of the clear prosperity and productivity benefits of such broadband. The member for Greenway is in a very expert position to speak about that, given her experience before she came into the parliament. They include seizing a clean energy future and making sure that as our economy continues to grow we are cutting carbon pollution and that we decouple economic growth from creating more and more carbon pollution. It is about ensuring that we get each of these policies right in order to build prosperity.                              Having done that, you can then keep investing strongly in the things that help people make a life and that help people in times of need - things like the National Disability Insurance Scheme and our record investments in health. We on this side of the House are determined to keep making the right choices to build a strong economy and not have reckless vandalism that destroys economic progress; build a budget surplus, not a $70 billion black hole which would require the slashing and burning of the services that families rely on; build future prosperity by recognising and acting on challenges like carbon pollution and a need for broadband, not denying that those challenges exist or trying to play a reckless, destructive fear campaign with them; and build Australia's education system and invest in Australian schools, not put schools around the nation on a hit list so you can cut back their funding.              </DOC>

  I thank the shadow Treasurer for that question, He certainly knows all about high-taxing government. He was a member of the highest taxing government in Australia's history. Tax to GDP peaked at 24.2 per cent under the Howard government. We are committed to keeping the tax-to-GDP ratio at or below the level that we inherited. The tax-to-GDP ratio is just 22.1 per cent in 2012-13. So I think by any measure we have demonstrated that we can put in place a very strong fiscal policy and that we can make the savings in our budget to fund our Labor priorities - and that is what we have been doing.                                                                    Mr SWAN:                    We have a proven track record of making room for Labor priorities, such as our Paid Parental Leave scheme. Those opposite want to put tax up to fund their parental leave scheme. They have a commitment to jack up company taxes under the Leader of the Opposition, the shadow Treasurer and the shadow finance minister - the three stooges who are in charge of economic policy on that side of the House.                                                                    Mr SWAN:                    I do withdraw. We on this side of the House will put in place - and we are putting this in place - very strict fiscal discipline. We have made the savings to fund Labor priorities and we will continue to do that. We will meet our commitment to keep the tax-to-GDP ratio below the level that we inherited from those opposite.                              Of course, we know why we are getting these questions today. It is because the shadow Treasurer over there on breakfast television -                                                                     Mr SWAN:                    The shadow Treasurer over there on breakfast television told tens of thousands of viewers of Sunrise - he was sitting next to the minister for the environment - that he had a $70 billion -                                                                     Mr SWAN:                    We are bringing our budget back into surplus in 2012-13 and we are doing it because we have put in place expenditure restraints, the type of expenditure restraints you did not see from the shadow Treasurer over there or the shadow finance minister when they were in government.                                                                    Mr SWAN:                    I am. I am referring to taxation. I am referring to our commitment to keep the tax-to-GDP ratio below the level that we inherited from those opposite, who were the highest taxing government in our history. I am referring to our record of making savings to make room for our Labor priorities. I am also referring to the fact that there is a $70 billion crater in their budget bottom line, which is one of the reasons they have committed at this stage to jacking up the company tax rate. So there is a very clear contrast between the fiscal discipline we see on this side of the House and the clowns that are running economic policy on that side of the House.               </DOC>

  I thank the member for Page and acknowledge her longstanding interest in Defence matters. The Australian Human Rights Commission report into the treatment of women in the ADF was tabled in the House this morning. The Sex Discrimination Commissioner, who prepared the report, has made some public remarks - as have I and the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel and the Chief of the Defence Force.                              This is a deeply significant report. In the aftermath of the so-called ADFA Skype incident in April 2011, the government commissioned a range of reviews - cultural reviews and reviews of the use of alcohol, the use of social media, personal conduct and the like. The results of those reviews were encapsulated in the document prepared by the Chief of the Defence Force and the secretary, called Pathway to change, which sets the prism through which personal conduct in the ADF is now to be judged. At the same time, I asked the Australian Human Rights Commission to investigate and review the treatment of women at ADFA and in the ADF generally. Commissioner Broderick's report into ADFA was made public in November last year, and today we see her broader work on the treatment of women in the Australian Defence Force. At the same time, members may recall that the government decided and announced that any restrictions on combat roles for women would be removed.                              I thank Commissioner Broderick and her team for this work. I thank the Chief of the Defence Force, the secretary of the department and the service chiefs for their very close cooperation with the commissioner in the preparation of her report. The government accepts the report and agrees in principle with its recommendations. I have asked the Chief of the Defence Force and the service chiefs to implement the report and to do that in a detailed way. There is a built-in review by the Sex Discrimination Commissioner of that implementation progress in 12 months time, as there is with the ADFA report.                              To give members a flavour of the report and its recommendations, as asked by the member for Page, the starting point for the report is that the equal treatment of women should be at the core of any Australian workplace and should be a core Defence value. The equal treatment of women should be a core Defence value not just for equality reasons but because to not do so undermines the operational effectiveness of the Australian Defence Force. In the modern era, with modern platforms, we are not just talking about physical strength; we are talking about intellectual strength and attributes. We know from other areas of Australian society that women can do this equally as well as, if not better than, men.                              There will be a report tabled every year with the annual report marking the progress which Defence needs to make to get to this ideal, to get to this positive outcome where women are treated equally in Defence, in particular and including the senior leadership roles, which are advisedly no longer to be restricted to those people who have undertaken a core combat role. This is a deeply significant report and I commend it to all members of the House.               </DOC>

  First, we will check the facts, because our experience this week is that the opposition's campaign of falsity includes questions that it comes into this parliament and asks. Facts have been wrong in questions all week - things misrepresented to add to the fear campaign. So we will check the facts because of that experience this week as part of the fear campaign. Second, I have answered this question on more than one occasion this week. The opposition may want to keep running its fear campaign despite the facts, but the facts are these. The carbon price is paid by a very limited number of businesses that generate a lot of carbon pollution.                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    Yes, the fools in the opposition think that laughing loudly changes a fact. But that is a fact and no amount of laughing or overacting changes that fact. Fact No. 2: we have always said that there would be some flow-through impact on electricity. When the opposition was wandering around the country falsely claiming that this would be astronomical, what we did was patiently go about our work and the regulators backed the government on the facts. That is what has happened. As a result of those increases in electricity - yes, it is true that some small businesses have seen increases in their electricity - we have put the consumers of the products of those businesses in a position where they have been assisted with tax cuts, family payment increases and pension increases. What that means, of course, is that on average the assistance provided to a family has been $10.10 a week. They are the facts.                              The member who asked the question has been in this parliament in one way or another over a considerable period of time. She is the sort of person who stood happily in the Howard government as they said they would have an emissions trading scheme. That is, she is the sort of person who has gone out to her community and said she supports carbon pricing. Well, she is in good company: John Howard, Brendan Nelson, Malcolm Turnbull and this Leader of the Opposition. No amount of spin and falsity from the opposition changes the fact that they support carbon pricing or changes the fact that if they were ever in government again they would keep the price on carbon. I trust the member will tell her constituents those facts.                              Leave not granted.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for New England for his question. I am aware of MBD Energy and James Cook University's cooperation on this issue. In fact, the government recently announced, through my colleague the Minister for Resources and Energy, a $5 million grant to assist this particular project. The grant is a tremendous example actually -                                                                     Mr COMBET:                                                      of the type of innovative project that can make a difference and help us establish a clean energy future for this country. MBD Energy is in fact at the forefront of the biofuels industry. It has projects across a wide range of clean tech industries. This particular grant I mentioned is for the macro-algae fuel program, which is developing methods for abating greenhouse gas emissions from facilities such as coal-fired electricity stations and using those gases as inputs in the algae growth and, ultimately, into biomass feedstock, which, as the member for New England indicated, has a number of potential applications, particularly in important growth markets in the Asia-Pacific region. This is a matter that many electricity generators - including one in my own electorate - have been examining, but it is something that becomes feasible as we put a price on greenhouse gas emissions in our economy.                              It is in fact but one example of the many changes that a carbon price is already driving in our economy. For example, grants have started to be made under the Clean Technology Program, which is a one billion-dollar program funded from carbon price revenue and directed towards assistance to the manufacturing sector to improve its energy efficiency and its emissions intensity. For example, one facility that I visited at Emu Plains called Crafty Chef has come up with changes that will reduce by 54 per cent the amount of electricity they use to produce a frozen meal for distribution through Woolworths outlets. That has cut their energy consumption per unit of output by 54 per cent -                                                                                       Mr COMBET:                    It is a big joke, according to the Leader of the Opposition, but it is actually pretty important. It means they can freeze a meal within one and a half hours, not ten hours, they will increase their turnover from $20 million to $50 million, and they will employ more people - that is, it will create jobs through clean technology.                                                                  I also visited Richgro Garden Products at Jandakot in Western Australia, who are installing a waste-to-energy plant that uses organic waste to generate electricity, and there are numerous other examples that can be pointed to of constructive changes in the                   economy, and particularly in manufacturing and food processing, that are happening right now. That will continue under a carbon price. And                   that is why at the end of the day the coalition will not and cannot repeal this legislation.               </DOC>

  I thank the member for his question. The Australian economy is the strongest developed economy in the world. We have impressive growth, we have low unemployment and we are outperforming every other major advanced economy. Unemployment, at 5.2 per cent, is less than half of that in countries across Europe. Inflation is at a 13-year low and official interest rates are lower than at any time under the previous government. That is a remarkable combination of economic fundamentals for any developed economy to have.                              Something like 800,000 jobs have been created in this country in the period of the Labor government, because jobs have been our number one priority. We understand that access to skills, access to training and access to education not only gets Australians into jobs but also gets them into better paid jobs. It produces more jobs, but it produces higher quality jobs. That is why we on this side of the House are absolutely committed to lifting the standard of education and making sure that no kid anywhere in our country is left behind. We believe in a better education for every Australian.                              Those on the other side of the House believe that too much money is being spent on public schools. The Leader of the Opposition said this was an injustice. That speaks volumes about the values of the Leader of the Opposition, but I think it does sound a warning bell about opposition plans to cut investment in public education in Australia. They are absolutely desperate to cut basic public services, particularly in health and education.                              We know that the shadow Treasurer let the cat out of the bag when he admitted on Sunrise on 12 August last year that there was a $70 billion crater in the Liberal party's budget bottom line. He sat there beside the environment minister and made that statement, but now he goes out there and says he never said it - then who was impersonating the shadow Treasurer on 12 August last year?                                                The fact is, there is a secret agenda here: to slash education and to slash public health. It is a secret agenda that is straight from the playbook of Premier Campbell Newman in Queensland. His approach was to not say anything about these cuts until after the election. There has been a bit of a change in the strategy today because we now have the shadow Finance Minister out there with his new plan in the Financial Review, 'Coalition's radical new federalism', detailing coalition plans to offload jobs to the states. Do you know what the plan is? He wants to outsource government to government. That is his plan. But when you drill down a bit, what you actually see is that they want to outsource their slashing and burning to the Liberal state premiers. That is what this plan is all about. We on this side of the House will continue to invest in skills. They will slash it.               </DOC>

  I thank the member for his question. To the member's question I would remind him of the facts, and no amount of fear campaigning from the opposition changes the facts, as inconvenient as they are for the opposition. So, they will shout, they will go and pull stunts and they will come in and ask questions where they have the facts wrong, but nothing changes the facts. The facts are, of course, as I have just said to the member over here, that it is only big businesses that generate a lot of carbon pollution that pay the carbon price. That is the design of the scheme. Had Prime Minister Howard been re-elected in 2007, that would have been the design of his scheme, and the Leader of the Opposition would have been travelling the length and breadth of the country to advocate for it.                              With a scheme designed that way, yes, there is some flowthrough impact; we always understood that. We said to small businesses, who do not have to fill in any additional forms - unlike the crushing burden of paperwork that fell on top of them when the GST was implemented by the former Howard government - that they should pass those costs through. And let us remind ourselves of the magnitude - in terms of the cost of living, 0.7 per cent, less than a cent in a dollar. In order to help Australian families with that we have provided tax cuts.                              The member would represent people in this parliament earning less than $80,000 - indeed, he would represent thousands of them - who have a tax cut. He would represent some working women who have gone from paying tax to paying no tax. He would represent some pensioners who have seen a historic pension increase and now, on top of it, 20 per cent more assistance than they need to deal with the average impact of carbon pricing.                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    He would represent people with families who have seen an increase in their family payments, and will see one again from this government from the proceeds of the Minerals Resource Rent Tax, because we believe in sharing the benefits of the boom.                              They are the facts. No amount of distortion from the opposition changes those facts. I think you can see it written all over their faces today. They are like mice running around on the same wheel. They run and run and run, and there is a lot of activity but they do not get anywhere.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Petrie for that very important question. I have to say that, by and large, the Commonwealth and the states have worked very well and very cooperatively together on health reform. In fact, last year we struck a deal that will increase hospital funding by $20 billion over the next decade. In the case of Queensland, Labor have committed about $13½ billion for health facilities and for hospital services under that agreement. These investments have ranged from very big ticket items, like almost one quarter of a billion dollars for the Townsville Hospital upgrade or $210 million for seven regional cancer centres across Queensland, to smaller but no less important investments, like half a million dollars for the extension of the Bloomhill cancer therapy house, which I was delighted to open with Senator Claire Moore recently. Indeed, in the member for Petrie's electorate there is investment like $7 million into the North Lakes hospital renal unit.                              I hear today that there are plans from those opposite to outsource health to the states. I am all for devolving decision making to a local level where we can. Indeed, that is why we have established 136 local hospital networks and that is why we have established Medicare Locals. It is curious, however, that the only single health policy we have heard from those opposite is the smashing of Medicare Locals. So, on the one hand, we have the finance shadow minister talking about outsourcing health to the states and then, on the other hand, we have another shadow minister talking about smashing devolution -                                                                     Ms PLIBERSEK:                    and smashing the very services that deliver better after-hours care, better access to psychological services -                                                                     Ms PLIBERSEK:                    We have smashing outsourcing and we have outsourcing. What you see when you outsource health to Queensland are cuts. We have seen cuts to Breastscreen Queensland. We have seen reported cuts of $80 million to hospital services in Brisbane. We have seen plans to cut 4,000 jobs from the health service, the axing of 30 beds from the Prince Charles Hospital in Chermside and surgeries put on hold at the Princess Alexandra Hospital. You know what? We wanted to build 55 mental health beds in Queensland. Here it is in this 2011 budget press release -                                                                     Ms PLIBERSEK:                    bids in Bundaberg, Hervey Bay, Maryborough and Toowoomba, but it is all of a piece. Queensland did not want those beds under Campbell Newman because this Leader of the Liberal Party, when he was health minister, cut $1 billion out of hospital services.                                                                    Ms PLIBERSEK:                    It's wrong, is it? Here it is in your own budget papers. Here it is - minus, minus, minus, minus - $1 billion out of hospital services.              </DOC>

  To the member who asked the question, once again we reserve the right to check the facts because we have found consistently this week, including in the area involving agriculture, meatworks and the like, that the opposition has come into this parliament and claimed things that are simply wrong. So we reserve the right to check what is being asserted by the member. Why would we be surprised at all that the opposition would be asserting things that are wrong? This is the same opposition that said Whyalla would be wiped off the map. This is the same opposition that said there would be no coal mining anymore. This is the same opposition that said there would be astronomical increases in the price of living. This is the same opposition that has gone up and down the country peddling fear instead of facts.                              I would remind the member who asked the question that in assessing the impact of carbon pricing on a small business, what we find from the opposition is that they are coming in here and either getting it entirely wrong or are seeking to misrepresent the position. Electricity prices are only one component -                                                                     Ms GILLARD:                    I was just about to say, for businesses electricity prices are only one component of their costs. For the vast majority of businesses, total electricity costs are two per cent or less of their turnover, making a carbon price impact of around 0.2 per cent. Then, when you have truly assessed the carbon price impact, there are various ways of businesses working to reduce their carbon emissions, to reduce their electricity usage, to adopt clean energy measures and energy efficient measures. The government is working with business to provide assistance with a number of those measures.                              I hope the member is not so blinkered that she is participating in the fear campaign or that she is not doing things like providing information to her constituents about the $40 million Energy Efficient Information Grants program, which is helping small businesses cut energy costs. I hope she is not so determined to be out there peddling fear that she is not pointing to all aspects of this package.                              Once again, I would remind the member for Murray, who is a member of long standing in this place, that she was a supporter of a price on carbon. She asked her constituents to vote for her in 2007 on the basis of supporting a price on carbon. She proudly supported John Howard's emissions trading scheme and the truth is if she was going -                                                                     Ms GILLARD:                    The truth is she can say to this business that if she was to sit on the government benches again she would be supporting a price on -                                                                      Dr STONE:                    The Prime Minister asked for this information in her answer. This is the itemised bill showing the charge.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Fowler very much for his question and for all the work he does for the families in his electorate. He knows this Labor government has a very strong record in delivering for Australian families. Most recently we have delivered millions of household assistance payments to families around the country. Next year there is more to come. There will be the Schoolkids Bonus at the start and in the middle of next year. Also in the middle of next year there will be further increases in family payments to help those families make ends meet.                              What we know now is that the Leader of the Opposition and all these Liberals over there have got a secret plan to cut this support to Australian families. All of us read -                                                                     Ms MACKLIN:                    What we know is that this Leader of the Opposition wants to outsource support for families and outsource support for people with disabilities to his mates in the states that have now got a very clear record of slashing and burning support for families. What we can see is that in Victoria, in New South Wales and in Queensland families are losing support for playgroups, losing support for disability services and losing family payment support. If you look at what has happened in Victoria, the Victorian government cut the School Start Bonus so that 40,000 low-income families lost support because of the Victorian government's budget change. The Liberals in Queensland are up to it every single day of the week. The Liberals in Queensland have cut the extra support to people with disability. They have cut support to domestic violence services. They have cut support to tenancy advice services and, just today, they slashed Queensland's child protection watchdog.                              That is the latest effort from the Premier of Queensland. Families know that this Leader of the Opposition will do exactly what his Liberal mates are doing in every state in the country -                                                                      Ms MACKLIN:                    We know that Liberal governments around the country are slashing and burning, and this Liberal Party opposite will do exactly the same to fill its $70 billion budget black hole.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for this question. I would direct him to the comments made by the Minister for Climate Change during the course of this question time - I believe it was in answer to a question from the member for New England. He outlined some of the support and work that is happening to help cold storage businesses - it was a business that was refrigerating meals - to cut their electricity costs and seize a clean energy future. I refer the member to the Minister for Climate Change's answer because it is pointing him to parts of the clean energy future package, the carbon pricing package, that can work with the sort of business that he is describing. I would say to the member that, rather than going out and peddling fear and falsity, it would be better if he directed that business to aspects of the carbon pricing package which may be able to help them seize a clean energy future. That is the kind of thing that local members do.                              Can I also say in respect of the member's question about carbon pricing that I am a little surprised that this seems to be the only day on which the Leader of the Opposition has not come into this parliament and backed in his stunt for the day by raising it as a question. He has talked about Olympic Dam but he has not talked about the cost-of-living-impacts of carbon on families. He was out with a family today. I am wondering if was too frightened to raise that because one of the members of that family was a public servant. Maybe he thought this was a particularly bad day to be talking about the cost of living for a family whose job he is trying to destroy - like those of 12,000 others. He is destroying not only jobs but also health and education services.                              Unlike the opposition, we will continue to get this nation ready for a prosperous future. A clean energy future is part of that. The member who asked the question stood for a price on carbon in the 2007 election. If he wants to talk to his constituents about the future, he should make sure he tells them that John Howard supports a price on carbon, Brendan Nelson does, Malcolm Turnbull does and so does this Leader of the Opposition.

  I thank the member for Parramatta for her question. As people know, the government commissioned an independent review into school funding led by the Sydney businessman Mr David Gonski, with a number of eminent panel members from across the political spectrum, because we care about the future of education. Importantly, the panel found that our existing school funding system is broken, leaving too many schools and too many students behind. It also found that funding should match student need, so that all students - whatever school they are in - can reach their potential. Those at the coalface of education - the parents, the principals and the teachers - have overwhelmingly agreed with these findings. Some members of the coalition, it seems, are tending that way too.                              Despite the findings of this independent panel, the Leader of the Opposition disagrees, saying very clearly - and he repeated it just in case somebody missed it - that 'the current funding for government schools is an injustice'. It seems that 'justice' in the mind of the mind of the Leader of the Opposition would be if school systems were funded purely on their share of enrolments. He does not agree that there should be additional funding according to need - just a straight split in funding between school systems based on enrolments.                              I challenge the Leader of the Opposition to visit schools working in difficult circumstances around the country and repeat his comment that their funding represents an injustice. He should turn up at a few P&amp;C meetings over the next couple of months - he could move for a suspension of standing orders, because that is what he knows something about - and then address the P&amp;C and say, 'There is no question of injustice to public schools; if anything the injustice is the other way', and then repeat it: 'If anything the injustice is the other way.' Perhaps the members for Parkes, Mallee and Durack would welcome the opposition leader to an awards ceremony at one of their schools in remote or rural Australia, schools that receive additional funding based on their circumstances rather than just the number of students. The opposition leader could open his remarks to those schools by telling the parents gathered there: 'You know what? The great injustice in school funding in Australia is that public schools, such as the schools in regional Australia, receive too much money.' I think if he opened his address in that way, he would not get too many return invitations. The fact of the matter is that the opposition leader is suggesting that if in fact we have a split in funding based on school enrolments that would represent a cut to government schools of $2.5 billion a year. On top of the $2.8 billion that the opposition has on the slate for cuts to school funding, the opposition leader, by saying it is an injustice to fund government schools, has added to that figure.               </DOC>

  I thank the shadow minister for education for his question. I am not at all surprised that the question is not about education, given that the opposition is trying to cover up its plans to cut public schools to get one in seven teachers out of the teaching service.                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    I refer the member for Sturt to an answer to a question from 13 May 2010. It was a question from Senator Michael Ronaldson in the Senate where his matter arising out of Senate estimates was dealt with. I refer him to the paragraph dealing with the Industrial Registrar telephoning -                                                                     Ms GILLARD:                    I was referring to this paragraph in the answer:                              The Industrial Registrar telephoned Mr Ben Hubbard (then Chief of Staff to -                               me as Deputy Prime Minister -                               on 8 April and advised that inquiries under section 330 of Schedule 1 of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 had been commenced in relation to the Health Services Union National Office and Victorian No 1 Branch and that investigation(s) under section 331 may ensue. Mr Williams also indicated he would not be making any public comment on the matter.                              That paragraph is accurate and has been on the public record now since 13 May 2010 - the best part of 2 ½ years.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for her question. Indeed, this is a government that is getting on with the job of building the infrastructure that we need, including the National Broadband Network. This is an investment to transform our economy and deliver superfast, affordable and reliable broadband to all Australians, no matter where they live.                              Those opposite have sought to wreck the NBN reforms all the way, while having no alternative credible policy. After 22 failed broadband plans when they were in government, the latest thought bubble is to model their policy on British Telecom's fibre to the node. But even the Tory minister for communications in the UK describes this as 'a temporary stepping stone to fibre to the home'. Peter Cochrane, the former chief technology officer of British Telecom, describes this system as 'one of the biggest mistakes humanity has made'. The truth is that their broadband policy, if you can call it that, just does not stack up, which is why on 20 August Alan Kohler wrote an article in Business Spectator - and you do not have to read it all to get the gist of it - headlined 'The Coalition's NBN policy is madness'. That is what he suggests about their policy, and he suggests that they will dump their policy sometime between now and the election. This upset the member for Wentworth a bit, so he had a long chat, according to Alan Kohler. After the chat, Alan Kohler wrote another article the next day - and you do not have to read all of it to get the gist of it - headed 'Sorry Malcolm, it's still crazy'. I table that article for the benefit of members.                              It is indeed crazy to lock Australia into a second-rate broadband policy reliant on an ageing copper wire system. At the same time that the member for Wentworth is trying to lock Australia into an inferior broadband network, he is investing in world-class broadband to future-proof France's digital economy, because he is investing in France Telecom, which is building a fibre-to-the-home broadband network in France to 15 million homes. He wants to spend billions of taxpayers' dollars here on a second-rate network, but when it comes to his own money he puts it into fibre to the home in France.                              We just require a bit of consistency. We know they know about the internet because we see them dealing off the issues that are on the internet time after time and we see their connections to the Tea Party - they were evident in the gallery earlier today.               </DOC>

  I thank the member for her question and for her interest in workplace relations. In terms of the proposition about what the government is doing to make sure that the governance of registered organisations is good, there has never been a time under this government when there has been such strong regulation of registered organisations. Let me go through the evidence to support the proposition I advance today. Under this government we have increased the penalties for people who are found to have breached their obligations under the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act. We are the ones who put an administrator into the troubled parts of the Health Services Union - that is, the HSU East branch. Under this government we have increased the educational standards required of people who hold fiduciary positions in registered organisations. Under this government we have strengthened the powers of the General Manager of the Fair Work Act. So we have a record of talking the talk and walking the walk.                              The only disappointment I have here is that, when it comes to workplace relations, the opposition only ever want to talk about one issue.                                                                    Mr SHORTEN:                    I am entirely confident that in recent years the Australian Workers Union has been very well administered. Let me go further on this question, because we know where the question is coming from. We know that there have been attempts by the Liberal Party to smear and muckrake; what we also know is that that dog is not going to hunt. Only this side of parliament will ever stand up for workers. I am proud to be in a labour movement that stands on the side of getting workers pay rises. I am proud to be part of a government that stands on the side of better health and safety for workers. I am proud to be part of a government that stands for secure jobs. I am proud to be part of a government and a labour movement that stands for the accomplishments of unions. I am also proud to be part of a government, led by our Prime Minister, that stands up for the issues of working people no matter what the topic.                              Need I remind the House of the National Disability Insurance Scheme? Need I remind the House of what we intend to do to improve the funding of schools, wherever they are and regardless of the postcode? Let me also make it clear that we on this side of the House will never be part of the sort of antics we see from the 'mini-me's' of the coalition federally - I refer of course to the East Coast state premiers. We will never be part of the wholesale job cuts that Campbell Newman is proposing in Queensland; we will never be part of Barry O'Farrell's attack on injured workers; and we will never be part of Ted Baillieu's attack on TAFE.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for McEwen for his question. I know that he has been talking closely with youth organisations and other community and health providers in his electorate for some time now about the headspace model. I enjoyed spending some time with him last Friday in Wallan with the new secondary school there and a range of other providers who are very excited about the headspace announcement for the member for McEwen's part of North Melbourne.                              Before the last election, the Prime Minister committed her government in the second term to making mental health reform a priority. Last year's budget delivered on that commitment with the largest ever package of new mental health initiatives in the Commonwealth's history. Over the course of this year we have been busy delivering on those initiatives - many of which, like headspace, are directed at younger people in the community because, unlike most major health conditions, mental illness tends to emerge early in life. A quarter of disorders emerge before the age of 12, two-thirds emerge before the age of 21 and three-quarters emerge before the age of 25. We know that young people, particularly young men, are less likely than any other cohort in the community to seek and access treatment. That is why building services where young people and their families feel comfortable going is such a critical part of our reform agenda.                              Forty headspace services are now open. Each of them is receiving double the core funding that they used to receive. Fifteen more now have lead agencies and will be open this summer. In the last fortnight I announced 15 more locations. They are in the member for McEwen's area, in the member for Kooyong's area - and the member for Kooyong has been advocating very strongly for a headspace in his part of Melbourne - and in many other areas across the country.                              Since October, headspace has been operating a phone and internet counselling service 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year.                                                                    Mr BUTLER:                    I do note, Christopher. It is also funded to deliver a crisis outreach service to schools impacted by suicide, which tragically still occurs two or three times per week on average.                              This month I also announced the results of round 1 of the early psychosis youth centres. Every jurisdiction expressed interest in this round, and it will see up to four services established in New South Wales, one in the Northern Territory and two in Western Australia, with service planning ongoing in Victoria and a second round which will open in September.                              In addition to these and other initiatives targeted particularly at young people, there are several other initiatives already being delivered to support adults with mental illness. While there is more to do, these initiatives are transforming the services available to the millions of Australians who live with mental illness.              </DOC>

  I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. The Minister for Resources and Energy today has been talking about the prices we have been seeing for commodities. He has indicated that prices have come off a bit - or, if you like, that the commodity price boom has passed its peak - but that there is huge investment phase which still has some way to run and that the export boom in resources still has a very long way to run. The point that the resources minister made - and indeed I am making it myself now - has been made repeatedly and it is actually in the government's budget papers as well.                               The fact is that Australia's terms of trade peaked about a year ago after reaching 150-year highs, but they still remain at historically high levels. What that means is that we will continue to see this nation earn a great deal of prosperity and wealth from exporting resources. We will continue to see billions of dollars invested in our resources sector. We will continue to see the opening of new projects and we will continue to see investment decisions made for those new projects. So, the mining boom - the amount we are earning from exporting minerals - will be with us for a long time to come.                               But we need to prepare for our long-term future. I have certainly said consistently in this parliament, and as recently as yesterday, that the government is managing the economy to keep it strong and running it in the interests of working people. But we understand that nothing is guaranteed about the future; you always have to build it, and part of building it is making sure that we are continuously upgrading the skills and capacities of the Australian people. That is why we have made record investments in education and we are continuing that journey of change.                              You always have to be prepared to invest in infrastructure and bring in the new technologies of the future. That is why we have invested more than $30 billion in infrastructure projects and why we are delivering the National Broadband Network. We have to be ready for a future in which we tackle climate change and seize the benefits of clean energy sources, and that is why we have priced carbon. These are the preparations the government is making today, including some very hard decisions, so that we have long-term prosperity.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Parramatta for her question and would note that it seems quite remarkable to me that, when a member in this parliament asks about a strong economy, what we get from the opposition are laughter and jeers. It is not clear to me whether they are laughing at the question or whether they are nervously laughing because they are so embarrassed to sit behind a leader who cannot read one page of material about a project as big as Olympic Dam. But whatever is motivating the laughter over there, on this side of the parliament we believe that keeping the economy strong and running it in the interests of working people is serious business. We believe it is such serious business that we as a government have worked hard to ensure that we continue to create jobs, with over 800,000 jobs created since we came to office; that we continue to make the right choices to bring the budget to surplus in 2012-13; and that we continue to do the right things with fiscal policy, which enables the Reserve Bank to do what it does, independently of government, with interest rates.                              We have seen job creation - 800,000 jobs created. Despite a reckless, destructive, hysterical fear campaign, we have seen 14,000 jobs created since the carbon price and the minerals resource rent tax started on 1 July. We are investing in major infrastructure projects that will be the backbone of future growth. We are ensuring that we have the infrastructure of the future, including the National Broadband Network. And as we keep our economy strong, we are finding new ways to distribute the benefits of a strong economy. You keep it growing and you use it for the interests of working people, including improving schools around the country and creating a national disability insurance scheme.                              The opposition are conducting themselves as if these things are somehow luxuries - as if they do not matter to working people and to families around the country, as if they are not necessities. We understand that creating jobs is a necessity for working people, that doing things like tripling the tax-free threshold so people move from paying tax to paying no tax is a necessity for working people, and that helping people out with increased family payments and pensions is a necessity for working people. We understand that doing what we need to do to keep spreading the benefits of the boom is important to working people.                              We will get on with that hard work, keeping the economy strong, always seeing what we can do to assist working people, dealing with the facts and doing the hard work. Over there, the Leader of the Opposition will continue to present to media conferences, sounding like the equivalent of a robocall. He only has one line. It does not matter what the question is; he will say the same thing, because he cannot be bothered doing any work or any reading to inform himself of the facts.               </DOC>

  Can I suggest to the member that he does something that the Leader of the Opposition was incapable of doing before he presented for a national TV interview last night. It will not take him very long; it is just one page. You do not even have to bother going to page 2, because that just has names and contact details on it. And when you do, instead of misrepresenting BHP's position, you will be informed by the facts. And instead of misrepresenting BHP's position on issues like carbon pricing, I would refer him to statements of -                                                                     Ms GILLARD:                    Thank you very much, Madam Deputy Speaker. Going to the member for Sturt's point of order, I grew up in South Australia and that is why I am personally offended by the fact that the Leader of the Opposition cannot be bothered spending one minute reading 600 or 700 words about the future of South Australia.                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    I am offended, as someone who grew up there, that he cannot take a minute of his time to read one page about something as important as Olympic Dam. Every South Australian should be asking themselves: why is it that the Leader of the Opposition can spend some time reading controversial books but he cannot be bothered reading one page about the future of Olympic Dam? They might well be interested in his choice of reading material. He has determined not to read anything that matters to the future of South Australia.                              On the misrepresentations by the member who asked the question, I refer him to the statement of the BHP boss, Marius Kloppers, which ran in the Australian under the heading 'BHP boss Marius Kloppers: it's time for carbon tax'. It read as follows:                              We do believe that such a global initiative -                               a carbon price -                               will eventually come and, when it does, Australia will need to have acted ahead of it to maintain its competitiveness.                              There was never a truer word spoken.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Hindmarsh for his question. As a proud South Australian - unlike the Manager of Opposition Business, the member for Sturt - the last thing he would do is talk down the South Australian economy. Let us be clear -                                                                     Mr MARTIN FERGUSON:                    I withdraw the reflection. Let us be frank, Olympic Dam is not lost to Australia. The decision of BHP Billiton yesterday was a commercial decision. They have clearly indicated that, in terms of the South Australian and Australian governments, they could not have asked for more. Every regulatory approval was in place. This was a potential investment of $30 billion, almost twice the outlays of the South Australian government each year in terms of its budget. BHP Billiton must get this project right.                              Let us have a frank talk about where Australia is at. In every resources boom there are two opportunities. First, there is the benefit of record commodity prices - and we have had that as a nation. The second and most important opportunity is attracting and implementing a pipeline of investment of $270 billion. The Australian community is proud of that. The only person who was very, very pleased with the Olympic Dam decision not going ahead in the immediate future yesterday was the Leader of the Opposition.                                                                    Mr MARTIN FERGUSON:                    To assist the House, Madam Deputy Speaker, we will do a few facts. The $270 million is a great achievement.                                                                    Mr MARTIN FERGUSON:                    Yes, I have withdrawn. The facts hurt.                                                                    Mr MARTIN FERGUSON:                    The facts speak for themselves - $270 billion, an ongoing pipeline of investment, creating wealth for Australia and, perhaps more importantly, creating real jobs for Australia. Let us think about these opportunities. Up at Gladstone, in the hinterland, there is a $55 billion investment under construction at the moment - 12,000 jobs. We are proud of that achievement. Let us go to Gorgon, on Barrow Island - a $43 billion investment, with 4,000 jobs in construction. Think about the multiplier impact on the rest of the Australian economy - marine services, aviation, legal services, financial services, cleaning and catering.                              The difference on this occasion is that we have got a pipeline of investment on an ongoing basis. The opposition, when it was last in government, merely spent a free kick from record commodity prices. Two opportunities - commodity prices and a pipeline of investment - and we achieved both. The Australian community is delighted at us spreading the benefits of this boom, not only in terms of what we are doing in infrastructure and skilling but also creating real long-lasting jobs. We are proud of it and it is about time the Leader of the Opposition was honest. He is very, very pleased with the setback with Olympic Dam yesterday.              </DOC>

  I do thank the shadow Treasurer for his question, because it gives me an opportunity to build on the answer that has been given by the resources minister. The facts do not match the critique and they do not match all of the talking down of our economy that we are seeing from the Leader of the Opposition, the shadow Treasurer and the shadow finance minister. They should be ashamed of what they have done - talking down our economy - because, as the resources minister has pointed out very clearly, we have a record pipeline of investment in the resources sector. There is nothing announced by BHP yesterday which indicates anything of the sort that was just raised by the shadow Treasurer. This is what the head of BHP said yesterday:                              The South Australian Government, the Federal Government and all of the agencies that have worked with us to make this a reality have been absolutely wonderful partners and I can't put that in more strong terms _                              That was Mr Kloppers yesterday. He went on to say: 'The tax environment for this particular project has not changed at all. The MRRT only covers coal and iron ore, not copper, not gold, not uranium. The tax environment has not changed since we started working on this six or seven years ago.' That is what Mr Kloppers has said. What we have is a record pipeline of investment in resources - an additional $90 billion in the past year alone and, as the resources minister said, $270 billion at the advanced stage. What do we get? We get the continual trashing of our economy by those opposite to hide their embarrassment at the fact that there is a $70 billion crater -                                                                     Mr HOCKEY:                    On a point of order, Madam Deputy Speaker: I referred to the CEO of Glencore, the biggest trading company in the world and one of the largest miners who said:                              _ Australia does have its risk, yes. We saw the carbon tax, we saw the mineral resource tax.                              I ask him to answer the question.                                                                    Mr SWAN:                    I was making this point very clearly: that since we announced both a carbon price and a resource rent tax, investment has gone through the roof. That is the truth of it. The decision that has been taken by BHP on Olympic Dam has been taken for entirely commercial purposes and it has absolutely nothing to do with carbon pricing or the MRRT. But for their own base political purposes there is nothing they will not do to talk down our economy. They do it day in, day out, and they demonstrate how unfit they are to be an alternative government.               </DOC>

  I thank the member for Melbourne for his question, because I do acknowledge there is strong community interest in ensuring that all of our public institutions meet the highest standards. The government does take these matters very seriously, but so too does the Reserve Bank. The RBA has responded to the matters that have been raised on 7.30 on Tuesday night and they have rejected the central implications of that report on 7.30. This is what the RBA has had to say:                              On any reasonable reading, the NPA Board at that time sought the appropriate information, sought appropriate advice, responded appropriately to the information it received, and reasonably relied on the advice it received.                              The RBA also stands by its previous statements to the House Economics Committee in respect of both NPA and Securency.                               I am confident that Governor Stevens has handled these matters with complete integrity. The RBA has taken steps over the past few years to tighten controls and to strengthen governance. As the member would be aware, many of these matters are still before the courts. The RBA is fully cooperating with the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions as part of these proceedings. Given that that court consideration is still ongoing, it is obviously inappropriate for me or the government to comment any further.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Fremantle for that very positive question. I notice the laughter on the other side of the House, because they do not appreciate the importance of the investment pipeline in our country. Nor do they appreciate the importance of the strength of our economy. They have absolutely no idea how to manage a $1.5 trillion economy. This government put in place policies to avoid the global financial crisis and to avoid a global recession. The consequence of that is: something like 800,000 Australians are in employment because of the policies that this government has put in place.                              What we have seen in our economy is the biggest investment pipeline in our nation's history.                               I was talking before about the increase in investment. In our time in office, there has been $919 billion of private business investment. As I was saying before, the investment pipeline in terms of advanced resource projects has increased by $90 billion in the last year alone. Today we have seen environmental approval from the minister for the environment for the Alpha project, which could create up to 3,500 jobs in the mine's construction alone.                               These are the facts. These are the cold, hard facts of investment in Australia, and that investment has been taking place in the full knowledge of a price on carbon and an MRRT. We know that the opposition is having a bit of trouble with the facts. We saw the Leader of the Opposition on 7.30 last night, and didn't that one just take the cake! It was the biggest train wreck since his last appearance, where he said you couldn't believe anything that he said; you would have to have it in writing. It was that bad. On 7.30 last night he was claiming that this project was not going ahead because of the carbon price. But when asked by the interviewer whether he had read the statement from BHP, the answer was no, he hadn't. Let's be very clear what BHP has said. This is what BHP has said:                               As you know the tax environment for this particular project has not changed at all since we started working on it six or seven years ago.                              That was bad enough, but what was really bad was the bold-faced porky he told at his press conference today, where he actually denied that he had said it - denied the very fact that he had not actually read this material. That was just a bold-faced lie at his press conference today.                                                                     Mr SWAN:                    I will withdraw. This is a bloke who spends all his time talking about honesty and the truth but he is out there lying every day.

  I was asked about the MRRT. The government will absolutely continue to proceed with the MRRT in the form that we agreed with the mining industry. We on this side of the House understand the importance of putting in place a tax such as the MRRT, which makes sure that Australians receive fair value and full value for the resources that they own 100 per cent. We also know that royalties are very inefficient taxes and they penalise many mines which are not as profitable. It is common sense to say that having a resource rent tax where those resources are superprofitable gives a fair return to the Australian people, and for us to spread that right around our community, and that is what the government intends to do.                               I have also been asked by the member about the views of BHP on the investment environment in Australia, so I would like to quote from what Mr Kloppers said last night:                              The South Australian government, the federal government and all agencies have worked with us to make this a reality. They have been absolutely wonderful partners to have and I cannot put that in more strong terms.                               That is what the Chief Executive of BHP said yesterday. I will quote again from what he said yesterday:                              _ the tax environment for this particular project has not changed at all since we started working on it six or seven years ago.                              So it should be pretty clear to those opposite what BHP thinks about the environment. The fact is that they are investing an enormous amount of money in our country, an enormous amount of money.                                                                     Mr SWAN:                    I will conclude on this point: investment in the resources sector in this country has been growing strongly. Private sector investment in our economy during our period in office totals $919 billion, and investment as a percentage of GDP is at its highest level in 40 years - all of that in the environment where we have been implementing a resource rent tax and carbon pricing. That indicates enormous faith among the international business community in investing in this country because it is a great place to invest. We have an opposition who want to talk our economy down every day, tell untruths about the economy and junk the economy for their own base political purposes. But the Leader of the Opposition was shown up on 7:30 last night, where he indicated what an ignorant person he was, that he did not care about the facts and that he would say anything and do anything for political advantage.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Wakefield for his question. The carbon price has now been in operation for seven weeks, and the fact is that the economy continues to grow. Yet the opposition leader, who is surely the master of mendacity, continues to come in here with his campaign of deceit. Yesterday, he plumbed new depths. Without even reading - by his own admission - BHP Billiton's statement, he blamed the Olympic Dam decision on the carbon price. It is important to note that, in the 36-page BHP Billiton investor update, carbon is not even mentioned - it does not even rate a mention in a 36-page investor update. What breathtaking mendacity and deceit the Leader of the Opposition engages in! He does not read it; he just makes it up - he goes out to a press conference and makes it up.                              Here is a fact he will not like. The Leader of the Opposition claimed that 45,000 jobs would be lost in the mining industry when the carbon price came in. We are up 49,000 jobs in mining-related activities since the carbon price was announced. That is an uncomfortable fact. They come in here day after day making claims about the impact on electricity bills of carbon pricing. They falsely attribute all network costs to carbon pricing. They never complain about the 50 per cent increase in electricity bills from state government network investments. They only use off-peak rates so that they can inflate the percentage increase. They assert that no costs are ever passed through to consumers - totally false. They hide the fact that electricity bills only account for about two per cent of turnover for most businesses, and that means that the carbon cost increase for most businesses is only about 0.2 per cent of turnover. For a typical small business, that is about $5 a week increase in costs.                              The master of mendacity over there has gone from the people's revolt to the python squeeze to the cobra strike to the wrecking ball. What is next? I will tell you what is next - the deceit will go up and up, and it is going to clean out your credibility big-time.              </DOC>

  To the member for Solomon, who asked the question: No. 1, I have a lot of respect the intelligence of Territorians, and they know that they are voting in a Northern Territory election for who will be the Chief Minister and who will be the Territory government. Then I go to the assertions that are in the member's question. The problem for the member is that, because the Leader of the Opposition has been out there peddling dishonesty and deceit, she feels that she needs to be out there peddling dishonesty and deceit. Unfortunately for the member, recycling the Leader of the Opposition's claims just gets you in the same problem as the Leader of the Opposition, which is that at some point you collide with the facts and it becomes clear that what you have been saying is not true and not truthful.                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    The problem for the member in following the Leader of the Opposition's campaign of deceit is that sooner or later you run straight into the facts. The Leader of the Opposition's was out there yesterday preaching doom and gloom and telling everybody that the economy was broken. He was out there making representations about Olympic Dam. He had not even bothered to read a statement which explained what was happening in Olympic Dam. But the member who asked the question about the Northern Territory knows that all of this from the Leader of the Opposition is wrong because she knows that in her electorate she is seeing the $34 billion INPEX project.                              So how has she felt as the Leader of the Opposition has been going around the country saying, 'That's it; the economy's history; there'll never be a new investment; no more coal; no more resources; no more anything'? How has she felt, given that peddling of deceit, when she has gone back home to Darwin, which is getting itself ready for this $34 billion?                              To the member who asked the question: the way she should feel is embarrassed. To the Leader of the Opposition: the problem he has is that every overblown, ridiculous claim he has ever made is now coming back to haunt him, and not one of them will stand up to scrutiny because not one of them is true. It is of no surprise that not one of them is true, because the Leader of the Opposition well knows that, when he sat around a cabinet table and decided that he wanted to be party to putting a price on carbon, he would have been informed of the real impacts of a price on carbon. He has always supported putting a price on carbon. He knows that these claims are false, and his fear campaign is running out of steam every day. He is continuing to conduct himself like a mouse on a treadmill, round and round and round, but it does not get any more true or any more credible just because he keeps saying it.               </DOC>

  I thank the member for Makin for his question as a proud South Australian. Of course the mining industry and Australian industry more broadly would be assured that they have a political party that does not want to, nor does it have plans to, increase the company tax rate. Indeed, the Australian Labor Party, the government, has a plan to reduce the company tax rate, thwarted by the Leader of the Opposition and the coalition, the so-called 'party of low taxes'. But there is a proposal to increase the company tax rate, and that proposal comes from none other than the Leader of the Opposition and the coalition. The purpose of this 1½ percentage point increase in the company tax rate is to pay for the extra paid parental leave scheme that the coalition took to the last election. Indeed, everyone knows about that.                              Everyone knows about the 1½ percentage point increase in the company tax rate, except that the Leader of the Opposition came to the dispatch box yesterday afternoon seeking a personal explanation, saying that he was misrepresented by the Treasurer and that there is no policy to increase the company tax rate by 1½ per cent. Well, why is it in the documentation? Why did the Leader of the Opposition, when asked by Greg Cary, 'It's still a tax, though, isn't it?' say, 'Well, it's a levy'? It is a levy; it is not a company tax rate increase - it is a levy. Greg Cary said, 'That's a tax.' The Leader of the Opposition said:                              I accept that it is going to raise the costs for those businesses with taxable incomes in excess of $5 million a year _                              That sounds like a tax to me, yet the coalition come in and say: 'We never said it. We weren't here. It wasn't us. We've been blamed. It's the Treasurer's fault.'                              We heard yesterday one of the most sensational, phenomenal performances that we have ever seen, ever witnessed, when the Leader of the Opposition came in to the 7.30 report and he blamed the carbon price and the minerals resource rent tax for the decision on Olympic Dam. He was asked by Leigh Sales:                              Have you actually read BHP's statements?                              And his answer was no. Across the table, he said, 'I never said that.' It was on national television. He said, 'No, no, I never said that I hadn't read it.' And then today he was asked to clarify and he said, 'Yes, I had.' So, between the 7.30 report last night and today, he has changed his story. Between 3.45 yesterday afternoon and 7.30, he read it, then he forgot he read it, then he said he had read it, then he said he had not read it. I will tell you what he has been reading. He has been reading soft porn books. He has enough time to read soft porn books -                                                                     Dr EMERSON:                    but not a two-page statement from BHP Billiton. This man is mendacious. He is deceitful. He is misleading. He is untruthful. He is a purveyor of untruths. He is economically -                                                                   The member for Mackellar then left the chamber.                              </DOC>

  As we can see, the opposition's campaign of fear and distortion continues. The member who asked the question apparently never asked herself: what was the impact for her constituents and businesses in her electorate as electricity prices went up 70 per cent because of factors associated with investment in the poles and the wires and the operation of the electricity system in New South Wales? She never asked herself the question as the current state Liberal government delivered its budget with big dividends from state electricity assets. She never asked herself the question: what does that mean for my constituents or businesses in my electorate? She never concerned herself about the huge rises in electricity - presumably because, at that point, she was following the Leader of the Opposition down a false and misleading path and pretending either these increases had not happened or they were the result of carbon pricing, even though they predated when carbon pricing started.                              Unlike the member who asked the question, I am concerned about those electricity price increases. Unlike the Leader of the Opposition, I do not deny that they exist. We are determined to act on them and we will be working, hopefully cooperatively, with state and territory colleagues including the New South Wales government to act on them.                                                                    Ms GILLARD:                    I thank the member for Sturt for proving my point that people know that there are other sources of electricity price increases apart from carbon pricing. I thank the member for Sturt for proving that point for me. He must have got the memo from the Leader of the Opposition that they have suddenly repositioned though they started this parliamentary fortnight saying such increases did not exist. Now they have been forced to acknowledge them because their state colleagues were talking about them and all of the experts were talking about them.                              For the cost-of-living pressures in the member's electorate including from electricity prices, when it comes to carbon we always said that households would see, on average, an increase of $3.30 per week and that is why, on average, we provided assistance of $10.10. When it comes to assisting the people in her electorate with cost-of-living pressures, we have increased their support for childcare because what was left to us by the former Howard government and the Leader of the Opposition was not good enough for Australian families. We put in place the Schoolkids Bonus to help with the costs of getting the kids to school. We have delivered tax cuts including now making sure you can earn $18,200 without paying a cent of tax. We have delivered a historic pension increase because we understand that older Australians can do it very tough. We will continue to work with Australians on their cost-of-living pressures. What we will see from opposition is more fear and more -                </DOC>

  I want to thank the member for Capricornia for the question and note her strong concerns about the protection of the Great Barrier Reef and for jobs in her electorate. This is an approval that should have been able to be dealt with by the federal government some months ago. Members may remember that at the time the Queensland government refused to finish their part of the job and left us with a situation where, having said that they would conduct the environmental assessment, ultimately, they did not.                              The federal government has now concluded by working directly with the company through the necessary environmental approvals and I have given them today. Those approvals have been welcomed by the company. I think it is important to note that as recently as today the Queensland Premier has claimed that there are a number of projects sitting on my desk that I am holding back. In fact, there are now none from Queensland awaiting environmental approval, notwithstanding the comments from the Queensland Premier today.                              It is important to note the standards that have been imposed by the Commonwealth are welcomed by the company. In a statement from GVK today it said:                              GVK chose to invest in Australia because of its low political risk coupled with strong environmental and safety standards which align with GVK's corporate philosophy and values.                              These additional environmental standards, which would not have been imposed if we had done what Campbell Newman wanted us to do, include management plans for the Caley Valley wetlands for water quality, taking into account the impact that run-off can have on the Great Barrier Reef and taking into account the impact that coal dust can have on the Great Barrier Reef.                               While the Premier of Queensland continues to say that the Commonwealth, and in particular I, should simply get out of the way on any coal projects that are coming forward, I will make clear my position and that of the federal government on this. If what the Premier of Queensland wants is for me to give approvals without conducting checks, then I will stand in his way. If he wants us to trash the Great Barrier Reef and to let him trash the Great Barrier Reef, we will stand in his way. If he wants to clear-fell every acre of koala habitat in South-East Queensland, we will stand in his way. It does not matter. We will continue to work with industry, we will continue to get good environmental outcomes and good employment outcomes for Queensland, but, no matter how many times he asks, if the Premier of Queensland wants to indulge in environmental corner-cutting, shambolic process and environmental vandalism, we will have none of it.              </DOC>

  I have been asked a question about some comments in the media What I have done to ensure that unions and employer organisations are complying with the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act is: I was proud to sponsor the strongest laws that have ever been passed in the history of the Commonwealth. Let me just remind the House. Those opposite need to be reminded because they voted against what I am about to say. Of course they do not want to say that they voted against it, but the record reflects that. What I have done to approve accountability of registered organisations is, first of all, in the legislation passed on 29 June this year, improved the Fair Work Australia investigation process. We have increased the civil penalties. We have required that registered organisations disclose remuneration and board fees paid to officials. We have required that officials disclose material personal interests. We have required that officials of registered organisations undertake training in financial management.                                                                    Mr SHORTEN:                    Those opposite are more predictable than the outcome of a race between Black Caviar and Mr Ed. All they ever want to do is attack trade unions. Those opposite are notorious union baiters. Why do they hate unions? Because they hate anyone who stands up for workers. They have never voted to improve the standard of registered organisations.                                                                    Mr SHORTEN:                    I have been asked about registered organisations and what I have done to make sure that good, strong organisations like the Australian Workers Union comply with registered organisations rules. What I have to hand - because my crystal ball did tell me that the opposition would do their usual union baiting - is a quote about registered organisations and what the government has been doing:                              The Government's changes to the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act are clearly warranted and industry is supportive of the reforms. Registered organisations play a very important role _ but recent events have highlighted deficiencies in the current laws.                              Memo to self: the 'current laws' were the Abbott laws. So we have increased the penalties. They say it is appropriate. What is really good is that the person who said it is not -                                                                     Mr SHORTEN:                    In my answer about registered organisations and what I have been doing, I refer not only to the legislation. It is only the people on this side, plus the crossbenchers, who did anything; those opposite cried crocodile tears about registered organisations but, when it came to actually voting for reforms, did they? No. They could not do that. But we know that they don't do their homework, don't we? I was quoting from Innes Willox. But we do not need much reminder about the homework they don't do. Who is going to forget National Lampoon's Vacation last night on 7.30? Not only don't they do their homework on registered organisations; the Leader of the Opposition could not even read BHP's statement.              </DOC>

  I thank the member for Robertson for her question and I thank her for the advocacy of the interests of her constituents in this place. She understands, in representing her electorate, which is home to so many families, the importance of having a strong economy so that people can make a life - so they have the benefit of a job, so they have the benefit of a pay packet and so they can get on with doing the hard work of raising their families and supporting their families. In order for people to have the benefit of jobs we need to keep the economy strong. And this government is always focused not only on the strength of today's economy but on what we need to do today so that the economy will be strong in the future.                               Much of this work requires action today, and it will show benefits over the longer term. But it must be done - investments in infrastructure, investments in national broadband, investments in a clean energy future. But the future of our country and the strength of our economy will be defined, more than anything else, by the skills and capacities and strengths of the Australian people. What that means is that there is nothing more important to the future of our nation than what is happening in education. There is nothing more important to the strength of our future economy than what is happening in classrooms in schools around the country today. That is why, in a parliamentary fortnight where the government has dealt with a range of issues, including commencing to implement the work of the Angus Houston review into asylum seekers, we have also been squarely addressing the most important issue for our nation's future, and that is what is happening in schools today.                              We are determined to keep improving schools to give our kids the chance that they deserve. We are determined to keep improving teacher quality, to keep improving each and every school around the country for each and every child. And in this area, where there is nothing more important to our nation's future, we leave this parliament with the battlelines drawn. We go out of this parliament knowing we are determined to make a difference for every child in every school - to give them the ability to have a great education and to shape their prosperous futures.                               The opposition leaves this parliament with the Leader of the Opposition pursuing a hit list to rip money out of public schools around the country. The opposition leaves this parliament with the opposition determined to say that there is not one school in the country, in any school system, that deserves an extra dollar. The opposition leaves this parliament wanting to rip one in seven teachers out of our schooling system and to see larger class sizes. The battle lines are drawn on education and our nation's future, and we will be fighting for it.               </DOC>

  I do thank the opposition leader for his question but I am not sure that the member for Wentworth will thank him for it. The member for Wentworth had the temerity to point out last week the entire negative approach of this opposition - not just talking down the economy but being out there attacking, attacking, attacking, with the Leader of the Opposition making negative points every time he stands up.                     He knows very well, Madam Deputy Speaker, that it was the actions of the coalition in this House that delayed our getting offshore processing going more quickly. They came into the House with their negative approach and they delayed the positive proposals that we put on the table to process in Nauru and to process in Malaysia at the same time. The consequence of that has been all of the tragedy that we have seen during that delay. The government has responded comprehensively to the Houston report and has put in place all the approaches that it recommended. It is simply, once again, deliberately deceptive of this Leader of the Opposition to pretend that somehow that report may have actually recommended temporary protection visas. It is yet another example of him being deceptive and not necessarily telling the full story about events that have occurred in the past. There was no support whatsoever in the Houston report for temporary protection visas.                  We have got the processing up and running as quickly as we possibly could, and we have done that since we got the legislation passed through the parliament. We have seen further evidence of that today with the statement made by the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship. We are proceeding as quickly as we possibly can because we do want to save lives. Putting this process in place in the comprehensive way that we are will save lives. What we have to do is stop the boats with a fair dinkum policy - the fair dinkum policy that was recommended by the Houston inquiry and that we are putting in place right across the board. This includes an increase in the overall intake to ensure that people have no incentive to jump on boats and risk their lives coming to Australia; it makes sure they can get in by coming through our offshore processes. That is what we are doing. This is a fair dinkum approach to a big public policy problem, but what we see from those opposite is the continued negative approach of the Leader of the Opposition.

  I thank the member for Corangamite for that question. Last week we saw more evidence of the world-beating performance of the Australian economy. I think it is something all Australians can be proud of. The latest national accounts show that our economy grew by a solid 0.6 per cent in the June quarter and a robust 3.7 per cent for the year. We continue to grow faster than any other major advanced economy. The accounts also show that growth was broadly balanced during the quarter. We saw broad based growth with positive contributions from consumption, investment, net exports and public demand. It is pretty rare to get that sort of healthy combination. All of this has been achieved against the backdrop of volatility in global financial markets and recession across Europe. So it was a pretty good result considering what was going on around the world during the June quarter.                  More than that, this data also confirmed 21 consecutive years of economic growth. That is a remarkable achievement, unequalled anywhere else in the developed world. It is something every member of this House should be proud of. It stands in stark contrast to the aggressive negativity of those opposite - the aggressive negativity of the Leader of the Opposition, the shadow Treasurer and the shadow finance spokesman.                  All of this does not mean that we do not still face economic challenges. We have global uncertainty, we have the impact of a higher dollar, we have lower commodity prices and we have other structural challenges. But we still have strong economic fundamentals - a combination of solid growth, low unemployment, contained inflation, healthy consumption and a record investment pipeline - so much so that our economy is now 11 per cent bigger than it was prior to the global financial crisis. Something like 800,000 jobs have been created in Australia since the onset of that crisis, which contrasts starkly with what has gone on elsewhere in the developed world.                 We have a clear plan to keep our economy strong and to provide opportunities for all Australians. In particular, we have made a commitment to invest in our education system, to make sure that we provide the resources for the quality education which is absolutely essential for ensuring we continue to grow strongly and continue to have job creation and the rising incomes we all aspire to. We have made a commitment to reform our education system so that every kid, regardless of their background, has the opportunity to become Prime Minister. So there is a clear choice: positive plans for the future or the negative approach of the Leader of the Opposition.

  This government is absolutely committed to putting in place a responsible fiscal policy. In doing that, we will bring our budget back to surplus on time and as promised. Over four budgets we have put in place $100 billion in savings to fund our priorities, including, in our last budget, $33 billion worth of savings - and we will continue to do that. We have done that in the face of massive revenue write-downs caused by the problems in the global economy. We have done all that and we will do it again - because we understand the importance of good fiscal policy. We do that in very stark contrast to those who sit opposite.                  We had a revelation the other day from the shadow Treasurer. On 21 August, he said:                 We have found all our savings and we have got our policies, we are ready to roll if an election is called tomorrow.                 From this government you will see the midyear budget update, due by the end of the year, and you will see our budget next year. But we do not have any commitment from those opposite to transparency or to the Charter of Budget Honesty.                  I say this to the shadow Treasurer: if you have your policies ready to roll, you can take a walk around to the Parliamentary Budget Office - it is not even as far as Aussies. I reckon he can get around there pretty quick and he can give them all of these costed policies he told us about on 21 August. Then we will see the $70 billion crater in their budget bottom line. Then the truth will be out there for all to see: the hidden agenda of the Liberal Party, the one unfolding in Queensland - the hidden agenda to slash health and education.                     If they are going to fill their $70 billion crater, that is what they will be doing. So take a walk. It is only a hundred metres or so. Go and give your policies to the Parliamentary Budget Office.                     Yes.

  I thank the member for Greenway for her question and for her ongoing interest in innovation, which was a very strong theme at the APEC meeting. By any standard, the APEC meeting in Vladivostok over the weekend was very successful indeed, and I wanted to use this opportunity to highlight two of the very important outcomes from that meeting. The first relates to a list of environmental goods on which the APEC members agreed tariffs would be limited to no more than five per cent. The purpose of this is to promote the flow of products that are used to preserve, protect and clean up our environment, with a very strong emphasis on climate change to ensure that we have effective policies for dealing with the challenge of climate change. This is an initiative that was initiated at Big Sky, Montana, more than a year ago. The leaders asked trade ministers to take this forward. I am pleased to advise that Australia was able to play a role in brokering this deal. We ended up with 54 such items, including wind turbine blades, solar cells, solar hot water systems and equipment used in the generation of electricity from renewable energy sources. I was asked about the potential benefits of this for Australia. We had a look at the 54 items, and Australia already exports $1.2 billion worth of these items, which is a substantial sum. But, for the APEC community as a whole, the trade in those items is $432 billion, so this opens up tremendous opportunities for Australian producers of these environmental goods.                 The second area, which is also right up Australia's alley, is that of university education. Russia has initiated the idea of a work program to promote the movement of students and academics from university to university around the region and to establish campuses in each other's universities - an inspired choice by Russia. We were able to bring that work program to a position where all leaders endorsed it. There are 176,000 university students from the APEC community studying in Australia right now. Education is our third biggest export. It still substantially beats LNG. I think this is great news. Ten billion dollars of the $16 billion of our education exports comes from the APEC community. This is the education revolution here in Australia being implemented more broadly, and it is certainly consistent with the white paper Australia in the Asian century. It is a very good outcome for all.

  I am pleased to answer the question, because here we have, yet again, the opposition talking down our economy. The shadow Treasurer is referring to the June national accounts data, which is simply outstanding data compared to what is going on elsewhere in the world. It does not mean to say that there are not challenges in our economy; there are. We know that sectors suffer from a higher dollar. We know there are other structural forces impacting upon the manufacturing industry. We know that a cautious consumer is making life difficult in retail. But, having said all that, when you have an unemployment rate as low as ours, when you have growth in a quarter that is faster than just about any other developed economy, it does not help the economy if the opposition is constantly talking it down. In the United States -                      In the United States, talking down the economy is called 'throwing sand in the gears' of the economy. As the opposition talk it down, they also try to talk down confidence - that is what they are doing. The allegation has been made by the shadow Treasurer that there is a hole in our budget, taken from a front page headline of the Financial Reviewwhich was dead wrong - completely wrong, completely inaccurate. Of course, we know that your $70 billion crater is there because you told us on morning television. You were sitting beside the minister for the environment when you confirmed that you have a $70 billion crater in your budget bottom line. If you want to disprove the fact that you put it into the media yourself, talk a walk down to the Parliamentary Budget Office.                     The truth is this. On this side of the parliament we operate a responsible fiscal policy - absolutely. On that side of the parliament they have a hidden agenda because their shadow finance minister told us about it when he was at Hayman Island. He said, 'We won't put any detail out; we'll do what John Hewson did, we'll hide it until after the election.' That is the approach on that side of the House. They can solve the problem with their crater. They can walk around to the Parliamentary Budget Office.

  I thank the member for Kennedy for his question. He is the one member of this House who has been consistent in his opposition to marine parks. I hear the scoffing opposite. The point the member for Kennedy makes is true when he says that the zoning done under the Howard government had a much bigger economic impact on communities than what is proposed by the Commonwealth now. That is exactly true.                 He also refers to a protest held outside here today. If you had a look at the placards at that protest today, one of them said, 'Don't lock us out of Hervey Bay' - in fact, two of them referred to Hervey Bay. When the areas for further assessment first went out some years ago, there was a proposed area off Hervey Bay which went out some distance. If you go to the final maps that have been released by the government, you will see that you can go out as far as you want east from Hervey Bay and there are no restrictions at all - no proposed marine park, nothing. This goes to the fear campaigns that have been run opposite and in a similar way with the Coral Sea. Those opposite are still circulating maps that have the entire Coral Sea locked up. That is simply not true. That is not the government's proposal.                 We then have the claim that there is no science on which these are based. Yet we have volume after volume of scientific bioregional planning - some of which have photographs of the member for Wentworth in them - the scientific basis for this work. I respect the fact that the member for Kennedy has a different view on this issue. You cannot pretend that there is no impact on communities. It is true that there is some, but it has been grossly exaggerated. The reference to Hervey Bay is completely wrong. There has been talk in recent days of a $1 billion impact on Cairns. That sort of impact would only be possible if you counted the impact over more than 150 years.                 Ultimately we on this side of the House, each and every time, are supportive of the concept of national parks; whereas those opposite, now with a private members' bill, want to abolish them in the ocean, to turn the ones in Victoria into farms and to turn the ones in New South Wales into rifle ranges. There is also a report of logging proposed in national parks in Queensland. On this side of the House, the support for national parks on land and in the ocean is a simple, straightforward environmental step forward which we are happy to back.

  I thank the member for Deakin for that question. In his electorate he has some 40 schools that have benefited from the investments that this government has made in libraries, multipurpose halls, classrooms and buildings and from the approximately 4,500 computers installed under our plan to make sure that classrooms are well-equipped for the digital age.                 It is the case that the government believes that every child should have the opportunity which quality education provides. That is why the Prime Minister announced the National Plan for School Improvement: doing the things that we know make a difference in the classroom and lifting education results for students with the goal of being in the world's top five education systems by 2025. We know what it takes to get there. On teacher quality: we have already secured national standards for teachers and invested half a billion dollars in the teacher quality national partnership, and we want to take that work further with higher entry requirements for teaching and better practical experience prior to graduation. On school improvement: we have given more power to principals and invested in literacy and numeracy resources, and we want to take that further with school improvement plans for every school and clear guidance to principals on how they can lift results as well. On transparency: we established MySchool to provide an accurate picture to parents and communities of their school, and we want to take that work further as well with more information about school achievement on MySchool and clear reporting on how our schools are tracking towards our top-five goal. On funding: our investment in Australian schools in this funding period doubled investment by the Howard government. We have paid particular attention to serving disadvantaged communities, including those with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students, and we need to go further now to ensure that every single school is properly funded to develop the potential of every single child.                 So that is Labor's plan when it comes to schools. We are working with our state and territory and non-government organisation colleagues and will introduce legislation into the House this year. Without seeing the legislation, the opposition pledged to repeal it - 'we will dismantle it', said the member for Sturt - and they have promised not to pursue a national plan for school improvement either. What they have promised to do is leave in place a system that was described by the Gonski review panel as illogical, inconsistent and unconnected to our educational goals. The opposition are ignoring the evidence that Australia has a significant issue on equity with schools, and they are not prepared to do anything about it. In fact, all they have on the slate is $2.8 billion worth of cuts to teacher quality across the education landscape. We stand for supporting schools and the best interests of kids in every school in Australia.

  Exhibit A: this is the negative approach of the opposition. If he wanted to accurately characterise that report, he would be standing up and saying that Australia is in a very competitive position. But no, what we get is this negative exaggeration all the time -                      and they are always changing their story. Whether it is support for the carbon tax or opposition to the carbon tax, they are always out there changing their story.                 I thought that what I would do today would be to quote an authoritative source on the economy and how competitive we are. Who said: 'When the Prime Minister and the Treasurer say that the economy is doing better than most, they are right. I agree with them'? John Howard said that. So John Howard does not share that particular view. He went on to say:                 There's no doubt that the Australian economy is doing better than most.                 Our unemployment is remarkably low; our debt-to-GDP is converged very favourably; and by all the measurements, our inflation is low.                 That is the former Prime Minister of Australia and his characterisation of our economy.                     I was just making the point about the strength of our economic fundamentals and the importance of our economic fundamentals to the peace of mind of all Australians. Nothing is more important to peace of mind than the capacity to get a job, and 800,000 jobs have been created in this country under this government - and, every step of the way, those opposite have talked down our economy. When we moved to stimulate our economy and to save jobs, they voted against it, and almost sank it, in the Senate. What would Australia be like today if they had succeeded in doing that? It is because we put in place a responsible response to the global financial crisis and the global recession, and because we put in place a responsible fiscal policy to bring the budget back to surplus, that we have strong economic fundamentals. And day in, day out, through their negative approach to everything, those opposite come in here and trash our economic fundamentals; they stick their head in the sand and will never acknowledge them. That shows that they are unfit for high office. The Leader of the Opposition does not have the temperament and does not have the experience for high office.

  I thank the member for Chifley for his question and for his ongoing interest in the National Broadband Network and in ensuring that Australia's telecommunications are the best they can be. Those opposite want to keep us in the last century's technology; the old copper network is where they want to be. They have opposed the National Broadband Network even though it will be so important, particularly for regional Australia - not because of what can be downloaded but because of what can be uploaded, and because of the impact it can have on education and the impact it can have on health. Already we are seeing that over 14½ thousand services have been activated nationally through the interim satellite service. The average take-up rate of NBN services being rolled out in places like Willunga and Minnamurra is 40 per cent higher and progressively increasing. The National Broadband Network is absolutely vital if we are going to compete in our region.                 And it is important that I get questions on the National Broadband Network from this side of the House, because we know that there have been no questions on the National Broadband Network from the shadow minister since 2010. For two years he sat there, by himself - sitting there patiently day after day after day. But we know he is demonstrating his support for the National Broadband Network in other ways. He is putting his money into the new fibre-to-the-home technology. I got a question a couple of weeks ago about the investment the member for Wentworth is making in French Telecom. He has also bought bonds in Telefonica, Spain's largest telecommunications company - and guess what it is doing? Fibre to the home - in Barcelona and in Madrid.                     I am indicating the demonstrated support for fibre-to-the-home technology, and I say to the member for Wentworth that he should put his mouth where his money is, put it into support for the National Broadband Network. If it is good enough in France and it is good enough in Spain, it is good enough right here in Australia as well.

  I thank the Leader of the Opposition for that question. I am certain that the member for Wentworth does not thank him. I will deal with the question in detail. First of all, these are matters which are decided for operational reasons at sea. Secondly, those opposite want to have it both ways. On the one hand they say they believe in the refugee convention, and on the other they oppose it and put forward courses of action directly in conflict with it. So what we see here, yet again, is the aggressive negativity of the Leader of the Opposition, who wants to play politics with people's lives. He wants to go the biff on this issue, day after day after day. I know there are members of the front bench over there who cannot stomach this approach - it is playing with people's lives. It is a bit rich for the opposition to go down this road when they held up the consideration of establishing -                      This government will never - I repeat, never - seek to direct the Navy when it comes to operations at sea. There is a stark contrast between our approach and the approach of those over there. It has been nine months since we offered the opposition a compromise that would have seen the Malaysia policy and processing put in place along with Nauru. In that nine months people have drowned at sea. The fact is that the minute we could get a bill through this parliament to set up offshore processing, we did so. We have been opposed by those here day in and day out - all they want to do is play politics with the lives of people getting on boats. That is what this question is all about. It is a continuation of the aggression of this Leader of the Opposition, who wants to go the biff all of the time. He does not want to have a substantive discussion about policy. We will get on with implementing the Houston report.

  I thank the member for Blair for that question. Our economy still walks tall in the world and we are continuing to grow faster than every single major advanced economy. This is a remarkable achievement given the backdrop of what is occurring with growth in Europe and the global economy generally - and particularly given the turbulence in the June quarter.                 We have secured 21 consecutive years of economic growth in this country. We do not seek that as an end in itself. The reason growth is important is that it supports jobs - 800,000 additional jobs during our time in government. Growth can bring peace of mind for all of our citizens. It gives us the capacity not only to have more jobs and better jobs but to provide the services we want to provide to all of our people, most particularly when it comes to education and health. It means better incomes for working families and more opportunities for our kids, particularly in education and health care.                 These are services which Australians ought to be able to rely on - good health care for their kids when they are unwell and first-class education services to enable their kids to get the best possible start in life. That is why I am so horrified to see the huge cuts currently being made in Queensland to these basic health and education services. These services are being ripped away in my home state by Campbell Newman and the LNP - and all along the way Mr Newman is being cheered on by the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Treasurer. Mr Newman said this about the shadow Treasurer and the Leader of the Opposition:                 I talk regularly to Mr Abbott _ He is very understanding, he and people like Joe Hockey have been incredibly supportive.                 Then, last Friday morning, the shadow Treasurer, in talking about the cuts being made by Mr Newman - including almost 3,000 jobs in health - said:                 Campbell Newman, all strength to his right arm, he's showing incredible courage _                 What is courageous about sacking nurses? What is courageous about cutting education? What is courageous about cutting doctors?                 What we are seeing here is a clear warning. We are getting a sneak preview of what an Abbott government would do to health and education nationally. Today we have had news from New South Wales of some of the biggest cuts in education in 20 years - all supported by the Leader of the Opposition. We know he was consulted by the New South Wales government about these cuts. Huge education cuts in New South Wales and the loss of 15,000 jobs in Queensland - this is what Liberals do. They take the axe to health and education. That is what they do.

  I thank the member for Blair for that question. We are hearing some very disturbing reports about cuts to education in New South Wales. We are hearing that these are the biggest cuts in 20 years. As I said before, similar cuts are also taking place in Queensland. It is in the DNA of the Liberal Party to take the axe to education - and that is precisely what is happening in the state of Queensland and in the state of New South Wales.                 We also know that the Leader of the Opposition was briefed about these cuts in New South Wales last week and that the Queensland Premier said that he has fully briefed the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Treasurer about his program in Queensland - and he says that they are incredibly supportive. There is a very stark contrast between the commitment of this government to providing economic growth as well as the basic services that families depend upon for their peace of mind and, on the other side of the House, the Liberal and National Parties, who are taking the axe to the social safety net.                 Some have called Campbell Newman a bully, but what we know about the Leader of the Opposition is that he is a thug. What we are seeing here is that -                      I withdraw.                     The only thing worse than a Liberal cutting jobs is three Liberals cutting jobs. That is what those opposite stand for.

  This is a breathtaking question from the shadow Treasurer because, first of all, he and the Liberals actually stand for a company tax increase. That is the Coles and Woolies grocery tax they still have on their agenda. Second, when we wanted to cut company tax, who opposed that? The Liberals! This great party of Menzies, supposedly the party of free enterprise, came into this House and opposed a company tax cut. Not only did they do that, but they came into the House and opposed the instant asset write-off, which represents tax relief for up to 2.7 million small businesses around Australia.                 The shadow Treasurer then has the hide to say, 'Why didn't you proceed with the company tax cut?' Because you opposed it - that is why we did not proceed with the company tax cut. And you are on the record as opposing it. I do not know what parallel universe you live in, but the fact is you opposed the company tax cut. When it comes to taxes more generally, you also have a lot of hide to come into this House and talk about taxation when you were a member of the highest taxing government in Australian history. In fact, if the tax-to-GDP ratio we inherited was there today, there would be a surplus in Australia of $25 billion. So you were the highest taxing government in our history.                 What we are doing is the responsible thing - putting in place a range of policies to keep our economy growing, to make sure we distribute the benefits of growth, to invest in the future and, most particularly, to invest in the education of our kids. For everyone on this side of the House, one of the fundamental reasons we got into politics is that we understand that investment in people, particularly in early childhood education, primary education, secondary education and tertiary education, is the foundation not only of our social progress but of our economic prosperity. That goes to the very core of the values of everybody who sits on this side of the House, but it does not go to the core of the values of everybody sitting opposite. That is why there is now such a fundamental difference between what you did and what we are going to put in place in this country for the future - spreading prosperity and opportunity to make sure that everybody, wherever they are born, wherever they come from, gets the best possible education and start in life.

  This government is very proud of its record in protecting our oceans. This government is very proud that we take a cautious approach to the management of our oceans. I want to acknowledge the member for Fremantle as one of the many members of the back bench - as well as members of the front bench - who have taken an active interest in making sure that any fishing activity is sustainable and that the scientific basis of any fishing activity is completely up to date.                 One of the concerns that have arisen with the development of the super trawler previously called the Margiris, now renamed the Abel Tasman, is that, unlike other vessels, it is able to remain in the one location for an extended period of time, which throws up some significant environmental issues that have not been contemplated previously within fisheries management. We must make sure that we properly maintain the protection of the ocean that we need, for the fish stocks themselves but also for the significant issue of bycatch, whether it be dolphins, seals, sea lions or seabirds.                 Making sure that the correct protections are put in place was the reason that, some weeks ago, I asked my department for advice on the limits of my legal powers at the moment to be able to take a highly precautionary approach to this issue. That advice came back last Monday - and members would be aware that I put some extra conditions in place - but the legal powers fell well short of where I had hoped they would be. But, when the law falls short, you change the law. That is why I announced that we will be changing the law and moving legislation in this parliament today to be able to provide extended powers over this particular vessel.                 There has been a huge outcry about the public interest in all this. People can see the dangers if something goes wrong, whether it be people with environmental concerns or the huge recreational fishing community that has been concerned about making sure that its fish stocks remain in place.                     I hear people opposite calling out 'risk', but you will never hear them call out 'environmental risk'! You will never hear them care for a moment about that. And I do not know what their problem is with the oceans. Why is it that when we try to protect the oceans, as in this case, they are against it; when we put in national parks, they are against it; when we fight with Campbell Newman over protecting the Great Barrier Reef, they are against it? You need to have a cautious approach. You need to adopt a precautionary principle in dealing with the oceans; otherwise, we will end up with decisions that are not science based. We are not willing to rush into decisions when the underpinning information is not yet before us. In this way, there will be a pause on different operations legally available while the expert work is done.

  This is an opposition which is constantly at war with the facts, which is why we constantly get all these aggressive questions with all of the exaggeration. We constantly get this from them because there is no real alternative policy framework on the other side of politics. Of course, they are always changing their story about this. Why is it that every living Liberal leader, except the current Leader of the Opposition, has supported a market price on carbon?                     There is an inconsistency in the approach of the opposition when it comes to emissions trading, which they supported for many years. There is a very interesting revelation today in the Australian Financial Review from Christopher Joye. He said:                 In November 2009 , Nick Minchin and Tony Abbott privately offered Hockey the party leadership on the proviso he dropped his advocacy of an emissions trading scheme. Hockey said no.                 He was committed to emissions trading. After that, he took that straw poll on twitter and then suddenly found out that maybe he ought to flip-flop on this critical question of an emissions trading scheme.                     I was asked about implementation of a clean energy package and about the emissions trading scheme. I was asked about expenditure in our relevant authorities.                     The government thinks it is very important to put in place a market price on carbon, to get a reduction in carbon pollution at the least possible cost to our economy. We are committed to that and there are many over there who used to be committed to that but of course now they have changed their story. It is not infrequent for the Leader of the Opposition to change his story. He is doing it all the time and I am sure he could change it back, because we know that in their heart of hearts they are committed to market principles and they want to keep a price on carbon.

  I thank the member for Denison for his question. I am aware of the bill to provide for same-sex marriage and it will shortly I think be considered by the Tasmanian Legislative Council. This is a matter which is properly considered by the Tasmanian parliament and it would be inappropriate for the government to offer a running commentary on the progress of the bill. As to the general issue, the member would be aware that the ALP member for Throsby has a bill before this House to provide for same-sex marriage under federal law. When this bill comes before the House, ALP members will be free to vote on it according to their conscience. It is not the case on the other side of the parliament and I think that is regrettable.                     The Labor Party recognises that this is an issue on which members of our caucus have deeply held personal beliefs and it is therefore appropriate for our members to vote on same sex marriage according to their conscience.

  I thank the member for Parramatta for her question. For students to reach their full capacity and for the nation to have sustainable prosperity, investing in education is absolutely crucial. I think I heard President Obama say that education is a gateway to the future for students and for the nation. It certainly is that, and that is why we have announced a national plan for school improvement. But improving schools requires funding - funding to train the teachers, funding to buy the books and materials and funding to employ specialists to give extra time to students who need it - and that is why this government is spending almost double what was spent by the Howard government previously. This is investment that is making a difference, particularly to students who are struggling at school.                 Critically, under our school improvement plan, every school's funding will continue to rise. There will be no cuts; no schools will have their funding frozen. This is important because, at this point in time, wherever we look across the state landscape, all we see are cuts - whether it is cuts to TAFE or cuts to education - and, when we look across the chamber to the comrades of the coalition governments in power in the states on the opposition benches, all we see here is cuts as well. The fact is that the coalition have promised to cut $2.8 billion - cuts that would affect education in Australia across both the government and the non-government school sectors. We are very concerned about the impact of cuts to education that are proposed by the Leader of the Opposition. Even though we did see some crocodile tears cast in the shadow party room today about what is in our DNA and what is not in our DNA, the fact is that, when the shadow Treasurer applauds the Queensland Premier for his 'incredible courage' and when the opposition leader clearly knows and converses with the Premier in New South Wales about his plans for the state, we understand clearly that cuts lie at the heart of the agenda of the opposition on education.                 Making $2.8 billion in cuts to education will affect students right around Australia at a time when what we really want is a national improvement plan for schooling. I have to say that, as I see those cuts in place, I want to make it perfectly clear -                      The cuts that you have on the record at this very moment. I want to make it perfectly clear: we have invested and will continue to invest over time to make our schools amongst the best in the world, but we will not invest where state governments take out that investment in the expectation that we will make up the difference. We are on the record as having a national plan for school improvement, which means supporting schools; all they want to do is cut.

  I thank the shadow finance minister for his question. I think I answered this question yesterday, and I have answered it already today. The fact is that we are determined to bring our budget back to surplus. We have put in place over five budgets very substantial savings to make room for our priorities, and I have made it very clear today that we will keep the tax-to-GDP ratio at or below the level we inherited.                 Those opposite, when they were in government, were the highest taxing government in our history, and as is consistent -                      I do not accept the very premise of the question. The only hole around here is the $70 billion hole in their budget bottom line, which the shadow Treasurer admitted to on breakfast television, right beside the minister for the environment. He was sitting there and saying there was a $70 billion crater in the budget bottom line. As I said yesterday, if he is so concerned about financing, he can duck around to the Parliamentary Budget Office - it is not as far as Aussies; he could get there pretty quickly - and get all of his costings in. He has also told us that he has got them all done. He said that a few weeks ago. Every single one of their costings is done.                  The fact is that we will produce a mid-year budget update and a budget next year. The big question is: are they going to do a Campbell Newman and keep their plan hidden prior to the election? The only way to be sure that that is not going to happen is for them to submit their fully costed policies, they claim, to the Parliamentary Budget Office. Of course, they are not doing that.                     I was asked a question about so-called holes in budgets. I have also said that, in going through and having all of our deliberations about what we will put in various mid-year statements and budgets, we will do that in the normal way.

  I thank the member for Moreton for that really important question. We know that the cuts that we are seeing in the Queensland health budget are just the curtain raiser on the cuts that this Leader of the Opposition would preside over here in Canberra. They have made deep cuts in Queensland, deep cuts to staffing numbers - 2,700. We know that you cannot cut 2,700 people out of a health system and not affect front-line services.                     We have a list here of the reports of the cuts - nurses, pathology, cancer screening, allied health, physios, occupational therapy, prevention services, flu vaccine, whooping cough vaccine. The list is a long one. This is just a precursor to the 20,000 public servants they say they are going to cut. You cannot cut 20,000 public servants from areas like health and have no effect on service delivery.                 Who are the people who are employed in health? They are the aged-care nurses who check that the nursing homes are safe for our older Australians. They are the people who work at the TGA, who make sure that medicines and medical devices are safe for Australians to use. They are the people who make sure we have enough flu vaccine around the country and that it can get to where the outbreaks are if there is an outbreak. We have seen this list of cuts in Queensland day after day and we have seen the effect the cuts will have on front-line services.                 The member for Moreton asked this question. The reports in his electorate are for cuts to counsellors at the local morgue - the people who are there counselling the relatives who turn up to identify bodies, in what must be one of the most traumatic experiences for any human being. There are reports that their jobs are under threat. I say today: let's put a human face on Campbell Newman's cuts. These are the people behind the cuts to front-line services. The woman shown in this article is Elizabeth Handley, a single mother, who says she is going to lose her home because she has lost her job - a front-line job that she has had for 27 years.                 The member for Canning was interjecting, saying, 'There's plenty of fat to cut in health.' While I do not want to see a single extra public servant employed, I will tell you that these people who are checking our medicines and making sure we have vaccines and making sure that drug-resistant tuberculosis does not come into Queensland are the people who will lose their jobs under this Leader of the Opposition.

  I thank the member for Petrie very much for that question and for all the work she does for very vulnerable people in her electorate of Petrie. Of course, this government gets on with helping people who are vulnerable in Queensland every single day.                 Pensioners in Queensland now receive $4,000 more a year than they got under the previous, Liberal government - $4,000 extra a year because of this government's efforts to give that extra support. We have doubled support in Queensland for disability care and support, and of course we are helping families with low incomes by boosting family payments and introducing the new Schoolkids Bonus. All of these measures are aimed at helping vulnerable Queenslanders.                 We do that because we know it is the right thing for governments to do - to stand up for those people in our society who are the most vulnerable. What do we see from those opposite and from those in the Queensland government? What we see from the Queensland government - and I am sure we will see more of it today in their budget - is massive budget cuts that are going to hurt the most vulnerable in Queensland. All of them are happening under the watchful eye of the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Treasurer who has been pinged by Campbell Newman. He has said he is incredibly supportive of what Campbell Newman has been doing up there. What is important is that we have to help those who are vulnerable.                 The Acting Prime Minister and I were together with People with Disability on Sunday in Brisbane, and they are the ones who are most worried about this Leader of the Opposition and this shadow Treasurer. They are frightened about what these people are going to do, because of what they are experiencing from Campbell Newman. We know Campbell Newman's hitlist already includes domestic violence services, tenants advice services and the child protection watchdog. All of these organisations have already been slashed by Campbell Newman, and it is exactly what the people of Queensland could expect to get from this Leader of the Opposition.

  Here we go with more of the exaggerations, more of the inaccurate statements - everything the member for Wentworth was talking about - and these inaccurate characterisations of the impact of a carbon price. The Commonwealth Treasury and the Department of Health and Ageing estimate that the impact of the carbon price will be 0.3 per cent on hospital costs. This is the equivalent of only one cent for every $3 spent on hospitals. In addition to that, there is indexation of hospital funding to the states that is very generous. The problem here at the moment is that the state governments are withdrawing money from public hospitals. I have seen it at Prince Charles Hospital in my electorate.                     They knocked off 30 beds the other day and there is more to come. We have just had Campbell Newman announce job cuts of 14,000.                     Unlike those on that side of the House, I have a deep commitment to our hospitals and understand the importance of them. If you are going to sack 3,000 Queensland health employees - as the health minister said before - that has a very substantial impact on frontline services. There are some twisted priorities over there. They are supporting the cuts of 3,000 from Queensland public hospitals and they are making up all these other figures. They ought to get their priorities right and they ought to be out there opposing what Campbell Newman is doing.

  Today I have already referred to the exaggeration and misrepresentation that we have seen from those opposite, including the member for Boothby. He came into this House a week or so ago and made a whole set of representations and claims about the Belair Hotel and every one of them was simply wrong - wrong, wrong, wrong. We ought to look at the real facts. I am happy to look at what he has to say. This comes from the member for Boothby, who had this to say on 19 October 2009:                 I think that an emissions trading scheme is an important contribution_ It is one in a suite of responses.                 So here we have another one of them. He has been out there supporting an emissions trading scheme and now coming in here and running a scare campaign.                     He was asking me about the impact of a carbon price, and I think I am entitled to point out that he has been a supporter of a carbon price. Now he is opposing a carbon price and exaggerating a whole set of impacts. But the truth is we know that if they were in government they would keep it.

  I thank the member for his question. The Labor Party is the political party for working Australians. We stand for jobs. We stand for good jobs, we stand for skilled jobs and we stand for fair jobs. Our record shows that we are a government that backs in good jobs. There have been 800,000 jobs created since Labor was elected to office. Unemployment even in these difficult global economic times is 5.1 per cent and our participation rates are still sixth in the world. But our record goes further than that. Our record shows that we are the only party that backs in skills. We are spending $15.6 billion over the next four years to help our young, with 375,000 extra places and 130,000 trainees and apprenticeships. We are the party of skilled jobs.                 Our record shows that, not only do we stand for jobs and skilled jobs, we stand for fair jobs. Since the Fair Work Act came in there have been 22,000 enterprise agreements ratified - that is 2.62 million people who are covered by agreements which have been negotiated between employer and employee under Labor's legislation. In the last quarter wages have moved sensibly and reasonably by 3.7 per cent.                 We see, also courtesy of Labor, that Australian workers can be free of anxiety from take-it-or-leave-it contracts of the past under the conservatives, free from the ability of employers to change rosters without any warning and free from unfair dismissal. We also know that you cannot have a good job in this country if you have the low road of insecure employment. When I look at the low road of insecure employment, obviously I see the 200,000 public servants in Queensland who face decimation - 20,000 of their number. What did they ever do to be lied to by the coalition at the state level? I see 45,000 teachers in Victoria who had a lie told to them before the last election. When Premier Baillieu said to them: 'You'll be the best paid teachers in Australia,' they should have seen the footnote: 'Actually, only one in 10 of you will be.' What did the Victorian nurses ever do to upset the Victorian conservatives, such that they had to spend months and months negotiating a fair pay rise? What on earth did injured workers in New South Wales ever do to deserve Barry O'Farrell?                 There are some in our business community who say Australia cannot compete. I refer you to Gina Rinehart's interview in the press. She said: 'How do we compete if Americans utilise illegal labour from Mexico? They say in Africa that Africans want to work and they are willing to work for less than $2 a day.' Let me make very clear on behalf of the government: we on this side are for good jobs and we will never become the $2 shop that the extremists in the ranks of the Liberals secretly want us to become.

  Once again, we have this incredible hypocrisy from those opposite.                     These are the people who went out and said that carbon pricing would mean death for the Latrobe Valley - an incredibly irresponsible statement which shows just how far they will go and how desperate they will be to spread fear. Now they are saying that, somehow, because we did not proceed with the Contract for Closure we are wrong as well. We did not proceed with the Contract for Closure because we did not think it represented good value for money. That is why we did not proceed with it. But we do have in place our carbon price and we have our caps. We will meet our targets and we will do that in the least cost way.                     The shadow minister is another one who has changed his position. Having written his thesis on a market price for carbon, he now comes in and says we should have one because we did not proceed with one or two other measures. Is that what he is saying now? This is further evidence that they will keep a carbon price.

  I thank the member for Capricornia for her question and for her ongoing interest in this very important area of social policy. The government knows that there are too many Australians who are homeless, there are too many people sleeping rough, too many mums and their kids sleeping in cars and too many teenagers couch surfing. That is why the Labor government has been reducing homelessness and has made reducing homelessness a national priority. It is why we have invested an unprecedented $5 billion into support for homeless services and programs since 2008. We also invested $20 billion in making housing more affordable, including $6 billion in social housing. This has meant that construction workers and small businesses could stay afloat and, indeed, thrive during the global financial crisis. But just as importantly it has meant that we had 20,000 new homes for those people who are homeless or at risk of being homeless. It was a very important investment. Through our efforts we have made a direct financial contribution since 2008 into one in every 20 homes constructed in this country.                 In tough fiscal times, we are still committed. We are still committed to making a difference. We are still committed to cutting homelessness. However, this partnership is with states and territories and they must do their part.                 I am asked if there are any impediments to cutting the rate of homelessness in this country. This is not helped by the New South Wales government increasing rents on pensioners and veterans in public housing. It is not helped by the Victorian government cutting funding to social housing advocacy and support programs. Indeed, it is not helped by Campbell Newman and the Queensland government axing the Tenant Advice and Advocacy Service and cutting front-line jobs which provide valuable assistance to more than 80,000 households annually in Queensland. Sadly, this valuable community service will close its doors in 24 locations around Queensland next month. Removing these services will, indeed, increase the risk of homelessness for thousands of Queenslanders.                 The member for North Sydney has said that Campbell Newman's decision was courageous. Campbell Newman himself has said he has the support of the Leader of the Opposition, Tony Abbott, in his approach to cutting services and cutting front-line staff. Make no mistake, these essential services are needed. These jobs being cut will hinder our most vulnerable. This is just a dress rehearsal. This is just a warm-up act for if ever Tony Abbott became Prime Minister of this country.

  I thank the member for his question. I think they are very sensitive because what we have put in place is a level of service that provides the front-line services that are required in this country. I seem to recall the last question that I had from the shadow treasurer about this was about how the Public Service had exploded and how there were at least 10,000 or 20,000 too many public servants. That is what he was saying. What we have done is run a responsible employment policy which is supporting public servants in this country who do a great job in delivering their services for the Australian people, and we get great value for money.

  I thank the member for Throsby for his question. I am delighted to inform the House that I am very much looking forward to working with him in Shellharbour in just a couple of weeks on the government's 59th jobs and skills expo. But also I stand here, like the member for Throsby, so incredibly proud of this government's record when it comes to jobs. I am proud that over 800,000 jobs have been created since we came to government. I am incredibly proud that we were prepared to stand up and protect jobs during the GFC whilst those opposite were busy sleeping. I am incredibly proud that we see an unemployment rate in this country at just 5.1 per cent, which is the envy of much of the rest of the world.                 But this government are not prepared to just step back. We know that there are some communities that are being left behind, and we want to make sure that all Australians share in the prosperity that we have on offer. That is why we have set up our jobs and skills expos. That is why we have now, after one last week in Kwinana with the Special Minister of State, had 58 of these expos around the country. I can tell you that they work. I can tell you that because we now have over 21,000 Australians who have been placed in jobs as a result of attending one of our jobs and skills expos.                 Sadly, not every government shares our commitment to employment though. Not every government does. You can imagine my shock when I arrived in Townsville for their local jobs and skills expo to work hard with the government to place 500 people in jobs to find out that Campbell Newman had just announced 400 local job losses for Townsville. We are working to help people into jobs locally; they are working to turf them out.                 We know that families right across Queensland, beyond just Townsville, have been confronted with terrible local news. In fact, the front page of the North West Star in Mount Isa yesterday read: '2,754 jobs to go. Mount Isa staff fear for their future as the Newman government slashes jobs.' The Sunshine Coast Daily's front page yesterday read: 'Job seekers giving up on ever finding work.' We know that they are not content to just cut jobs. In fact, they are cutting the programs which help support people get back into work. In the budget today, the LNP government have confirmed $287 million in cuts, axing the Skilling Queenslanders for Work program.                 We can see a very clear contrast here. We are continuing to work to support Australians to work, to share in the benefits and the dignity that comes with employment. We have seen in crystal clear form right across Queensland just exactly what we would see if this Leader of the Opposition were ever to become Prime Minister.

  I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. He continues to be at war with the facts. He is all about aggression and not about outcomes. He is all about exaggeration and not about responding to this issue in a responsible way. He will not respond to this in a responsible way. He comes in here and claims that tow-backs and temporary protection visas can somehow work when these have been rejected comprehensively by the Houston report. We get this continued hypocrisy. They talk about the refugee convention and then they talk about towing people back to Indonesia, which is not a signatory to the refugee convention. They choose to ignore the danger to our naval personnel, who should not be towing people back to Indonesia because it is a danger to their lives.                 Essentially what we have seen here today from the Leader of the Opposition is more questions. But I will tell you this: he most certainly does not like answering questions since he was towelled up by Leigh Sales and Lisa Wilkinson. For two years we have seen the Leader of the Opposition out there every day - out at a factory, out at a shop -                      I certainly will. Every day for the last two years the Leader of the Opposition has been out there in one form or another conducting his horror show - every day he has been out there doing a doorstop. But we have not seen one for the past week because he has had a week-long 'Mark Riley moment'. He slammed the door shut on his press conferences. Why is that? It is because he does not want to answer questions factually.

  What drives this government, whether it is the pricing of carbon or the declaration of marine parks, is the national interest. That is what drives this government. That is what drove us to respond to the global recession and put in place a stimulus which saved jobs and supported small business in our economy. What drives us when it comes to carbon pricing is our future economic prosperity and the desire to generate power in this country from renewable energy. What drives us when it comes to the supertrawler is making sure that all Australians can have faith that fishing practices are ones which encourage sustainability. I know that all Australians have been concerned about this issue, which is why the government has responded in the way in which we have responded. That is, we have introduced to this House legislation that ensures that the science will drive the decisions, so that our fishing industry is sustainable for the future. That is what we have done. That is what the minister for the environment has done in this House this morning. I am absolutely stunned that those opposite could vote against this very important measure. It shows just how cavalier they are and their disdain for the environment and for sustainability. As someone who comes from the great state of Queensland and as someone who grew up on the coast, I understand how important it is to preserve our fisheries.                     I understand how important it is that our sons and daughters and grandchildren can have the opportunity to throw a line in and catch a fish. I understand the importance of that -                    The member for Bowman then left the chamber.                     but nobody on the other side of this House gets that equation, because they do not believe in protecting the environment. They do not believe in all of the essential protections that we on this side of the House are absolutely committed to. We have put to the House a proposal which is responsible. We have put to this House a proposal which will protect our fish stocks. We have put to this House a proposal which is in the interests of our environment. I would have thought that we would get universal support for it. The fact that those opposite are opposing it shows just how negative they are and the lengths they will go to to trash our environment.

  I thank the member for Throsby for his question, because the Australian economy is a clear stand out in the developed world. We supported growth during the worst global recession in over 80 years. We avoided recession and we avoided the destruction of jobs that occurred right across the developed economies. Of course, if those opposite had had their way at that time Australia would have gone into recession and we would have seen small businesses hit the wall and a substantial increase in unemployment.                 Through all this period, as we have supported the economy we have put in place a responsible fiscal policy. We put in a set of fiscal rules to bring our budget back to surplus that are light years ahead of major advanced economies. In those rules we have of course been able to find room for Labor priorities: doubling investment in education and delivering a historic boost to the pension and fundamental reform to our hospital system. All of these responsible initiatives are part of Labor values. But what we are seeing on the other side of the parliament are Liberal values - the scorched earth approach to education and health.                     In Queensland and New South Wales today people are waking up to the stark reality of the values that drive the Liberal Party - indiscriminately wielding the axe, particularly in health and education. In Queensland there has been the loss of 14,000 jobs of key workers, in health in particular. All of those cuts have the cold-hearted stamp of approval of the Leader of the Opposition. Just yesterday we saw cuts to education in New South Wales - $1.7 billion was ripped out of education.                 In both New South Wales and Queensland every parent and every pupil fears the reckless approach to these vital areas of public policy that comes from the Liberal Party. We know when the Liberals swing the axe who gets the chop. We know that it is nurses, hospital workers, and working men and women. And the people who need those government services are the people who feel the chop. What is going on in New South Wales and Queensland now is just the warm-up act for the Leader of the Opposition, who has given his seal of approval to the cuts in both New South Wales and Queensland.                 In Queensland what we are seeing is a very cruel and destructive budget. It is a budget that speaks volumes about Campbell Newman, Tony Abbott and the entire Liberal Party. We on this side of the House will always stand up for responsible fiscal policy, and of course that is standing up for working Australians. Those on the other side of the House want to cut them down.

  We now know why the shadow Treasurer did not ask this question. It is because the shadow Treasurer has been going around the country saying that there are 20,000 too many public servants in Australia and he is going to take the axe to those public servants. So he has not had the guts to front up and ask the question. He has had to throw it to the Manager of Opposition Business. But we on this side of the House, as I said before, are committed to responsible fiscal policy and to making the savings to put in place the priorities that we have, particularly in health and education.                 We have found savings over five budgets - $100 billion during our first four and $33 billion during our last savings exercise. We have found efficiencies in the public sector. The one thing we have not been doing is taking a big axe to jobs like those over there -                    The member for Cowan then left the chamber.                     We on this side of the House have a methodical approach to finding savings in the public sector. We have been doing that in a responsible way over the time that we have been in government. That is why we have put in place those essential Labor priorities. The biggest increase in the pension in history was put in place because we found room in the budget. The tripling of the tax-free threshold was put in place because we are committed to putting in place policies which reward hard work and make sure that people have access to the essential services that they need, in particular in health and education.                 I am asked about the Public Service and I am asked about figures. The Public Service has had an annual growth of just 0.8 per cent over the five years since we came to office ending in 2012-13. That has been the growth in the public sector in the period that we have been in office. It stands in stark contrast to the proposals from those over there not only to cut 20,000 from the public sector; we have not yet got to their hidden agenda, the one they are not going to tell people about until after the next election if they win, which is how they will get to filling the $70 billion crater they have in their budget bottom line - the Campbell Newman approach.                     Everybody here is aware they will not have their policies costed at the Parliamentary Budget Office. On this side of the House we have been entirely transparent. We are proud of what we have done with the public sector. We recognise the very good work it does. We recognise the importance of front-line services, unlike those opposite, who want to have a scorched earth approach to the public sector and the services in health and education on which so many Australians depend.

  I thank the member the Chifley for his question. The fact is that Labor has consistently invested in schools around Australia. That is what Labor does. We have consistently done it in New South Wales - half a billion dollars for the low socioeconomic schools national partnership and $100 million on literacy and numeracy and on teacher quality. I could go on. Federally, we have almost doubled what the Howard government spent on education.                 We know we have to do more to lift our education performance, focusing on teacher quality, looking at giving more power to principals in schools and giving schools the support they need to lift their results. That is why the Prime Minister has been clear that if there is agreement to a national plan for school improvement then we would be willing to invest more. In fact, we saw OECD head Andreas Schleicher endorse our approach just today on that. On this side of the chamber we know that Labor in government will always invest in schools. It is what we do. It reflects a profound view that we need to do the best we as a nation can on education so that every child has a chance, so that as a country we continue to grow and so that as a country we continue to be prosperous.                 But when Liberal governments come to power they put schools and teachers straight up onto the chopping block. I can understand why schools across New South Wales, including in the member for Chifley's electorate and my electorate, are worried about these proposed cuts to education.                 Before an election the coalition will say things that they want to say and they think people want to hear, and let me tell you what they are: that 'teachers will be the best paid in the country', that 'we will invest in schools', that 'fees will not rise'. But after the election it is a different story. When the Liberal Party and the Liberal government in New South Wales wanted to make a saving it was education that was bowled up first - $1.7 billion worth.                     Against the hubbub, I am asked the question: what does this mean? Well, I will tell you what it means: cuts that will push up fees in non-government schools in New South Wales, cuts that will reduce support to government schools in New South Wales, cuts that will slash jobs for TAFE teachers and increase fees for students. It is worthwhile reflecting for those opposite that the biggest cuts we have seen to education in New South Wales were when the last Liberal government was in power and Terry Metherell united the entire education community and the state against him. I wonder if the member for North Sydney remembers that.                 The fact is that we will always invest in education on this side of the House. This is absolutely core to what Labor governments do. But we now know, from what we see in New South Wales and from what the Leader of the Opposition has promised by way of $2.8 billion of cuts in education, that that would happen here too if they were ever to come to power.

  The fact is that the shadow Treasurer, in his usual sloppy way, is in fact making it up himself. So let's just go very clearly through this. The health minister has developed an excellent scheme to improve dental services in Australia. Everyone on this side of the House is absolutely proud of what we have done in this area. Of course, what we have done at the same time is to remove and close down a scheme put in place by the current Leader of the Opposition which was blowing out in terms of its cost. It was blowing out and a very, very big drain on the budget over a long period of time. It is one of the great atrocities that has been committed on the budget by this current Leader of the Opposition. And because it was not delivering value for money we said that we would abolish it, and he has been holding up its abolition in this House for years and years and years.                 But, yes, it is already counted in our forward estimates because we have announced our intention to abolish it, and that is factored into our budget. So, yes, we do have to find additional savings to fund the scheme. So both are correct. The only misrepresentation here is from the shadow Treasurer over there, who is seeking in his usual way to twist the facts.                 This is the reason, of course, that he will not take that walk around to the Parliamentary Budget Office, which is not as far as Aussie's. He spends plenty of time around there. He could take a walk around to the Parliamentary Budget Office and submit his costings, which he has told all Australians are now complete. If they are complete, why don't you show them to the Australian people? We can see the secret hidden agenda that you have to slash health and education, because that is the only way you are going to make up the room for your hidden agenda and your policies into the future. So let's see someone be fair dinkum over there and take their policies around to the budget office. Let's see whether you are fair dinkum or not.

  I thank the honourable member for his question and his interest in housing. This is a very important area of public policy, and it is for that reason that recently, at the ministerial council that was held in Perth, I had discussions with my counterparts at the state and territory level to talk about what we need to do to ensure that we have sufficient housing stock in this country and to ensure that we have sufficient capability to allow people either to find housing for affordable rent or to make affordable purchases of homes. There is no doubt that, in the time that we have been in office, we have invested, as a federal government, more money in housing than any other government at the Commonwealth level. We created the National Affordable Housing Agreement with the states and territories to ensure that we provided opportunities for people who were looking to enter the housing market. We also invested $20 billion in housing. As I said yesterday, as a result of that investment, we have been contributing to one in every 20 homes built in this country since 2008.                 But the member points to some other areas of public policy that are also very important. It is for that reason that we need to make sure that, in discussion with states and territories, we find sufficient land available to enable us to continue to invest in housing stock. My conversations with ministers at the state and territory level have involved us looking at ways we can unlock land to increase housing stock to ensure that people in Sydney, in New South Wales generally and in other states in this country are able to find the homes that they deserve. Most Australians believe that it is only reasonable that their aspiration involves finding a place they can call home. We have to do everything we possibly can to do that. I say to the honourable member, in relation to some of the reforms he is proposing, that they are on the table at the ministerial council on housing and homelessness. I am engaging with those ministers. There are also discussions that will occur in other ministerial councils in relation to planning, because there is no doubt there has been insufficient planning in relation to housing at the state level and we need to therefore consider doing more.                 Further discussions will be held in November with my counterparts at the state and territory level to talk about those reforms. COAG is looking at driving some of these reforms as well. If the states and territories are fair dinkum about providing opportunities for people to purchase homes, whether it is in the honourable member's electorate or any other part of this country, they need to bring to the table reforms that are needed, whether it is looking at ways in which people can enter the market for the first time or whether it is about ensuring we have sufficient affordability. I will continue to look at that and I am happy to talk to the member about that issue.

  I thank the member for Parramatta for her question. This government understands the importance of managing the budget for all Australians. That is why we are making responsible savings in order to return the budget to surplus this year. But, because we are a Labor government, we are determined to manage the economy responsibly, in a way that does not leave people behind. In fact, we are providing more support for families and communities than ever before. We are determined to make sure we have a strong economy, but we want to build a fairer society as well. That is why we have introduced the Schoolkids Bonus; that is why we have increased family payments; and that is why we have delivered $47 billion worth of tax cuts in the term of this government.                 But hardworking families and communities are facing an unprecedented threat, and it is coming from state Liberal premiers. Yesterday we saw the New South Wales Liberal government announce funding cuts of $1.7 billion to education. These are the biggest, the most vicious, the most aggressive cuts to education funding in New South Wales in the last 20 years. Guess what. That is when the Liberals were last in government - when the most vicious cuts prior to this were inflicted.                 The member for Parramatta knows - representing a part of the world that I also represent, western Sydney - just how much of an impact these cuts are going to have for the people of western Sydney. But it is not just her and me who feel this way. There is another memberfor Parramatta. He is the Liberal member for Parramatta in New South Wales. He was quoted in the Telegraph today saying, about these education funding cuts:                 These are our people in western Sydney, the aspiring, and these are the ones we should be supporting, not cutting them down.                 It is Labor governments that invest in the skills of people like the people of western Sydney. It is the Liberals that are out there cutting them down. And we can guarantee that they will do it again. If this mob ever get into government, they will do the same thing. How do we know that? We know that because they have got a $70 billion black hole. If they can do this sort of damage in New South Wales with $1.7 billion worth of cuts, imagine how much damage they can do the country if they have to rip out the amount of cuts involved to fill their $70 billion black hole. We know that they have already announced $2.8 billion worth of cuts to education, but it is not the cuts that they have announced that you have got to worry about; it is the ones that they have not announced yet. One of the first things the Leader of the Opposition will do, straight out of the Campbell Newman playbook, is establish a commission of audit. The commission of audit will be all about making sure that they get to inflict the cuts that they have not had the opportunity to take to the Australian people before the election.

  I think that question just demonstrates how far those on the other side of the House will go to run a fear campaign. I refer the shadow minister to the answer that I gave in the House yesterday and the answer I gave the day before, but what I will say is that, when we responded to the Henry report, we ruled that out.

  I thank the member for Petrie for her question. I know that as a proud Queenslander she is very worried about the effects that these cuts will have on people living in her electorate and living in Queensland. For weeks now we have heard little bits of information from here and there: cuts to breast-screening services; cuts to nurses in Townsville, the Darling Downs, Charters Towers and West Moreton; cuts to flu vaccine for health workers; cuts to pathology services in Hervey Bay; and even cuts to counsellors who help grieving relatives at the morgue - all of these little reports from everywhere. But yesterday we saw in the budget papers a whole lot more information. We heard that in fact the job cuts were not 2,700; there are in fact 4,140 jobs to go. You cannot cut that many jobs without impacting front-line services.                 We have seen more shockers. We have seen the shutting of the Queensland Tuberculosis Control Centre and 12 full-time jobs go from the DonateLife agency, effectively disbanding this agency. Everything we know about increasing organ donation rates says that you need dedicated workers to do it, and we have seen in this budget that those dedicated workers have gone, including the donor family support officer - gone to be a bureaucrat instead of supporting families.                 You know, having all these bits of information, it is like one of those 3-D Magic Eye pictures - you are seeing all these bits of disparate information and when you look at it closely a picture emerges, and it is a very scary picture indeed: it is the picture of Tony Abbott's Australia if he is ever Prime Minister. We know this is the curtain-raiser. I tell you what: we had a press release also from Peter Dutton, the member for Dickson, the shadow minister for health and ageing; it is called -                      So, the member for Dickson, the shadow minister for health and ageing - 'Resuscitating Queensland Health'. This is a great one. He is congratulating the Queensland government for these cuts. And - wait for it - this is the best bit: he says, 'You can take Labor's path and spend taxpayers' money on shiny towers housing public servants, or you can take the Liberal way and spend it on helping doctors.'                     What do we see here? Campbell Newman's towers!                     Members opposite should read the Townsville Bulletin:                  As Townsville's already-stretched public hospital staff face an uncertain future, Premier Campbell Newman has announced a flash new Brisbane office for himself - and it's not a good look.

  This government is very serious about fiscal policy. And we have proved that, every year that we have been in government. We have put in place a fiscal policy which has had the big tick from the OECD, from the World Bank, from the IMF and, most particularly, from the rating agencies. We have a AAA, gold-plated rating from the three major rating agencies, for the first time in our history - something not achieved by those on the other side of the House. That is the first time in our history we have had that from the three major rating agencies globally. And why do we have that? Because, firstly, we took the responsible steps during the global financial crisis to stimulate our economy and to support jobs and families - understanding, based on Labor values, that we would protect people from the ravages of a global recession, because we understand what unemployment means to people. We understand what it means to dignity. We understand what it means to communities. We understand all of these things because they are based on our values and our sound policies. And when we did that we were opposed by everyone opposite; the Leader of the Opposition slept through the critical debate that saved Australia from the global recession. At the same time that we did that, we put in place the fiscal policy to bring our budget back to surplus over time and to put in place a set of fiscal rules -                      It was a question about fiscal policy, Madam Deputy Speaker, and I am answering it directly. Nothing could be more important to the peace of mind of the Australian people than a very sound fiscal policy. But that is not understood by those opposite.                 The shadow Treasurer admitted on morning television that there was a $70 billion crater in his budget bottom line. He said it on TV, sitting beside the environment minister, and now he claims it did not happen. For the past two years this country has had to suffer the Leader of the Opposition going from shop to shop and town to town talking doom and gloom, talking our economy down and talking up a horror show wherever he has gone. But he has gone missing in action for the past week. He has been nowhere to be found for the past week. All we have had from the Leader of the Opposition for the past week is radio silence. After his interview with Lisa Wilkinson on Friday, he retreated. Perhaps there were things in his past that he did not want to talk about. Perhaps he was deeply worried about the political implications of what is going on in New South Wales and in Victoria.                     I am talking about the importance and seriousness of fiscal policy. Those on that side of the House do not have one and they are unfit for high office.                 Leave not granted.

  I thank the member for Greenway for her question. The Labor government and the labour movement are always striving to promote fairness in Australian workplaces. To support that proposition, I would submit that it is this government which has been in office during the creation of 800,000 jobs, that it is this government which is educating and training our young for the future, that it is this government which is remedying unequal pay for women in the community services sector, that it is this government which wants safe roads and which is acting to make sure that truck drivers return home safe at the end of their rostered work, that it is this government which is delivering secure retirement incomes by increasing superannuation from nine per cent to 12 per cent, that it is this government which has abolished discrimination against older workers in access to superannuation and that it is this government which is scrapping superannuation taxes for the low paid. But this is not a government which seeks to dump the blame for the challenges of the national economy on the backs of 1.8 million public sector workers.                 Fairness in Australian workplaces can never be taken for granted. It must be jealously guarded. We must be vigilant against threats to fairness. But fairness in Australian workplaces is under attack today. Let us have a look at those Liberal state governments - they are not a looming risk to fairness; that risk is a reality. Every patient, every student, every family is affected by the cuts to public sector jobs in Australian workplaces. The state Liberal chainsaw job massacre is underway. We know you cannot have fairness for public sector workers while they are being maligned by this view that, if we could just get rid of tens of thousands of public sector workers, miraculously the nation would be a better place.                  Let me unpack who some of these public servants being attacked are. There are 600 transit officers in New South Wales being cut. What did they ever do to deserve a Liberal attack?                     In the Queensland rural fire service, 45 out of 79 uniformed officers are being cut. What a recipe for disaster to cut fire officers before what is potentially one of Queensland's worst bushfire seasons! What did the public servants who are on maternity leave in Victoria ever do to be told by Premier Baillieu - 'Red Ted' Baillieu - that they have to reapply for their own jobs?                     I withdraw. But what did the nurses in Townsville ever do to deserve Premier Newman cutting their jobs? What did the hospital orderlies and the school cleaners and the people necessary to make sure we have healthy hospitals do? Fairness in Australia is under attack because of conservative state governments. I only have one challenge for those opposite: will you endorse what they are doing or will you walk away from it? Are the state governments really the warm-up act for your industrial relations approach or do you disown the bungling?

  I thank the member for Hume for his question, because what we have seen in this House, day after day, are allegations of that nature, and they are generally always wrong. They are always exaggerated, they are always taken out of context, and there are a litany of them. So I am happy to examine the bill, but I want to make a couple of points.                 The fact is that the fear campaign run by the Leader of the Opposition has now simply run out of steam. It has run right into a brick wall. And why has it run right into a brick wall? Because many of these allegations have been proven to be false. He even recognised this himself when he was down in Tasmania a few weeks ago, where he was forced to admit that the impacts he had been claiming the carbon price would have were not going to happen. He admitted that. Of course, that does not gel with all of the statements he and others from the coalition had been making that the carbon price was going to be a wrecking ball right through our economy -                      It is very interesting that it is no longer the Leader of the Opposition who asks these questions. He no longer asks these questions, and I wonder why that is the case. I think he wants to separate himself from his immediate past, not just his past going back a decade or so -                      Certainly, Deputy Speaker. Hospitals do not pay the carbon price. Yes, there is an impact on electricity costs - there is no doubt about that - but there is no direct imposition of the carbon price on hospitals. And as the Treasury modelling estimates -                      I guess they prove my point all of the time with this outrageous exaggeration. The Australian public has recognised it for what it is, which is outrageous exaggeration. But they are still in here trying to run the fear campaign when it has run into a brick wall. That is why the Leader of the Opposition is not going to come in here and ask these sorts of incorrect questions; the campaign that he has been running has simply run out of steam. That says a lot about those opposite - that they do not have any alternative policy framework for this country other than to put their stamp of approval on savage cuts to health and education in the states of Queensland and New South Wales. This is one of the reasons why there is radio silence now from the Leader of the Opposition. He is not out there talking about these things because he is not fair dinkum.                     Where has the Leader of the Opposition been for the past week?                 Leave not granted.

  I thank the member for Blair for his question. Both the member for Blair and the member for Oxley, along with a number of members on the other side of the House, have been very involved in raising with me the impacts on their communities of disasters, whether it was Black Saturday, the Queensland floods, Cyclone Yasi or floods in the last season. There are many of these events, unfortunately, that occur, and we are coming into another season now where Australians need to make sure that they are prepared for them.                 People are probably aware that the Commonwealth contributes a significant amount of money to supporting communities in such times of trouble. In the course of the year 2011-12, the Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements provided approximately $3 billion to affected communities.                 When disaster strikes, people expect that communities will pull together. The member for Blair asked the question. I went to his local SES and worked with and met a number of people who are volunteer firefighters, who are involved in all sorts of assistance to the community. It is why we read with, frankly, some large shock that more than half of Queensland's Rural Fire Service, their uniformed officers, are being sacked as a result of cuts by the Queensland government - more than half.                     People might be calling out over there, but I know - and I do not make any political point about this - that there are many regional members who come to talk to me who want assistance, appropriately, for their communities. We have been engaging and discussing with them, whether it is the member for Riverina, the member for McEwen or the Independents. Unlike the outrageous comments that were made earlier in question time, we do not actually care how those communities vote. They are entitled to assistance and they should not be going through what they are going through in Queensland, in a state of shock that more than half of the uniformed officers in the Rural Fire Service are being sacked by Premier Newman.                 As we go into disaster season, we cannot afford to lose confidence in those vital services, whether it is the SES, the fire service or our police. On this side of the House, we want to work with emergency personnel and provide them with the support that is needed. Unfortunately, the Liberals around the country do not think that is so important and we do not know what this man opposite would do if he were the Prime Minister.

  I thank the member for Hindmarsh for his question. The member for Hindmarsh has been following the issue of the supertrawler very closely for some time and has been making representations about it in detail. Since I referred to the issue yesterday, the legislation has been introduced and is now before the parliament. It is also the case that in the course of that discussion there have been a couple of issues raised extensively as developments that need to be put out of the way straight away for the benefit of all the parliament. The first development is that there has been a claim that a document that was put out independently by AFMA two or three years ago was somehow authorised by me when I was fisheries minister. That, of course, is not the case. It never has been the case and that harvest strategy was never authorised by the minister. That is not how the system works.                      The most ridiculous claim is that somehow this legislation is going to have a big impact on recreational fishing as well. I am not aware of a lot of recreational supertrawlers out on the ocean.                      I do not know that the issue is all that big. I do know that there is a series of amendments, some of which I have put in, and one of which was referred to in the question by the member for Flinders, which clarify once and for all what has always been the intention of the government.                      The member for Dobell - and this is where concerns have been raised, including by recreational fishers in the electorates of those opposite. It is the reason the member for Dawson stood up in parliament yesterday and said that he wanted that particular vessel stopped. The amendments will be made to hone down the issue and leave no doubt that we are talking about very specific situations. If anyone wants to claim that they can just vote no and hide behind a recreational fishing argument, that argument will be gone. And people will know when they go back to their electorates, if they vote against the government's legislation, that their recreational fishers will put the issues squarely to them. They may as well be standing on the deck, hauling in the net, if they oppose this legislation.                 Leave not granted.

  I thank the Deputy Leader of the Opposition for that question, because it is not a bad attempt to deflect attention away from the savage cuts that are being made to health and education right across Queensland, the absolutely savage cuts - 14,000 public sector workers getting the axe in Queensland.                     Certainly. First of all, I was asked about the carbon price. The government has put in place a carbon price to make sure we reduce carbon pollution and to drive investment in renewable energy. Nothing could be more important to the prosperity of an economy in the 21st century than being driven by renewable energy and making your economy more energy efficient. We have devoted a lot of time to that over the past 12 to 18 months, and we have been opposed, tooth and nail, every day of the week, by those opposite. But we have got that done, and that will be good for our economy in the long term. It will be good for prosperity in this country and it will increase the investment in renewable energy. So everyone on this side of the House is proud of that achievement.                 And, of course, we have put in place new taxation arrangements in the mining industry to make sure Australians get the fair share from the resources they own - 100 per cent.                 But of course what those opposite have done there, once again, is to be entirely negative, to oppose everything, because they would rather see our economy fail than see this country succeed, and that is the approach that they take on every issue.                 Now let us go to the issue of the supertrawler. What the government wants to see is a sustainable fishing industry in this country. The supertrawler poses new challenges to our current regulatory framework, so the government is coming to the table in good faith, understanding the concern of all Australians about the activity of the supertrawler. As someone who grew up on the Queensland coast, I have spent a lot of time in the water and I have spent a lot of time out there fishing along the Queensland coast. What I want to see for my children and what I want to see for my grandchildren is the capacity to throw a line in and catch a fish. That is what we want to see, and anyone who wants their children and grandchildren to see that will be for sustainable practices in fisheries.                 But, as is the case with the carbon price, what we have on the other side of the House is a mob of environmental vandals who do not understand the importance of sustainability - sustainability when it comes to the need to invest in renewable energy, sustainability when it comes to the need to make sure we have adequate stocks -

  I thank the member for Fowler for that question, because the Australian economy walks tall in the world. Our economy is now 11 per cent higher than when we came to office, and of course we have done that during a period when many other developed economies have gone backwards. One of the reasons that we are in this strong position is that during the global financial crisis and the global recession we put in place a range of policies to support employment and to support small business. We did this in the face of the worst global downturn in 80 years. That meant that we avoided the skill destruction and we avoided the capital destruction of small businesses that we see right around the world, which are holding all of those developed economies back.                 But, most importantly, why did we do that? We did it to protect communities. We did it to protect families. We did it to protect small businesses. We did it because we understand that we live in a community; we do not just live in a corporation, and we bring those values towards our decision-making processes. We want to protect the very social fabric of our communities. Of course, to do that, you also have to invest in the future, and that means investment in education in particular: in schools, in vocational training and in universities. That is why we have found savings in our budget over the past five years to make room for those priorities. We have put in place a responsible fiscal policy. It is all about making sure that Australians have jobs and about getting a fair go, not just everything going to the fortunate few.                 We on this side of the House will always stand up for working Australians. We will not have any part of tearing them down, which is why what we are seeing in Queensland and New South Wales at the moment is so regrettable. The big axe is being taken to health and education, having dramatic impacts on the lives and lifestyles of tens of thousands of Australian families right around the country, and there is the big attack on education spending in New South Wales as well - indiscriminately wielding the axe, cutting the basic services that go to the very basic fabric of our society.                 We know that this is just a warm-up act for Tony Abbott and Joe Hockey, because they have a $70 billion budget crater.                     Certainly.                     I do understand why they are so sensitive, because they are going to take the axe to basic services, and they want to keep their agenda hidden just like Campbell Newman kept it hidden in Queensland. That is their objective: to have a commission of audit to hide the truth, not to tell the truth.                 We on this side of the House understand that you have to build up the nation. You have to support your workforce. You do not do it by tearing working people down.

  Net debt 2011-12, $142.5 billion; 2012-13, $143.5 billion.                     Gross debt 2011-12, 265.8; 2012-13, 274.2.                     I also wanted to make some -                      Thank you, Deputy Speaker, because I am only too happy to talk about debt. I am very happy to talk about it. Net debt in Australia as a percentage of GDP was 9.6 per cent in 2011-12. That is around one-tenth of the level of other major developed economies.                 Why is that important? It goes back to the core of the disagreement in this chamber between the government and the opposition. We do have some net debt in this country now. We have it because the government took the responsible position of supporting jobs and small business during the global financial crisis and the global recession. The consequences of that action are the strong economic fundamentals we have and, most particularly, the gold plated AAA credit rating we have from the three major global rating agencies.                  I make that point because here we have yet another scare campaign from those opposite. They are seeking to exaggerate our levels of debt and seeking to talk down our economy as they have day after day for the last few years - but all the time having the shame of having opposed what we did to make our economy strong, to support jobs and to protect the fabric of our community. That shows the clear contrast between the values those on that side of the House have and the values we on this side of the House have. We will always support working Australians and small businesses, but those opposite will always take the axe to them.

  This Labor government has a proud history of investment in schools. But what we build up, the Liberal Party is intent on tearing down. We are seeing the biggest cuts to education in New South Wales in decades - the biggest cuts since the Liberals were last in power. These cuts will impact on families, on teachers and on disadvantaged students.                  I have noticed all kinds of excuses from the New South Wales government. The Premier said yesterday that money does not matter in schools. That is wrong. Targeted investments make a difference in schools. But do not take it from me - I had an opportunity to read one of the submissions to the Gonski panel on school funding. That submission said, 'Australia must increase school funding at least to the OECD average.' It went on to say, 'The Gillard government's National Partnership investment should be maintained. Many advances will be lost if the extra funding ceases.' Who said that? It was Barry O'Farrell's New South Wales government submission to the Gonski review. He agrees that we need to invest more - and why? Because it is working. Then he turns around and delivers the biggest cuts to education in New South Wales in decades.                 The second excuse made by the New South Wales government was that they had to cut schools funding because GST revenue is down. That is also completely wrong. The New South Wales minister yesterday issued a press release saying he had to cut schools funding because of a huge drop in GST revenue and he asked me to speak to the Treasurer about it. I did speak to the Treasurer - and guess what? New South Wales revenues are rising. Over the next four years, New South Wales GST revenue is projected to rise by 18 per cent. GST revenues in New South Wales are going up while Barry O'Farrell and the Liberal Party cut education funding.                  The truth is, whatever the excuses of the New South Wales government, this is all about choices. We on this side of the House, as a Labor government, choose to support investment in education because we know that good jobs in the future are absolutely reliant on a good education - a good education, a good job. If you choose to cut funding to school education, that is a choice that you, as a government, will be judged by. In New South Wales, all we are seeing from the Liberals is cut, cut, cut.                  The Leader of the Opposition is famously on the record saying that he thinks support for government schools is an injustice. We have a shadow Treasurer planning $2.8 billion worth of cuts to schools and we have a shadow minister for education who thinks one in seven teachers should be sacked. We build it up; all they want to do is cut.

  I thank the member for Dickson for his question about the Australian economy and about his allegations of a black hole. The only black hole around is the $70 billion crater in the Liberal Party's bottom line that the shadow Treasurer announced on breakfast television when he was sitting next to the environment minister. I would like to talk more generally about the state of our economy and relate that to revenues. There have been a number of statements in recent times about the strength of the Australian economy, and one in particular stands out. It goes like this:                 There is no doubt the Australian economy is doing better than most - our unemployment is remarkably low, our debt-to-GDP compares very favourably on all measurements, our inflation is low.                     The shadow minister has the hide of a rhino. He comes in here and wants a guarantee from me that there will not be cuts in certain areas when he has said nothing about the savage cuts in Queensland to health and education by the Newman government - absolutely nothing. He has been completely mute. The reason every single one of those over there have been mute about the cuts in New South Wales and in Queensland is that they have the stamp of approval of the Leader of the Opposition.                     Certainly. I was also asked about the economy.                     I am sorry - if you cannot understand a question from the member for Dickson, you are not going too well. I was asked about an alleged hole in the budget and I am responding to that by talking about the strength of our economy and our economic fundamentals and about the commentary that our unemployment is remarkably low, our debt-to-GDP compares very favourably on all measurements and our inflation is low. So who do you reckon might have said that? Which leading Liberal? Which living Liberal leader might have said that? It was John Howard who said that. So when they come in here to run their scare campaign about our budget, they cannot climb over that assessment of the Australian economy. Nor can they climb over the assessments by the IMF, the OECD and most other reputable bodies.                  The fact is that we have put in place a responsible fiscal policy in this country and we have done that over five years. We stimulated our economy to support jobs, now we are coming back to surplus and our economy is growing. What we are doing is paying down debt. That is precisely what a responsible government does in these circumstances, and it is precisely what those opposite cannot do because they have a $70 billion hole in their budget bottom line and the fact is they have got an agenda to slash in health and education just like New South Wales and Queensland.

  Whether it be because of AFMA's legislation or because of their own actions, I do not believe they have been precautionary enough.                     Those opposite ask why we are forming this view of AFMA. AFMA themselves in the last 24 hours have reported to the government legal advice that they have been implementing some aspects of the act incorrectly. Members have heard me talk repeatedly about whether or not quota has yet been assigned to the vessel. AFMA at their meeting yesterday received new legal advice that a practice they had been following since the previous government was in office, and it continued under our government, was not actually consistent with the act. There are some serious questions, and I am pleased that the fisheries minister has called for a root-and-branch review. We need to make sure not only that a precautionary principle exists in writing but also that it is being implemented and implemented appropriately.                  There are some areas, for example with respect to target species, where I have no reason to doubt that the science is done thoroughly.                 But, in terms of bycatch issues, I am not relaxed about a situation where you always wait for the damage to occur before you decide that there should be tougher rules. Certainly, in terms of questions which I sought an answer to, to work out whether part 10 of the environment legislation would be activated -                      Correct. A week and a half ago I had not received the information that came in the last 24 hours. But, if we want to talk about events 80 years ago, you are the one who thinks Tasmanian tigers are still around! So don't you be talking about recent discoveries. We have an answer to the question -                      No, no - there would only be one member of this House that could possibly apply to, Deputy Speaker Burke, and I withdraw any reference to you in that respect.                     The question asked by the member for Lyne goes to that final question to which I sought an answer when I was working out whether part 10 of my legislation would be activated. It was a question of what the impact on species that rely on the target species would be. The answer was that we do not have that scientific information, and that that was giving a green light to the vessel. I do not believe that is a sufficiently precautionary principle. That is the principle currently being applied by AFMA. When the law falls short, I believe we need to change the law.

  I thank the member for Capricornia very much for her question. I was very pleased to be in Sydney this morning with the Acting Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and others to welcome home from London our Paralympic team. They were incredibly pleased to be home and, of course, very, very proud of their achievements. I know you are not supposed to have favourites, Deputy Speaker Burke, but my favourites really were the wheelchair basketballers, both the men and the women, who were fantastic competitors - incredibly tough. Congratulations to them and all of the other athletes, who showed that the Paralympics are all about hard work and dedication to your sport, demonstrating to not only the Australian people but also the world what extraordinary talent we have in this country. We are proud of our Paralympians because they also demonstrate what people with a disability can do, even when faced with sometimes very serious disabilities.                 This government is determined to do what we can for all people with disabilities, their families and their carers by building a National Disability Insurance Scheme. In building that National Disability Insurance Scheme, we want to make sure that we do everything we can to support people with disabilities so that they can meet their aspirations, find what it is that they can do, rather than have the system focus on what they cannot do. We believe that Australia needs a disability insurance system and, at long last in this country, we will have one. We are determined to deliver it to end what so many people have called 'the cruel lottery' - the cruel lottery that at the moment says that you get a certain level of care and support depending on where you live, depending on the type of disability you have or depending on how you got your disability, not depending on what your needs are. We want to turn that around and make sure that the National Disability Insurance Scheme we have in this country will determine what people get on the basis of need.                 We have already agreed that the scheme will start in New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Tasmania and here in the Australian Capital Territory. So we will be starting from the middle of next year. Twenty thousand people with disabilities will benefit, and so will their carers and families.

  I thank the shadow Treasurer for that question. I would like to go back to basics here because I think it is very important. We have put in place a responsible fiscal policy. We have set ourselves the objective to come back to surplus in 2012-13 and we are committed to doing that because our economy is growing around trend. That is precisely what we ought to do, given the strength and fundamentals of our economy, and that is what we have been working on for a number of years since the global financial crisis when we took the essential steps to support our economy, to support our communities, to keep people in work and to keep the doors of small business open.                  Of course, we have always been able to find room for our Labor priorities. In some of the most dreadful conditions in 80 years we found room to put in place the most significant increase in the pension and we are very proud of that. We have tripled the tax-free threshold, a fundamental reform, which really delivers to many people on low and fixed incomes. We have done all those things because we have found responsible savings. It has been hard. We have worked very much in the budget to find those savings - $33 billion in our last budget, $100 billion before that. That has been the methodical, careful approach of the government, which stands in stark contrast to the approach of those opposite who simply want to slash and burn.                  Their agenda is to slash and burn, like they are slashing and burning in Queensland and in New South Wales. We hear this afternoon that the Liberals in South Australia also have a new plan which is that, if elected to government, they will cut the public sector by -                      The shadow Treasurer has confirmed yet again that he has given a big tick to all of the cuts in Queensland and New South Wales and, if they are to come, in South Australia, because that is the federal Liberal agenda. What we have here is the Liberal 'Horror show'. It is produced by Barry O'Farrell and Campbell Newman and it is authorised by Tony Abbott, Leader of the Opposition.

  I thank the member for Reid for his question about a topic which I know occupies the minds of everyone in this chamber. Every day, on average six or seven Australians die by suicide and many dozens more make an attempt. Suicide is the biggest killer of men under 45 and of women under 35. One in four deaths of very young men is through suicide and, shockingly, two or three high schools every week are rocked by suicide. Certain groups in the community are at higher risk than others to suicide - Indigenous Australians, the LGTBI community, construction workers, families themselves bereaved through suicide, to name just a few, which is why over recent weeks and months I have announced millions of dollars in funding targeted at each of those groups. In spite of increased investment in the last term of the Howard government and in our first term in this area, the death toll through suicide has not shown significant improvement in more than a decade.                 That is why, in the lead-up to the last election, the Prime Minister announced that in a second term of her government we would redouble our efforts in this area, in addition to tackling broader mental health reform. That policy has led to funding flowing, for example, to Lifeline to increase their call capacity from about 400,000 calls per year to 700,000, and to take off the charges for mobile calls to that critically important service; to emergency face-to-face counselling services for Australians across the country where they are identified by GPs or emergency departments as a suicide risk; to infrastructure projects at notorious suicide hotspots which, for obvious reasons, we do not discuss in precise detail; and to a crisis outreach service run by headspace for schools that are impacted by suicide and more. We know that government investment in these programs alone is not going to protect families and communities from this ongoing tragedy. We need more open discussion in this nation, more open discussion as a community about mental health, about the impacts of bullying and about suicide.                 As the member for Reid reminded us, Monday was World Suicide Prevention Day and today is R U OK? Day. These are important community initiatives, led from the community and supported across politics, which promote more open discussion. Today reminds us all that looking out for each other and taking a short period of time to have a quiet discussion with someone we know who does not seem quite okay can have an enormous impact and can save a life.

  I thank the member for Wentworth for that very rare question. He deserves congratulations. It is obviously because the deputy leader is at the table that he has actually asked a question.                      You do not believe in the NBN!                      On this side of the House we do have a commitment to nation building. We have a commitment to the NBN because we understand the importance of super-fast broadband to the modern economy. We understand that we need to have the latest technology so we can deliver super-fast broadband and not have to maintain the horse-and-buggy system that we have got now. I think everybody understands there is a basic difference of opinion between this side of the House and that side of the House. They want to stay with the horse-and-buggy system. We want to invest in the latest technology to make sure that we are not only connected across our country but we are effectively connected to the rest of the world. Wherever I go in this country, but particularly in regional areas, the NBN is well understood. Even if they are not on our side of politics they give it very strong support.                 What I would say in regard to the specifics of the question from the member is that I am advised that, in terms of our corporate plan, our rollout is rolling out consistent with the time frame and numbers that we have published, and it will continue to be rolled out.

  I thank the honourable member for her question and recognise her very strong advocacy for the cause of refugees in the Middle East. We have all watched the humanitarian crisis in Syria in horror - 250,000 people have fled Syria for Lebanon, Turkey, Jordan and Iraq. The humanitarian situation in Damascus has deteriorated rapidly. Over 100,000 people have fled Syria in the last month alone and thousands more are fleeing Syria every day. High Commissioner Guterres expects that a further 650,000 people will leave Syria in coming months, bringing the total to almost one million people. One of the most disturbing facts about this crisis is that many of the people who have been forced to leave themselves sought refuge in Syria. Over the past 10 years many people have fled Iraq and taken refuge in Syria, and now they are again being forced to leave and seek refuge in another country.                 Of course, Australia is helping. We have committed $20 million in food assistance and medical assistance, making us the fourth largest bilateral donor in the world. Today I have announced another significant contribution. As part of the government's decision to increase the humanitarian intake to 20,000 people, I can announce today that we will resettle an extra 1,000 people from Syria. These UNHCR mandated refugees will be resettled over coming months. This will include both Syrian nationals and members of the Iraqi community who have previously been forced to leave Iraq and take refuge in Syria. This includes Assyrians, Chaldeans, Syriacs and Mandaeans. Many of these refugees we resettle will already have significant family links to Australia.                 This government is committed to ensuring that those in urgent need of resettlement get the chance of a better life in Australia. Many of those who have fled Syria will want to return when it is safe to do so, but many others simply will not be able to do so. Proximity cannot be the determinant of our obligation to help people in desperate circumstances.                 Today's announcement is only possible because of our decision to increase the humanitarian intake to 20,000 people. Our humanitarian program can never take all or even most of the people in need in Syria or anywhere else, but we can do our part. The announcement today says to people in desperate circumstances in Syria that those for whom the Arab Spring has turned to winter have a friend and a supporter in Australia.

  I was just trying to figure out which Wazza it was. We have a couple. I thank the member for his question. There has been some publicity about these matters in the press, and it is the case that the department has been out seeking quotes for whitegoods, kitchenettes, meeting rooms and so on. I just want to go through what the department is doing, because this is a very energy-efficient building.                     I really do understand that those opposite do not understand the concept of energy efficiency. I think everybody in the House actually gets that, and they have proved it yet again. The fact is that this new building which is being constructed and which the department is moving into is expected to cut their emissions in half, and it is going to save something like $70,000 a year from power generated by solar panels that are on the roof. The department expects to make $19.1 million in savings from 2011-12 to 2015-16 from the construction of this energy-efficient building. As I have been saying through the discussion today, the government does have a focus on finding efficiencies in savings. Efficiencies in savings have been found substantially within the department and that will continue to be the case.

  I want to thank the member for Moreton, because I know that the member for Moreton, like many other members in this place, understands the vital role that community organisations and all levels of governments play in supporting some of the most vulnerable in our community.                 Of course, the government is very proud of our record when it comes to supporting families: our Schoolkids Bonus, our increased family payments. We are also doing a lot of work when it comes to vulnerable families, with our $1 billion Family Support Program, $86 million in our National Plan to Reduce Violence against Women and their Children and, recently, $400 million in the second three-year action plan on the National Framework for Protecting Australia's Children. The government will continue to invest to support our fellow Australians in need. It is really important, because many of these programs require not just one level of government alone acting. We all need to work together - all levels of government and the community sector - on these very important policies.                 That is why the cuts in the Newman state budget this week are so alarming. I just want to run through a few. We have cuts to mental health programs, cuts to support for victims of domestic violence, cuts to family planning, cuts to rent support, cuts to women's health services, cuts to Indigenous employment and cuts to the commission for children. We know that the Leader of the Opposition and the Liberals have endorsed this plan and these cuts to vulnerable families in Queensland. Why is that? We know it is because, if they ever get back into government, they would do the same. They would cut services to community organisations, they would sack workers and of course they would do all this to fill their $70 billion black hole. The shadow Treasurer says natural attrition, of course, would take care of their proposed public sector cuts. But we now know in Queensland that natural attrition means sacking 14,000 workers - shame! Can you believe that in community services alone, as the minister for families said, there are $360 million in cuts? Of this, can you believe that $9.6 million is cut from the Commission for Children and Young People and Child Guardian? This is when the Queensland government have just endorsed their second three-year action plan on the National Framework for the Protecting Australia's Children and they are in the middle of a child protection review.                  Of course, Campbell's cuts go further: $260 million in what the Newman government is calling lower priority projects and efficiency improvements. Where is the efficiency in cutting domestic violence services? Domestic violence currently costs the Australian economy $13 billion a year, and Queensland's share of that would be $2.5 billion on a per capita basis. This is just ridiculous. We know that Liberal governments right across the country are cutting money away from vulnerable people in our community and of course this government is getting on with the job of supporting them.

  We have seen these allegations day after day after day, and most of them are incorrect. But I do say to the member that they should refer these matters to the ACCC, because if somebody out there in the supply chain is not doing the right thing then there is a means to deal with that. So they should go straight to the ACCC if the member is actually serious in the question that he has just asked. Has he referred these matters to the ACCC? Has he referred what the suppliers are doing to the ACCC?                  We have heard day after day members on the other side come in here and give us some facts about the impact on electricity bills, and generally they have been found to be wrong. The fact is that what we have seen here is a continuation of the scare campaign, which they are pretty embarrassed about now. The opposition leader went to Tasmania three or four weeks ago and admitted that the sky was not going to fall in, that things might not happen quite the way that he said they would - Whyalla would be wiped off the map, Gladstone would be wiped off the map, the whole of the Central Queensland coal industry would be gone. We can see that that has not happened, so they are continuing to try to do this in a different way.                  The fact is that this mob opposite have simply run out of steam when it comes to this scare campaign. It is leaving them exposed as not having a policy agenda for the future. All they have got is a $70 billion budget crater. That is what they have got. The shadow Treasurer announced that on breakfast television, sitting there beside the minister for the environment.                 Then he goes on TV and says that it never happened. It did not happen! He was not there! The invisible man!                     Why we are getting this sort of campaign from those opposite is that they are seeking to camouflage the fact that at the core of their whole policy agenda they have very harsh cuts planned for health and education - harsh cuts, just like we have seen in Queensland and just like we have seen in New South Wales and what would be seen if the Liberals were in power in South Australia.                      Certainly. I was referring to the fear campaign that has been waged by those opposite on carbon pricing, which has been found to be baseless. Frequently, when matters are raised in this House and we go away and investigate them we find out that they are wrong. But the member who asked me this question does not even believe in the science of climate change. This is what he has had to say:                 So we are not talking about proven science we are talking about a climate change theory.                 So what we have is a clear and stark contrast -                      What I would say is that he should say to everyone in Lithgow that he does not believe in the science of climate change and that is why he is involved in the fear campaign as he is.                     No. I table the Association of Heads of Independent Schools of Australia media release 'New South Wales Government fails students at independent schools'.

  I thank the member for McEwen for his question. There has been a concerning report released today that finds that a significant and rising problem for working Australians is job related stress. This can cause long-term damage to health. Nothing is more expensive than sending a good worker into stress, triggered by what happens in the workplace. This can take a heavy toll on staff, on families and on the performance of organisations. That is why, where there is stress caused in workplaces by uncaring and deliberate decisions of bad bosses, this needs to be tackled. Labor does not believe it is right and fitting for employers to cause stress for teachers, members of the Rural Fire Service, teachers aides, firefighters, police, ambulance officers, nurses, cleaners, orderlies.                 On this side of the House we appreciate what 1.8 million public sector workers do for Australia. We understand that our public servants at local, state and national level deliver services, deliver care, deliver trenchant analysis and deliver emotional commitment and that they work very hard. If it were not for our 1.8 million public sector workers, Australia would not be as modern; Australia would not be as fair. It would not be as flexible, it would not be as safe and it certainly would not be as compassionate. That is why public sector workers do not require the stress of 15,000 job losses in New South Wales. Public sector workers do not require the stress of 20,000 job losses in Queensland and 10,000 in Victoria. And - adding to the arms race - the South Australian Liberals have said, in the last half hour, that they want to get rid of 25,000 public servants.                 Indeed, if those numbers do not appal those opposite, let me quote, from the Courier Mail and the Brisbane Times today, the voices of the real people affected by these terrible changes and stress. Lisa Rake, a Queensland public servant, received a yellow envelope yesterday saying that she was excess to requirements. She is quoted as saying:                  Newman has stolen my future, that's what he has done.                 Bernard White is a 56-year-old nurse at the tuberculosis centre at the Princess Alexandra Hospital in Brisbane. He said:                 I can't give up because the amount of money that they are offering isn't enough for me to retire.                 Felicity Davis is a nurse at the Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital. She said:                 Everybody's really unhappy and everyone in our department definitely feels the same way. It's not right.                 Members of the House, one thing is very clear about workplace stress: bad bosses cause stress and fear; Liberal governments cause stress and fear; Liberal governments make bad bosses - or, to put it another way, if we want to do something about workplace stress in Australia, the three biggest causes are Campbell Newman, Ted Baillieu and Barry O'Farrell.

  It may have something to do with the $400 per household that is paid by them to meet Campbell Newman's taxation of the power system. It may have a lot to do with that. We have had a lot of discussion about the impact of a carbon price on electricity. The government has outlined the impact time and time again. Those are the figures that have been published. Any claims over and above those are simply part of a scare campaign. I reckon people in Queensland have got a lot to fear from Campbell Newman when it comes to electricity, given how much he is ripping off, putting into his budget and then transferring on to households like the ones in the member's electorate. Do you want to know something? They are pretty cranky about it.                   The member for Fadden then left the chamber.

  I thank the member for Petrie for her question. As a Queenslander she is experiencing through her constituency the devastation of the cuts that are being inflicted upon Queensland by the Newman government. We know that skills are absolutely essential to Australia's future competitiveness, yet incredibly the Newman government has completely axed the Skilling Queenslanders for Work program at a cost of almost $300 million. A recent evaluation of this program by Deloitte said:                 It has directly led to the employment of an additional 8,500 people who would not otherwise have gained employment _ the increased earnings generated by this employment ultimately contribute an additional $6.5 billion to Queensland GSP to 2020.                 That was a great program that was axed by the LNP government in Queensland.                 What is the federal coalition's view of these sorts of cuts? The Queensland Premier, Campbell Newman, said of the Leader of the Opposition: 'I've taken him through it. And he's very understanding _' He said the Leader of the Opposition has been 'incredibly supportive' of these cuts. The shadow Treasurer said of Campbell Newman: 'All strength to his right arm.' The shadow Treasurer said also that he was absolutely committed to these cuts, that they are fantastic and that there should be more of it. What do we have in common here? We have in common a Leader of the Opposition who is committed to an audit commission, exactly as Campbell Newman was committed to an audit commission. They have both done that because there is a $70 billion black hole. The shadow Treasurer said, 'I never mentioned $70 billion; I wasn't there; it wasn't me.' He said, 'Therefore, finding $50 billion, $60 billion or $70 billion is about identifying waste in areas where you do not need to proceed with programs like the skilling Queenslanders program.' The Leader of the Opposition then said, 'Well, this $70 billion is a fanciful figure; it's plucked from the air by government ministers, and I'm surprised you're retelling it to me.' Then on cue the shadow finance minister said, 'Oh, it's not a furphy. We came out with that figure, right?' That is the $70 billion black hole that they have to fill. We have the same shadow finance minister saying, 'I've got on my desk 49 policy documents with covers, narrative, a list of policies and the costings.'                 The truth is that they want to conceal the costings. They will not go to the Parliamentary Budget Office. I will tell them what they can do. They can go down to Aussies, get a cream bun, get a cup of coffee and get the costings done, all for $10. They will not go anywhere reputable to get those costings, because they know that they will set up an audit commission and inflict on Australia the savage cuts that Campbell Newman, Ted Baillieu, Barry O'Farrell and all of their Liberal crony mates have inflicted on this country.

  I thank the honourable member for her question. The question goes to an invitation from an organisation known as HUT for a conference that was held yesterday. HUT has not been proscribed in Australia and nor has it been proscribed in the United States or the United Kingdom.                     When the honourable Manager of Opposition Business asks why it has not been proscribed, he might want to check with the honourable member for Berowra, who said in 2007, when he was Attorney-General, that it should not be proscribed.                 The situation is that this entry permit was issued in accordance with the normal procedures for British nationals. I refer the honourable member to the normal procedures that apply. This individual was not on the movement alert list because he is not speaking at an organisation that is proscribed in Australia, and nor is it proscribed in like-minded countries, for the reasons very eloquently put by former Attorney-General the member for Berowra.

  I thank the member for Bass for that important question, because we do have significant challenges in the global economy. We have many European countries in recession and we have weak growth in the United States. And, of course, many developed countries across the world are not back to where they were prior to the global financial crisis. That means very high levels of unemployment right across developed economies.                 I think everybody in the House can take heart from developments in the international economy over the past four or five days. We have seen the intervention of the ECB in Europe, which was certainly welcome - the intervention by Mario Draghi - and we have seen the decisions in the United States for QE3. I think we can take some heart from those announcements, which will simply support global growth.                 But we are not immune from challenges in the global economy. One thing that has strengthened our economy has been the decisive action taken by this government, in the face of the global financial crisis and the global recession, to support jobs and support small business in the Australian economy. So, we have not suffered the capital destruction and the closures of the small businesses that we have seen in other developed economies, and we have of course had very strong employment growth.                 Those actions were opposed by those opposite. They opposed the support we put in place for our economy to support small business and employment. We know that the Leader of the Opposition actually slept through the critical vote during that period, showing you the values that he brought to that debate: the lack of concern for skills, the lack of concern for jobs and the lack of support for a strong community.                 Since that time we have put in place savings in our budget of $130 billion to bring the budget back to surplus in 2012-13 and to make room for our priorities. It has been all about the values that we on this side of the House hold to support communities, small business and jobs. We believe that everyone in this country must have a say in our prosperity and a stake in our prosperity into the future.                 The values of those opposite are entirely different. We have seen in the past week or two a sneak preview of what an Abbott government would do in this country if it were in charge.                     I was also asked about domestic fiscal policy. We have put in place responsible savings built on our values. Those opposite have an entirely different set of propositions which are built on their values. Their values are ones which take the axe to essential services in health and education, slashing employment in a savage way, particularly in my home state of Queensland - 14,000 people hit immediately. We have seen it again today in their proposal to get rid of the Queensland Reconstruction Authority, a vital element of flood recovery in the great state of Queensland.

  I certainly welcome the question, but I am sure it is not welcomed by the member for Wentworth. The fact is we have seen the opposition come in here week in and week out making all sorts of inaccurate claims about the impact of a carbon price, whether it is on electricity bills or anything else. We know that electricity prices in this country have increased by about 50 per cent in the past four years without a carbon price. Depending on where you are, we know that has substantially come from decisions taken by state governments, particularly their overinvestment in poles and wires. Of course, we never hear about that. In my home state of Queensland, dividends taken out of the system by the Queensland government are responsible for something like $400 in every bill for every household.                 We know the opposition are running out of steam when it comes to their scare campaign about carbon pricing. We have not been getting quite the same volume of questions that we were getting before. The sky has not fallen in. Central Queensland has not been wiped off the face of the map.                     I am referring to the carbon price and the fact that the overall impact of the carbon price is 0.7 per cent, less than 1c in every dollar. The government have been up-front. We indicated what the impact would be on household electricity bills. We said all of those things, but that did not stop those opposite coming into the House and predicting doom and gloom. They said it was going to be a wrecking ball; it was going to wreck the economy. That has not happened. They have been walking back from that week after week. You can see the air coming out of that fear campaign. You can see it virtually evaporating, much to the chagrin of all of those opposite.                     Not even the Leader of the Opposition now believes his own scare campaign. Those opposite do not believe it any longer. So we can continue to get these questions with exaggeration and all of the hype, but it is not true and nobody is buying it any more.

  I thank the member for Page for her question. She knows that we have already committed some $4.1 billion to the Pacific Highway, which compares to the $1.3 billion over double the time - 12 years - that the Howard government committed. In addition to that, in the recent budget we allowed for $3.56 billion to be put on the table for the full duplication of the Pacific Highway by 2016 based upon a matching commitment from New South Wales, which was both the timeline of 2016 that the Howard government put and also the funding model that the Howard government put when the National Party had ministers. Over the weekend the federal coalition gave the state coalition, their mates in Macquarie Street, the green light to abandon the 2016 timeline. They have deferred the full duplication to beyond the current decade. Indeed, when they were in government, they said the opposite. They said the Pacific Highway was a state road and they called for the New South Wales Labor government to do more. The member for Cowper had this to say: 'It's a state road. New South Wales refused to commit one extra dollar of state government funding to a road they are responsible for.' The state coalition was saying the same thing: 'Yes, I will match that money,' said Duncan Gay, 'and save the lives of people in New South Wales that have to use this highway.'                 On the weekend, the member for Wide Bay made an announcement about how they were going to take the allocated money from the Parramatta to Epping rail link that had been pushed back for two years because of the inaction of the state government. They said that that would enable them to fully duplicate the highway and meet the target of 2016. There is only $67.9 million available under the Parramatta-Epping rail link between now and 2016. So they push it out beyond 2020, and, in spite of that, they are still half a billion dollars short because of the failure of the state government to honour the commitments that they made in the 2011 election campaign.                  Right now today there are over a thousand people working up and down the Pacific Highway. When we had the economic stimulus plan we put money into fully, 100 per cent funded projects such as the Kempsey bypass to make sure we could get it done. Those opposite have given a green light for New South Wales to abandon their commitment to this highway and at the same time they have walked away from the provision of infrastructure into public transport.

  I certainly thank the member for that question because, like many members of this House, I have been a long-term believer in putting a price on carbon and doing that through an emissions trading scheme. Of course, that was the policy of the previous, Howard government, and it is the approach of every living Liberal leader. It was also the approach of the current Leader of the Opposition and it all changed when he got rid of the member for Wentworth.                     I am, Madam Deputy Speaker. We have put a price on carbon to drive investment in particular in renewable energy. We have put in place a range of supports, particularly for trade exposed industries, and also for households. In terms of the impact on households, it has gone through the system, as the Treasury modelling said it would. I have not seen any particular amount or bill that the member is talking about. But if he is true to form with all the exaggeration that we have seen previously, it will simply be incorrect yet again.                 Obviously the opposition has decided today that they want to resurrect their fear campaign. They can do that. But the truth is that the introduction of a price on carbon has gone very smoothly in our economy. The consequence of that will be that we will get a price on carbon. We will drive the investment in renewable energy. It will secure prosperity for the future. It will mean that we will continue to grow and to create jobs. A prosperous economy in the 21st century has got to be one which is driven by renewable energy. A price on carbon is for the long-term good of this country and it does not matter how much those opposite run a fear campaign; its introduction is there for all to see and it is not having the impact that those opposite have been claiming. We have not seen Whyalla wiped from the map, we have not seen the destruction of the Central Queensland coalfields - we have not seen any of those outcomes. We have not seen the wrecking ball through our economy. Those opposite now simply have no political strategy whatsoever.                 Leave not granted.

  I thank the member for New England for the question. The member for New England was involved in the negotiations right from the beginning on the establishment of the independent expert scientific committee. As members would know who have dealt with the water area - in particular, the member for Wentworth - there is a great level of complexity when you are dealing with underground water as to the extent to which you have connectivity to both surface water and underground water often in very different areas. The science on this requires significantly more work and, for that reason, an independent committee was established and extraordinarily well funded.                 I find it extraordinary that those opposite would view the campaigns on coal seam gas and concerns about water as being run purely by GetUp. If they met one or two farmers they might take a broader view. The member for New England knows too well the concerns in the lead-up to the New South Wales election about wanting to determine whether or not prime agricultural land was to be protected in some way. We eventually had the announcement of a policy from the New South Wales government - one of the governments that had signed up to use the independent expert committee. Both farmers groups and conservation groups have complained fairly strongly that it has fallen a long way short of the expectations that they had. There is some additional land which arguably has been set aside for agricultural use in the Hunter, and some in new England as well, but it is way short of the expectations that were given in advance of the election.                 The part of the process that New South Wales has announced will interact with the independent expert scientific committee is what is known as their gateway process. The gateway process used to have an exceptional circumstances clause but that clause is now gone. So all large coal and coal seam gas projects in New South Wales will have to go through the gateway process. It involves an expert panel and it is at that point that the independent expert scientific committee will plug its information into the New South Wales process. So there is a direct pathway for the national partnerships that were established and expected.                 The states involved on national partnerships at the moment are Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia. It is largely irrelevant to Tasmania; Western Australia has refused to be part of it; and the Northern Territory is still in negotiations. Ultimately what is behind all of this is to acknowledge that, on underground water, we potentially have very serious environmental and agricultural issues at stake. It is not enough to simply expect decisions to be made on data which has not been fully research. Rather - and the member for New England has been entirely involved with this -  - it is better to make sure that the scientific work is done, that it is done independently, and that it is well funded.

  I thank the member for Petrie for her question and, in particular, for her advocacy for people with disability and carers in her part of Brisbane. I know that she is campaigning hard to make sure that people in Queensland with a disability and their carers and families get a fair go. Of course, that is exactly what this government is determined to do. We are determined to build a National Disability Insurance Scheme. The Treasurer announced in this year's budget an extra $1 billion so that we can start the National Disability Insurance Scheme from July next year. We have done this with the agreement of New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Tasmania and the Australian Capital Territory - but not Queensland.                 What this government also realises is that we have got a lot of work to do in the meantime. We are delivering additional support for people with disability and their carers. Since 2007 we have delivered $800 million for disability care and support in Queensland alone. What we of course have also done is deliver to the 35,000 carers in Queensland extra income support, to the 150,000 Queenslander with disabilities we have also delivered an increase to their disability support pension. Of course at the same time that the Queensland government is slashing and burning and cutting grants to community sector workers, cutting grants to many organisations that people depend on in Queensland, we are seeing 385 staff lose their jobs in the community services sector alone in Queensland. And while this is all happening of course we have the shadow treasurer saying that he thinks all of these cuts are courageous. We have Senator Joyce saying that he backs Campbell and these cuts 100 per cent.                     I was also asked about challenges. The biggest challenge sits right opposite, because when you were in government you were the ones that cut disability care and support funding so that people with disability found their care and support disappear when you were in government.

  If there have been unjustified price increases, they should be referred to the ACCC. Because, as I have said before, the overall impact on the economy is 0.7 per cent, less than one cent in the dollar. Yes, it does have a more significant impact on electricity. But, overall, in terms of our economy, price rises of that magnitude should be referred to the ACCC.

  I want to thank the member for Blair for his question. The member understands what it means to have a strong and vibrant health system. In his electorate recently, we have just committed $21 million for a new cancer centre in Springfield. I was up there in Blair recently with the member for Blair and the member for Oxley, not just looking at the site of the new Springfield cancer centre but also meeting with the West Moreton-Oxley Medicare Local that are delivering much better primary health care services in the areas represented by the member for Oxley and the member for Blair - better allied health, better extended hours GP services and better mental health, all on the ground up there.                 All over Australia families like those families in Blair and in Oxley can see that our agenda is making real differences to their lives - investing and improving, in contrast with the slashing of services that we are seeing from state governments. We are graduating more doctors and more nurses - a thousand extra nurses a year, and 6,000 extra doctors over a decade - in contrast to the slashing of GP training places and the shortages that were left by the Leader of the Opposition when he was health minister. There are record bulk-billing rates versus record low bulk-billing rates. In contrast to our $20 billion investment into hospitals, $1 billion was cut by the Leader of the Opposition when he was the health minister.                 The contrast is a stark one. I know that it upsets those opposite to have these issues raised. The dental scheme that we have introduced into the parliament just recently includes $4.1 billion to be spent on better dental care for 3.4 million Australian children, better investment in the dental care of adults, and about $1.5 billion extra for public dental care. Those opposite are saying, 'Where does it come from?' Yes, we will close the chronic disease dental scheme, because it is a rorted scheme. It is a scheme that was supposed to cost $90 million a year that was costing $80 million a month. It is a rorted scheme.                     The contrast in Queensland: dentists sacked in the Brisbane Dental Hospital, dental services downgraded at the Royal Children's Hospital, and $1.4 million cut from the metro health oral budget. And, do you know what? The Leader of the Opposition says Campbell Newman has his full support. The shadow Treasurer: 'Campbell Newman has my full support.' Barnaby Joyce: Campbell has his full support. Three billion dollars was cut from the New South Wales health budget, and the shadow health minister loves -

  I am very happy to take that question from the member for Cook. It goes to my powers under the Migration Act in relation to the character test and the public-interest test. In relation to that test I refer the honourable member to my previous answer, which outlined the fact that this is not a proscribed organisation. In relation to the views of that individual, every member of this House would have very strong views about the position taken by that individual.                     In relation to the minister's personal powers, these are to be exercised appropriately and carefully. For the information of the House, I have personally considered the character test on 38 occasions during my time as minister for immigration and on 27 of those occasions I have taken the decision to cancel or refuse a visa. It is a parallel exercise with due care and diligence and the member for Cook might like to get a reminder from the member for Menzies about what happens when a minister does not do that.

  I thank the member for Banks for his question. In the investment that the Gillard Labor government has provided in his electorate he can see some 107 projects benefiting 46 schools with seven libraries, 22 classrooms, and 5,000 computers delivered. And Riverwood Public School and Sir Joseph Banks High School being involved in the Smarter Schools National Partnerships.                 And we continue that investment in schools around Australia because we know that the future prospects of Australian schools are dependent on the investment that they get and on the policies in place to lift education outcomes, support teachers in the classrooms and make sure that principals have got more opportunities and autonomy to lead their schools. And we understand that the link - the connection - between education and a strong economy and a fairer society is an absolute one. That is why we have a National Plan for School Improvement so that all kids can get a good education. Because if kids get a good education now then they get a good job in the future. And we want to put Australian schools in the world's top five. And under our plan all schools will see their funding rise; no school will see funding cut and no school will see funding frozen.                  Is there a challenge to this particular commitment? Yes. We see what happens when the Liberal Party is in charge of education budgets - and nowhere more clearly than in New South Wales, where there has been $1.7 billion worth of cuts identified by Premier O'Farrell; 1,000 jobs to go; funding freezes for non-government schools; 800 job losses for TAFE; TAFE fees going up: cuts to the tune of $1.7 billion.                 If we look across the landscape of coalition states and we see the same thing happening. What comes on the chopping block? - health and education. This is a taste of what is likely to come at the next election - certainly if the federal Liberal Party should prevail at that election. On top of the existing $2.8 billion in cuts that we have underway already, we also saw this weekend the member for Sturt, the shadow opposition spokesman, completely exposed on how he would grow school funding. Up to this point in time he has said that he would provide school funding increases to six per cent.                  And now what he is saying is that he will only apply it to the level of the flawed funding model of the Howard government at 3.9 per cent under the AGSRC. So he has betrayed the non-government schools that he was promising would get a six per cent increase by going back on his word. And the impact of any coalition government in this place is not only to have $2.8 billion worth of cuts but to be committed to a funding system  which would see funding for all schools go down over time.                  Leave not granted.                      I withdraw.

  I thank the honourable member for his question. Such is his interest in this matter that he wrote to me on Thursday and, funnily enough, he also released details to the journalists in the press gallery at a very similar time as writing to me. Such is his public interest concern in this particular case.                 In relation to my powers under the character test and the public interest test I will conduct myself in the same way as I have in the other 38 cases that I have personally considered and I will -                      I conduct myself in relation to the character test in accordance with my responsibilities under the act. To do otherwise would be to open the Commonwealth to potential overturning of the decision and a potential very serious compensation case, as the honourable member for Menzies well remembers.

  I thank the member for Parramatta for her question. She is a very effective voice for the people of western Sydney in this place. As she knows, this government has delivered several rounds of tax cuts because we want to give hard-working families and businesses the chance to get ahead. We have provided $47 billion worth of tax cuts, with the latest round of these tax cuts coming into effect on 1 July this year. And, of course, we have delivered $2 billion worth of tax relief to small businesses, through the instant asset write-off. And we have done all of this at a time that we have been handing down a budget that returns our budget to surplus ahead of every other major advance economy in the world.                  Australia's tax-to-GDP ratio was at record high levels when the previous government were in office. The tax-to-GDP ratio, which of course is the amount of tax collected as a proportion of the economy, hit record high levels under the former government. At the moment, it is at 22.1 per cent, which is lower than at any point under the previous government. In fact, if Australians were paying the same rate of tax today as they were when the previous government was in office, they would be paying an extra $24 billion in tax every year.                 But of course the Liberals have no interest in genuine tax relief. They have opposed nine tax cuts to families and to small businesses, including a cut in the company tax rate. Not only did they oppose the cut in the company tax rate but they want to increase taxes for companies. Several thousand businesses will be slugged with an increase in tax of 1½ per cent to fund their paid parental leave scheme. In doing so, consumers will all be hit at the checkouts with higher prices.                 We see on the weekend that their colleague in New South Wales, Premier O'Farrell, is now talking about jacking up the GST. Of course, this was not an isolated incident; it came in response to an invitation he received from the member for North Sydney. The member for North Sydney in July said:                 If you are going to have a discussion about changing the GST the states have to lead the argument because they are the ones that need the revenue.                   Premier O'Farrell has responded on cue. He came out on the weekend suggesting that we should increase the GST. We know that will be welcomed by those opposite, but if you want to increase the GST there are only two ways you can do it. You either jack up the rate or you take away the exemptions. We all know the biggest exemption is on fresh food. So they either want to jack up the rate of GST, extending it to fresh food, or have a look at what the other exemptions are. The two other biggest exemptions are health and education services. It is not bad enough they want to rip money away from these services - now they want to hit them with the GST. We all know they believe it should be a tax that applies to everything; now they want to do that.

  I understand the question and the reason that it has been asked but, consistent with longstanding practice, I obviously would not comment on individual security advice that we are given. I can confirm to the House a matter that I think the immigration minister was trying to make clear over the cacophony that was coming from the other side. There are of course two different issues that are being addressed here. One is the proscription of terrorist organisations, of which there are 17 in this country. There is a very detailed process which is gone through. It is an important factor that people should be aware of, and it is a matter that I think it is important that people understand. That process needs to be gone through - both in consultation with the states, it is acted on in particular advice -                      The point that I was going to go on to make is that obviously, if people are in any way involved with organisations that are on that proscription list, there are certain processes that are gone through which would have an impact on the way a discretion was exercised by a minister.                     The minister himself has already answered the question with regard to the requirements under the immigration act, and, having been on the receiving end of quite a number of actions -                      Having been on the receiving end of complaints that are made against the Commonwealth when action is not taken appropriately, in accordance with those legislative requirements, one of the unfortunate jobs that Attorneys-General have is to mop up mistakes that are made when people do not fit an act within the requirements of legislation. We have spent plenty of time doing that for decisions taken by those opposite and we do not intend to do that again.

  I want to thank the member for Wills for the question. The member for Wills is one of the first members of the parliament to express particular high levels of concern about wanting to make sure that our fishing remains sustainable.                 Of course, he was reflecting views that have been described by those opposite as only coming from environment groups. Nothing could be further from the truth. There has been no group making more noise in respect of this issue than recreational fishers. Recreational fishers have been responding loudly and strongly with two messages. Firstly, they want to make sure that in the years to come we have not overfished the stock. They want to make sure that they and their kids and grandkids can continue to catch fish in the same numbers that they can now. The second message that has come in response to the government's action is a genuine level of shock that an opposition which campaigned as through it were the friend of recreational fishing has gone missing on this issue and has actually become the chief opponent of a recreational fishing campaign. Recreational fishers have discovered, without any doubt, that those opposite stand against them when it comes to what happens 5½ kilometres from shore. They might be friends if there is a zone 400 kilometres away, but if it is as soon as you reach Commonwealth waters, those opposite and recreational fishers stand opposite each other, opposing each other, every step of the way in this debate.                 This legislation is now being dealt with in the Senate. It was delayed for an hour while opposition speakers debated for an hour whether or not they had time to debate it in the Senate, but then, having done that, the debate commenced. After question time the debate in the other place will continue. I certainly hope that they reach a conclusion in that debate today, because we want to be in a situation where the law is proclaimed and we want to be in a situation where the government is able to action the new laws and the new legal powers which it makes available.                 On proclamation of this legislation I will be using the legal authority made available to me and to the fisheries minister to be able to conduct the scientific research, which I wanted to be able to conduct, before conditions were put in place. In any other area of environmental law you can do it. In any other area of environmental law, if the information is not there, you can make sure that the studies are done before the decision has to be made. Until this law is through, you cannot do that and you do not have those same powers with respect to fisheries. This government makes no apologies for wanting to have a highly precautionary level of care when it comes to our oceans. Those opposite might be able to turn a blind eye to these issues, but we will not.

  I sincerely thank the Deputy Leader of the Opposition for her question. It goes to the activities and steps taken by the Howard government in relation to Hizb ut-Tahrir. That was the question put to me - about the approach taken by the Howard government. These are issues that have received some public attention in the past. For example, on 29 January, 2007, on the John Laws program, these issues were given some public airing. Somebody very eloquently put the case about why Hizb ut-Tahrir had not been proscribed and why -                      The Deputy Leader of the Opposition went to the 'very strong approach' taken by the Howard government in relation to this. On 29 January 2007 somebody very eloquently put the case as to why people who are guest speakers of Hizb ut-Tahrir or members of Hizb ut-Tahrir would not automatically be denied a visa. The speaker said this:                 _ because there is often a thin line between stupid extravagant language and language which is deliberately designed to incite violence or to bring about violence or to threaten the security of a country _ and people can say a lot of ridiculous things and they should be able to say ridiculous things in a democracy.                 Well said, John Howard! He defended why Hizb ut-Tahrir was not proscribed and why guest speakers were allowed in. He was referring to a particular case. It is well known that I have been critical of my predecessor, the member for Menzies, in relation to his ham-fisted dealings with the character test of Mohamed Haneef which resulted in hundreds of thousands of dollars of compensation being paid.                     Madam Deputy Speaker, the question goes to precedents and how these matters should be handled. I am going to give credit to the member for Menzies because he too has had to consider some of these matters. When he was asked why he agreed to Mr Yusanto, a speaker from Hizb ut-Tahrir, being admitted to Australia he said, 'I am satisfied that all relevant checks were undertaken prior to the granting of Mr Yusanto's visa.' I table the letter from the member for Menzies when he was Minister for Immigration and Citizenship. The hypocrisy of the opposition is writ large for all to see.

  I thank the member for Robertson for that question. When the worst global financial crisis in 80 years hit this country we had a really stark choice. We could sit back and let employment, jobs and small business hit the wall or we could intervene and support our economy. Of course, on this side of the House we chose to support jobs, we chose to support small business and we chose to support our economy. The consequence of that has been that we were one of the few advanced economies in the world that was not hit by recession and we did not suffer the really high and prolonged unemployment that we are now seeing in many developed economies and the capital destruction, the destruction of small businesses, that we see elsewhere in the developed world.                 But of course those on that side of the House had a different set of values, a different set of priorities. They said that we should not act. They said that we should not do anything. They said we should let that force run right through our economy and cause all of that damage in our economy. What that demonstrates is the priority that we on this side of the House give to jobs but also the priority that we give to communities. We understand the importance of the 800,000 jobs that have been created in this country while Labor has been in power, when around the rest of the world something like 27 million jobs have been lost elsewhere.                 We also understood that when we moved to support our economy we would put in place strict fiscal rules to bring our budget back to surplus. Of course that involves difficult choices. But in making those choices we have always been guided by our values, guided by our priorities to support our communities and to support jobs.                 Of course we believe that everybody should have a say in our prosperity, and we should spread the benefits right around our community. But those on the other side of the House have a different set of priorities. They are sitting there now ticking off savage cuts in Queensland, with the loss of something like 14,000 jobs, and all of the damage that causes not just for those individuals but to the communities in which they live. I am pleased that the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations today has announced a package of measures to assist unemployed Queenslanders get back into work - a very important package.                 Because we have different values and we have different priorities from those on that side of the House, we will always try to build our community up by investing in skills, by investing in education. So I think there is a really stark choice in this House, between a Prime Minister and a Labor Party that are absolutely committed to investing in the future and the Tony Abbott that I know, who is completely stuck in the past - a choice between a Prime Minister who wants to build our nation up and the Tony Abbott that I know who wants to tear it down.

  This is another example of the old scare campaign that we have been seeing in this House for the past 12 months.                     You certainly have been making it up, and that has been proven. You have been in here day after day, week after week, exaggerating prices, exploiting households and businesses for your own political gain. It is just part -                      One of their favourite tactics has been to be misleading about electricity price increases and attribute the increases to the carbon price when in fact they go to other factors - overinvestment in poles and wires principally by state governments that are withdrawing huge dividends from those organisations at a cost to businesses and households in those states. But of course that is never, ever acknowledged by those opposite, because it is too inconvenient for their political purposes.                 But we all know that this scare campaign has hit the wall - we know that. We know it is running out of steam. We see the end of the campaign in the House, but it has run out of steam out there because those people out there living in the community are on to you. They understand that electricity price increases have principally been caused by other factors rather than by the carbon price.                 But also we have today this commentary from the Reserve Bank in the Reserve Bank minutes. It makes this point:                 Liaison suggested that the introduction of the carbon price had not yet had a significant effect on downstream price pressures -                      I see: it is still coming. It is not involved in that question over there. Okay, we get that! How does that work? The RBA continues:                 _ with only isolated examples of suppliers attributing price increase to the carbon price. There was no evidence that the carbon price had raised medium-term inflation expectations.                 Leave not granted.

  I would like to thank the member for Moreton for his question because he, like everyone on this side of the House, is committed to being a pro-jobs government. Yes, we are a government with a plan for jobs for all Australians. The reason why I say that we are a pro-jobs government is that since Labor has been elected 800,000 new jobs have been created - an enviable record anywhere in the industrialised world. Despite a soft labour market, we still have unemployment of 5.1 per cent. We have 462,000 apprentices and trainees - 462,000. That is something which everyone in this House should take pleasure in, because that is good for the nation.                 But the member for Moreton also said, 'What are we doing for good jobs?' I can assure members of the House that this is a government who support penalty rates in our system. We believe that low-paid Australians should be paid for working unsociable, un-family-friendly hours. When I look around the nation at we are doing for jobs, I look at the support that federal Labor gives to the car industry in Victoria. In Western Australia I look at the fact that we are building infrastructure for all our fly-in fly-out workers to get from Perth to the mines of Western Australia. In Tasmania, there is the NBN; in New South Wales, financial services; South Australia, the air warfare destroyers; and in Queensland we took the decision to back Queensland to rebuild.                 But the member for Moreton asked what alternative approaches there are. I think, members of the House, we need to have a conversation about Campbell, because Campbell Newman has a different approach to jobs. Just ask about BHP. Just ask Anglo and Rio what they think about the Queensland LNP jobs-killing royalties propositions that they are advancing.                     Poor old Clive Palmer! His money is not even welcome in the LNP anymore, because he is anti what is happening there.                  Then look at the public sector jobs - 14,000 jobs. The job of political leaders in Australia is not to take jobs away. That is why the federal government is stepping in. That is why we are doing no fewer than three extra jobs expos in Ipswich-Logan, Brisbane and Townsville. We are providing the workshops because there are 14,000 public sector workers who did nothing to deserve the tyranny of an LNP government - nothing at all!                 The question which also remains for the House is: is Campbell Newman the metaphorical conservative, lone gunman or does he in fact act in lock-step with those opposite? I think I would have to say that he does, because he shares one common attribute with other conservative governments and conservative oppositions: he has never seen a public servant that he did not want to sack. He has never seen a public sector worker that he does not blame for all the problems of Australia.                  What I know about workplace relations is that there is right way and there is a wrong way to do business -                      I withdraw. What I know about conservative political parties is that they have a hit list of no fewer than 80,000 public sector workers across Australia -

  I will be very brief, because I have dealt with this question on a number of occasions in the last couple of weeks. Those opposite continue to stand up and claim electricity price increases due to the carbon price which are simply untrue. What is worse about it is that they know it, but they continue to do it in this House, day in and day out - yet another demonstration of how all of those on that side of the House, led by the Leader of the Opposition, are in a constant war against the facts.                  What they have, however, is this aggressive campaign of misrepresentation, seeking to make a political point and to mislead the community. It has been going on for a long time, but it gets exposed further and further the longer it goes on. I thought everybody in this House did agree that the one thing we should do is reduce carbon pollution, and I thought that we had an understanding that at least we both had the same target.                 Of course, we have acknowledged that there will be a cost for consumers flowing from our package - something like $9.90 per household.                     These are the facts. The coalition plan would cost households $1,300, and they come in here and talk about the cost of living. The coalition plan will cost households $1,300 - that is a fact, and it is a very inconvenient fact for those opposite.                 We have put in place assistance to households and assistance to trade-exposed industries. We have done it to reduce carbon pollution. We have done it to ensure investment in renewable energy. We have done it so our economy can prosper in the future. And what we are seeing here is yet another example of how those on the other side of the House can do nothing other than be very aggressive and negative all of the time, with nothing positive to say about the future of the country, and that is why they have been exposed.                 Leave not granted.

  The member is absolutely correct to describe the importance of scientific research to our country, to our community and to our long-term economic prosperity. In this vein, the government has acted very swiftly and over a period of time to increase funding to scientific research and innovation. This financial year it is almost $9 billion, an overall increase of 35 per cent since 2007. Also, in terms of health and medical research, that funding has increased substantially since 2007, from $614.5 million in 2006-07 to $760.5 million in 2012-13. Of course, there has also been very substantial investment through the Health and Hospitals Fund and a number of other areas as well.                 What that effort does is reflect the importance that the government puts on scientific research. Of course, as we go through producing the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook, we will do that in line with the Charter of Budget Honesty and we will do it in line with all past practice, and I do not intend to pre-empt any decisions of MYEFO.

  I thank the member for Blair for his question. I know that the member for Blair is deeply concerned about the jump in the local unemployment rate in Ipswich, which he represents, from 4.7 per cent in July to six per cent in August. I also know that, like so many others in this place, he is deeply shocked at the severity of the numbers of workers that the Queensland state government has axed.                 Of course, it stands in stark contrast to this government's focus on employment and on increasing job security for Australian workers. On our side, our very hardworking MPs - and, I must say, particularly the representatives from Queensland - have urged us to step in and assist in their home state. That is a call that we are absolutely willing to heed. Today our government proudly announced an $850,000 support package to assist the 14,000 Queensland workers that have been coldly and cruelly sacked by Campbell Newman and his government.                 Members would be aware of the success of the government's jobs expos that we have been holding right around the country, which already, to this date, have seen over 21,000 Australians placed in jobs and back in the workforce. At 58 expos across Australia we have worked at a grassroots level to help Australia, to keep Australia working. I know at the Kurri Kurri smelter, when thousands of workers received the news of their impending redundancy, we did not turn our backs on them. Instead, we were prepared to stand alongside them, to work with their company. I had great pleasure in attending an expo with the Chief Government Whip that we organised where there were 6,400 jobs on offer for those workers.                 Similarly, we will not turn our back on the workers of Queensland. Instead, we have today announced that we will step in. We will provide additional expos.                 We will expand the jobs expo that we will be holding in Logan. We will add additional expos in both Brisbane and Townsville. We will work shoulder to shoulder with the people of Queensland to assist back into work those very people whose faith Campbell Newman has betrayed - the nurses, the hospital orderlies, the child protection workers, the school cleaners, the transit officers and so many more who have been stripped of their livelihoods by the LNP government in Queensland.                 Of course, we know that they are not alone because it is in the LNP DNA. We have seen the education cuts and the health cuts in New South Wales. We have seen the TAFE cuts in Victoria, and we have seen the South Australian Liberal opposition leader stand up and announce that 25,000 to 35,000 workers should be stripped of their jobs there.                 The Australian people have a very clear choice at the next election because standing up for ordinary Australians is what this government does.

  As I was indicating before, I do not rule anything in or out when it comes to budgets. That is the consistent approach of this government as it was the consistent approach of the previous government. I am delighted that the member has actually asked this question because I think everybody on this side of the House understands the importance of the early years agenda when it comes to education. We get education across the board. We understand that the early years are vital, and a good start in the early years of education is something on which you can build in the years of primary school and secondary school right through to tertiary education. The best possible start in life is absolutely critical in the early years. We back that up with a suite of policies, particularly from the department of families, which assist families with the early years. We understand the importance of early intervention strategies, particularly in those disadvantaged families around the country.                     As I indicated at the beginning, Madam Deputy Speaker, I do not rule anything in or out in the lead-up to a mid-year statement or to a budget. That was the question, and the question was also about the importance of the early years, which we take very, very seriously.                     Okay, they do not take it very, very seriously, so I will not talk about it.

  I thank the member for Capricornia for her very good question. Indeed, the scare campaign about a carbon price has hit a brick wall since 1 July. It has hit a brick wall as the reality has triumphed over the rhetoric. Prior to 1 July we were told that the sky was going to fall in. We were told that towns like Whyalla were going to be wiped off the map. I can inform the House, including the member for Rankin, that last Friday I flew over Whyalla on the way to Port Augusta, and it is still there. There is no crater in the ground. It is still there.                 Of course, there was also Gladstone. In Gladstone on 11 March the Leader of the Opposition stood next to the member for Flynn and said that the price on carbon would - and I quote, 'turn places like this into a ghost town'. That is what we were told about Gladstone. Whyalla would be wiped off the map, and Gladstone would be turned into a ghost town. Let's have a look at the reality post 1 July. Pre 1 July - chaos; post 1 July - reality. Last week Qantas announced - and remember Regional Airlines were supposed to be gone after 1 July - that they will begin direct services from Sydney to Gladstone from next year, from 2013. There will be 1,200 people flying between Gladstone and Sydney every single week. It is pretty odd behaviour to fly into a ghost town, but that is what they will be doing.                 What did the member for Flynn, who stood with the Leader of the Opposition at the about-to-become ghost town prior to 1 July, have to say about this announcement? On 13 September he welcomed it. He said: 'It was a big vote of confidence for our community.' So, prior to 1 July it is going to be a ghost town; after 1 July there is a big vote of confidence for the community. Far from being a ghost town, Gladstone is an economic powerhouse which will continue to contribute to our economy. There is $56 billion of investment in pre-LNG projects alone committed and planned in Gladstone.                 But the Leader of the Opposition will not let the facts get in the way. These, of course, are the people who went to the RSPCA and said that the puppies and kittens were in danger as well. That was my favourite part of the scare campaign. Well, the chickens are coming home to roost as it comes down to the reality of the carbon price. This is ridiculous rhetoric from those opposite.

  I thank the member for Solomon for that question because she has got a hide to ask it. If those on that side of the House had agreed with us nine months ago, we could have had offshore processing up and running nine months ago and it would have been a lot cheaper for our budget.                     Those on that side of the House have sought to politicise this issue and they have done so in a way which has caused great damage.                     This has done great damage because it has taken another nine months to get that done from the time that the minister for immigration made the offer to his counterpart on that side of the parliament. The consequence of that has been a pipeline of people wanting to come -                      We on this side of the House want to get outcomes in putting in place offshore processing. We have done everything we possibly can over the past nine months to get that in place. We were opposed every step of the way by those opposite. We have now got it up and running and that is very important. The cost to the budget will be accounted for in the mid-year budget update.

  I thank the member for that question. There are definitely challenges I can identify, particularly when we look at the impact of New South Wales government cuts on schools in her electorate like St John's Primary College of Riverstone. I want to table the Rouse Hill Times where principal Marian Bell says:                 I am concerned what will happen to a little school like St John's _ I am also worried about the school's extra curricular activities.                 Thankfully, they have the Labor member for Greenway to fight for that school because all the state Liberal member could say was:                 I know there will be in impact on the schools and families. It is up to the school system to decide if they have to have cuts in their administration or their fees have to go up.                 What a Liberal Party choice. We do the building up in education and they do the tearing down. It is the same story in skills as well. We know that learning a trade has a big impact on a young person's employment prospects. Some 83 per cent of people with a certificate III or higher are employed compared with 57 per cent of those who leave school early. We also know that skills training is essential for our economy to grow. In New South Wales alone, we need an extra 320,000 trained workers by 2015. That is why this government is putting in place trade cadetships in the national curriculum. That is why this government is investing $2.5 billion in trades training centres and schools - you-beaut industry-standard facilities so that every secondary student in the country can start learning a trade while still at school. Of course, the opposition leader has promised to scrap trade training centres as part of his $2.8 billion in education cuts and it is the same story in TAFE and vocational training.                 We on this side are investing $9 billion for students to get the skills they need in the workforce whilst, at the same time, the New South Wales Liberal government is cutting 800 TAFE jobs and increasing fees by 9.5 per cent. Even the New South Wales MP for Penrith admitted to the Western Weekender that the cuts will have an impact on the delivery of TAFE programs. Just look to the north and there we have the LNP government in Queensland planning to close at least 38 of the state's 82 TAFE campuses. Every local and regional Queensland TAFE is on notice. Look south, down to Victoria, and the Victorian Liberal government is pledging $300 million in its first budget in cuts to TAFE. We have already seen campuses closing and courses closing. Just as it is in schools with the Liberal Party, it is in skills as well: we do the building up and all they want to do is cut it down.

  It gets better by the day! The shadow Treasurer has denied that we have made $130 billion worth of savings in the budget, even though it is in the budget. He now wants me to release all of the detail that was in the budget.                     Well, if I had the budget papers here, I would table them. I am happy to table them any time. But I think what this demonstrates is how sensitive those opposite are about the fact that they have a $70 billion crater in their budget bottom line. This is what the shadow Treasurer said on Sunrise: 'Therefore, finding $50, $60 or $70 billion is about identifying waste in areas' -                      Most certainly - I am dealing with savings and I am dealing with budget bottom lines. Of course, he was then contradicted by the shadow finance spokesman, who said that 'talk about this is fictional' on 16 March 2012. Well, it was not fictional, because this shows where he said it, on breakfast television, sitting beside the minister for the environment.                     So it is true.                     Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. Each year, under the Charter of Budget Honesty, we produce both a budget and a mid-year update which contain a consolidation of all of the decisions which have been taken by the government. Of course, when we do the mid-year update, our decisions will be there for all to see. All the previous decisions are in the previous updates and in the previous budgets. But what this is all about is the fact that they are very, very sensitive about the $70 billion crater in their budget bottom line.                     The shadow Treasurer was correct to say that over five budgets we have made $130 billion worth of savings, and of course we hope to make savings in the future. For example, the health minister is trying to get rid of the chronic disease scheme at the moment, because costs are blowing out - opposed by those opposite. The sorts of savings we have made have been to means test the private health insurance rebate - opposed by those opposite. As a consequence of their fiscal irresponsibility, they have a $70 billion crater in their budget bottom line, and that is why they are so sensitive about this matter. We on this side of the House will get on with putting in place our fiscal rules, doing the right thing by the country, keeping growth going and generating jobs, while those on the other side will continue to be negative, continue to try and tear our economy down and talk the place down all the time.

  I thank the member for Petrie for her very important question. I know she understands the really important role that emergency relief provides in her electorate and right across the country. That is why this government has almost doubled emergency relief funding since we came to office in 2007. Indeed, we are now providing more than $180 million over three years to community groups right across the country, to provide this valuable relief.                 Emergency relief assists people in financial crisis. It assists them with things such as vouchers for food, transport and medicines, part payment of accounts such as rent and utility bills and the provision of household goods, food parcels or clothing. I know that many members in this House really understand this important program and the assistance that it provides, because I have received many letters of support for this program from right across the House.                 In fact, one member of the House eloquently described the work of a group in his electorate in a letter in May, where he said: 'This program caters for clients who are particularly vulnerable and require referral and coordination of services plus assistance with practical needs such as food.' This, of course, was the member for Dawson, who was seeking funding for a particular organisation in his electorate. I can inform the member for Dawson that the government is providing almost $830,000 in emergency relief to the Mackay area for the next two financial years. Indeed, we are providing more than 152 contracts to emergency relief providers right across Queensland, providing more than $36 million in emergency relief over the next three years. And that is not counting the additional $1 million that we provided in emergency relief for flood affected Queenslanders, in light of their plight during the flood and recognising the assistance that they needed at that time.                 But now Queenslanders needing emergency relief have been left stranded by the Newman state government. As part of Campbell Newman's cuts, Queensland is now the only state in Australia not providing emergency relief to vulnerable people. In fact, my advice is that the Newman government will cut this emergency relief to the three biggest providers in Queensland by the end of this month and to all the other providers by the end of November. What does the Newman government plan instead? Well, the government's media release says:                 _ emergency relief will no longer be provided, however people in financial crisis will still be able to access emergency vouchers and assistance through the federally funded scheme.                 Cutbacks Campbell has become Pass-the-buck Campbell. What an outrageous shirking of his responsibility as a Queenslander. They are using every trick in the book. We know that the Leader of the Opposition and the Liberals support these cuts to vulnerable Queenslanders, because we know they would do the same if they ever got back into government.

  It is not very often that you get a Dorothy Dixer from the other side of the House, but it seems I have got one today. I table all the budgets produced by this government, with all the detail the shadow Treasurer is asking for. Secondly -                      Given that the shadow Treasurer said he had all his policies costed - although they are still hidden - I call on him to table them today.

  I thank the member for Parramatta for her question. This government is determined to keep our economy strong into the future and to ensure that we are able to provide support to hardworking Australian families, like those families in the electorate of the member for Parramatta in Western Sydney. That is why we have already delivered $47 billion of income tax cuts in the time we have been in office. That means that someone on an income of $50,000 is paying $40 a week less in tax under this government than they were under the previous government. We have delivered $2 billion worth of tax relief to small businesses with the instant asset write-off. We are also delivering in services. We are investing in health and education services through our health reforms and our new investments in dental health, and also by delivering the schoolkids bonus. And we are determined to implement our national plan for school improvement.                 These are the choices we have made as a Labor government, a government determined to run a tight budget and to take responsible savings measures. And what have we seen from those opposite? We heard from the member for Goldstein, in the Australian Financial Review just a few weeks ago, that he has a different approach to achieving savings. The member for Goldstein has said that he intends to save money by outsourcing education and health completely to the states. And haven't they been doing a good job of it! I am sure Australians all around the country are feeling very safe knowing that health and education would be completely in the hands of Premier O'Farrell and Premier Newman under a Liberal government.                 It is no wonder that the member for Goldstein would be suggesting that. With their $70 billion black hole, he has already indicated that they will have to sack whole departments - entire government departments. The member for North Sydney is looking into his papers sheepishly over there. He is the one who went on breakfast television and confirmed a $70 billion black hole. Just think about it for a minute. Do you really think Campbell Newman and Barry O'Farrell are going to gratefully accept all this additional responsibility - the outsourcing of education and health policy - without expecting anything in return? We all know what they want in return. Premier O'Farrell was out there on the weekend telling us. They want those opposite to jack up the GST. We know that the GST was the tax you introduced right from day one. You always wanted to put it on every single item. You wanted it to be a big tax on everything. And now that you have all these state Liberal premier mates in power you are working in collaboration, wanting to come back and have a second crack at it, to work together to try to make the GST a tax on everything.

  The figure that has been used by the Financial Review is wrong. It has no basis in reality. The only hole or crater in a budget bottom line is the $70 billion in the bottom line of those opposite. He has a lot of hide to come in here and ask us about tax. First of all, the Liberal Party is absolutely in favour of lifting the GST and broadening its base. That is point No. 1, made by the shadow Treasurer over there.                     This is what the shadow Treasurer had to say on 21 July:                 If you are going to have a discussion about changing the GST the states have to lead the argument _                 He is encouraging New South Wales and all his state colleagues to jack up the GST and campaign for it, whilst at the same time they are cutting services.                     Deputy Speaker, I was asked about taxation. He has a lot of hide coming into the House and lecturing about taxation when he has a proposal to put up the company tax rate by 1.5 per cent - that is their Coles and Woolies tax - and when the opposition has come into this House and opposed tax relief for 2.7 million small businesses. They voted against assistance to people on low incomes - 3.7 million of them - for their superannuation. They have also opposed the tripling of the tax-free threshold. That is where we stand when it comes to tax.                 For our part, what we have said is that we will behave in a responsible way. We will bring our budget back to surplus in 2012-13. We will make our savings in a responsible way, in a way that supports jobs and economic growth. That stands in stark contrast to the approach of those on the other side, who want to go out and take the axe to large slabs of health and education and sack workers - hell, west and crooked. There is a very clear contrast for all Australians to see, based on our values of supporting community and their approach, which is simply scorched earth.

  I thank the shadow Treasurer for that question, because we always have good conversations about good public policy in our caucus, and we certainly had a good discussion yesterday. I think everybody in our caucus is absolutely proud of the fact that Standard &amp; Poor's has reaffirmed our AAA rating - our gold-plated AAA rating - with a stable outlook. Think about that for a moment. There are only seven countries that have that rating.                     There was an interjection from over there saying, 'Thanks to the Howard government'. This is the first time in our history that we have had the AAA gold-plated rating from the three major rating agencies, not something achieved by those on that side of the House - never.                     I am directly answering the question, because our AAA rating goes to the core of our fiscal discipline, which has been recognised by the rating agencies - indeed, cited by the rating agencies for their reaffirmation of our gold-plated AAA rating. Those opposite do not even understand that most basic fact. When we moved to support our economy during the global financial crisis, to support jobs and small business, we put in place fiscal rules to bring our budget back to surplus when growth returned to trend. And that is what the government has been doing.                  During that time, based on our Labor values, we have found room for Labor priorities, such as paid parental leave and a big increase in the pension, by making savings. We have done all of that in the face of very large revenue write-downs, to the tune of $150 billion. We have done all of that and we will continue to adhere to our fiscal rules as we make room for Labor priorities. We have done the hard work to find the savings. But there we saw again this morning, once again on breakfast television - but this time he was on his own -                       I was asked about savings and I have said very clearly that the government will find the savings to fund Labor priorities. I am drawing the very clear contrast with the shadow Treasurer who, on breakfast television, admitted again this morning there was a $70 billion crater in the Liberal Party's bottom line.                     For our part, we in the government will continue to implement responsible fiscal policy, making the savings to fund Labor priorities in difficult environments, because that is what we do. We understand the importance of both good economic management and putting in place Labor priorities.

                     I thank the member for Greenway for her question, because a little bit earlier today the member for Greenway, the Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth and I, accompanied by a number of others - New South Wales Labor MPs - had the opportunity to meet with representatives from the Catholic schools sector and from independent schools.                    We had, in particular, the opportunity to discuss our plans for school improvement and our plans to ensure that a child's needs are put at the centre of our education funding system. We had the opportunity to talk about building our future by better investing in Australian schools. We particularly had the opportunity to meet with Bishop Anthony Fisher of Parramatta and representatives of New South Wales independent schools.                   Those representatives spoke to us of their concerns about the very negative impact that the cuts by the Liberal New South Wales state government will have on non-government schools. Indeed, Bishop Anthony Fisher was very clear about his concerns for the west of Sydney, particularly for smaller Catholic schools that are smaller now but destined to rapidly grow because of the growth in western Sydney and on whom these cuts will fall especially heavily. We talked about our determination, as representatives in this place, to work with Catholic and independent schools in New South Wales to campaign against these cruel cutbacks by the O'Farrell government.                   As Prime Minister and as someone who is very concerned about the future of education, I indicated to those representatives that we will not let Liberal government state cutbacks feed into the way in which we fund schools. At the moment, as result of the way school indexation is done, when Liberal governments cut, that feeds into federal government indexation rates. We will not allow that to occur. We will not allow the conduct of Premier O'Farrell and his Liberal mates around the country to drag down the investment of the federal government in schools around our nation. There could not be a clearer contrast in the approach that we take to education than this. We on this side of the House are passionate about creating opportunity and a better future for our children through a great education. The                    Liberal Party are proving, every day, around the country, that they stand for denying children that opportunity of a great education. They stand for cutting funding to schools.

  I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. I particularly thank him for referring to statements that I made earlier this year, because I would remind the Leader of the Opposition that at the start of this year as we came into this parliamentary year I said that the principal battle ground for this year would be on the economy - on jobs, on services and on the federal budget - and the ability to properly provision for the services and supports that families need. I am delighted, even though it has taken until September, that the Leader of the Opposition is finally coming to meet us on this battle ground of central concern to the Australian community.                 I am delighted that the Leader of the Opposition is now indicating by his conduct that at the centre of the political debate between now and 2013 and at the core of the election campaign in 2013 will be who is best -                      I am delighted that the Leader of the Opposition is now indicating that at the centre of the 2013 campaign will be who can best run the economy and who can best manage the federal budget. If that is to be the contest, we will be absolutely delighted. In that contest, what we will do every step of the way is continue to bring our Labor values to the choices that we make in the government budget. We are a government that has found $130 billion for savings in order to fund Labor priorities.                     We have as a government, across the budgets we have delivered, brought our Labor values to sometimes very tough choices.                     We have been prepared to make changes to the budget, savings in the order of $130 billion, in order to fund Labor priorities. We will continue to do that, continue to make the right choices, so that we can fund the National Disability Insurance Scheme, so that we can fund a better future for our children. I say to the Leader of the Opposition: what I can say for the government is, through MYEFO and through the budget and then through the process of the election campaign, we will publish all of the credentialled figures through Treasury. You will know where we stand and what we value from the figures that we make sure are checked and are right and are published.                 The Leader of the Opposition will not match that commitment. Having gone through the last election campaign and generated an $11 billion black hole, he stands today for $70 billion worth of cutbacks and he is on the run from revealing that truth. We will be very pleased to lay our values open for inspection. We stand by them and we are proud of them.

  I thank the member for Canberra for her question. The question relates to Afghanistan and recent ISAF operational directions. As the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition have reminded us in a different context earlier today, these ISAF directions - International Security Assistance Force directions - follow five terrible fatalities, so far as Australia is concerned, and three of those from so-called green-on-blue or insider incidents. Yesterday, we saw the last of those five funerals, for young Sapper James Martin in Perth.                  The first green-on-blue incident against Australia occurred more than 12 months ago and since that time we have been working very closely with General Allen, Commander ISAF, to improve the force protection mechanisms which apply in this area and to do everything we can to minimise the risk to Australian Defence Force personnel.                  Regrettably and terribly, we have seen in recent times a growing number of such incidents, directed, in the main, against United States and United Kingdom personnel but against ISAF generally. Since our own first terrible incident more than 12 months ago, we have enhanced our force protection measures and taken a range of steps to minimise the risk. We have worked closely with General Allen in that respect.                 In response to the terrible number of incidents recently and in response to heightened tensions as a result of the so-called Innocence of Muslims video, at the beginning of this week General Allen, Commander ISAF, issued a directive which does not have the effect, as I have seen reported, of ceasing all partnered operations between ISAF and the Afghan National Security Forces; it has the effect that partnered operations are now to be conducted at battalion or Kandac level, which is dealing with some 500 or 600 army personnel, and that below that level - for partnered patrols, for example - the approval of the relevant Regional Command commander is required.                 In Australia's case, in Uruzgan we are part of Regional Command South. So, to engage in partnered patrols we now need the approval of the regional commander. On Monday and Tuesday of this week, as a result of that directive, no joint patrols were conducted, because that is below Kandac level. Today in Uruzgan our commanders will be speaking with Kandac commanders about the plans that the Kandac commanders have for individual patrols so far as the ANA in Uruzgan is concerned, but also to now mount the case - to approach Regional Command South for permission - to resume joint patrols. I am not putting a timetable on that. That will be an operational matter. In the meantime, all of the commanders have been asked to review force protection measures and to minimise risk against these so-called insider incidents.                 As transition proceeds it will be the case, in the not too distant future, that it will be the Afghan National Army itself who will be conducting patrols by themselves as Australia and the International Security Assistance Force essentially retreat to an adviser role. In the meantime, our judgement of transition is that we continue to progress. It is, of course, continuing to be a difficult and dangerous circumstance and I know the ADF -

  I thank the shadow minister for his question, because I made the point before that we will go about, in the preparation of our mid-year update - as we do through the normal budget process - putting in place the savings that are required to fund our priorities, and, in particular, putting in place economic settings which will ensure growth and making sure we do the most we possibly can to generate growth and to support jobs in our economy. That is all the more important because of the savage cuts that are going on across the eastern seaboard by conservative governments, who are hacking into jobs. That is not good for many families and the peace of mind of regional communities in this country.                      So, as we go through the preparation of MYEFO, we will do the normal thing that we always do, which is to find savings. We will do that in a responsible way. That will contrast, I think, quite markedly with those opposite, because what we will do, as we go about that, is adhere to the Charter of Budget Honesty. We will do that in the mid-year update as we will do it in the budget next year. And there will be a very clear contrast -                      As I said, I think, in the House yesterday - and I will say it again today - as we go through the preparation of the mid-year update, we will find the savings that are required to make sure there is room for our priorities. As we go through that, we do not provide a commentary on any allegation made by anybody, wherever they come from - least of all from those opposite. This was the practice of the previous government as well, so there is absolutely nothing unusual about that. But we do know a bit more about budget craters. As we can see here, we had the shadow Treasurer, on breakfast television with the minister for the environment, admit a $70 billion crater.                      There was a repeat performance this morning on breakfast television. There is a $70 billion crater. So they can huff and they can puff but they are not going to blow their crater away.

  I thank the member for Kennedy for that question. I have to say I thought it was some sort of sick joke when I read in the Queensland budget papers that they intended to abolish the Reconstruction Authority. There has been a very substantial commitment to the rebuilding of Queensland made by the Commonwealth, particularly tropical North Queensland - well over $1 billion.                 I have been up there on many occasions with the member for Kennedy and I know he has worked his guts out getting around those communities, working out what needs to be done, trying to ensure that it is done promptly and trying to ensure that the guidelines that the Commonwealth has put in place are adhered to, particularly by the state authorities but also by the councils. So I take this matter very, very seriously - in particular the matter at Mission Beach, where we are trying to provide an all-weather safe harbour. We have allocated $5.5 million towards the planning and construction of an all-weather boating facility. That is really important up there for that local economy and it is certainly very important for safety. Enormous damage was done to industry in that area - to rural industry on the one hand and the tourist industry on the other. So we take this very seriously and we will do everything within our power to ensure that that money is correctly spent there at Mission Beach.                 The broader question of other areas and other harbours is much more difficult, and I cannot say I can give him at this stage any great comfort about that because they are very difficult challenges. What I can assure him of is the absolute determination of the Gillard Labor government to ensure that the money that is provided to Queensland is properly and correctly spent to the benefit of Queenslanders and in particular to the benefit of all of those people that live in tropical North Queensland.                 When we look at the proposal to abolish the Reconstruction Authority, I guess that it will be another one of those slash-and-burn proposals that the Leader of the Opposition gives a very big tick to, because he has given a big tick to making very big cuts in terms of jobs, in terms of health and in terms of education. But all of us on this side of the House do understand the importance of the rebuild in Queensland. We understand the damage done in particular to the Queensland economy and also to the Australian economy. Unlike those opposite we do not pretend that it did not happen. We understand the damage that was done and we have backed it with a lot of cash to support Queenslanders who had great need during that period. We will continue to do that and to do absolutely everything we can to ensure that our money is spend correctly by local authorities and by the state government.

  I thank the member for Robertson for her question. As the Prime Minister said, we met here today with members from the non-government schools sector of New South Wales and with caucus members from New South Wales as well. The community values the support that is provided to schools in funding, and the New South Wales Liberal government's cuts to schools mean things like fees going up, class sizes increasing and curriculum options narrowing. We heard that when we met today, and those views have been echoed by principals, teachers and parents around New South Wales. Listen to what the Principal of St Felix Primary School in south-west Sydney said: 'We have students with very specific learning needs. The withdrawal of state funding will be devastating to our families.' The executive director of Catholic schools in Parramatta said to the Rouse Hill Times that the cuts represent:                 _ betrayal by a government which has shown a lack of understanding of what is needed to deliver quality learning and teaching in today's world.                 That understanding is completely absent.                 But of course the New South Wales Liberal government's cuts do not just hit the non-government schools; they hit support for government schools, they hit school front-office staff, and they hit TAFE students by increasing their fees and sacking teachers. And this is after the Gonski review told us that we need to be investing in more support, that we need to be providing our students with more opportunities. Instead, the New South Wales Liberals have gone the other way.                 In this House, federal New South Wales state MPs have gone into bat for their schools against the New South Wales government cuts. They introduced a private member's motion so that we can debate those cuts. So I think it is time for the Leader of the Opposition to move on from the end-of-the-world sound bites and come in and make a contribution to this debate, because it is clear that these types of cuts from state coalition governments are a curtain raiser to what the opposition leader has in store if he should win at the next election.                 Again, on ABC 24, the member for North Sydney confirmed the Liberal Party's $70 billion black hole. So how will the opposition leader fill it? What is he going to do? As he said to the press this morning:                 _ I respect the job that they're -                  the Liberal Premiers are -                  doing. I work closely with them as far as I can. But they are dealing with their problems at the state level and I will seek to deal with federal problems at our level.                 You talk about code for what is going to happen - that is open-source code. This is plainly saying that the same savage cuts to health and education that we have seen in Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria will be visited upon us in this House if the Leader of the Opposition should ever occupy the Treasury bench. He has already promised $2.8 billion in cuts - cuts to teachers training, cuts to computers and cuts to school facilities, and we know he wants to cut more. How is he going to cut more? It will be in education and health.

  I thank the member for his question. Firstly, I would say to the member that I think it is very important that in this place we do not talk down the fundamental strength of the Australian economy. I would remind the member that our budget forecasts are predicated on the basis that commodity prices would peak during 2011. So we understood, in preparing the budget, that the commodity price peak part of the resources boom was being reached but we also understood that we were going to see increasing export volumes and that we were seeing an investment pipeline of $500 billion with more than $200 billion of it at an advanced stage.                 Yes, when we look at the Australian economy today, we can look across the range of indicators about the health of the economy whether we are looking at growth, whether we are looking low inflation, whether we are looking at low interest rates or whether we are looking at an unemployment rate of just over five per cent, which around most of the world people would look at as a remarkable result. Imagine some of those towns in America and the circumstances of unemployment there. Imagine what is happening Spain and much of Europe and what is happening in the United Kingdom. So it is inappropriate and wrong for members of the opposition to come into this parliament and talk the Australian economy down.                     I was pointing out it was a question the sole purpose of which was to create fear and concern about the Australian economy. That is not appropriate conduct by the shadow minister for finance. It is not appropriate conduct by the opposition leader but it fits in with their relentless negativity - that is for sure.                 On budget forecasts, as the member ought to recall from his time in government, the way in which this works is budget forecasts are updated in the Midyear Economic and Fiscal Outlook, they are updated again in the budget and then, moving into the election, they will be updated in the pre-election fiscal outlook. And every step of the way we will engage in properly funded, properly costed policies, whereas the member who asked the question, who has acknowledged he has to cut $70 billion out of services for families, is trying to cover that up. Over here, we will make sure the Australian people have all of the information they need. If we are going to have this fiscal debate then the member should come to the dispatch box and should say he is prepared to get the opposition's policies properly costed; otherwise, why would anybody take him seriously?

  I thank the member for Petrie for her question because she understands that a healthy, modern democracy needs more than just a parliament and courts to protect the rights of citizens; it needs also a vigorous civil society, a free press, independent trade unions and a vibrant not-for-profit charity sector which is free to do its good work and to speak up without fear or favour for those who often do not have a voice themselves to do so.                 This freedom is under attack in Queensland. Campbell Newman has introduced clauses into Queensland government contracts with not-for-profits and with charities that prohibit them from speaking up about government policy - and even prohibit them from including links on their websites to other organisations that might be doing so. The clause is well known in the not-for-profit sector as a gag clause.                 An especially bizarre feature of this gag clause in Queensland is that, not only are these organisations prohibited from talking about Queensland government policy; they are also prohibited from talking about Commonwealth government policy. I can tell the House that the Commonwealth government did not seek this protection from Campbell Newman. I don't need it. I'm pretty sure the Minister for Health doesn't need it. I'm absolutely sure the Minister for Disability Reform doesn't need it. And nor do we want it, because not only are gag clauses fundamentally antidemocratic, they are also just weak. It is a cowardly government that cannot brook criticism or dissent from Australia's not-for-profit organisations and its charities. That is why, when we were elected, we removed the gag clauses inserted under the Howard government into Commonwealth contracts, and that is why we have announced today that we will introduce legislation into this parliament to prohibit gag clauses from Commonwealth contracts now and into the future.                 This is an announcement that has been warmly welcomed by the not-for-profit and charities sector. Tim Costello, the CEO of World Vision, and the head of the Community Council of Australia, released a media statement today, in which he said:                 Civil society is at its best when the voice of the not-for-profit sector can be heard loud and clear. The removal of gag clauses is a critical part of the reform process, and one charities and not-for-profits will strongly welcome.                 I table that media release, Madam Deputy Speaker. I also table the media release from the Council of Social Services, welcoming our announcement; and the media release from the Mental Health Council of Australia, welcoming our announcement - just as three examples.                 This was a bad policy under the Howard government, and it is yet another step backward for the people of Queensland. The government does hope that our legislation ultimately will win the support of the opposition, and of other MPs in this place, to send a very clear message to Campbell Newman, and to other state governments who might be considering this, that gagging our not-for-profit organisations and our charities has no place in a modern democracy.

  I remind the member that there was an economic event called the global financial crisis.                     I know that that has caused an outbreak of confusion in the opposition ranks. They are now all looking at each other, confused - 'What are people talking about', they are all talking to each other and saying; 'A global financial crisis? What was that? When was that?' - because we know the Leader of the Opposition slept through the legislation to deliver economic stimulus to keep our country out of recession and to support jobs. But there was the biggest economic downturn the world had seen since the Great Depression. That happened.                     The member might be the only person who claims economic literacy who has forgotten -                      but rest of the world has not. And then when we look at what that has caused around the rest of the world: we have see economies in recession; we see economies with double-digit unemployment rates; we see lives being wasted, lives of hopelessness now being led because people cannot get work; we see governments that have had to slash government services because of the nature of their economic conditions.                 In contrast, what have we seen here? Because of the timely and decisive action of the government, we kept our nation out of recession, we supported jobs - and that was the right thing to do for working Australians and for the people that they care for, to keep people in work, and we stand by it.                 Of course, the global financial crisis, hitting as it did, the global economy and then into our economy, we were not immune - of course that had implications for government revenue, as the member well knows. And, as has been acknowledged by opposition spokespeople in the past, they too in those circumstances would have had seen the government's -                      Thank you very much, Madam Deputy Speaker. Once again, we have the absolute economic illiteracy of the opposition  on display - forgotten about the global financial crisis, weren't prepared to support Australian jobs, were happy to see our nation go into recession, which would have ended up with a declining economy, with hopelessness for working Australians, as they were in economies and communities that had been devastated and they were unable to provide work.                 We made a different set of choices: we chose to support working Australians. We now are going to bring the budget into surplus, because that is the right thing to do in these economic circumstances. We will make all of the hard decisions necessary to do that, and we will be transparent about them. What the opposition will do is cook the books - that is what they did in the 2010 election, and that is what they are looking to do now.

  I thank my friend and colleague the member for Blair for his question, because I know how much he cares about the people of Blair and of Ipswich. He has been discussing with me the increase in unemployment associated with the savage cuts of the Queensland state government.                 We know that investing in skills and education is the pre-eminent source of competitiveness in the 21st century. Yet across coalition states we are seeing savage cuts to investment in education and training. New South Wales is taking $1.7 billion out of schools and cutting 800 TAFE jobs and increasing TAFE fees.                     Dr EMERSON:                     The Queensland government is cutting the number of TAFEs by half, the Victorian government is slashing TAFE funding by $300 million and of course just today this has been fully endorsed by the Leader of the Opposition when he said: 'I respect the job they are doing. I work closely with them as far as I can. But they are dealing with their problems at the state level and I will seek to deal with federal problems at our level.' You have the Leader of the Opposition endorsing the cuts and saying that he too would engage in savage cuts to government programs.                 We know the size of the problem, because the shadow finance minister indicated that there is indeed a $70 billion funding crater. That was confirmed again today by the shadow Treasurer. The shadow finance minister further said to Business Spectator, in August: 'I have on my desk 49 policy documents, with covers' - that is nice  - 'and the costings.' So they have the costings and they are concealing them. We know that they are deliberately concealing the costings of where these savage cuts are coming from because he said at the same interview that they would not make the same mistake as they made with Fightback! and set out those policies before an election. Indeed, the device of an audit commission is the device of choice of the coalition. It is the device that Campbell Newman used to conceal the cuts to education, to training and to the workforce in Queensland. And we know that this opposition has said no to the charter of budget honesty, which was designed by former Treasurer Peter Costello. They will not go to the Parliamentary Budget Office. The shadow Treasurer obviously is going to hire a retired Mosman bookkeeper to put a little ruler over the costings and then say that it all adds up. But in truth they have in mind the same device -                      Dr EMERSON:                     and that is an audit commission. You, the Leader of the Opposition, should have the courage to say to the Australian people where you are going to make cuts. Be a man, front up and tell the Australian people how you are going to savagely cut education -

  The Leader of the Opposition has raised this matter with me privately, and I acknowledge that. Our nation has seen a number of Australians affected by terrorist events, and there is nothing we can do as a government or as a parliament that brings back a lost loved one or ends people's suffering when they have been wounded in such grievous attacks. But as a nation we have cared for people who were caught in the Bali bombings, in 9/11, in Mumbai, in Jakarta and in the many events in which Australians have been hurt by the acts of terrorists. I think as a parliament, in a very bipartisan way, we should recognise that our nation has extended that support. That has included emergency financial assistance, the support of family liaison officers, travel back to Bali - and the government is extending a package of support so people can return for the 10th commemoration of the Bali bombings, lifetime health care, counselling, rehabilitation, money to cover out of pocket expenses and the like, and of course some people were also assisted to attend the trials of the Bali bombers.                 We are working together in a bipartisan way to put this kind of ad hoc assistance on a more systematic basis for the future and so there will be a scheme established for Australians should any be hurt in the future by terrorist attacks. I am sure we would all be hoping that no-one ever gets hurt again, but understanding the world in which we live we must prepare for that possibility and in those circumstances an amount of up to $75,000 would be extended to Australians harmed in overseas terrorist acts or the families of those killed.                 The Leader of the Opposition has raised with me the question of people who were the subject of the Bali bombings in the past. I indicate to the Leader of the Opposition that I am open to considering unmet needs for any of those individuals, and if the Leader of the Opposition wants to bring some material to me in any way that suits his convenience, or have me speak directly to family members involved, then I am open to that.

  I do very much thank the member for Chifley for raising this question. A number of us in this parliament had what was the very special privilege last night of attending a first ever Australian Multicultural Council lecture delivered by a very great Australian, Frank Lowy. I was in attendance, the Leader of the Opposition was in attendance, the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship was in attendance, the Minister for Multicultural Affairs was there, Minister Ellis was there, the shadow parliamentary secretary was there and the former minister for immigration Mr Ruddock was there, amongst a large number of others. It was a special privilege to be there and to hear the remarkable life story of a truly great Australian who, as a very young boy, fled the horrors of the Holocaust and made such a remarkable success of his life in this country.                 I was very pleased that when I spoke, when Mr Lowy spoke and when the Leader of the Opposition spoke we saw a bipartisan embrace of multiculturalism and what it truly means. Multiculturalism is the meeting place of rights and responsibilities - the right to bring to this nation as a migrant your heritage and your culture and your language and your religion; to bring all of that with you and pursue it freely. It is the meeting of those rights with the responsibilities that come from making your way in a new nation, including responsibilities to find work, to learn English, to uphold our rule of law, to be a full participant in our democracy and to recognise women as equals in our society. Each person who spoke last night - I, the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Lowy, the chair of the Australian Multicultural Council - made the very important point that what we saw in the streets of Sydney last weekend was not multiculturalism; it was extremism and it should be recognised as such.                  I am very pleased that we will now see this lecture happen once every year. It will give us a tremendous opportunity to come together as a parliament and I believe, as it becomes more publicly noted, to come together as a nation to celebrate what multiculturalism has achieved for this country. We certainly made a flying start with the address last night from Mr Frank Lowy. I very much enjoyed it. I know his representative in this parliament, the member for Wentworth, enjoyed it. It was a truly great occasion for this parliament and I wanted this parliament to add its voice to the very wise words spoken by a great Australian last night on multiculturalism.

  To the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, I will have to make some inquiries about the number and, in the appropriate time, will provide the Deputy Leader of the Opposition with the information she seeks. As the Deputy Leader of the Opposition would know, the question of visa cancellations is the subject of legislation and is the subject of the rule of law - that is, it has to be done appropriately and, if it is not done appropriately, then you end up in very difficult circumstances. I would remind the Deputy Leader of the Opposition of the difficulties encountered by the former Howard government in the cancellation of the visa of Mr Haneef. So you have to proceed on the basis of legislation and the rule of law. That is what the government always does.                 I say to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition I do not believe that such a matter should be the subject of partisan divisions in this parliament. I would have thought, in line with what I just said about multiculturalism and the events of last night, that we could speak with one voice, that violence is always wrong - it is wrong if it happens on the streets of Sydney, it is wrong if it happens in a family home, it is wrong if it happens on Christmas Island. Violence is always wrong and the violence should be -                     Violence is always wrong and perpetrators of violence should be dealt with appropriately according to law.

  I thank the member for Deakin for his question because I was asked about the strength of our economy and the fact that Standard &amp; Poor's have reaffirmed our gold-plated AAA credit rating with a stable outlook. This is what Standard &amp; Poor's had to say:                 The AAA rating is underpinned by low public debt and strong fiscal discipline.                  We are proud on this side of the House that we have that rating from the three major ratings agencies. Of course, we are one of seven countries in the world with that rating and a stable outlook. We have this because we have put in place a strong fiscal policy. Getting this rating from the three major agencies is like having the Brownlow, the Norm Smith and the flag all in the same season. I think it is something that everyone on this side of the House will be celebrating. But, of course, those on the other side of the House - the Leader of the Opposition, the shadow Treasurer - raced into the House to trash the Australian economy yet again. They came in half cocked like a couple of rabid pit-bulls, ears pinned back, salivating, tongue hanging out. They raced into the House and all they wanted to do was to run down our economy because somehow they had a whiff that this was not quite right. They somehow had a whiff that it did not work. We saw from the Leader of the Opposition that he has no vision and is all venom. He will do anything to trash our economy at any time.                 The shadow Treasurer then followed him. He did not go out and check the basic facts. He raced in resting here despite the S&amp;P report and he had an incorrect report from ABC radio. He should have known how wrong it was. Very sloppy, Joe - very very sloppy. The fact is that they should do the honourable thing in this House today and apologise, stand up at the dispatch box and apologise for trashing the Australian economy. They should unreservedly apologise for the fact that they used incorrect information in this House to run down our economy. What we saw yesterday were the typical bully boy tactics of the Leader of the Opposition and the Treasurer running down our economy.                     The Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Treasurer -                      I withdraw. I was asked about the misrepresentation of facts about the Australian economy. The Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Treasurer did that yesterday - they misrepresented the facts. We have had the Leader of the Opposition do it again today. He said the aim of the Liberal Party would be to return to growth. What does he think is happening in the Australian economy at the moment? The economy is 11 per cent bigger than it was four years ago.

Of course, individual businesses will make commercial decisions every day in the Australian economy. Of course we expect that to happen. But the shadow Treasurer should recognise, too, when he is talking about our resources sector in Australia, that there is currently a $270 billion pipeline of investment committed and $230 billion in planned capital.                      The shadow Treasurer may want to bellow, but no amount of bellowing changes the facts, and they are the facts. The shadow Treasurer, too, if he is interested in this question, may want to pay some regard to the work of the bureau of resources, which has recently published some material, and even to the Reserve Bank of Australia minutes - the shadow Treasurer might be interested in those. The data from the bureau of resources shows that we will see export earnings, in their calculation, in 2012-13 at $189 billion. They, of course, are replicating to the Australian community what we have said about the commodities boom, and that is: that we expected commodity prices to peak in 2011, but then we expected, beyond the peak of commodity prices, to see the continuation of production and the continuation of investment, and so we will. The Reserve Bank has made similar points about the Australian economy and its outlook.                 The shadow Treasurer has determined that it is his job not to pursue Australia's national interest but to talk the Australian economy down. It ought to be incumbent on everyone in this House to be talking about the strength of the Australian economy and to be talking very clearly about the trends in the Australian economy. There are businesses under pressure as a result of the sustained high Australian dollar; there is no doubt about that. And that is why we have been working so strongly with manufacturing, why we will continue to work with tourism, and why we have worked hard with our universities on international education, because the high dollar matters to them as it matters to a large number of other businesses. But the shadow Treasurer should be out there telling the truth about the Australian economy - an economy that is growing, an economy that is offering Australians the benefits of work, an economy with low inflation, an economy with low interest rates. Of course we will not see the shadow Treasurer speaking about those truths, because he is following the Leader of the Opposition down a path of reckless and destructive negativity.                      But we will keep managing the Australian economy in the interests of working people.

  To the member for Denison: I share his concern about problem gambling and I share his concern about the impact that it has on family lives. I agree with him that reasonable people would want to see, through this parliament, laws that would assist people deal with the scourge of problem gambling. Reasonable people would want to see that. The government does want to see legislation - and it would be the biggest package of legislation to deal with problem gambling ever brought before a national parliament - which would require precommitment technology to be available on every one of Australia's 200,000 poker machines. We do want to see technology that would assist people on those machines to monitor and set limits on how much they are spending. We do want to see legislation that would require new electronic warnings on poker machines and that would limit cash withdrawals from ATMs in pokies venues to $250. We also want to see a large-scale trial of mandatory precommitment in the ACT and we have such a trial agreed in principle with the clubs in the ACT. I would want to see this parliament legislate on problem gambling in the terms I have just outlined but it does require people to make a decision in favour of the community's interest because the community is concerned about problem gambling. Unfortunately, every step of the way, as usual, we have seen the relentless negativity of the opposition.                     Even though many of them have interjected during the course of this answer, not one of them intends to vote in order to assist people with problems with gambling. I also do note that there are others including the Australian Greens who have not committed to supporting this legislation. I believe this legislation is reasonable, I believe it is balanced, I believe it would do good and I believe people of good will should support this legislation.                     The member for Wannon is someone who does not want to vote to assist problem gamblers. To the member for Denison, the answer is this: -                      we will bring legislation to this parliament when we know it has the support of this parliament. In order to get the support of this parliament, the member of the Wannon, who has just been very vocal, could announce that he is going to vote for the legislation. That would be one step forward. The Leader of the Opposition could do the decent thing and acknowledge that all members of the coalition will vote for the legislation. The Leader of the Australian Greens, Ms Milne, could announce that the Australian Greens would support the legislation. The legislation will be brought to the parliament when people in this parliament, beyond those who have already indicated, say that they are prepared to act on problem gambling.

  I want to thank the member for Hindmarsh for his question. Since before he was a member of this parliament, he was campaigning for better oral health in the community he represents. I recently announced a $4.1-billion package to improve the dental health of Australians with $2.7 billion for 3.4 million children including 12,000 in the member for Hindmarsh's electorate to make it as easy for them to go and see a dentist as it now is to see a GP. There will be $1.3 billion to provide 1.4 million extra services for adults on low incomes in the public dental system and $225 million for dental capital and workforce measures. This comes on top of a half-a-billion-dollar announcement in the May budget.                     I have had a number of people -                      I announced that that $515.3 million would be available from January. That is how long I imagine it would take to negotiate with the states and territories their signature on the piece of paper that will say that they will not reduce their services - as Campbell Newman has already done in Queensland, cutting paediatric dental services. The member for New England has asked me, as have a number of Labor MPs and other Independents: could this money start to flow earlier? Today, I would like to say, yes, it can start to flow earlier. It can flow as soon as the states and territories sign on the dotted line saying that they will not reduce their services and that they will tell us who they are treating. There need be no gap between the closure of the Chronic Disease Dental Scheme on 1 December and the half a billion dollars we committed in the May budget. All it requires is the states to come to the table and sign on the dotted line.                 I think it is very important to note that this support for the boost to public dental services to treat the most disadvantaged people with the highest dental needs -                      The proposal that we are supporting is not a unique proposal. In fact, it is a proposal that has been around for a little while. In 2006 there was an excellent report from the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Health and Ageing chaired by the member for Fairfax and included the member for Wentworth, the member for Leichardt and the member for Bonner that recommended:                 The Australian Government should supplement state and territory funding for public dental services so that reasonable access standards for appropriate services are maintained, particularly for disadvantaged groups                 It is an excellent report because it was chaired by a very sensible member. All I would like to see is those members opposite, instead of supporting the flawed, rorted Chronic Dental Disease Scheme, supporting their own report.

  I thank the member for Indi for her question. I thought at the end of yesterday maybe the opposition had moved on from carbon pricing, but clearly not. And there is the member for Indi, back, right on cue - despite knowing that the Leader of the Opposition is someone who has been in favour of carbon pricing, every living Liberal leader is in favour of carbon pricing; and, should the Leader of the Opposition ever be elected as Prime Minister, he will keep carbon pricing. But I am not surprised that the member for Indy is in this parliament, once again, misrepresenting what is happening with carbon pricing, because the Leader of the Opposition, though he is a supporter of it, is addicted to the fear campaign. But the fear campaign is always punctured by the facts. And the fact is this: we are seeing business investment, as a percentage of GDP, at its highest point in 40 years - 17.1 per cent. That is the fact.                 The member for Indy might look like she is not interested in that but you cannot wish those kinds of statistics away. We are seeing business investment at record levels. And that is after we have announced carbon pricing and legislated for it, after we agreed the minerals resource rent tax and legislated for it. That is the performance of the Australian economy. Yes, of course, there are things in the Australian economy that are bringing pressures. Chief amongst them is the high Australian dollar, which is putting pressure on a range of businesses, but it is not true, as the opposition is trying to assert today, that we are seeing business investment at anything other than very strong levels in our economy.                  If the member for Indy is truly interested in risks to this kind of business investment then she may want to inquire of the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Treasurer why they want to do things like put company tax up and why they have $70 billion that they need to slash out of services to families, with all of the implications that that would have for jobs and support in the Australian economy. Why is it that they are on such a reckless and destructive path when it comes to Australian businesses? Why is it that they spend all of their time scrapping about investments, with Senator Joyce allowed to say whatever he likes whenever he likes, jeopardising foreign investment and the future of the Australian economy? Why is it that they are bereft of any strategy other than aggressive and reckless negativity?                 If the member for Indy has the slightest interest in the jobs and prospects of working Australians she should be seeking to get those questions answered, not to misrepresent the facts.

  I thank the member for Reid for his question. It is particularly pertinent because yesterday, on behalf of the government, I introduced legislation that will link Australia's carbon price mechanism to the European Union emissions trading scheme, which is the largest carbon market in the world and has been in place since 2005.                  The fact of the matter is that by linking with the European Union Australia's carbon price will be the same as that which obtains in 30 other countries with a combined population of 530 million people. Little wonder that the Leader of the Opposition turns his back, because that is a message he does not want to hear. He has deceived people in this country about this issue. Thirty other countries will have the same carbon price, including the United Kingdom, Germany and France - and in combination those countries represent our second largest trading partner, and they will have the same carbon price. This gives the lie -                      the lie to the campaign by the Leader of the Opposition that Australia is somehow going it alone.                     I withdraw.                     These mendacious claims have been made by the Leader of the Opposition numerous times. For example, he has claimed that there are no carbon pricing mechanisms anywhere in the world at all - they are nowhere in the world; there is no carbon price. Just last month he said:                 There are no developing carbon markets in the Asia-Pacific.                 Well, the facts are somewhat different. The fact is that Korea, China, Japan, New Zealand, Thailand, Indonesia, Vietnam, the US state of California -                      Not only are there market measures developing within the economies that I referred to, just this week there were further details of emissions trading schemes in Guangdong Province - which, on its own, in China is our sixth largest trading partner - and also in Shenzhen. These are hugely significant developments.                  The fact of the matter is that there have been no unimaginable price increases as forecast by the Leader of the Opposition. There has been no collapse of whole regions or industries. In fact, today, Arrium Mining announced 100 new jobs in Whyalla, that the opposition leader said would be wiped off the map. Jobs are growing. The economy is growing. This has been the most mendacious campaign we have seen against an important policy initiative and you are going to be held to account for everything you said.

  To the member for Goldstein, who may or may not have listened to the answer to the question for the member for Indi, there are things called facts. I know they are always inconvenient for the opposition, and I know that they never buttress the opposition's fear campaign. I know that therefore the opposition lives in denial of them, and I know therefore that the opposition criticises, hounds and seeks to destroy anybody who raises the facts and any expert who ventures an opposition. That is all part of their relentless, destructive, aggressive negativity, and we see it every day.                 But people of reason know that there are things called facts, and the facts matter - like the facts on business investment in our nation. The member for Goldstein, who is seeking to be a senior economic spokesperson in a government, should acquaint himself with these facts. We have a growing economy. We have business investment as a percentage of GDP at a very high point - the highest point in 40 years. We have reached that with the government's policy settings, which have been about keeping the Australian economy strong, making sure we came out of the global financial crisis without a recession and with Australians in work, and, in this phase of economic change in our region, seeking to maximise the jobs and opportunities that come from this period of economic change.                 And that does mean that we have to be ready for the future. That does mean that we need to have a cleaner energy economy, and that is why we have put a price on carbon. It does mean that we will need the infrastructure of the future, which is why infrastructure investments are at a record level, and we are rolling out the National Broadband Network. It does mean that we will need the skills of the future, which is why there is nothing more precious to us than what is happening in our education system - whether it is early childhood education, school skills or universities - and we are not done yet on making sure that Australians have got the best of future opportunities. It is about making sure, as our region grows and changes and is home to more middle-class people than any other part of the world, that we get the benefit of those opportunities: legal services, health services, education services and food industry services - and the list goes on. This is the economic future -                      The Manager of Opposition Business has just misrepresented what Professor Garnaut said. Let's just mark that. The Manager of Opposition Business should note the facts about economic growth in this country. And the Manager of Opposition Business should also be honest enough to say that the opposition is wilfully misleading people about those facts as part of their negative campaign.

  I thank the member for Fremantle for her question. she understands that it is right that those older Australians who have contributed a lifetime of work deserve our support and of course, especially for those who are living on fixed incomes, we do understand how important it is that we as a government give them a helping hand.                 That is why I can announce to the parliament today that from today Australia's 3.5 million pensioners will be receiving an increase. For single pensioners on the maximum rate, that will mean an extra $17.10 a fortnight, and pensioner couples on the maximum rate will receive an extra $25.80 a fortnight. Typically, those opposite show no interest whatsoever in what pensioners are going to receive - no interest whatsoever. Just turn your back like you did for 12 years in government. That is what pensioners got from those opposite.                 We know that it took a Labor government to deliver these historic reforms to pensioners, and it is not only the increase to the pension; there were also the very significant improvements to the indexation arrangements to make sure that the pension would keep up with pensioners' costs of living. Of course, this government delivered that pension rise, fully funded, fully costed, and delivered it in a sustainable way. That was never done by those opposite, who refused to deliver to pensioners when they needed it most.                 We delivered this significant increase to the pension, and we will continue to make sure that pensioners keep up with the cost of living. We know that at exactly the same time we have Liberals in Queensland and in New South Wales clawing back this increase from pensioners. Barry O'Farrell is putting the money in his pocket and Campbell Newman is putting the money in his pocket instead of helping pensioners. And we know that each and every one of you want to do exactly the same: take the money off pensioners to fill your $70 billion black hole.

  Thank you very much to the member for Menzies. The member raises with me the circumstances of a hotel. The opposition has raised the circumstances of hotels and carbon pricing in this parliament before. They raised the Belair hotel, and at the time they completely misrepresented the position, because when you looked at the bill of the Belair hotel the carbon adjustment was less than 10 per cent of the overall electricity bill and not the increase of 45 per cent falsely claimed by the member for Boothby. So the member for Menzies is continuing this negative fear campaign -                      I thank the member for Boothby for precisely proving my point. When you looked at the bill of the Belair hotel, what you saw was a carbon tax gain of less than 10 per cent. What you saw on that bill was, in action, what we said would always result from carbon pricing - that is, that people would see electricity price increases of up to 10 per cent. That was exactly what was always said by the government. Because of that, we have provided the household assistance that the minister has just gone through: pension increases and family payment increases. We have made sure people have tax cuts. All these things are jeopardised by the fact that the opposition now has to make $70 billion worth of cuts because of the reckless approach they have taken -                       - to making promises. I am sure the member for Menzies is engaged in exactly the same trick and maneuver as the member for Boothby. That is, on proper examination, when the hotel's bills are looked at the claims being made by the member for Menzies will not be found to be true. It also continues to amaze me that Liberal members who are here, now interjecting and carrying on, did not say one critical word when the Liberal government of Western Australia was responsible for electricity price hikes of more than 60 per cent, or when the Liberal government in New South Wales is there gouging dividends out of power companies and passing that extra cost through to consumers and small businesses. There was not one word of criticism of 50, 60, 70 per cent price rises.                     The fact that the Manager of Opposition Business would say that by way of interjection just proves how out of touch the opposition is. He thinks a 50, 60 or 70 per cent increase for an Australian family or a small business does not matter. Well, Australian families and small businesses think that they matter. The opposition might be running a protection racket for their Liberal mates in the states when these increases come through, but we are working on these electricity -

  I thank the member for Corangamite for his question. The member knows that, when the biggest global economic downturn since the Great Depression struck, this Labor government was ready to step in and to stimulate the economy and to support the jobs of hundreds of thousands of Australians. That was choice that we made because, as a Labor government, we believed it was important that we took that action to support jobs and to keep the doors of Australian businesses open.                 But, of course, our government, like governments all around the world, have been hit with downgrades to our revenue. Notwithstanding this, we are returning the budget to surplus, and we are doing that by making responsible savings. But those opposite are still struggling to make their numbers add up. The Australian people will remember that, at the last election, the coalition took some costings to the election that were later exposed by the Treasury to have an $11 billion black hole in them. So dodgy were these costings that the Institute of Chartered Accountants had to reprimand and fine the accountants that were involved in this so-called audit. Now we know that they have a $70 billion black hole, and we know that because the member for North Sydney has confirmed it twice now, on breakfast television. Yesterday, he confirmed it once again when he said, 'Well, I said at the time, whatever the cost would be - 50, 60, 70'. That is $70 billion. Further questioned, he went on to say, 'We will find the savings' - and, wait for it - 'and we have found the savings'. Well, I will believe that when I see it.                 I do not believe he has been able to fill his $70 billion black hole, but I do believe he has a secret plan. If you go to the member for North Sydney's office, in his top draw he has this folder. And on the top of the folder it says, 'Secret: Commission of Audit Recommendations'. There it is, all ready to go - he just won't tell anyone about it until after the election!                 The member for North Sydney should be honest with the Australian people and he should tell them that he has a plan to rip away services such as education and health, in the same way as his state Liberal Premier mates have been doing. He should be honest with the Australian people, he should go to his top drawer, he should take out that folder that has his policies, he should reveal them to the Australian people - as scary as that might be. And, when he has done that, he should take his policies, walk down to the Parliamentary Budget Office and this time get them properly costed.

  Thank you very much, Madam Deputy Speaker. I am very happy to answer the member's question. I think it is very important some facts are put on the table in relation to this. In that regard, I would refer the member to a press release from the relevant Parliamentary Secretary for Defence that lays it out in some detail. But to give the member some of the detail contained in that release that I think is important to understand in this issue: recent data shows that our Defence Force Cadets program has increased by over 1,000 cadets. Claims that the Australian Army Cadet supervision is being cut by 30 per cent are untrue. Claims that Navy and Air Force Cadet units will be amalgamated and may be closed due to sweeping or widespread budget cuts are also untrue.                 Experience shows that, from time to time, cadet units close. That happens as a result of cadets, volunteers or community support in a particular area. Experience also shows that new cadet units emerge because of community support and cadet interest, and indeed I have seen that in my own electorate - an organisation starting to run cadets that did not used to do so. So there is some change over time.                 I would refer the member to all of the details that this release outlines in relation to ADF Cadets, and I want to assure him that the government is planning for an enhanced future for the Australian Defence Force Cadets, not a reduced one. We understand the importance of the cadets to the Australian cadets to the Australian community. We understand the importance of the cadets to the Australian psyche and we understand their importance to generating the next great generation of future leaders.

  I thank the member for Makin for his question. He knows that Labor stands for good jobs, he knows that Labor stands for a fair go all around and he knows that this Labor government stands for getting the work-life family balance right. He also knows that it is important that the people of Australia understand the position of the two major parties in terms of workplace relations.                 Workplace relations is an appropriate matter for debate in the national parliament of Australia. Even if some opposite do not like what we stand for on workplace relations, people know what we stand for. We stand for fair laws to protect people against unfair dismissal. We stand for improving superannuation from nine to 12 per cent for people like the 46,000 voters in the member for Makin's electorate. People know that we stand for the recognition that there should be penalty rates for people who work family-unfriendly hours. People know that we stand for safer roads via Safe Roads for truck drivers. People know that Labor stands for better protection for outworkers.                 What people do not know is the opposition's workplace relations policy. This is an obstacle. It renders a disservice to the people of Australia. Whatever people think about the merits of competing policies, they do have a right to expect that the so-called alternative government of Australia will front up on industrial relations and tell us their policies. But not all is lost.                 First of all we have the Leader of the Opposition, who uses cliches as a substitute for thinking. The opposition leader always says, 'We will be in the sensible centre.' The opposition's policies could not fill out a full tweet. But what we also do have is the actions of the state governments, because if we cannot find what goes on at the national level it is legitimate for this parliament to debate the actions of their fraternal political party, at the state level. And we know what the opposition stands for through their state brothers and sisters. They stand for job cuts, for terrible processes in the way they implement job cuts, for not guaranteeing the transfer of people's entitlements if they are outsourced.                     But all is not lost. Not only can we see what state governments do to represent their opposition policy, but we have the rise of a couple of IR hawks. I congratulate Senator Sinodinos and the member for Mayo. Whilst I do not agree with what they stand for in industrial relations, at least we know they stand for something. Although it does raise an interesting question. In September last year the member for Mayo said we should bring back individual statutory contracts. Is this the sort of freelancing that the opposition leader will require him not to say, now that he has received a promotion.                 The reality is that it is not fair on the Australian people that the opposition hide their policies. Cowardice is no substitute for national political debate. Being a small target and negative is no substitute for talking about workplace relations. You can run but you cannot hide over the next year. We will have a workplace relations debate.

  I understand why the Leader of the Opposition has asked this question today. What would be on his mind - and he has made some public comments about this today - is the publication of some text messages from Mr Slipper, a number of them from before the time he was Speaker. The contents of these text messages are offensive. I find sexism offensive wherever it comes from. I do believe that sexism is always offensive. You would expect me, as the first woman Prime Minister of this country, to say that.                 On matters involving the Speaker more generally: as the Leader of the Opposition would be aware, the material he is referring to is material from a court case where the judge at the moment has reserved his decision, so I do not believe that it is appropriate for this parliament canvas in a full way this material, which is in evidence in a case where the judge has reserved his decision.                 Leave not granted.

  I say to the Leader of the Opposition: here we are, back to the same old siren song of negativity and distorting the facts. He says he is concerned about this pensioner in Western Australia. I do understand that pensioners around the country actually struggle to make ends meet. We in this government understand that, which is why we were responsible for an historic increase in the pension, something delivered by this government and never delivered by those opposite when they had the opportunity. We delivered an historic pension increase. Then, when we put in place carbon pricing, because we were concerned about the circumstances of those on fixed incomes we ensured that we not only gave them the amount of money that would be necessary to deal with the average flow-through price impact, we gave them extra money because we wanted them, knowing that their budgets are tight, to benefit from this package.                 The Leader of the Opposition well knows that the big drivers of electricity price increases in Western Australia are local factors and decisions of the Western Australian government.                     As much as the opposition might interject and yell, they cannot get away from the fact that there have been 62 per cent increases in Western Australia over the last 40 years, and that is not about carbon pricing; that is about the decisions of the Western Australian government. Premier Barnett has, in fact, dealt with this matter publicly and has apologised to the people of Western Australia for the huge increases that his government is responsible for.                 We took a different approach to Premier Barnett. We knew that there would be an increase in electricity prices of 10 per cent. That was modelled accurately by Treasury. We ensured that those who needed support the most were assisted, including the pensioner who the Leader of the Opposition refers to. So if he has a genuine concern I suggest he does the following. I suggest that he speaks to Premier Barnett about assisting people in his state on fixed incomes with the increases that Premier Barnett has been responsible for. I also suggest that he get on board with the government's approach and the government's plan to deal at the next COAG meeting with these kinds of increases in electricity prices, rather than trying to confuse and mislead about the true drivers of electricity prices.

  I thank the member for Deakin for his question. I know that the member for Deakin is very concerned that the people who live in his part of the world get the best of job opportunities and the benefits of a strong economy. He wants to see the people who live in his part of the world able to find work and to make a decent life for themselves and their families. Of course, in order to provide that opportunity, we need to keep the economy strong.                 I know Australians are proud of the strength of the Australian economy, and they should be. They should be proud because we built the strength of the Australian economy together. The nation pulled together during the days of the global financial crisis to ensure that we came through that crisis strong, that we kept Australians in work. The IMF has just released its most recent forecast for global growth and it shows that since this government came to office we have become the 12th largest economy in the world, passing South Korea, passing Mexico and passing Spain. This is an achievement for a nation that we should be proud of - the 12th largest economy in the world. This is when our population is not in the top 50 countries in the world. So we are the 12th largest economy and we are not in the top 50 population wise. This is a true achievement for the Australian economy and for the Australian people.                 We are one of the few countries that have kept a AAA credit rating. Unemployment and interest rates are low - lower than the average under the Howard government. A family with a $300,000 mortgage is now paying around $4,500 less in repayments than when we came to office, and someone earning $50,000 a year is paying $2,000 less in tax each year. We have created 800,000 jobs since this government came into office, and that is good news.                 Whilst we have worked to keep the economy strong, we have also worked to bring decency to working Australians. There is no more important decision than the legislation which came into this parliament today to ensure wage justice for the people, predominantly women, who work in the social and community services sector, whose work has been historically undervalued precisely because they are women, because caring work is viewed to be innately women's work and of lesser value. That is an injustice corrected under this government, and $2.8 billion fully budgeted for and fully accounted for, the subject of legislation today, is reserved to give pay increases to these working Australians, predominantly women. We intend to keep building on this track record of decency and support for working Australians, but this is a red-letter day for the social and community services sector.

  The member for Boothby well knows that the government said from the time that it announced the plan to put a price on carbon that it would have an impact on electricity prices. We always said that. We always said to the people of Australia that there would be a flow-through impact as the biggest polluters paid the price on carbon. We wanted Australians to understand the facts. From the opposition what they got was reckless negativity. What they got was a scare campaign. What they got was a determined attempt to mislead the Australian people - ridiculous claims. Whyalla wiped off the map, no more coal mined, roasts at $100 - all of these claims have shown to be ridiculous, shown to be the kind of thing that happens when this Leader of the Opposition switches onto reckless negativity, which is where it is stuck. On electricity prices -                      On electricity prices, of course the opposition has been out there with false claims too. They have talked about astronomical increases. The opposition know that the increase around the country has been what was predicted - 10 per cent or less. The opposition know that that means that people have seen on average increases of $3.30 a week and on average assistance of $10.10 a week. Why doesn't the member for Boothby come into this place and say honestly and loudly to his constituents that he wants to see every increase in the pension, every increase in family payments, every increase that we have delivered, including a tax cut for working Australians, taken away? That is the logical conclusion of his question. The member for Boothby should also be honest enough to come into this place and say that in South Australia there have been large increases in electricity prices which are nothing to do with carbon pricing. He should be honest enough to say that.                 On the question of accurate fact and electricity prices, having had a look at the document that was just tabled by the Leader of the Opposition, it says in relation to carbon pricing: 'This represents an estimated increase of 9.13 per cent for an average daily usage.' Once again the Leader of the Opposition is caught out, just like he was on Whyalla, just like he was on the coal industry, just like he was on lamb roasts. He is peddling fear, peddling reckless negativity. The one thing you will never hear from the Leader of the Opposition is anything that sounds like the truth about carbon pricing, or indeed anything else.

 I thank the member for Corangamite for his very important question. The IMF's World Economic Outlook does predict a slowing down in global growth in 2012 and 2013. The recession in Europe and moderating growth in the United States will have an impact in this region as well. Australia is not immune from these developments, and in addition to that we face the challenges of a higher dollar and a cautious consumer, which is putting some pressure on a number of industrial sectors.                 However you look at the data, the Australian economy continues to walk tall in the world. The IMF is forecasting that the Australian economy will outperform every single major advanced economy in the world. I know that is something that everyone on this side of the House is extremely proud of. We are also proud of the fact that Australia is now ranked the 12th largest economy in the world based on GDP at market exchange rates. This is a very substantial achievement - up from 15th to 12th. As the Prime Minister has said, we have passed South Korea, Mexico and Spain. This is a very considerable achievement considering that we are the 51st largest country when it comes to population. Becoming the 12th largest economy in the world is a very substantial achievement and it reflects very well on all of the hard work of Australian workers and the hard work of Australian business.                 You would have thought that this fact was welcomed by those opposite, but of course it is not welcomed by those opposite. They are talking down the economy. You would have thought that the Leader of the Opposition would stand up just once and welcome a positive piece of economic news for Australia; stand up just once and say, 'Isn't this great for Australia - I'm proud of what has been achieved by Australian workers and by Australian business.' But he will not do that - he is constantly talking the economy down and is constantly at war with the facts. A few weeks ago he said the Australian economy was not growing. Fact: the Australian economy is growing at 3.7 per cent. Last week he compared our economy to the economy of Greece. Greece is in its fifth year of recession. That is a fact.                 The Leader of the Opposition may want to run his scare campaigns, but he is not entitled to make up the facts. The fact is that the Australian economy is growing and the fact is that there are challenges globally, but all of us can be confident in the knowledge that we have strong economic fundamentals. When the Leader of the Opposition runs down our economy, he demonstrates how unfit he is for high office.

  The member asking the question has not seen fit to table the documents. I am not sure why they are being covered up but I suspect it is because what we know to be the truth is transparent from the face of the bill or associated documents. The truth about electricity pricing in New South Wales is that carbon pricing, from 1 July, did cause a 10 per cent increase in electricity pricing. That is what happened. That is what the regulator determined.                 That increase followed a large number of price rises in electricity in New South Wales which are deeply concerning to me because of the pressure they have put on the families of New South Wales - without assistance flowing from the state government. I am concerned, and I have publicly said this, about the approach being taken which is leading to the so-called gold plating of the network. This is a market failure which basically means that, the more they roll out the network, the more electricity assets get to earn. I am concerned too about what is happening with dividend streams to state governments and the impact that has on people like the family in New South Wales the member referred to - I think they are, as she said, actually constituents of the electorate of Banks.                 So carbon pricing in New South Wales has caused a 10 per cent rise. What has the government done to assist? A family like that - I do not have their income details available to me - may well have been eligible for the tax cut. If, due to the need to care for the child, one of the parents involved works part time, they may well have gone from paying tax to paying no tax, because now you do not pay tax on the first $18,200 you earn. The family may have been eligible for the family payment increases - certainly they would have seen an increase if they are family payment recipients. We brought in those measures because we knew there would be a flowthrough impact on families.                 Let us for once have the opposition try to have a mature debate about the facts. Let us see an end to the reckless negativity and to the false fear campaign. The track record so far today is one bill referred to and misrepresented in this parliament - it actually showed a 9.13 per cent increase because of carbon pricing. The nature of the misrepresentation of this bill I cannot judge because the documents are being covered up.                 Leave granted.

  I thank the member for Dobell for his question. Particularly when it comes to issues of natural disasters, there is a very high degree of sensitivity about trying to make sure the information offered by the Bureau of Meteorology is as localised as possible. I can understand why that is a view very strongly held on the Central Coast, particularly after the recent early onset of the fire season.                 I should note that weather forecasts themselves are provided on a very local basis. The bureau, for example, provides full seven-day weather forecasts for the Central Coast - I think you will find it is Norah Head, Gosford and, I think, Mangrove Mountain. But, as I understand it, the regional forecasts are tied to state government fire districts. At the moment, I think the Central Coast is tied in with the Hunter region. I would not want to depart from us having consistency between how the bureau operates and how the emergency services themselves seek to operate.                 That said, I am very happy to ask the parliamentary secretary in the other place, who has responsibility for the issue, to raise this directly with both the bureau and the New South Wales authorities. The people of the Central Coast, understandably, want those warnings to be given in the most timely way and in the most localised way, and many of them would, quite rightly, regard the Hunter as being a long way from home, whether you are living in The Entrance, Terrigal or Gosford. So I will ask the parliamentary secretary to follow through with that action and report back directly to the member for Dobell.

  I thank the member for Greenway for her very important question. I was really pleased this morning to introduce legislation into this place to ensure our contribution of $2.8 billion to fund pay increases for social and community services sector workers, as determined by Fair Work Australia, is secure for now and into the future. This government is creating the Social and Community Services Pay Equity Special Account to deliver certainty to these workers and to the sector.                 We know these workers are some of the lowest paid in Australia, and many of us are aware of the great work that they do as dedicated professionals, carrying out work in our communities every single day. They help women and children in refuges. They run support centres for people with disabilities. They lead teams of counselling professionals, manage family support programs and deliver emergency housing to those experiencing homelessness or mental illness.                 We know that, for too long, this important work has been undervalued, and that is because it has been seen as a caring role, primarily women's work. That was until Fair Work Australia's historic equal remuneration order earlier this year. The government made a joint submission with the unions to Fair Work Australia in support of better pay and to address the gender pay gap in this sector. This ruling on equal pay was very significant, particularly for women, because 120,000 of the 150,000 workers covered by this order are women. This government really wants to ensure that these workers and their proper award are secure. From December of this year, the workers will receive increases - in nine instalments over eight years - of between 23 and 45 per cent.                 The process of supplementing payments to the sector has been carried out in close cooperation and full disclosure with both the sector and the unions, and I want to thank both of them for their important work throughout this process. I know they have worked cooperatively with the government and with many government agencies over many months, and we have held roundtables in every state and territory with more than 500 sector representatives. The government have also set up a dedicated website to provide updates on this process.                 Supplementation will be delivered through funding drawn down from the special account by eight Commonwealth agencies, and we have made this process as fair and transparent as we can. State governments will also receive funding through this special account, and we want to continue to work with the states and territories to ensure that these workers receive those pay rises and that this historic decision by Fair Work Australia is implemented.                 The government's $2.8 billion contribution is fully funded and accounted for in our budget, and this special account shows our commitment to the services, to the sector and, of course, to closing the gender pay gap.

  I add my congratulations to you, Madam Speaker, on your elevation. I thank the member for Petrie very much for her question and congratulate her as well, as I have many times, for the outstanding work she does for her constituents, particularly for those families which really do need that extra help. It is of course the case that 12,500 families just in the electorate of Petrie have received additional help from this government to make sure -                      The SPEAKER:                     The member for Sturt has been warned once!                     that they are able to meet their everyday expenses. It is this government that is also delivering extra help to families in the electorate of Petrie and in every other electorate in the country. In Petrie, 9,700 families are receiving extra help with the costs of sending their children to school. We know that everybody over there voted no to that - no to helping families with the costs of sending their children to school. Of course, you do not trust families with managing their money.                 We on this side of the House know how important it is to help families. That is why we were so pleased to deliver the Schoolkids Bonus in the middle of this year. It was this government that also delivered Australia's first national Paid Parental Leave scheme and there are 1,400 families just in the electorate of Petrie who have already benefited from the Paid Parental Leave scheme.                 We know that this lot over there had 12 years to implement paid parental leave. This Leader of the Opposition said that it would be introduced over his dead body. As the Minister for Community Services has just indicated, we continue to help families, particularly low-income working women who are responsible for their families. What we are delivering today in the legislation introduced by the minister is certainty of a pay rise, to make sure that families can meet their living expenses. I congratulate the Prime Minister and the minister concerned for the work they have done.                 This all comes on a very special day: it is 100 years ago that Australia's first family payment for mothers was introduced by the Fisher Labor government that said that it was delivered to see that every child born into the world should have a fair start in life, and of course I can let the House know that the conservatives then, just like the conservatives today, voted no - voted no 100 years ago -

  I thank the member for his question. The member would be aware that I have taken a large number of questions like this about the impact of carbon pricing on small business, and when the opposition has chosen to table the documents and we have analysed those documents, and, on occasion, spoken to the small businesses in question, what we have found is that the facts are very, very different from what the opposition comes in here and says as part of its reckless fear campaign. We find that they are two very different things, because they have always been two very different things - the truth versus the opposition's reckless fear campaign. So if the member at any point chooses to table the documents, we will look at them. But I would make the following point to the member, as I have made in this House before: small businesses are not directly paying the carbon price; that is paid by Australia's biggest polluters. Yes, there are costs that do flow through to small businesses. We have said that that would occur, and one of the reasons that we assisted households through tax cuts, through increased family payments, through increased pensions, is that we recognise that a number of businesses would pass those costs through. But let us be clear about the dimension: 0.7 per cent, less than one per cent, of CPI, of cost of living. Let us be clear about the dimension for families: an average of $10.10 assistance a week, which is more than the impact that families would expect to see.                 On the question of small businesses, in terms of some facts that the member might want to be aware of, the Big Switch Projects report has been released, and this actually went to the costs of 66 businesses. It looked at their bills and tried to assess what has happened with carbon pricing. The Big Switch, of course, is a project being led to try and get people a cheaper electricity deal, and not because of the impact of carbon pricing but because of the impacts we have seen around the country of 50, 60, 70 per cent increases - the increases that the opposition from time to time denies exist, the 60, 70 per cent increases that we have seen in parts of the country. What this project found from those 66 businesses was that the average rise was 11 per cent, the equivalent of 2c per kilowatt hour.                 So I would say to the member once again: do not be misled by the Leader of the Opposition into following his political tactics of reckless negativity. Instead, try and deal with those people in your electorate on the basis of the facts and what is actually happening. If the member wants to table the document then we will look at it and ascertain the facts.

  I thank the member for Fremantle for the question. The member for Fremantle, as one of the Western Australian members on this side of the House, is clearly in a position where she is intending to vote and support the interests of wheat farmers in Western Australia. This process began some years ago, and we should never forget the context in which this process began - a process where the corrupted AWB 'wheat for weapons' scandal needed to be undone. Back then, with the same position that the National Party adopts today, Brendan Nelson, as Leader of the Opposition, was willing to show a level of leadership and separate the way the National Party voted from the way the Liberal Party voted on a fundamental economic reform to restore probity to the wheat-marketing system. It is a grave shame that the level of leadership that was shown by Brendan Nelson back then -                      is completely absent from the chamber now. We should not make any mistake about what this is about -                    The member for Riverina                    then                    left the chamber.                     The defenders of AWB who want to go back to the glory days can continue to call out. They can continue to pine for the days when AWB was involved in scandal, but this government wants to get back to a very simple principle that a WA wheat farmer by the name of Mark Hyde said to me some years ago, when he said: 'It's my wheat; why can't I decide who I sell it to?'                     At its core, that is all this debate is about. Those opposite are actually wanting to go back to a period where farmers are not allowed to choose who they sell their own wheat to. What has happened to the economic policies of those opposite if we are in a situation now where the simplicity of being able to sell your own product to whoever you want to is something they will stand in the way of? Imagine if instead the argument was a farmer saying, 'I want to treat my workers however I want to.' They would be clambering over themselves to say, 'It's your business; do what you want.' They will provide a level of respect to wheat that they would never dare apply to workers, and that, at its heart, goes to what has happened here. Once again, when there is a divide between the economic principles that the Liberal Party used to always stand for and the demands that are put down by Barnaby Joyce and those from the National Party, those opposite, on every economic principle, will let the Nationals run the show, even at the expense of farmers being allowed to do what they want with their own wheat.

  I thank the member for his question. The first part of the answer is to make this very important point: we on this side of the House take the Charter of Budget Honesty very seriously. What we are doing is operating within the Charter of Budget Honesty and operating within a set of fiscal rules which will bring us back to surplus in 2012-13. And, of course, we did produce the Final Budget Outcome.                 What the member fails to say and fails to acknowledge is the impact on government revenues of a write-down of $150 billion which was caused by the global financial crisis and the global recession. Those opposite pretend that that write-down has simply never happened. But they will not come into this House and say what they would have done if they had been in the position that we were in when revenues were written down by $150 billion. What we on this side of the House have done is put in place a set of policies to make savings over time to bring the budget back into surplus - $100 billion worth of savings in our first four years, $33 billion in our last budget - and we will need to make more savings to come back to surplus in 2012-13 because there has been a further write-down of revenues, and that is what I stated in the Final Budget Outcome.                 We are absolutely determined to bring our budget back to surplus, even though there are more difficult conditions. Why are we determined to do that? Because growth is at around trend, and in those conditions it is appropriate that we give the Reserve Bank maximum opportunity and room to move when it comes to interest rates. We on this side of the House have done that. We have put in place a responsible fiscal policy and made responsible savings, and we will do that in terms of the mid-term update that will come by the end of the year.                 There is a very clear contrast between that approach and the approach of those opposite, who have a $70 billion hole in their budget bottom line, and they are not going to tell anybody how they intend to fill it. On our side of the House, we are complying with the Charter of Budget Honesty, and we will continue to do that. On that side of the House, the shadow Treasurer is refusing to take the walk past Aussies to go round to the Parliamentary Budget Office -                      It is very clear that they do not take these processes seriously. The shadow Treasurer said on breakfast television, sitting beside the minister for the environment, that there was a $70 billion crater in their budget bottom line.                     We will bring the budget back to surplus. We will do it and outline all of our savings in the mid-term economic update. Those opposite intend to hide their future plans, which at least $70 billion worth -

  Thank you to the member for Page for her question. The carbon price mechanism has now been in place, as the member for Page indicated, for in excess of 100 days. Of course, before it started on 1 July, the Leader of the Opposition made countless dire predictions of the plague and the pestilence and destruction that would be wrought upon the Australian economy, Australian businesses and Australian households. Not a single one of them was based in fact, and every single one of them has been proven to be completely mendacious.                 It is worth revisiting some of these dire predictions that the Leader of the Opposition has made. Whyalla, of course, was to be wiped off the map, and we had a question earlier from the member for Grey about Whyalla and the region. The Mayor of Whyalla in fact has recently indicated that the town is 'kicking goals'. In fact, jobs and investment are growing.                 The Leader of the Opposition predicted that whole other regions of the country would be destroyed. Gladstone would be destroyed. There is $42 billion worth of investment in LNG alone going into Gladstone now. What a ridiculous proposition from a senior political leader in this country!                 He predicted the death of the coal industry, but in 2012 it is predicted that our steaming coal exports will increase by no less than 12 per cent to 165 million tonnes - in this calendar year. In fact, in my home town we are discussing the development of a further coal loader because of the demand for coal. So much for that one.                 The Leader of the Opposition predicted the death of the steel industry, the wiping out of the steel industry in this country, but what have we recently seen? A takeover bid led by Posco, a South Korean company, for OneSteel, now known as Arrium - a takeover bid for one of the companies that the Leader of the Opposition said would be completely annihilated by carbon pricing.                 He predicted the death of manufacturing. There have been 9,000 extra manufacturing jobs since 1 July - 9,000 more in the manufacturing industry. The Leader of the Opposition predicted unimaginable price increases, but the RBA could not find them, from the minutes of the last meeting that the RBA published. And of course we have seen the electricity price claims repeated here today.                   The trouble is that they do not even do enough work to know that these are tariffs which are published in Western Australia in circumstances where the Barnett government has increased tariffs by 60 per cent and where the regulated tariff for carbon is 9.13 per cent. Take the effort to read it on the bill before you give that a run next time. Everything that has been said has been completely mendacious.

                   When the government was elected, we were elected on a platform to get rid of Work Choices and introduce Fair Work - and we did. When we introduced Fair Work, we of course swept Work Choices away, but, in respect of the provisions for registered organisations - that is, the legal architecture for both the trade unions and employer organisations - we did not change those provisions. We re-enacted them - they obviously needed updating because we created Fair Work Australia, so the terminology changed - but the provisions regulating registered organisations were kept as they were under the Howard government. I make that point as No. 1.                   As No. 2, I would make the following points. The                    misuse of union members' money is of course wrong. The misuse of employer organisations of the stipend paid by employers to their organisations is wrong. Anyone who has an allegation of misuse, whether it is in a trade union or in an employer organisation, should report that expected misuse to the appropriate regulator and then it should be fully and appropriately investigated and dealt with. I would take                    exactly the same attitude to this as I take to fraud and poor conduct in corporations and to dishonesty generally. Anybody who has an allegation of dishonest conduct should take it to the appropriate authority to be dealt with.

  I thank the new Second Deputy Speaker for his important question. It is important because mental illness is still the single largest cause of disability in Australia. One in five Australians will live with mental illness this year, and one in three will experience it at some point in their life. But we know that, with the right supports, those Australians can recover - if not always permanently and completely then certainly to the point of being able to live contributing lives in our community.                 As the Second Deputy Speaker has said, today is World Mental Health Day; and, I acknowledge, it is the first ADF Mental Health Day being commemorated in our defence and veterans communities. These are occasions to reflect on whether we all are giving enough supports to the millions of Australians living with mental illness. Most importantly as governments, we reflect on the degree to which we are providing services that reflect people's needs, to make sure that they are properly coordinated, particularly for the most severely unwell in our community, which is the objective of the new Partners in Recovery program; on the degree to which we are making sure they are well targeted to young people, where most disorders emerge, hence our focus on expanding services like KidsMatter, headspace and early psychosis centres; and on the degree to make sure they are available in a range of forms, including online. Today I have announced a three-year, $16 million agreement with Access Macquarie to operate a virtual clinic attached to the mental health online portal, mindhealthconnect, which will give virtual online support to people needing counselling services, building on the 24/7 clinic already available to young Australians through eHeadspace.                 But perhaps the more challenging question to reflect on is how we continue to draw down the stigma associated with mental illness, how we get to a point where people feel as comfortable talking about mental illness as they feel talking about kidney disease or a crook knee. And although we still have a long way to go, we should recognise that we have made significant progress as a nation in recent years in reducing the stigma of mental illness. I must say that has largely been through the extraordinary courage that people who live with mental illness have shown, whether as consumers or carers publicly talking about their experiences - people like Jessica Rowe, who gave a public lecture last night here in Canberra about her battle with postnatal depression, a lecture that I suspect we all wish we were able to attend, and not only to show Jessica our support.                 We should also recognise that leadership from this place across political lines has also been enormously influential in lifting the profile of mental health. But on this day of all days it is important that we remember that that leadership also involves us demonstrating how to prosecute points of difference forcefully while also respecting the dignity and the occasional vulnerability that we all have as human beings.

  The Leader of the Opposition clearly misunderstands today's employment figures. I believe it is very important that Australians have the facts about these employment figures, rather than hearing the Leader of the Opposition's misrepresentations. Over 32,000 full-time jobs were created in September.                     Let me repeat that for opposition members who were screaming instead of listening: over 32,000 full-time jobs were created in September. There are 32,000 Australians who are now in full-time work. For those Australians, that is a life-changing moment, and it ought to be received as such by the opposition. Rather than interjecting or talking loudly amongst themselves, they should be celebrating the fact that 32,000 Australians got full-time work.                 The headline figure for the unemployment data released today has been affected by increasing participation. What that means is that more people have gone to look for work; more people want to get jobs. That is the meaning of the participation rate. When we look at today's figures very specifically - and I think we owe it to Australians to do this - we can see that nearly two-thirds of the increase in unemployed persons can be accounted for by the result in Queensland. I think anybody who knows what is happening in Queensland would know why that is occurring. The explanation is a two-word explanation: Campbell Newman. Campbell Newman and his approach to sacking Queenslanders and putting them into unemployment is showing, and showing in these figures. The kinds of things that Liberals do once they are in government - cutting jobs, cutting work, throwing Australians onto the unemployment queue - is showing in the state of Queensland. What we already know from the Leader of the Opposition is: he endorses this approach and, as Prime Minister, would be out there drafting redundancy notices for over 12,000 public servants.                     So, on the unemployment data, what this should cause people to reflect on is the damage Liberals do in government to the jobs of working Australians. Look at the Queensland figures. There is the proof.

  I thank the member for her question. We as a House have just had the opportunity to reflect on what these bombings meant to our nation, what they meant to each of us and the way in which Australians will go about their memorials and reflections tomorrow. To provide further details of the kinds of events that will happen tomorrow: they will enable Australians to have the opportunity and the moment to reflect, if they choose to involve themselves in a public event or even watch it on TV. Many people, of course, will do their reflection in their most private moments, but the government will hold memorial services in Bali and in Canberra. These services will provide an opportunity for people to gather to remember those killed and injured in the Bali tragedy. I will represent the government at the service in Bali, along with the Leader of the Opposition and former Prime Minister John Howard, while the Governor-General will lead the Canberra service. Further details about these memorial services can be found at the DFAT website for anyone who wants to see the very specific details.                 The government has announced a comprehensive assistance package for families of those killed and seriously injured in the attacks planning to attend either memorial service. For many of the families, this will be a time where they do want to return to Bali and be there at the place where they lost their loved one and where their family was cost so much. For others, that clearly will not be possible. Some will exercise the option of attending the service in Canberra. For some, of course, that will not be their way of grieving. They will not want to take themselves to a public event; they will want to do something far more intimate and private with their own family members. But, for those Australians who lost so much who do want to attend these services, a package has been made available. That is providing a similar level of support to victims and family members as that provided by the Howard government for the first anniversary in 2003. The package includes assistance with airfares, accommodation and ground transport. Even at this late stage, if people want to ring the Bali Memorial Hotline on 136125, more details can be provided.                 Our thoughts will be with these family members tomorrow as our nation grieves and remembers this event that radically changed our country.

  To the shadow Treasurer, I refer him to today's employment figures and the creation of 32,000 jobs. I refer him to the Leader of the Opposition's reckless fear campaign, which the shadow Treasurer is now trying to reinterpret because the shadow Treasurer must know the kind of nonsense that was spouted by the Leader of the Opposition. What the opposition went round saying for months and months and months was that the economy would basically halt the day carbon pricing came into effect, and that it would be a wrecking ball through our economy. Terminology like 'a permanent depression' was used. Whyalla was going to be wiped off the map.                 Let us be very, very clear here: what the Leader of the Opposition effectively predicted was the loss of hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of thousands of jobs. That was the nature of his fear campaign. The coal industry - not to exist anymore. The town of Whyalla - gone. All manufacturing - gone. A wrecking ball through the economy; a permanent depression. These were the predictions.                 What has in fact happened - and the shadow Treasurer really knows this, but feels the need to fall in line with this reckless campaign - is that we have continued to see jobs growth. We have continued to see jobs growth at a time of volatility continuing in the global economy.                 I would refer the shadow Treasurer to the work of the IMF. He might hang his head about that - needing to look at the work of the IMF - but it records, of course, the circumstances of the global economy and some of the things that are impacting on global growth rates. It also records the circumstances of the Australian economy, where we continue to see growth at trend, where we continue to see jobs created, and where we continue to see low unemployment rates. When you look around the world, who would you change with? America? No - higher than us. The UK? No - higher than us. Parts of Europe with unemployment rates at 20 per cent or 25 per cent? Here, in the Australian economy: low unemployment; low inflation; a triple-A credit rating from all three major credit ratings agencies - something never achieved by the Howard government in office.                 The opposition should stop talking the Australian economy down. Australians are proud of the economy we have created. We have done it together - employers, employees, unions and the government, working in partnership in the worst economic downturn since the great recession of the late 1920s, and we have come through, building jobs, and we will continue to build for the future through our clean energy package and build jobs at the same time.

  I thank the member for Reid for his question. The government has been entirely up-front about the impact of the carbon price on household electricity bills, because the Treasury modelling found the carbon price would increase household electricity prices by an average of 10 per cent, which equates to an average of $3.30 per week across Australian households. To meet that impact, the government is deploying the majority of the revenue from the carbon price to implement tax cuts and increase pensions, family tax benefits and other Commonwealth payments, to an average of $10.10 per week in households across the country - $10.10 versus $3.30 a week in electricity bills.                 Electricity regulator price determinations and the market itself have confirmed the Treasury modelling. In fact, in some jurisdictions the impact is less than the Treasury modelling. In South Australia, for example, the average household impact is just $1.50 per household per week. It is important to establish those facts, because the Leader of the Opposition consistently engages in a cowardly campaign of frightening people in the community and, in particular, of trying to terrify pensioners about the impact of carbon pricing.                     Just yesterday, the opposition leader, in question time, made a false statement, a false claim, about the electricity bill of an elderly Western Australian. The opposition leader told the House:                 With an $800 increase in just one bill, of which 70 per cent is due to the carbon tax _                 That is completely fallacious, totally wrong, totally deceitful. Even the most cursory examination of that bill that the opposition leader reluctantly tabled demonstrates that he did not read it. The most cursory examination of the bill demonstrates two things: a clear statement by the energy retailer that the carbon price impact is just 9.13 per cent - if you had bothered to read it, you might have noticed before you brought it into the House for your very first question. Your very first question, and you get it wrong. You do not read it.                     I apologise. The second thing evident from the most cursory examination of this bill is that the electricity consumption almost doubled compared to the previous billing period. The statements that are made by the Leader of the Opposition are totally false, totally deceitful, totally gutless. People are starting to see through the deceit that is being engaged in here and they are going to judge you very harshly.

  From the Leader of the National Party what we see is a continuation of the campaign of deceit that the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency was just exposing to this parliament - a campaign of falsehoods and misrepresentations, a campaign designed to put fear into Australians, a campaign that every step of the way neglects the facts, including bringing into the parliament yesterday an electricity bill no-one in the opposition had bothered to read, which on its face clearly supported what the government has been saying about the increase in electricity pricing caused by carbon.                     I know the member for Sturt does not want people to have the facts, but these are the facts. What the Leader of the National Party has just done in pursuit of misleading Australians is he has tried to combine electricity price rises from different sources and pretend that they are all about carbon. That is wholly untrue. That is a misrepresentation. That is an attempt to mislead. What the Leader of the National Party actually knows is that the impact on electricity prices is 10 per cent - $3.30 a week on average, when, on average, households have received assistance of $10.10 a week. Yes, there have been shocking increases in electricity that come from other sources and are the responsibility, in part, of policy settings of state governments - something about which the Leader of the National Party, to my knowledge, has never said anything, because instead he prefers to engage in this campaign of misleading.                 Australians do face cost-of-living pressures. There is no doubt about that. So the government has worked with Australians on those cost-of-living pressures, and we will continue to do so. That has included providing tax cuts, including making sure that people can earn $18,200 a year without paying a cent of tax. It has included family payment increases, including the package of sharing the benefits from the boom, opposed by those opposite. It has included the schoolkids bonus, which, to a person, everybody opposite marched in and voted against. It has included putting more money into child care, which of course is there to support families with their cost-of-living pressures.                 There is one opposition member who is prepared to tell the truth about these things - that is, Mal Washer, who has said:                 We beat the drum too hard on the carbon tax - everyone has stopped listening to the sound of it. The marrow has gone out of it - we need to move on to other issues.                 I suggest to the Leader of the National Party that he talk to Mal Washer about telling the truth.

  I thank the member for his question and note that his question is trying to get to some of the real causes of price rises in electricity. I am not surprised that it was objected to by the opposition, because they do not want people to have the facts about this matter. The member is pointing to issues which are impacting on electricity prices and have been the drivers of the big increases families have seen - 40 per cent, 50 per cent, 60 per cent - and he has particularly pointed to the drivers of costs in New South Wales.                 He is right to point to a set of market failures here - a market failure which means that there is a perverse incentive to continue to see more and more and more investment in the poles and wires of the system, the so-called gold plating. This is a market design problem. He is also right to point to the fact that there are issues associated with state governments, including the New South Wales State government - indeed, one could probably say particularly the New South Wales State government - seeking to get major dividend streams from electricity, given that they are the owners of the assets, and that those dividend streams end up being paid for by households and businesses across New South Wales. These are very concerning issues.                 From the other side of politics we have seen these issues denied. The Leader of the Opposition used to deny that network prices had been rising, ignoring households in his own electorate and across New South Wales who are now paying over $1,300 a year in network costs, when in 2007-08 they only paid $500 a year.                 It is the government's intention to work on these issues through COAG processes, including the processes engaged in by energy ministers, to deal with these market design issues and consequently to have an impact on price determinations in the future. The government is committed to that program of work. I understand that the member is going to bring before the parliament a private member's bill on this issue. We have not as yet seen the contents of that bill, and of course we are respecters of the role of private members' business, but the government's commitments relate to its work program. We will be keen to discuss this with members of goodwill across the parliament - that is, people who are prepared to deal with the public policy issues, to understand the facts, to put aside the reckless and silly fear campaigning and to act on behalf of their constituents in a responsible way.

  I thank the member for his question, because tomorrow I will attend the IMF and World Bank meetings in Tokyo. This is a difficult time in the global economy. We saw earlier this week the IMF revise down its global forecast. We see recession in Europe. We see a moderating of growth in the US. Of course, this is impacting on growth, in particular, in our region. The meetings this weekend will be important in assessing all of these trends and shaping the response of global bodies, including the IMF, to these challenging times.                 It is the case that our economy is not immune from the fallout of what is happening elsewhere in the global economy. Locally, given these global headwinds, we also have a higher dollar and we have a cautious consumer, and that is weighing on some sectors of our economy. But, if you take all of these things into account and you look at the fundamentals of the Australian economy, you see an economy which is still the envy of the developed world. The IMF is still forecasting, for Australia, growth which is greater than that of every single major developed economy over this year and next. We had the revision from the IMF only a couple of days ago, which shows that our economy is the 12th largest in the world, up three places since we came to office.                 I think all of this reflects the fact that we have strong fundamentals, and it reflects all of the hard work that has been done by Australian business and of course by workers in this country. It also reflects the response that this government put in place to the global financial crisis and the global recession - the fact that we, almost alone, avoided recession and the fact that we have been able to support employment in our community, with over 800,000 jobs created in this country since this government came to office, despite all of the circumstances of the global financial crisis and the global recession. That is something that I think everyone on this side of the House is immensely proud of because, when it comes to employment, that is the key to economic strength.                 That is why it was pleasing today to see that the expected jobs growth for September was 14,500, driven by strong growth in full-time employment: 32,100 additional jobs when it comes to full-time employment. Of course, the participation rate did go up and that meant that more people came into the labour market. It also meant that the unemployment rate did go up. But what we have to keep in mind is that this is a very strong figure for Australia and we should not be talking it down, as the shadow Treasurer the Leader of the Opposition do every day of the week. As a Queenslander, I believe the Queensland economy also has a bright future, but it was very disappointing to see the results in Queensland, with the largest fall in monthly employment on record: 20,900 jobs.

  To the member who asked the question: it is obviously impossible for me to address the specific circumstances of this hospital when the member will not table the account that he says he is relying on and when our experience, day after day, in this parliament is that electricity bills are misrepresented by the opposition, misrepresented in the most gross ways, misrepresented in order to further their fear campaign and misrepresented in order to deny the facts. Just to emphasise that point, we saw absurd claims made about the individual electricity bill of a pensioner in Western Australia, when anybody who had bothered to read it saw that the increase was 9.13 per cent. On health costs -                       The SPEAKER:                     The Prime Minister has the call.                     Thank you, Madam Speaker. Let me make it very clear that I am not addressing my remarks to the CEO of the hospital; I am addressing them to the member who asked the question and his refusal to table the document in order to inform this answer. And one wonders why he is refusing. On the question of health costs, the Commonwealth Treasury and the Department of Health and Ageing estimate that the impact of the carbon price will be 0.3 per cent of hospital costs.                      Let me repeat that again and, as the opposition interject, I am talking about figures of the Treasury and the department of health, which are the same agencies which advised the Howard government. So members of the opposition ought to treat them with some respect rather than engage in interjecting.                 The impact of the carbon price will be 0.3 per cent. That is the equivalent of only 3c in every $10 that a hospital spends. When you look at what this government has determined to do with respect to funding of hospitals, you will see that it has increased funding to hospitals in a way which means that we are covering the extra costs many times over. To take just one figure: indexation of the hospital agreement will see federal hospital funding increase by 6.5 per cent in 2012-13, going up each year to more than 10 per cent indexation in 2015-16.                  So let us just make that clear again to the opposition, which does not want to absorb the facts: indexation of hospitals is going up to 10 per cent. This is a stark contrast to the days when the Leader of the Opposition was ripping $1 billion out of Australia's hospital system, $1 billion as uncovered -                      Thank you, Madam Speaker. In returning to the question, there is no doubt, as a result of the way in which we have determined to fund hospitals, that hospitals are receiving extra resources under this government. The member should not be misrepresenting the circumstance with carbon pricing, which is the equivalent of only 3c in every $10 that hospitals spend.                  Leave granted.

  I thank the member for Moreton for his question. I can report to the member for Moreton, who I know is very interested in the creation of good jobs in Australia, that the monthly labour force figures have come out today. I can report to him that we have more Australians in full-time work than ever in the history of the Commonwealth - 8.1 million people in full-time work, and I can tell -                      I am sorry that good news disappoints those opposite, but Australia has more people in full-time work than ever before in our history. What is more, since the carbon-pricing mechanism was introduced, I can report to the member for Moreton, there have been 200 jobs created every day, which casts the lie that somehow the proposals of the government are causing unemployment. However, I do have to report to the member for Moreton some disturbing trends in the monthly labour force figures, and they do in fact refer in particular to his home state of Queensland. The member for Moreton may not be aware yet that since 31 March - about the same time as Campbell Newman became Premier of Queensland - there have been 26,000 jobs lost in Queensland.                     I will put it another way: 130 jobs are leaving Queensland under LNP rule every day since they were elected.                 This is a government that is committed to protecting people's entitlements. That is why today we are doing what the Queensland government and those opposite should be supporting. We are making sure that if the jobs of public sector workers throughout Australia - hardworking workers in Queensland, New South Wales, South Australia and Tasmania - are privatised or outsourced, and if then the business is sold to another entity, their terms and conditions are relayed and moved with them, so they retain the same conditions. We are making sure that, when a private sector worker in Australia has their business sold to another entity, they get all the same terms and conditions. We are making sure that, in spite of the second-class status which unfortunately is being visited on them by those opposite and by Campbell Newman and Barry O'Farrell, all Australian workers are treated the same. That is what you get with Labor. We look after the workers; the other side do not.                   The member for Dawson then left the chamber -

I remind the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that, in relation to these matters, there were police investigations that did ensue. If she checked the record, she would know that.

  I thank the member for Page for her question. The ACCC has today released its report on the first 100 days since the carbon price came into effect, on 1 July. The report shows that during the first 100 days, around 2½ thousand complaints were received by the ACCC. To put this into some context, this amounts to just 6.5 per cent of the total number of consumer protection complaints received by the ACCC. The complaints in relation to carbon pricing have now slowed to around four complaints a day. This shows that the overwhelming majority of businesses out there are doing the right thing; they are acting responsibly and they are not making misleading claims in relation to the carbon price.                  Of course, that is in spite of the fact that the Leader of the Opposition has been out there for two years encouraging them to jack up their prices and falsely blame those price increases on the carbon price. Those business that have not been doing the right thing - and I must stress it is a small proportion of businesses - have been the subject of very strong and robust enforcement action by the ACCC. I think that has been important in sending a very strong message to all businesses of the importance of not misleading their consumers.                  Since day one of the carbon price having been announced, the Leader of the Opposition, in contrast to the majority of Australian businesses, has been making one misleading and reckless claim after another. We saw him come into this chamber yesterday brandishing an electricity bill of a pensioner - hiding behind the bill of a pensioner - claiming that a doubling of the electricity costs of that pensioner were as a result of the carbon price. He seemed to deliberately conceal the fact that, from one quarter to the next, that pensioner, that household, had doubled their electricity usage. It seems as though he is now making another misleading claim to the Australian people - that, under their policies and their plans if they ever get elected, you can double your electricity usage and somehow, from quarter to quarter, your bills are going to be cheaper. What nonsense. This is the sort of nonsense that we have heard.                 We have heard so many misleading claims from the Leader of the Opposition. Let us look at what he has said. First he said it was going to be a cash cow. He said it was a dog of a tax. He said it was going to be a cobra strike and it would be a python squeeze. He even said it was going to be an octopus. There is a bit of a theme developing here. He has taken his reckless scare campaign not just to every fish shop and every fish market in the country; he even went to the RSPCA. We all thought that he was beginning to be the Dr No of Australian politics. It turns out he is actually Dr Dolittle. And when it comes to repealing the carbon price -

  Thank you, Madam Speaker. You were right to hesitate at the question being asked. Of course, I am happy to answer any question that I can appropriately answer, within a couple of constraints. One of those is a matter that the Commonwealth is no longer party to, which is still before the court. Justice Rares has reserved his judgement and these text messages that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is asking questions about are actually part of his determination.                 As has been publicly reported, material was provided to the Government Solicitor at the end of May. Undertakings were made, as required by the court, by all parties that the material could only be used for the purposes of court proceedings. That is the only circumstance upon which any material could be used. That is all that has been provided. Of course, I as the Attorney -                      I am answering the question as I am appropriately able to answer.                     For a member who has actually dragged the Commonwealth before the courts on the way he conducted himself in ministerial office -                      I think it is a little bit rich for him to be intervening.                     I am really not able to go into each stage of the legal advice that we have been provided with at different times. It is before the court. The legal advice is subject to legal professional privilege. That material was with the Government Solicitor. I had been briefed on that material, and I really cannot provide further information while that matter is still before the court.

  I thank the member for Blair for his question and his ongoing advocacy for tenancy services in Queensland. I can say to him, and I think it is fitting given that yesterday was World Homeless Day, that there is a strong commitment by this government to make sure we do everything we can to prevent Australians finding themselves at risk of being homeless. Therefore, tenancy advice and advocacy services are vital. They are vital in every state and certainly in Queensland.                  It is true to say that some decisions have been made by the Queensland government that would have potentially impacted adversely upon 80,000 Queenslanders who require advice of the Queensland Tenant Advice and Advocacy Service. Indeed, we know we need to ensure we prevent homelessness by having the services in place to prevent people being evicted from homes, to prevent mums and dads and kids finding themselves out on the street.                 That is why the decision by the Queensland government to cut absolutely all funding to the Queensland Tenant Advice and Advocacy Service was cruel and heartless. It was a cruel and heartless decision because it will impact so badly upon so many vulnerable Queenslanders and it was an economically absurd decision because it will cost more to look after those people who will be hurt as a result of that decision. Of course, there will be more front-line staff cut in Queensland as a result. That really does fit with the Campbell Newman approach of 'all pain, no plan' when it comes to government services in that state.                 What is more galling is that the money that has been taken from these services is the interest accumulated from the bonds paid by tenants into the Residential Tenancies Authority. So it is not even taxpayers' money; it is tenants' money that has been taken by Campbell Newman. This was a terrible decision. As a result, this government has stepped up with $3.3 million of emergency funding to ensure the 23 offices across Queensland will remain open to look after up to 80,000 Queensland families each year. We are doing that to ensure that those services are there for those who need them. I have also made clear that from 1 July next year any future Commonwealth-state arrangement with Queensland in relation to housing and homelessness will have to ensure that those services are maintained.                 Why did Premier Newman make such a decision? He has been emboldened by the shadow Treasurer and by the Leader of the Opposition, who said these cuts are good cuts. 'They are courageous cuts,' the shadow Treasurer said. They are disgraceful cuts, and we totally oppose them.

  I think it is absolutely clear that you have not read the legal services directions at all. All of our conduct in this case has been entirely consistent with the legal services directions. Not only that - it has been entirely consistent with the legal advice that we were given. It does not matter how many times people ask these questions, material that has been released to any party in litigation which is subject to undertakings given to the court is not going to be breached unless people want to be found in contempt of court, and the Commonwealth has no intention of being found so.

  I thank the member for Petrie for her question. Today's passing by the House of this legislation does ensure that the Australian government's $2.8 billion share of the equal pay increases awarded by Fair Work Australia to social and community services sector workers is able to be passed on to organisations that employ workers under the scope of this decision. The social and community services pay equity special account locks in the government's contribution to these pay rises over the eight years of this decision for directly funded programs and programs through Commonwealth-state agreements.                 This government is and has always been committed to delivering 100 per cent of our share of these historic increases. The Commonwealth is seeking to work collaboratively with all jurisdictions and has requested feedback from every state and territory to determine the appropriate amount of Commonwealth funding. This is an open and transparent process that we are undertaking, and it was disappointing to see in news reports today that the Victorian government is claiming that they need more Commonwealth funding for its supplementation, especially since the Victorian government has not yet given us feedback on its costing assumptions on this negotiation.                 Let us be clear: we are not going to pay Victoria's or any other state's share of this increase. We will fund our share 100 per cent, and we have said that. The Victorian state government made a promise before the last state election that they would pay their fair share. They committed $200 million over four years for this. They said that if it was any more than this they would fund it.                 We want to work with every state and territory government in good faith for the benefit of the workers who are affected by this decision and, importantly, for the vulnerable people in our communities who rely on their services. We have undertaken a rigorous process to calculate our share of these increases and we have tested these calculations with a number of different processes with the sector. All of our commitment, the $2.8 billion, is fully funded and accounted for in the budget. These workers will benefit from pay rises from December this year of between 23 and 45 per cent in total.                 Around 120,000 of these 150,000 workers are women in very challenging jobs, dealing with some of the most vulnerable in our community. We want to continue to work with the sector, and of course with the states and territories, to ensure the smooth implementation of this historic decision. The passing of this legislation by the House will assist the Commonwealth in making offers and payments to organisations so workers can have their payments by Christmas.

  To the Leader of the Opposition I say: haven't we heard all this before? Here we are, with the Leader of the Opposition still trying to roll out his tired old fear campaign. In fact, so dusty and so tired is it that today, for his carbon-pricing stunt of the day, he went back to a business that he had been at last September. One can only assume that this is the start of a tour, a tour that will take him to Whyalla, where he will be saying to himself, 'Gee, why is this place still here? I thought it was going to be wiped off the map', that will take him to a coal mine, where he will look and say, 'Heavens! They appear to still be mining coal; I thought all this was going to be shut down', that will inevitably take him to a supermarket -                      As part of this continuing tired, old, fear campaign there was the Leader of the Opposition today, back at Universal Trusses! Now to the Leader of the Opposition's question: the purpose of putting a price on carbon is to reduce carbon pollution - that is, it has the same purpose as when former Prime Minister John Howard was out arguing for a price on carbon. It has the same purpose as when former opposition leader Brendan Nelson supported a price on carbon. It has the same purpose as when the member for Wentworth supported a price on carbon. It has the same purpose as when the Leader of the Opposition supported a price on carbon. The purpose of putting a price on carbon is to most efficiently reduce carbon pollution generated by the Australian economy, and no amount of fear campaigning from the opposition, no amount of tired old retreads, will change that simple fact.                 Can I suggest to the Leader of the Opposition that he perhaps consider the words of one of his backbenchers, Dr Washer, the member for Moore, who, I think, very perceptively said:                 We beat the drum too hard on the carbon tax - everyone has stopped listening to the sound of it. The marrow has gone out of it - we need to move on to other issues.                 The Leader of the Opposition should listen to his back bench.

  I thank the member for Greenway for her question. She represents in this parliament an electorate where, I believe, the people truly understand the opportunities that come from the connections we have to Asia in this century. I have had the privilege and pleasure of meeting, through her, a number of her local community groups, who are seized by the opportunities that this century will bring.                 Having been asked this question by the member for Greenway, let me just reflect on the fact that we stand here today after the delivery of the government's white paper, Australia in the Asian century - the government's plan to ensure Australia is a winner in the Asian century. The contrast in Australian politics has never been clearer than it now is between a plan for the future and no plan. Our plan for the future, as laid out in the white paper I announced yesterday, is about understanding the dimensions of change in our region and about seizing the opportunities out of it. In the past 20 years China and India have almost tripled their share of the global economy. By 2025 Asia as a whole will account for almost half the world's output. Asia will also be home to the world's biggest middle class. The biggest middle class on earth will be in our region. What we have seen so far in our economy with the resources boom is a down payment on the opportunities that we can seize for the future. We, through our resources, have been fuelling the urbanisation of Asia. This burgeoning middle class will now want to buy the kinds of things that Australia has a comparative advantage in. So our task is to keep the economy strong and build on the strengths of our economy for the future - such as the strengths we have in agriculture and the food industry, tourism, legal services, education services, health services, and customised and elaborately transformed manufacturers. And the list goes on.                     And I am not surprised to be called at by the opposition when I am talking about Australia's strengths.                     Australia's economy is strong and we can build on those strengths through the people of Australia having higher skills and the capacities we will need in this century of change and through working with Australian businesses to seize all of the opportunities and potential for this time. I was very proud to deliver that plan for the nation's future yesterday and, day by day, we as a government will be delivering it.

  In answer to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition's question, I have dealt with these matters on the public record on many occasions. I stand by my statement. Isn't it interesting that here today we have the opposition, with their tired old fear campaign, having a fiddle with the rear-vision mirror as they look backwards, as we lead this nation to a future of opportunity and opportunity shared?

  I thank the member for Deakin for this very important question. We are experiencing a changing of the guard in the global economy, a shift in economic power from West to East. What is going to emerge here is the world's largest production zone and also the world's largest consumption zone. This presents enormous opportunities for Australia at the dawn of the Asian century. What is most important in maximising the opportunities that will come from growth in the region is to keep our domestic economy strong. We have one of the strongest economies in the developed world and we are set to grow faster than every major developed economy this year and the year after.                 The foundation for economic strength is strong fiscal policy, and Australia's public finances are among the strongest in the world. Just days ago we had the ratings agency Fitch reaffirm our standing as one of only seven economies with a AAA rating and a stable outlook from all three major global ratings agencies. This is the first time this has ever occurred - that stable outlook from the three major global agencies - in Australia's history. What it says is that we do have the opportunity to maximise the opportunities that will flow from the region - not just in mining but also in services and manufacturing. What we must do is reverse the decade-long decline in our productivity by making essential investments in economic capacity so that we can maximise the opportunities which will flow from growth in the region. That is why the government is investing in education and skills. It is why we are investing in science and innovation and R&amp;D funding. It is why we are investing in critical technology such as the NBN. It is why we have put in place a whole series of reforms to lift workforce participation - the tripling of the tax-free threshold, incentives for people to work additional hours.                 This is the key to maximising the opportunities that will come from growth in the Asian region in the Asian century. And this is what will make us the winner in the Asian century. We have a forward-looking program to make sure we not only create prosperity but spread it right across the country. That is why the white paper is so important. It was not a waste of money as the shadow Treasurer has said; it is an important investment in our future to maximise the opportunities that will flow to this country from strong economic growth and very good social policies which spread opportunity to every corner of our country.

  I thank the member for his very important question. We see carbon pricing as one of those essential investments in capacity which is going to grow this country in the Asian century. It is going to drive massive investment in renewable energy in this country, which is precisely what is required. For any country to be a first-rate First World economy in the 21st century, you have got to put in place carbon pricing, particularly to drive investment in renewable energy. And that is exactly what is going on: right across the region massive investments have been made in renewable energy. That is so important for the future of our country. This carbon pricing scheme that we have put in place is absolutely essential - as essential as investments in education and training and skills. It will drive innovation -                      I would refer the member to all of the details that are contained in all of our published documents. The carbon price will be $23 in 2012-13, $24.00 in 2013-14 and $25 in 2014-15, and the current projection is that it will be $29 when it floats.

  I thank the member for New England for the question and acknowledge the role he has played in advancing within this parliament the many concerns about the potential impact on water resources of coal seam gas and other developments.                 He has not been the only member to raise those concerns. Members like the member for Page and the member for Lyne have as well. But certainly the amendments that are referred to have been very much part of the negotiations and discussions that the member for New England has been leading. Those amendments resulted in two issues where there have been two different delays, which are referred to in the question. The first is a delay in arriving at a protocol with the New South Wales government. The second delay that the member refers to is a delay in setting up the finalised committee. I will just explain the reasons for each of those delays.                 The first delay with New South Wales has been that they wanted to base their protocol on their aquifer interference policy. That policy was not resolved until quite recently. There has been a fair bit of public discussion about the merits of that policy, and I will not get into that now. But the protocol has been designed to match that policy from the state government. So that is the reason that that delay has happened. We want to make sure we get a protocol that is right, and that is why that has taken a bit longer.                 On the establishment of the committee, we did have an interim committee in place immediately. We were not able to put a finalised committee in place until the legislation was through the parliament. That took a lot longer in the Senate than we expected. I blame nobody within this House, but it is true that a number of coalition senators went on a frolic that was entirely unexpected. They formed a unity ticket with the Greens and massively tried to expand the legal environmental powers that I had to go to every single land-use decision. So, for all the one-stop shop arguments and other arguments about how environmental law should be run in this country, interestingly we ended up in a situation -                      And apparently the senators are not your coalition partners, from that interjection. We ended up in a situation where that massive expansion that was proposed was rejected by those opposite who are now interjecting, and the whole legislation took quite a few months extra to be able to get through.                  It is now through, and I can advise the member for New England that I am in the final stages of being able to announce the membership of the committee. That is something I expect to be able to do in the next few days. At that point we will have a finalised committee. Because of the delays, I intend to ask the finalised committee, once it is proclaimed, to review any of the work that the interim committee has done. I am not rushing to make any decisions that are ready in the interim to make sure that the finalised committee is actually able to do its job in spite of that delay.

  I certainly thank the member for Moreton for his question. In fact, my heart was all aflutter when the shadow trade minister and Deputy Leader of the Opposition rose, because I thought I might get a question from the coalition on trade matters. But, alas, it has been 760 days since I have had a question - in fact, I never have. It makes the member for Moncrieff look like an incessant questioner. I thank indeed the member for Moreton for his question, because the Gillard government is rising to the challenge of the Asian century.                 There are marvellous opportunities being generated from our participation in growth in the Asian century. We are doing this through, in the business area, a number of initiatives, bringing together the various instruments within the trade portfolio, such as the resources of Austrade, the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation and, indeed, the Export Market Development Grants Scheme, to concentrate on those frontier and emerging markets where we see these opportunities opening up - markets such as China, of course, Indonesia, India, Mongolia, Kazakhstan.                 We have also announced a $6 million business engagement plan. This is designed to ensure that our business organisations, those bilateral organisations, have some extra support to take business missions to these countries, to develop what ultimately is the most important feature of engagement in the Asian century - and that is the people-to-people links. We can do as much economic modelling as we want, but ultimately relations with the communities in Asia depend on those cultural, economic and sporting links, and that is what we seek to build. So this is the sort of vision, of course, that we are unveiling through the Asian century white paper.                 It does, of course, stand in contrast. I thought that we might get some questions on the Asian century white paper. Unfortunately, we have still got one-trick Tony. He cannot change his habits. He is old one-trick Tony, and he is running fast out of puff. He is running fast but he is running out of puff. He is running out of puff because this opposition knows nothing other than to oppose, to say no. And one-trick Tony is out of puff.

  I thank the Deputy Leader of the Opposition for her question. It seems very interesting to me - here today in parliament, in question time, what have we had? We have had the Leader of the Opposition going back to a business he was at a year ago, we have had the Deputy Leader of the Opposition referring to events two years ago, and now we have her asking about events 17 years ago. As the opposition find themselves without ideas and without a plan, as they let down the Australian people every day with their relentless negativity, we will not -                      There is no amount of bluster from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that makes this a question about anything other than events 17 years ago. We stand here with a plan for the nation's future. They sit there with relentless negativity and a look in the rear-vision mirror of the past. I refer the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to my many public statements about this matter, including one of the longest press conferences ever given by a Prime Minister. To the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, can I say: try and find a policy or a plan; this is embarrassing.

  I thank the member for Banks for that question. He has some $83 million of investment benefiting 107 projects and 46 schools in his electorate. He knows that the government of which he is a member has a profound commitment to education. The fact is that for Australia to succeed in the Asian century we need to equip all young Australians with a better understanding of history, of culture and of the language of our Asian neighbours, and we need a school system that is amongst the best in the world.                 That is why our response to the Asian century white paper includes three national objectives to increase our Asian literacy: all students to have the opportunity to study an Asian language from the first day of school through to year 12, every student to have significant exposure to studies of Asia across the curriculum to increase their cultural knowledge, and Australia's school system to be in the top five schooling systems in the world. To help achieve this, every school will engage with at least one school in Asia to support the teaching of a priority Asian language, including through increased use of the NBN.                 Asia literacy will be a core requirement in new education reforms we are currently discussing with the states and territories and non-government education authorities, building on the work already underway and noting that Mandarin is one of the first two languages to be rolled out under the national curriculum. This is all about getting on with a plan to build a future for a modern Australia. It is all about setting us up and setting young Australians up for a future where Asia is critical and where many of the employment opportunities of the future will require high skills and will be driven by those Asian economies to our north.                 I was pleased to see that stakeholders have responded positively to our commitments. In the Australian, Adelaide university Asia expert Kent Anderson said he was really impressed with how the white paper mainstreams Asian studies and languages. The Asia Education Foundation's Executive Director, Kathe Kirby, in the Age, welcomed the education objectives that were listed in the white paper. This is the future and this government is preparing for it now.                 I am asked by the member for Banks whether there are any barriers to young Australians getting the benefits from the economic rise of Asia. The fact is - there should be no surprises - that the barriers to us advancing education opportunities for young Australians lie with the Leader of the Opposition and those sitting opposite us in the House. Remember, it was the member for North Sydney who yesterday labelled the white paper 'a waste of time' - that is, encouraging Australian students to engage in the Asian century. The Leader of the Opposition has described public school funding as an 'injustice', and the opposition shadow minister, who has been thrown out of the parliament yet again, who cannot stay in here to listen to this question, wants to see one in seven teachers sacked. I need say no more.

  Oh, to have been a fly on the wall at their tactics meeting this morning! They really brought the originality and creativity to the table, didn't they! They really thought hard this morning! 'I know,' some genius said, 'let's go on carbon again.' And then another genius said, 'Let's raise boats' - not one question about MYEFO; not one question about the Asian century white paper; not one question about the future of the Murray-Darling.                     To the Leader of the Opposition's question: yes, I am concerned about boat arrivals. I was concerned about them every day that the Leader of the Opposition came into this place and played his reckless negative politics in order to deny the nation the ability to process asylum seekers offshore. I was concerned about the cost of that reckless negativity to the nation every day it continued. And I continue to be concerned about the Leader of the Opposition's reckless negativity towards the Houston report. Let us remind ourselves who Angus Houston is. He is the former Chief of the Defence Force. Let us remind ourselves whom he was assisted by: Michael L'Estrange, a foreign policy expert, and Paris Aristotle, an expert in refugee policy. And yet, despite the delivery of that report, we have yet to hear the opposition say that it will embrace the national interest and work with the government to ensure all of its recommendations can be implemented.                     I refer the Leader of the Opposition to the budget papers. If he is genuinely concerned about this matter, then endorse the report of the former Chief of the Defence Force, Angus Houston.

  I thank the member for Makin for his question, raising as it does a very important issue that the government has addressed in the past week - another policy matter, and so it has fallen to the member for Makin, to the government, to ensure that this matter is raised in this parliament, because, from the opposition, apart from reckless negativity, apart from their tired old fear campaigns, there has been no examination today of public policy issues for the nation: Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook - no, didn't want to deal with the details of that; the future of our nation and how we will strengthen our economy and have jobs and opportunity in this century of growth and change - no, didn't want to deal with that. And I am not surprised that they did not want to deal with the Murray-Darling Basin Plan and what we are doing to ensure the health of the Murray.                 I was very pleased on Friday to be in South Australia with the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities and the Premier of South Australia, making a landmark announcement about the health of the Murray. This is of course of supreme interest to people in South Australia, but this is a truly national issue, given the significance of the Murray-Darling Basin to all of us.                 The government has announced that we will deliver 450 gigalitres of extra water to assist with environmental outcomes for the Murray. Many members in this parliament would be familiar with the work of the Murray-Darling Basin Authority and the work it is doing to deliver a plan with 2,750 gigalitres of water. Some members of this parliament would be familiar with the modelling that has been done to show the environmental outcomes that can be achieved through a return to the river of 3,200 gigalitres.                 We have announced a plan that will access the 450 gigalitres. We have announced a plan to give the environmental outcomes that, the modelling shows, comes with 3,200 gigalitres. What does that mean? Put simply, it means the mouth of the Murray will be open, it means the Lower Lakes will be in better health, it means there will be water for the river red gums and it means there will be more security and peace of mind for the people of South Australia. We know is that the words of those opposite depend upon what side of the border they stand on. They say something different in South Australia to what they say upstream. Their days of being able to peddle a double message are fast coming to an end. They will need to make a choice in this House. They will need to decide whether to vote to resolve this national issue and whether the South Australians amongst them will vote for an outcome for South Australia. We await, with interest, to see what the opposition will do.

  I see that I have goaded the opposition into raising economic matters, so that is an achievement for the day. To the shadow Treasurer, I echo the words from the day that the Treasurer delivered the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook. He spoke about our plan, our determination, to deliver a budget surplus, because that is what our economy requires now, when he delivered a MYEFO. It speaks about the projections of our economy for trend growth. It speaks about the strength of our economy, about low unemployment, low inflation, strong public finances, AAA credit rated, and how, in those circumstances, a surplus is the right policy for the nation. I refer the shadow Treasurer to the words of the Treasurer, on the day we delivered MYEFO, and I suggest to the shadow Treasurer that he actually try -                      The shadow Treasurer may not have been listening, but I have just been dealing with his question. I have been referring him to the words of the Deputy Prime Minister and Treasurer, where he dealt with this in detail when we launched the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook. What I would say to the shadow Treasurer is, rather than bluster in a desperate attempt to pretend that the opposition has got anything like an economic policy, what he might be better off doing is explaining to the Australian people the acute contradiction between his age-of-entitlement speech and what he said about the baby bonus. And he can explain to the Australian people -                      On budget matters he can explain to the Australian people his plan to rip the schoolkids bonus off every Australian family and make them thousands and thousands and thousands of dollars worse off. Talk about forgotten families! - the shadow Treasurer has forgotten them, that is for sure.

  I thank the member for Kingston for the question. She is someone who has argued relentlessly for the need for the Murray-Darling Basin to be managed as a national system, rather than be managed on a state-by-state basis. The authority have been recommending for some time the figure of 2,750 in terms of the environmental outcomes that they believe best optimise the environmental, social and economic outcomes. They have been putting forward the concept of a mechanism that allows us to deal with that.                 What the government announced last week was how the Commonwealth would engage with the mechanism, by providing the additional 450 gigalitres. It does not resolve every issue in the plan and there is still discussion happening in earnest with the different jurisdictions across the Basin, but it does resolve the commitment of this government to make sure that we are able to restore the Murray-Darling Basin to health. To have that guarantee of the additional 450 gigalitres is a very big win for those people who have been advocating for the health of the Basin. It is a very big win for each of those South Australian members, in particular, who sit beside me and behind me here.                 The decision of the government to do this through infrastructure measures should have been something that those in irrigation seats were able to claim as a win themselves. So I was shocked when a number of members - including the member for Murray - got together over the weekend to condemn what the government had put forward. They described it as having 'crippling social and economic consequences'. The reason I was shocked to hear this was up until now every word from those backbenchers has been that if you do it through infrastructure measures it is a win-win outcome. That is what the member for Murray said in her own media release on 18 June: 'Upgrading infrastructure is, in fact, the most efficient and long-term cost-effective method of securing environmental water,' which I table. That is what the member for Murray said in a media release of 29 August this year: 'Additional water should come from environmental works and measures, including the Lower Murray, or from investments in water savings,' Dr Stone said, which I also table.                 Those opposite have to realise that there will be occasions when they want to rail against something from the government. But when you have a win you do not have to say no. When you have a win and there is something you have been arguing for that the government says, 'Yeah, we will do it that way', you do not have to say no then as well - unless it is actually the position of those opposite that they just oppose improving the health of the river.                  Even if you get to the stage where you have 450 gigalitres being delivered through investment in local communities, through investment on farms, through all the things those opposite previously decided was good for the local economy, if it is good for the river those backbenchers are opposed.

  As much respect as I have for the member for Isaacs and his status as Queen's Counsel, unfortunately, if that was the statement that was made, it was wrong. A strike out application was not made by the Commonwealth, as was -                      This matter can clearly be clarified if anybody would like to check the Federal Court file, which is available online. It can be clarified if anyone would like to check Hansard, as it was confirmed in Senate estimates. And I understand from my colleague that, if you actually read the context of the comments made by the member for Isaacs, it will be clear that, as we have always said, an abuse of process application was made, but not a strike out application. That information is all there, available to see, and is incontrovertible.

  I thank the member for Robertson for asking me a question which is central to this nation's future - a question about education. I do note that the opposition member to first raise a question in question time today was the shadow minister for education but the only thing we never hear from him about is education.                 It remains undoubtedly true that if we are to win the economic race in this century of change, this Asian century of growth, then we must win the education race. We cannot have the high-skill, high-wage jobs that we seek for our nation's future unless the children who are studying in Australian classrooms today get a great education which gives them the capabilities they need to navigate the era in which they will live. That is why we set three very clear goals as part of our plan for Australia's future in the white paper which we released: Australia in the Asian century.                 First, we want to see Australia's schooling as one of the top five schooling systems in the world. That means that we have got some work to do. Whilst we have a good schooling system, in the standards of the world we have been slipping behind, and this is not a race that we can afford to lose. So we are determined to drive the quality of schooling around the country for every child in every school. We have therefore moved beyond the old politics of division in education based on school sector and moved to working on the education of every child in every school. Our National Plan for School Improvement, which will be associated with the funding reforms that we are working on with the states and territories' independent and Catholic school systems, will have this drive to be amongst the world's best embedded in it.                 Second, we also want all students to have the opportunity to undertake a continuous course of study in an Asian language throughout their school years. We have identified as priorities Chinese, Hindi, Indonesian and Japanese, and we will embed this in our school reform agenda and new funding arrangements. Third, we will ensure that we integrate Asia across all of the subjects of the curriculum through our world-leading new national curriculum.                 We know that this Asian century is real, it is changing and it is complex. I want our nation to be a winner in this century. What that means is that I want every child to win a great education, and we are determined to ensure that that happens.

  In answer to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition's question let me firstly say this: I am not the only person dismayed by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition's tactics. I do note Michelle Grattan in today's Agequoting a Liberal saying -                      In answering the Deputy Leader of the Opposition's question I do note that a member of her Liberal team has said to Michelle Grattan:                 We've drifted into the more personal politics side of things rather than dealing with the policy and allowing the muck to slide.                     Never a truer word spoken, by a Liberal dismayed by the way in which the Liberal Party has run out of puff on its smear campaigns and has descended into this muckraking.                     In answer to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition's question, I have dealt with these matters extensively on the public record, and no amount of muck and filth from her, to the dismay of her Liberal colleagues, will change that simple fact.                     I seek leave to tender the memorandum and articles of the Australian Workers Union Workplace Reform Association. I seek to table them.                     The SPEAKER:                     Is leave granted for the documents to be tabled?                     No, the Deputy Leader can file it in their mud bucket.                     The SPEAKER:                     The Leader of the House is warned.                     I rise on a point of order. Madam Speaker, I ask that you require the Leader of the House to withdraw that slur.                      The SPEAKER:                     The member for Reid has the call.

  I thank the member for Reid for that question, because Asia is undergoing a profound transformation: it is set to be the biggest economic region in the world by the end of the decade.                     The SPEAKER:                     Order! The Treasurer will resume his seat. The member for Kooyong is warned.                     The SPEAKER:                     The member for Hume is also warned.                     Speaker, I was asked a question by the member for Reid about the opportunities for the future in the Asian century - something that everyone on this side of House is intensely focused on, because we understand that to create prosperity for the future, to spread opportunity in our country, we have to be fairly and squarely focused on the region, and how we can maximise the opportunities for growth in the region. And that is what the government has done through the Asian century whitepaper. It is a positive plan for the future.                 Contrast that to the mud bucket being thrown by those opposite. We have had two questions today: all the mud slingers are out there. They have no plans for the future. We on this side of the House are going to focus on positive plans for the future. We understand that the opportunities in the region that will flow our way can create enormous wealth for Australia if we maximise those opportunities from the growth in the region.                 We understand those opportunities will come in agriculture. We understand those opportunity will come in services. They will come in education. They will come in tourism. And they will come in a whole host of professional fields. And we also understand that those opportunities will come in manufacturing if we have a plan for the future and if we have the capacity to invest in lifting our productivity - in expanding the capacity of our economy.                  Just today I was talking to 25 Chinese leaders across the road who have come here to study Australia to see how we can have closer economic relations so we can both benefit in the 21st century. What that was all about is understanding what we must do. As the Prime Minister said before, we have got to invest in education and skills. That is the key to lifting our productivity in the Asian century. We have got to invest in infrastructure. That is the key to lifting our productivity in the Asian century. We have got to reform, fundamentally, a whole host of areas of public policy, from regulation to tax. This is the positive approach of everybody on this side of the House, and it stands in stark contrast to how negative everyone on that side of the House is.                  I am not a great follower of opinion polls, but I know one thing from recent polls: the Australian people have turned off the Leader of the Opposition. And they have turned off him because of how negative he is. He does not have a positive thing to say about this country. He talks the economy down every day. On this side of the House we will talk about the positives in Australia, because we believe in Australia.                     The SPEAKER:                     The member for Indi is denying her colleague the call.

  To the shadow minister's question, we have appropriately provisioned for that in the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook. That is the same MYEFO that delivers billions of dollars in savings to return the budget to surplus, and we are on track to deliver that. The shadow minister evidences some concern about boat arrivals. Like him I am concerned about boat arrivals. I am concerned about the months and months and months of reckless delay that the negativity of the opposition costs us, and I am concerned now that they still fail to endorse the full recommendations of the Houston review.                     The SPEAKER:                     The member for Indi is now warned.                     I have a supplementary question for the Prime Minister. With 16 boats carrying over 600 passengers arriving in the last seven days - more in a week than the government estimated would arrive in a month - how can the government credibly claim it will deliver a surplus in 2012-13 with these blow outs?

  I thank the member for Melbourne for his question. I understand this is an issue that he is concerned about. I would say to the member that the basis of his question is not correct. The minister has not made it compulsory for Woodside to proceed with this proposal. What the minister for resources has done is set a time frame for the joint-venture partners to make a final investment decision in the first half of 2013 on the proposed gas processing hub at James Price Point. A strategic assessment of the environmental impacts of the project has been submitted to the WA government and is currently under consideration. After that process has ended - that is, the state process has ended - it will then be a matter for consideration by the federal government, by the Commonwealth. Finalisation of the Western Australian government's report must come first. It must precede final termination of the assessment documents. This process requires all potential environmental, heritage and Indigenous impacts to be fully assessed.

  Thank you very much. I note that the leader of the opposition is on other matters than carbon today, perhaps stung by the things I said to him yesterday or perhaps stung by Phil Coorey's piece in the Sydney Morning Herald this morning where several Liberal MPs told the Herald that Labor's recovery was now clearly a trend and Mr Abbott needs to broaden his approach.                     I thought the leader of the opposition might want to know the views of his Liberal team. On the question he asked me, as I said in answer to the shadow minister for immigration's question, we have just delivered - as the leader of the opposition may know - the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook. In it we have delivered billions of dollars in savings to return the budget to surplus and we are on track to deliver it.                 What I would be interested to know from the leader of the opposition is whether or not, when those savings are presented to the parliament, the opposition will vote in favour of them or against them. They have been out there in the community basically saying that they are opposed to them but will they vote for them or against them? The leader of the opposition cannot be taken seriously on these questions (1) because he has not clarified that (2) because the opposition has a $70-billion black hole and (3) because the opposition is running, hiding and refusing to submit its figures to Treasury for proper costing.                 When it comes to these questions of budget management, from the days of Peter Costello to now, it has been apparent that the leader of the opposition has no credibility. And no day in opposition has served him well because there is not one day that he has bothered to make a new policy statement of substance. There is not one day that he has done a proper costing. There is not one day that he has promised to put his figures in for proper assessment. There is not one day that he said he is prepared to abide by the charter of budget honesty. Until he does so then his contributions in this debate will be weighed for their worth, which is absolutely nothing.

  I thank the member for La Trobe for her question. The government is getting on with the plan to build a modern Australia, and the Australia in the Asian Century White Paper is the plan to make sure that, as the Prime Minister said, we are a winner in the Asian century. Central to us achieving those objectives set by this government is to make sure that every student in every school is getting the best possible education they can and has the foundation of Asian languages and Asian literacy in place.                 The fact is, and I think most people know it, the growth in economies like China, India and Indonesia provide fantastic opportunities for businesses and fantastic opportunities for young Australians when they come out of school and start work - high-skilled, high-wage jobs. In equipping young Australians with Asian language literacy, we know that the earlier you start a language the better. That is why we want to work with state and territory authorities to see basic language instruction starting at the very early years of school.                 We also know that it is important that once a student starts they can continue on a learning path that is not interrupted. That is why we want our education stakeholders to see that students have these opportunities through their entire schooling. I am pleased to see that teachers understand this. A teacher from Corrimal High School, John Matthes, was reported in the Illawarra Mercury as saying:                 We should focus on these opportunities with Mandarin and Hindi, and Indonesian because Indonesia is our northern neighbour and has the fourth-largest population in the world.                 He went on to say:                 Learning a second language helps you to understand your first language by helping you understand your grammar structures and how language works.                 He is right about that. Business too understands how important this is. The recent Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry release noted that education is the key to unlocking the Asian century. They say, very simply, that a strong education and training system will lay the foundations for the future.                 This government knows it, teachers know it and business knows it. Despite some opportunistic comments by the Victorian education minister, the states know it as well. Premier O'Farrell has said that New South Wales needs to focus on Asian language development, 'as much as we need to focus on industry development.' Premier Baillieu aims to have the country's most Asia-capable workforce, including compulsory Chinese language classes, for all government school students by 2025.                 That is why we have said that we will talk to the states and territories about how we can fully implement our objectives in the Asian century white paper as part of our national plan for school improvement. Unlike the shadow Treasurer we do not see focusing on improving the opportunities for students in the Asian century as a waste of time. We are committed to doing this work and we know that Australia and Australian states understand that.

  Thank you, Madam Speaker. We brought down a midyear budget update last Monday week and in that budget update we made savings of over $16 billion. We did that because we are bringing our budget back to surplus, and we stand absolutely by all of the forecasts that were contained in the midyear budget update delivered last Monday week.                     We could not be clearer than that. It is galling to have a question about surplus from the shadow Treasurer who went on breakfast television, sitting beside the minister for the environment, and admitted to having a $70 billion crater in his budget bottom line. It is completely galling to receive a question from the shadow Treasurer who will not commit to the savings that we announced in the midyear budget update.                     I was being very relevant, Madam Speaker. I stand by the midyear budget update. It is important to come back to surplus to give the Reserve Bank maximum flexibility when it comes to cutting interest rates, should they decide to do so. But what is being posed here is some form of hypothetical scenario - a what if. What if something happens in the global economy? I will say this: we have a proven track record of responding to volatility in the global economy. When our country was threatened, we saved it. And who voted against that? Everybody over there. Those opposite voted against the stimulus that saved our country. They voted against it.                     We will always do the right thing by growth and jobs in our economy, unlike those opposite, who back in 2008 and 2009 voted against the stimulus package that saved jobs and kept small business in business. We have brought down a midyear budget update that brings the budget back to surplus in 2012-13 because we understand how important it is at a time of global uncertainty to bring the budget back to surplus when the economy is growing around trend.                 What we have heard from the shadow Treasurer has been a conga line of clangers. He went out today and said that there was nothing in the midyear update about the Murray-Darling. Wrong. He went out and got the growth rate wrong - again. A conga line of clangers. He said last week that the economy was flat lining. A conga line of clangers. What we have is an appropriate fiscal policy to support jobs and growth.

  I thank the member for Blair for his question. Tackling climate change through carbon pricing is a fundamental part, in fact, of the government's dialogue with our major trading partners in the Asian region. Our trading partners in the region expect Australia - which is the 12th largest economy in the world, the 15th highest greenhouse gas emitter in the world and the highest greenhouse gas emitter in the world per capita among the advanced economies - to play a part in tackling climate change along with them. That is the simple fact of the matter.                 On that front, Korea has legislated for carbon pricing to be established through an emissions trading scheme and pilot emissions trading schemes covering about one-third of China's economy are on track to begin next year, 2013. Ultimately, the government is looking to link to these schemes in the same way that we are linking to the European Union market scheme to establish common carbon pricing and common carbon market arrangements with our major trading partners.                 The opposition leaders' claims that the climate science is absolutely crap and that Australia should do nothing to reduce carbon pollution are an embarrassment for this country in our region and they risk trade retaliation. They are economically and environmentally reckless. They might have been political opportune at one point but they are not looking too good now. The fact is that carbon pricing has been settling well into our economy over the last three months and none of the absurd and mendacious predictions made by the opposition leader have come to bear at all.                 One such prediction was that there would be unimaginable price increases - it was beyond the capacity of the human mind to imagine the price impact of carbon pricing. Guess what? He was wrong, like he has been wrong on everything about carbon pricing. His mendacious claims have known no limit whatsoever. The September CPI figures show that over the last 12 months inflation is just at two per cent, bang on the bottom of the RBA's target range. How unimaginable is that? What a joke; what a total loss of credibility the opposition leader has had. We can remember him going to fish markets and claiming that there would be incredible price rises. The CPI results for fish and seafood in the September quarter was 0.1 per cent, down 0.1 per cent on 12 months ago. Honestly, it is time that those opposite started having a look at the member for Wentworth again. Even the member for North Sydney has been looking pretty hungry on Kitchen Cabinet.

  I have already been through in some detail the MYEFO forecasts and how the government supports those forecasts and is determined to meet them by putting in place the savings to bring the budget back to surplus in 2012-13. We are making more than $16 billion of savings in the face of very substantial revenue write downs. What I said right through last week and what I have said this week is that we will always put in place the appropriate fiscal settings to support jobs and growth in our economy. That is the point that I made last week and that is the point that I am making again today. When you have an economy that is growing around trend, that has low unemployment, that has a very substantial investment pipeline, that has low interest rates and that has contained inflation that is precisely what we should be doing and that is what we are doing.                 But the importance of that fiscal policy is not understood by those opposite, because what they have actually got is a $70 billion crater in their budget bottom line, and they are acutely embarrassed by that fact.                     What I have been doing is outlining our commitment to good, firm fiscal policy, and it is not a commitment that is shared by those opposite, because they have a $70 billion crater in their budget bottom line and they have form: an $11 billion hole in the estimates they took to the last election - they had a company that was fined for professional misconduct during that campaign. And we have seen more of that professional misconduct through the life of this parliament by their refusal, when they say they have all their policies ready, to take them over to the Parliamentary Budget Office and have them costed.                 The fact is that we are implementing good fiscal policy that supports jobs and growth in the Australian economy, and at every turn we are opposed by those opposite, who are completely reckless and day after day after day talk our economy down. We will get on with the job of making the savings, coming back to surplus and supporting the forecast we have put in place through the mid-year budget update. But what we will not see from them is a commitment to the same fiscal policy by their giving support in this House for our savings.

  From the Leader of the Opposition we see another new height in creativity as he tries to re-gear his carbon tax campaign, which even members of his own backbench know is running out of puff. On the question of the budget surplus, which apparently the opposition stumbled upon for the first time yesterday, having not bothered really with the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook at all, I say to the Leader of the Opposition: if he genuinely cares about budget accounting then he may want to explain to the Australian people why, during the whole time he has been Leader of the Opposition, he has not put out one properly costed policy, not one policy properly checked by Treasury - not once, not ever.                 If he wants to be taken seriously on the question of the budget surplus then there is no better time than today to say that the opposition will fully comply with the Charter of Budget Honesty; that, instead of producing dodgy figures as they did at the last election, with an $11 billion black hole in their centre, they will get their figures properly costed. We know that what is holding them back is the $70 billion plan for cuts to services that they are currently hiding -                      On the question asked by the Leader of the Opposition, I answered it yesterday. We have just delivered the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook. What that shows is that we have built on the billions of dollars of savings realised so far with more billions of dollars of savings. What the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook shows is a surplus. We stand by the figures in the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook and we are on track to deliver the surplus that the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook has contained within it.

  I thank the member for Petrie for her question. What it serves to highlight is the fact that the difference in Australian politics can now be put down to a very simple point. On this side of the parliament we have a plan for the nation's future. On that side of the parliament there is no plan, just relentless negativity - as we have seen today with the opening question of the Leader of the Opposition. Yesterday, of course, we saw them start with muck. The day before we saw them start with their carbon tax campaign, which even backbenchers of the Leader of the Opposition's own team fear has run out of puff. On this side of the parliament, rather than being mired in that kind of negativity, we have delivered a plan for the nation's future and we are getting on with the job of shaping that and delivering that, because that is what matters for the future of Australians, for their jobs, for their skills and for their capacities, to make sure that they can seize individually the opportunities that will come in this century of change and growth.                 The member for Petrie has rightly asked me about this plan's focus on education. If you do not focus on education then you cannot focus on the nation's future. If you do not have a comprehensive approach to education then you are denying the nation the future it should have. So our plan for the nation's future focuses centrally on education. It focuses on deepening and enhancing our education links with the region of the world we live in; the growing region of the world. The new Asia-bound grants will offer between $2,000 and $5,000 for students undertaking short or semester-length study exchanges and $1,000 grants for preparatory Asian language study. In addition, we will be simplifying and broadening eligibility for increased student loans for those students seeking to study in the region.                 All up, this will support more than 10,000 young Australians to live and study in Asia and build what will be a lifetime set of choices about careers with opportunities for the rest of their lives. This comes with our focus on Asian languages, and it comes with everything we have done and said in relation to scholarship. It comes with our plan to build deeper business engagement. It comes with a comprehensive plan for the nation's future. I want our nation to be a winner in this century of change. That is why we have delivered the plan for the nation's future with education at its heart.

  I thank the shadow Treasurer for that question, because we have a proven track record of putting in place fiscal settings which will support -                      We have a proven track record of putting in place fiscal settings which support jobs and growth in our economy - and nothing could be more important to everyone on this side of the House than what we have done to support jobs and growth in our economy over the past five years. When the global financial crisis and the global recession threatened, we put in place a substantial response to support jobs and to support small business in our community. As a consequence we did not experience a recession, as did just about every other developed economy in the world. The consequence of that has been that our economy is stronger than just about any other developed economy in the world. We are expected to grow faster this year and next than other major developed economy.                  When we put that stimulus in place we also outlined fiscal rules to bring our budget back to surplus - and, since that time, that is precisely what we have been doing. We have put in place a set of fiscal rules to bring us back to surplus. And because there has been $160 billion in revenue write-downs, we have had to put in place $150 billion worth of savings in our budget.                     So we brought down the mid-year budget update nine days ago. In that budget update we forecast coming back to surplus in 2012-13, and we made $16 billion worth of savings. We made those because there were further revenue write-downs which hit our budget. But in an economy which is growing at around trend, in an economy which has contained inflation, in an economy where there is a very substantial investment pipeline, it is entirely appropriate in those economic conditions to come back to surplus.                  That is why we put in place savings - tough savings - which are not supported by those opposite. Those opposite come in here and cry crocodile tears about a surplus but are not prepared to support any savings in this House which will bring our budget back to surplus. So the test is for them. A $70 billion crater in their budget bottom line was announced on breakfast TV, sitting beside the minister for the environment -                       We are putting in place the savings to bring our budget back to surplus. What this question proves is how unfit for high office the opposition are. They have no understanding of the economy, no understanding of the basic economic facts -                      and all they can run are negative scare campaigns.

  I thank the member for that question. This side of the House has a plan for the future - a positive plan for the future which is based on an understanding that there is a fundamental change in the global economic outlook: a shift in economic power from West to East. And that shift in economic power from West to East brings enormous possibilities for our country. If we put in place the right set of policies to maximise those opportunities, we will continue to grow strongly. We do that from a position of strength. We are the 12th largest economy in the world, up from 15th. Three places we have improved since this party has been in power. We are 11 per cent bigger than we were as an economy prior to the global financial crisis, while many other developed economies are still struggling to get back to where they were back in 2008.                 We are in this position of strength to maximise the opportunities of the Asian century precisely because of the actions that we took back in 2008-09 to strengthen our economy. We know where the economy would have been if those opposite were in power: we would have gone into recession. We would have had many more people unemployed, and many more businesses would have hit the wall. We are in a position of strength right now precisely because the government got the economic settings right over the past five years.                  In our response to the Asian century white paper we are getting the response right - yet again - for the future, to create the jobs of the future, to invest in education and innovation and research, to put in place the fundamental reforms that are required to lift the capacity of our economy. Unlike those opposite, we understand the importance of productivity growth, and the Prime Minister particularly understands how important investment in skills and education is in the Asian century. What we see is the high skilled, high-wage path forward - forward in the Asian century - not the low skilled, low-wage path that those opposite see.                  Only last night they were in the parliament voting against bills to protect workers' entitlements. Their path to the future is lower wages and their path to the future is to attack the wages and working conditions of Australian workers. What we believe in is investing in our workforce; what they believe in is tearing it down. So what you can see is a fundamental approach here, a plan for the future, and what you see from those opposite is simply talking our economy down and being negative all of the time.

  I am really pleased I have been asked a question about priorities and am delighted to get a question when it comes to carbon pricing. I am delighted to get a question that follows a discussion on the Asian century and how the path forward is the high-wage, high-growth path that is plotted for us in the white paper, because one of the foundations of growth in the 21st century is putting a price on carbon - putting a price on carbon so we can drive investment in renewable energy. Driving investment in renewable energy is the key to prosperity in the 21st century for a developed economy. So we do not apologise, for one minute, for putting in place a fundamental reform that drives investment in renewable energy. But what we get here - day in, day out - is all of this negative talk, all of this exaggeration, all of this approach which simply trashes public policy.                  We do not apologise for what we have done with carbon pricing. It is absolutely essential to the jobs of the future. You can ask as many questions like that as you like; you will have no impact. I will tell you this: the public of Australia are no longer listening to this negative approach. They are sick of the harping. They are sick of the carping that is coming from those opposite. They are absolutely fed up with the approach of those opposite.                     We do not apologise for any of the investments that we make in reducing carbon pollution. We do not do that at all.

  I thank the member for Kennedy for his question, and I know how concerned he is about these issues of water use not only in Queensland but also across the nation. He and I have had an opportunity to speak about them in the past, and he is raising them in the parliament today because they are matters of passionate concern for him. I say to the member for Kennedy that I certainly will be pleased to receive a deputation with him and with community members to talk about the Pentland-Charters Towers project that he referred to in his question.                 The member for Kennedy and I have, in the past, talked about micro-irrigation projects in North Queensland and I will be pleased to talk about those matters too. I know that they are of concern to him, and I know that he has been working strongly with local government. He referred to Mayor Daniels and referred to the formation of a cooperative and the Cloncurry project. I will be very happy to pursue discussions with the member for Kennedy on those questions too.                 To the member for Kennedy: the government is working hard on water reform. We have been speaking today in this parliament - as we did yesterday and the day before - about our delivery on the weekend of a plan for the nation's future. We live in a century of change and growth. We live in a time when Australia is uniquely positioned to seize these opportunities, and so I was pleased and proud to deliver that plan for the nation's future. But immediately before delivering that plan, working with the minister for water, I made an announcement about the Murray-Darling, and I know that the member for Kennedy follows this closely. That announcement is about ensuring that we can get good environmental outcomes in the Murray-Darling.                  This basin matters to the whole nation. It matters to the people of South Australia, where I grew up. I know that the member for Kennedy is keenly following this reform agenda and would have followed the announcement we made on Friday. He would know that there is legislation before the parliament dealing with 450 gigalitres being released through infrastructure work. He is also following the delivery of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. So I will be happy to talk through all of these questions with the member for Kennedy. I thank him for his question and for his continued passion for irrigation and water reform.

  I thank very much the member for Fowler for his question and note that members of his local community will soon see the rollout of the NBN in parts of Liverpool, Ashcroft and Mount Prichard. We do indeed have an ambitious plan for the future that positions our nation for the Asian century to take advantage of the opportunities that are there and to make sure they are spread throughout the community. That is what we are doing, and part of that has to be investing in modern, nation-building infrastructure - including the NBN.                 The NBN is critical infrastructure to embrace the opportunities that are there for the Asian century. We have in Australia suffered from the tyranny of distance between ourselves on such a vast island continent and our distance from the rest of the world. The NBN will bring us that much closer and overcome those distances so that location becomes unimportant. That is why we, like our counterparts in Japan, Singapore and South Korea, are investing in super fast broadband. This will be a major boost for business enabling all Australian companies better access to Asian markets, so unlocking opportunities for greater regional collaboration and innovation and opening up new educational opportunities for our schools, our TAFEs and our universities - providing access to the best available resources from across the nation and the world. With the right plan we can maximise the benefits from the new middle class in Asia by creating high-paying, highly-skilled jobs for Australians. Our ambitious infrastructure agenda is a key part of this plan.                 In addition to the NBN, we are investing $36 billion in our Nation Building Program in critical road, rail, port and intermodal infrastructure so that we can get our goods to markets and so that we can engage in trade in the region; the full duplication of the Hume Highway, which will be completed over the coming months; the rebuilding of one-third of the interstate rail freight network; and the building of the Moorebank intermodal terminal in south-west Sydney, which will create 1,700 jobs on a permanent basis and provide real opportunities for employment in south-west Sydney as well as make a big difference to the functioning of the port at Port Botany and to our efficient nation-building infrastructure, because it is on the interstate rail freight network as well. We have this plan. Those opposite are showing today, yet again, that all they have is relentless negativity.

  I do welcome the question and, as is usual, I will have to go away and check the facts that have been put forward. The member for Mayo, for example, asked a question before that was inaccurate, because the money that is going through that fund was actually allocated -                      The government are delighted to receive a question about the NBN because we are very proud of what we are doing. Of course, we did account for our expenditure on the NBN in the mid-year budget update, as we have done in all of our budgets. We are also very pleased with the progress of the rollout which has accelerated since we have made the arrangement with Telstra. For example, by the end of this year construction will have commenced or be complete for 758,000 premises. By mid-2015 work will be complete, underway or due to begin in 3.5 million homes and businesses. Why is that important? It is important because we have had something like 22 failed broadband plans from those opposite - 22 failed plans. The government are very happy and very proud of what is being achieved by the NBN, and we think it is very good value for money.                 Some assertions have been made by the member for Wentworth. But I was saying before that the member for Mayo actually distorted the facts, because the Clinton Foundation grant was approved by Alexander Downer in the Howard government.                     I will step away and take the so-called facts that the member for Wentworth has put forward. I will go away and check them because usually you cannot rely on anything they say.                 Leave not granted.

  I thank the member for Kingston for her question, and I acknowledge that the member for Kingston along with other government members from South Australia - indeed, all of the government members from South Australia - have been keenly interested in the future of the Murray. Representing their constituents, the people of South Australia, in this place they have felt acutely the consequences for the Murray when there have been severe droughts, and they have felt for the people of South Australia how important it is for the Murray to be returned to long-term environmental health. These are sentiments that I can well and truly understand. Growing up in South Australia, you know that the health of the Murray, that great river, is pivotal to the health of that state.                 As Prime Minister working on water reform for the nation it has also become increasingly clear to me that it is pressing for the whole nation for us to deliver the right reforms for the Murray-Darling Basin to make sure that we get it right for the whole of the Murray-Darling Basin and to make sure we get it right for the long-term future. That is why I truly believe we are presented with a once-in-a-generation opportunity to deliver a long-term plan for the future of the Murray-Darling Basin. We are getting on with that job.                 The Murray-Darling Basin Authority has proposed a plan starting with a benchmark of 2,750 gigalitres of environmental water, and the same authority has recently released modelling which shows that we could deliver an additional 450 gigalitres by removing constraints in the system and funding river infrastructure. Importantly, the plan proposed by the authority stipulates that additional water above the benchmark should only be acquired through ways that deliver additional water without negative social and environmental consequences.                 I was pleased to stand in South Australia with the minister for the environment and water and to say that we want to make this happen. We want to make the 450 gigalitres extra happen, and we have allocated $1.7 billion in the mid-year budget estimate to make it happen. Contrary to what was mentioned in the House yesterday by those opposite, this was provisioned for in MYEFO.                 I congratulate all of those who have campaigned for the long-term health of the Murray-Darling Basin. I once again congratulate government members for doing so. I congratulate the Adelaide Advertiser for its campaign in mobilising the people of South Australia. I also congratulate the Premier of South Australia for his strong leadership of that state and for his pressing for the importance of this major reform. It is a plan for the future and we intend to deliver it.

  I stand by all of my statements on this matter. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition has referred to a number of documents. Let me refer her to an important quote made by the opposition leader yesterday: 'I will leave the nasty personal politics to the Labor Party. I'm going to focus every day on what matters to the Australian people.' Did the opposition leader endorse the asking of this question? My question is very relevant, given that statement yesterday.                 Leave not granted.

  I thank the member for Wakefield for his question. Australia has never been closer to the reform of the Murray-Darling Basin than we are today. I want to commend not only the member for Wakefield but indeed all those South Australian members on this side of the House for the arguments that they have run relentlessly in pushing for the restoration of the health of the Murray-Darling Basin. I also want to acknowledge the contribution of the member for New England in ensuring that, in going down this path, we work with communities. In that way, we have made sure that we have the minimum standards required to restore the Murray-Darling to health. But, wherever we have been able to meet those environmental standards in ways that work with communities, we have taken those options.                 Shortly - in the next few weeks, once the Senate have dealt with the legislation that went through this House last night - I expect to be able to sign off on a Murray-Darling Basin plan. That plan will have a benchmark of 2,750 gigalitres, with the environmental consequences attached to that. I do not believe and the science does not say that those environmental consequences on their own are enough to restore the basin to health. The reason the authority could only go that far is capacity constraints in the system. That is why the Prime Minister gave a guarantee at an event with the Premier of South Australia last week that the government will provide the money to remove those capacity constraints and get the additional 450 gigalitres that the Murray-Darling Basin so desperately needs.                 That not only provides an environmental benefit for South Australia but also provides environmental benefits across the basin, whether you are at the Macquarie Marshes, Menindee Lakes or at the Hatter Lakes. The Ramsar wetlands up and down the Murray-Darling Basin all stand to benefit from a return to health here.                 Given the history of some of those opposite, people such as the member for Wentworth, who have played a role in getting us to this point over the years, I was astonished to have the member for Sturt describe Murray-Darling reform as being part of a 'blizzard of distractions' - he gave a 'blizzard of distractions' as a description of Murray-Darling reform. We have an opportunity in this House to actually do what generations before us have always failed at. I know the member for Sturt, apparently just today, described the South Australian Premier's role as making him a weakling. That is always a mean thing to say, but to be called a weakling by the member for Sturt would I think hurt in a very big way.                 Let me leave you in no doubt that it is the case that anyone who stands on the side of restoring the system to health is on the right side of this debate. They are on the side that for generations the basin has been waiting for and that the House will deal with soon.

  As I have explained to this parliament in the past, when we replaced Work Choices and its dreadful rip-offs of working people, when we replaced the fact that people could be dismissed for no reason, when we replaced the industrial laws that had hurt working women the most, when we replaced those vile laws from those opposite, the Leader of the Opposition and the opposition generally, what we did was create the Fair Work Act and fairness and decency at work. What we also did in relation to the provisions for registered organisations was effectively bring them from the former legislation into new legislation - that is, there was no substantive change to the provisions for registered organisations.                 The offences in Work Choices were against working people. They were about working people having their penalty rates ripped off, they were about working people being unfairly dismissed, they were about working women being unable to secure equal pay, and the list went on and on. So we fixed all of that, but, as for the registered organisations provisions, they appear in the Fair Work legislation - or they did appear in the Fair Work legislation - effectively in the same terms as under the former Howard government. Then, of course, in the recent period -                      I am pointing out to the member for Sturt that the provisions were in the same terms as the provisions that he supported when he was a member of the government. So it would seem to me incredibly negative for him to suddenly be opposed to them when he supported them every day in government.                 Since then, and in the light of some recent issues, the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations has brought into the parliament, and the parliament has passed, new laws for registered organisations, particularly relating to transparency. So the answer to the member for Sturt's question is that initially the laws were in substantively the same form as the Howard government's and since then this government has chosen to tighten them up.

  I thank the member for Capricornia for her question. I know that she is very committed to ensuring that workers get a fair deal at work.                 I can report to her that the government has done a range of measures, and there are four that come to mind immediately. First, after the long, dreary years of the Howard government's industrial relations, we introduced a bargaining system that has now seen 2.2 million Australian workers covered by over 16,000 agreements. That is one tick. The next tick is that we extended unfair dismissal protections to cover seven million Australian workers so that people at least have some remedy against unfair dismissal. That is another tick. Indeed, since Labor was elected at the end of 2007, we have seen 800,000-plus jobs created. That is good news for workers and another tick. The fourth provision is that we increased compulsory superannuation from nine to 12 per cent, which means that Australians will have more money to retire on than they would have if the coalition had been in power.                 But I can report to the member for Capricornia that last night there was a further development to improve the protections for Australian workers. I am referring to legislation that was passed called the Fair Entitlements Guarantee. Last night this Labor government put into statute the existing protections that exist in an administrative scheme known as GEERS.                     Spot on. As the member for North Sydney says, it was set up by the opposition. This is why what happened last night is so mind-numbingly perplexing, by the opposition. This was a scheme that we have improved -                      This is a scheme that we have improved. We have polished and improved it, because we always do better for workers than those opposite. But what is interesting is that this is a scheme to protect workers who are at risk of losing their entitlement. It is a scheme of last resort to help bail out workers who risk losing entitlements. So, even though the member for North Sydney says, 'Hang on, don't take credit; that is our idea,' why did you vote against it last night? What happened last night is that they decided to lower it because they have never seen a worker's condition they do not want to cut, and, when they could not get their amendment up, what did they do? They threw their toys out of the cot and said they would vote against the whole lot.                 So the 14,000 workers in the last financial year who have benefited from the GEER Scheme should be grateful that there is a Labor government. The 64,000 workers who have benefited from the GEER Scheme since we were elected should be grateful for a Labor government. And I tell you who else should be grateful: all those workers in the future, because if the opposition had their way they would do over - they would further injure - workers who lost their entitlements courtesy of insolvency. Those opposite showed their real form on industrial relations last night: cut, slash and burn.

  I thank the member for his question. The member, in the last part of the question, referred to the Cooper review. We have been implementing various recommendations of the Cooper review as part of a major reform of superannuation. Members of the parliament would know how routinely superannuation legislation comes before the parliament, and the government has been working on a major agenda of change - things like the MySuper system and the other efficiency measures that have been there for the recipients of superannuation. We will continue working on the recommendations of the Cooper review. Of course, we want people who are guiding superannuation funds to be people of quality and people of integrity; we would all want that for people in superannuation funds. So, whether there is an issue arising because of someone's involvement in a business or whether there is an issue arising because of involvement in a union, of course we would want it properly dealt with.

  I thank the member for Fremantle for her question. It is good to have a number of Western Australian members of this parliament who will be defending the interests of Western Australian wheat growers, because there are quite a number who intend to vote entirely against the interests of wheat growers. The process of moving away from the truly ugly days of the AWB monopoly has gone through a few stages. We began with an entirely regulated and controlled system. We then went through a system of partial deregulation in the last term, and we have legislation before the parliament now for full deregulation. There were media conferences before we came into parliament today, with a number of additional undertakings, such as switching with the ACCC from a voluntary code to a mandatory code, that have been of particular interest to the Greens. I am pleased that those negotiations have gone the way they have.                 But think, in the plan of deregulation, about the pathway we have gone down. When I was agriculture minister and introduced the first stage of that plan, we did have amendments from those opposite. They said we were not going far enough. They said that the amendments that were designed by the member for Groom, that were put forward in the Senate and that were accepted by us - when the Liberal Party were going ahead with the values that the Liberal Party were meant to hold, back with Brendan Nelson - were all about saying, 'You're not pro-market enough.' All we are saying here is that a wheat grower grows the wheat and they should be able to choose who they sell it to. But these days the only thing we are asking from the Liberal Party is that they in some way support free enterprise. It has become too much to ask the modern Liberal Party to be on the side of free enterprise.                     If there were ever an example of how much the Liberal Party have changed under this Leader of the Opposition, it is the fact that they now cannot bring themselves to allow a farmer to choose who they want to sell to. If there were ever an example of how the Liberal Party of today is fundamentally different to what it was throughout its history and to what it was even three years ago, this is it. How many of the Liberal Party backbench intended to join the DLP? How many members of the Liberal Party backbench thought they were going to end up with the economics of Bob Santamaria when it came to what you are allowed to export? But that is the decision that is now before this parliament. If you will not even give the basic threshold level of allowing a business to choose who they will sell their products to, then every member of the Liberal Party needs to know they are in a fundamentally different party under this Leader of the Opposition to the one they ever joined.

  Well, I am surprised they are now supporting a resource rent tax in the House - isn't that a turnaround! The fact is that unused royalties are not transferrable, nor are they creditable. We had statements to the contrary in the House today by the shadow Treasurer. But I do welcome the opportunity to put a few facts on the table about the MRRT, because those opposite will go to great lengths to distort any fact, to tell any untruth, about this tax, and it is very important that we understand what is going on.                 The MRRT is an important mechanism to spread the benefits of the mining boom right around our country. And the fact is that the opposition have been making assertions which are simply untrue. The first fact is that we have forecast $9 billion over the forward estimates. Yes, that is a write-down of revenue of $4 billion over the forward estimates. But why has that happened? That has happened because, between the budget and September, iron ore prices crashed 38 per cent. When prices are down and when profits are down, resource rent taxes are down. If you were to take the logic of those opposite, they would be repealing the PRRT, which supplies some billion dollars of revenue to governments each year. The fact is that they have not been telling the truth about what we put in MYEFO and about what is going on with the MRRT. The final numbers will come to us when the tax office have complied with all of their legal obligations and completed their analysis, paying due regard to the privacy conditions that they operate under. And for the opposition to go around and make all sorts of outrageous claims about revenue just proves how dishonest they are.                 The fact is that we will be publishing, on a monthly basis, the outlook for MRRT revenues, consistent with the advice that we receive from the tax office, particularly when it comes to privacy. And we are not supplied with any estimates when it comes to individual companies at all. But the fact is that they want to come in here and cry crocodile tears over a tax that they want to abolish, because they want to kneel at the feet of the mining billionaires and vested interests. That is why we are getting all of the crocodile tears.                 The first thing they could do when we announced a resource rent tax was to run out the door, get on bended knees to the mining billionaires and vested interests and say, 'We'll give you a tax cut.' That was the very first thing that they did.                     We have put in place a tax which will ensure that, over time, the Australian people will get fair value for the mineral resources they own 100 per cent.                   The member for Wright then left the chamber.

  I would like to thank the member for Hindmarsh for his question. It is important to remind the House that the Treasury modelling of the impact of the carbon price showed that the price impact would add 0.7 per cent to the CPI in financial year 2012-13. That was the Treasury modelling, and it has been mentioned many times.                 Following the release of the September quarter CPI figures last week, some economists are in fact predicting that the impact will be less than that forecast by the Treasury. For example, the Commonwealth Bank senior economist Michael Blythe said the following: 'It is looking as if the Treasury's figure will be an overestimate rather than an overestimate.' And that is very good news for Australian households, recipients of tax cuts funded by the carbon price, recipients of pension increases funded by the carbon price, recipients of family tax benefits funded by the carbon price - all good news.                 But of course the most notorious prediction came from the Leader of the Opposition about the price impacts of carbon pricing. He has travelled the country claiming time and time again that there would be unimaginable price rises on - you name it; just think of any commodity: meat pies, sausage rolls, tomato sauce, Weet-Bix, fish fillets, wetsuits, anything! Unimaginable price impacts were predicted by the Leader of the Opposition.                 We know that he is not real good on forecasting the stock market, but he is even worse with regard to the CPI. Now that the September quarter CPI figures are in, we can do a few price checks. The Leader of the Opposition went to Sanitarium's Weet-Bix factory, for example, and claimed that prices would be much, much higher. But the CPI figures show that in fact breakfast cereal prices fell by 0.9 per cent in the first three months of the carbon price. The Leader of the Opposition went to a dairy farm. He said that the price of milk would go through the roof, that milk would be unaffordable. The CPI figures for the September quarter showed milk prices down 0.5 per cent.                 Senator Barnaby Joyce, that great soothsayer, a sage and a seer, said that a lamb roast would cost $100 after the carbon price came in. Lamb prices were down 2.3 per cent in the first quarter of the carbon price coming into effect. Lamb prices are down. The opposition leader claimed that motorists would not be able to get into their cars - another mendacious claim. There is no carbon price on fuel at all. A totally mendacious claim!                 It is time that the Liberal Party moved on from the DLP leadership and that the Liberal Party became a Liberal Party once again. Give the member for North Sydney a go; give the member for Wentworth a go. They are both starters. There are a couple of roughies there. I like the member for Menzies for the job. He has put up his hand before. Put someone else on who can tell the truth.

  To the member's question: I do not think that, after the years that we have lived through, anybody could deny or doubt my capacity to argue for and deliver a price on carbon. We have got it done. And to the members opposite who hung their heads during the minister for climate change's last answer: imagine how you are going to feel in 12 months time.                 I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper.

  I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question, and we end the week as we started it - with the opposition back on their campaign of fear, their mendacious claim to try and scare the Australian people about the impact of carbon pricing. All of these claims come from a leader of the opposition that brought you the statements that Whyalla would be wiped off the map, the coal industry would shut down and roasts would cost $100.                 To the Leader of the Opposition: he ought not to verbal the Treasurer; the Treasurer yesterday went through a number of factors which, in combination, bring us economic growth. Put simply, we have to be ready for the challenges of the future. We live in an era of remarkable change. We are in the area of the world that is changing the most. It is the area of the world undergoing a profound transformation which, in its size and scale and speed, leaves the industrial revolution in its wake.                 When you are living in an era of change, you can either decide to be ready for that change or sit and do nothing - or, even worse, pine for the past and not be ready for that change. Undoubtedly, one of the things that is changing in our world is that people are dealing with climate change and tackling carbon pollution. Provinces in China are, South Korea is and nations in our region are moving. And we have a choice for our economy: do we wait till the final moment and have a huge dislocation in our economy to try and catch it up to what will then be required by the world, or do we have the most efficient transformation possible at the lowest cost?                 The Leader of the Opposition has endorsed a target of reducing carbon pollution by five per cent by 2020. That, supposedly, is bipartisan policy. You then ask yourself the question: if we are going to get there, does it pay to start now or leave it to 2019? Well, common sense tells you: the sooner you act, the easier the transition will be.                 Then the other question you ask yourself is: what is the most efficient way of doing it? The Liberal Party, before it was led by this Leader of the Opposition, believed in a market mechanism to achieve that transition, as do we. The Liberal Party of Prime Minister John Howard believed that. It is truly to be regretted that this Leader of the Opposition has driven the Liberal Party into climate change denial and extremes, and that is what is represented by his question today.

  I thank the member for Page for her question. The member for Page, in asking her question, is showing, on behalf of her constituents, the common sense and the understanding that you will realise the best possible future if you plan for it rather than just having yourself or your nation drift into a future determined by others. Our nation is here, in contemporary times, and that means that we live in a tough and unpredictable world. We saw the consequences of it being a tough and unpredictable world with the global financial crisis.                 And we got the judgement calls right - the government working with employers, working with trade unions and working with the Australian community. We got the judgement calls right to save jobs - 200,000 of them - and to keep our country out of recession. That means we emerged strong and resilient from this time of real impact in the global economy, AAA credit rated, with low unemployment, inflation and interest rates, having cut taxes so that you can keep $18,200 before you pay a cent of tax.                 But in a world that continues to change, in the scale, size and speed of the transformation we are living through in our region now, we have to keep planning for the future. That is why the government has delivered a clear plan for this nation's future. We did that on the weekend with the delivery of the white paper showing how Australia can be a winner in this century of economic growth and change in the region in which we live.                 We have identified at the centre of that plan the need to make sure we win this economic race by winning the education race. The jobs of the future will be high-skilled jobs. Higher-skilled jobs can be higher-wage jobs. It is good for the Australian community to have a future where you can find employment and where that employment is high skill and high wage. But it will not happen by accident and it will not happen if we allow our schools to slip behind the standards of the world, which is why we are so focused on driving our schooling system into the world's top five. It will not happen if we do not have infrastructure at the standard of the world, which is why we are focused on the delivery of the NBN, as well as traditional infrastructure, like roads, rail and ports. It will not happen if we continue not to act on challenges like climate change - if we follow the Leader of the Opposition down this path of recklessness and negativity. We need to ensure that there is a clean energy future.                 Australians are an optimistic people. They can have confidence in our plan for the future, and we will get on with the job of delivering that plan.

  The Leader of the Opposition's version of leadership might be being dictated to by editorial writers in the United States of America, but my version of leadership is coming up with a uniquely Australian plan for our nation's future. As Australians standing in this parliament I actually think it is our duty as Australians to make sure we are making decisions that are in the best interests of our nation, and as Prime Minister I will always do that.                 It is in the best interests of our nation that at this time of change in our economy, when we see our resources sector going strongly, which is of course a down payment on the economic opportunities of this Asian century of change, that we make sure we have in place the right tax policy so that we can share the benefits of that period of resources growth. I believe that is the right policy, and the government has delivered it. It is a profits based policy. That is why it is an efficient tax. It is obviously true, manifestly true, that, as commodity prices rise and fall, the degree of taxation moves with it. That is why it is a profits based tax - because that is the efficient way of taxing.                 To the Leader of the Opposition: it is really an interesting kind of schism in the characterisation of the opposition on the minerals resource rent tax. They used to tell us that it was so big, so onerous and so crushing that it would destroy the resources industry. Now they tell us that apparently it is not big enough and it is not raising enough money.                     One wonders how people can get up in the morning and actually have these ridiculous double standards in their head. Of course, one could conclude that the opposition is incapable of reason. But what I think is more likely than that is that, whatever the reasoning is, they will always be negative. So they do not mind on one day saying that the tax is so big it will destroy the resources industry and the next day saying the tax is too small and is not raising enough revenue. The only thing that brings this opposition together, the only point of coherence in their whole strategy, is being negative about everything, every day, every time, and making sure they are always negative about Australia's future.                     We are on a different path, with a plan for Australia's future befitting a confident and optimistic nation, and that is who we are.

  I thank the member for Parramatta for her question, because overnight we had another stark reminder of just how difficult conditions are in the global economy, with unemployment across Europe and the eurozone hitting a shocking 11.6 per cent. The situation here could not be more different. In the eurozone there are something like 18½ million people in the ranks of the unemployed, but we have seen here in Australia 800,000 jobs created in the period of this Labor government. Our unemployment rate has a five in front of it, which is less than half the rate in the eurozone. Of course, that is a direct result of direct actions taken by this government to support our economy in the face of a collapse in global demand during the global financial crisis and the global recession.                 As a consequence of that, our economy is stronger than just about any other developed economy. If those opposite had had their way, Australia would have experienced a recession and we would have had the capital destruction and the skills destruction that goes with that which are still being felt across developed economies right around the world.                 Everybody on this side of the House is proud of the actions taken by this government to support employment, to support jobs and to support small business - and, in particular, to ensure that so many Australians were taking home a pay packet. We will always support those on low and middle incomes, unlike those opposite, who have been in here, in the parliament, in the last couple of days hacking away at wages and working conditions and supporting policies that will erode the living standards of working Australians.                 We understand that the global economy does have a dramatic impact on the future of the economy in this region. One of the reasons I am going to the G20 meeting in Mexico over the weekend is to talk with my colleagues and other finance ministers about what must be done to reinvigorate global growth, because global growth with a three in front of it is simply not going to enable a reduction in unemployment levels across the country. So we do need some decisive action through those bodies.                 But what we are seeing - and this is what works in Australia's favour - is this shift in economic power from the West to the East. Here in this region we appreciate the opportunities that lie before us, which is why we have published the Asian century white paper. We understand that putting in place a range of policies to support capacity in the economy and productivity growth is the way of the future. That is our plan for the future. It stands in very stark contrast to the approach of those opposite. We want to build our workforce up; they want to tear it down. We have a very clear plan for the future; they have an approach that is simply stuck in the past.

  I really do thank the shadow Treasurer for that question, because I not only understand the legislation; I support it. Unlike those opposite, we support a resource rent tax. We supported the PRRT and we are supporting the MRRT. In the forecasts, we are forecasting revenue of $9 billion. It is true that we are not providing a refundable credit, such as the refundable credit that was put forward in the RSPT. It is also true that those credits are not transferable. Royalty credits can be used, but they are used as a deductable allowance, and that is how it operates under the law: it is a deductable allowance. It is true that people have described that as creditable, including me in the past, but it is a deductable allowance, and it does not work the way in which the member over there described it this morning. It is deduction from profit - a deductable allowance. We on this side of the House understand the difference between a refundable credit and a deductable allowance.                     That is what the legislation says: it is a deductable allowance. And no amount of moving all the words around by the shadow Treasurer can move away from that. It is a deductable allowance.                 I want to finish on this final point. When we announced the resource rent tax, all of those opposite went down on bended knee. They went out to the millionaires and billionaires in the mining industry and the vested interests and said -                      They went out and said, 'We've got a tax cut for you.' We on this side of the House believe in resource rent taxes and understand their importance to the future of the country, and we understand that it is important that Australians get fair value for the resources they own 100 per cent, which is why we are supporting a resource rent tax. Those on the other side of the House are opposing one - one that will bring revenue to the Australian people so we can spread opportunity right around this country.                   The member for North Sydney then left the chamber.

  I thank the member for Denison for his question on what is an important issue - an important issue for his constituent Lachlan and also an important issue for people right around the country. I know there are so many Australians who find it so difficult now, with our current system of supports and services, to get the care their families need. One of the reasons we have embarked on creating a National Disability Insurance Scheme is that we do understand that the way in which services are provided now is too fragmented and that there is not a common approach, so people in comparable circumstances do not get the same degree of support.                 We have been working to improve circumstances for people with a disability, and our Better Start for Children with Disability program was part of that extension of support. It is an early-intervention initiative that we will extend further next year. Better Start does relate to eligible conditions, as the member for Denison has said, and I do understand that there are still children like Lachlan who are not eligible for the Better Start program. For Lachlan and for families around the country, we will continue to improve disability services as we can. But the real outcome we are seeking for them is the National Disability Insurance Scheme.                 I am happy, of course, to maintain contact with the member for Denison about the specific circumstances of this family. And I know that he will be working with the government because I know he too is very concerned about disability services and wants us to work together to ensure for people around the nation and in his electorate that we see an NDIS.

  I thank the member for Wills for his questions. As a Victorian he knows there is an important carnival going on over the weekend and into next week in Victoria.                 Carbon pricing has been in place now for four months and the economy is growing, inflation is contained, interest rates have come down, investment is growing - the economy is strong. That is the reality of carbon pricing in our economy: the economy is continuing to grow. It is a very different picture indeed to the nightmare that was presented over the last 18 months by the Leader of the Opposition. We all know he predicted that whole towns were going to disappear, industries were going to be ruined, hundreds of thousands of jobs would be destroyed and the weekly shopping trip would bankrupt families.                 I am asked about the impact on major events in particular. The Leader of the Opposition has also claimed that the whole Australian way of life is under threat from carbon pricing. But major events, like the Spring Racing Carnival, which are surely cornerstones of our way of life, are underway, and I want to reassure racing fans that there is no cause for alarm. Carbon pricing will not stop the Victoria Derby on Saturday and it will not stop the Melbourne Cup next Tuesday. The carnival is going to go well.                 Treasury modelling showed the carbon price impact on sport and recreation will only be 0.3 per cent, or around 20c a week. Fashion at Flemington is going to be okay because last week's CPI figures showed the price of women's clothing actually fell by 0.2 per cent in the September quarter! What people with an interest in the racing industry need to know is that the Leader of the Opposition's scare campaign has been the biggest shakedown since the Fine Cotton affair in 1984! The ring-in that day, for those who can remember, was called Bold Personality. That is all we have had from the Leader of the Opposition. The rest of it is all rubbish, a complete shakedown, and frankly it is time that the Liberal Party stewards started to intervene here and had a look at a bit of change.                 What about the member for Wentworth? A classy thoroughbred if ever there was one! He was badly checked by the member for Warringah in the 2009 race. The member for North Sydney is hungry for a win, but he has demonstrated yet again today that he is not up to group 1 racing level - he is out of the chamber. Then there is the member for Curtin: three times runner-up - surely a chance this time! The member for Cook is a promising weight-for-ager, I reckon, but spooked by foreign horses every time! Or the member for Mackellar, a favourite in 1994, and what a stayer - she's still here!

  I thank the member for his question, and I do thank him for clearly engaging in a bit of choreography with the minister for climate change for the amusement of the House. On the quick look I had at that graph when it was held up, what it is showing is that the biggest bars of cost are things like the network charges. So I thank the member for holding up a chart that proves the government's case about electricity.                 We have had the Leader of the Opposition, as part of his mendacious claim, out there saying that any dollar increase in electricity is about the carbon price, and for a long period of time he was absolutely denying that there was any other factor. Finally, he was shamed into admitting that yes, there are other things going on with electricity; and yes, there were things like 40, 50, 60, 70 per cent increases before carbon pricing even came into effect; and yes, a big factor in those increases is the so-called gold-plating of the network, shown I think by the blue bars on that chart there.                     I am talking about electricity pricing and its impact on businesses, and I am thanking the member for holding up a chart that I think, from the quick look I had at it, clearly shows that carbon pricing is the least of the effects on electricity - the least of the effects.                 On impacts for businesses like Woolworths, they have actually been on the public record about carbon pricing, and they are not joining hands with the opposition in this reckless campaign of fear. So, when it comes to the Woolworths business, I suggest people listen to the people who run it rather than the opposition.                 Then, of course, the thing that the member did not raise, and that members opposite do not like to raise, is that as part of carbon pricing we have provided tax cuts and family payment increases and pension increases, building on our other cost-of-living measures for families, all of which would be removed by those opposite - tax cuts gone, pension increases gone, family payment increases gone, Schoolkids Bonus gone and the list goes on.                 So, after the expose that there has been of this litany of falsehoods from the opposition, it is time for members who can actually think in terms of policy to start disassociating themselves with this reckless and stupid campaign.                 Leave not granted.

  I thank the member for Shortland very much for her question and for the way in which she stands up and advocates for people with disabilities and for carers in her electorate. One of the things that the member for Shortland knows well and that the question from the member for Denison also emphasised today is just how critical it is that we confront the reality that the system of disability care and support in Australia is underfunded and unfair. That is what people with disability in Australia face and have faced for a very long time.                 People with disability have waited for such a long time for change to the system of disability care and support. It is now time that this changed and this government is determined to make that change. We are determined to deliver a new system of disability care and support for this nation to make sure that people with disability do not face a lottery. It should not depend on where you live or how you got your disability or what the disability is. That is what people have faced for so many years.                 I will shortly be releasing for public discussion the draft bill to establish a national disability insurance scheme. That will be available. People will be able to see the way in which the legislation will build the framework for a national disability insurance scheme. This legislation will establish the launch transition agency. That agency will be established as an independent body that has the responsibility to run the National Disability Insurance Scheme. The legislation will also set out the way in which the agency intends to deliver planning and support for people with disability and for their families and their carers. I intend to introduce the legislation into the parliament before the end of this year. We went to make sure that we get it into the parliament and that it is available for all members of parliament and the public to have a very good look at before it is debated next year.                   The draft legislation has been well informed by thousands of conversations that we have had with people with disability, family members, carers - all the people who need to have a say. There has been a lot of detailed discussions with those who work in the sector and also with the states and territories. I particularly thank those states that are host jurisdictions who have played such a constructive role.

  We could not get a sharper contrast between a government focused on the future and an opposition focused on sleaze and smear from 17 years in the past.                     I stand by my comments on the public record in relation to this matter. Let me make it clear: my accusation of the opposition is hypocrisy. I table a record of the press conference held by the Leader of the Opposition at the start of this week, 29 October, in which he said -                      When I was interrupted, I was tabling a document containing a statement of the Leader of the Opposition from 29 October where he says:                 I will leave the nasty personal politics to the Labor Party. I predict that we will see a lot more of that in the months leading up to the next election, but I am going to focus every day on what matters to the Australian people and that is sensible, careful, responsible change that will give them a stronger economy and a more cohesive society.

  I thank the member for Fowler. On this side of the House we know how important it is to invest in our schools across the member for Fowler's and my home state of New South Wales, where we have some 3,000 schools. Those schools have received 369,806 computers; 140 projects in trades training centres, benefiting 317 schools; 7,000 Building the Education Revolution projects; 1,400 classroom improvements; 746 libraries; and 924 multipurpose halls - and about 823 schools have benefited from the Smarter Schools National Partnerships.                 That is a proud record of investment. The numbers are important, because it is a proud record of investment by a government that has got its priorities right. It means we have tens of thousands of students learning in the classroom with 21st century technology, students learning a trade while at school, thousands of modern classrooms built for today and hundreds of schools benefiting, including Bonnyrigg Primary School, which is in the member's electorate. That investment is critical. It has delivered results, but we know there is more to do, and that is why the Prime Minister has announced the National Plan for School Improvement - investing in great teachers, focusing on school improvement and giving more power to school principals.                 I am asked about alternative policies. I guess I would put it this way to answer that question. The opposition leader thinks that the current level of funding for public schooling is an injustice. The shadow spokesperson for education wants to sack one in seven teachers and bring in larger class sizes. And the shadow Treasurer is on the record: he has not found a schools program that he does not want to cut. He was on ABC radio just the other day boasting about how he would cut the funding for trade-training centres. There is $2.8 billion in cuts already on the slate from those opposite.                  Just think about the investment in education in Fowler if this negative Liberal Party opposition had their way. We have put 8,300 computers in schools. They would cut it. We put $2 million worth of investment into two trade-training centres. They would cut it. We have put, into 115 projects, $108 million in Building the Education Revolution. The opposition leader slept through the vote - that would be zero.                  Of course, members from New South Wales would not be surprised to know that the song remains the same for their Liberal government as well. There has been $1.7 billion in cuts through raising fees, cutting funding to schools and TAFEs, and sacking staff. A footnote to all of that is that, yesterday, the New South Wales Auditor-General discovered 37 mistakes in the New South Wales Liberal government's budget. They are a billion dollars better off than they were in June. I and those on this side have a message: put that billion dollars into education in New South Wales and follow the lead of this government that supports education and wants to make every school a great school.

  I think the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has a future as a race caller, if nothing else! To the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, I say that I stand by my statement of 23 August. To the opposition in general: I draw their attention to the Leader of the Opposition's statement on 22 August, 'In relation to these matters this is not the main game for us,' - yet another hypocritical statement from the opposition.                     On the tenor of this question and the ones that have preceded it, as question time draws to an end at the end of this sitting week, you could not have a clearer choice between a political party with a plan for the future and a party of scare and sleaze and smear. Despite the protestations of the Leader of the Opposition that he was not going to be into this, there they are full of negativity, out of ideas. Scare, sleaze and smear is all they know.

  I thank the member for Fremantle for her question. She is one of the Western Australian members of parliament who was able to be in the chamber when the vote happened on this issue last night. There are opportunities that have already come as a result of deregulation of wheat that have made an extraordinary benefit for our wheat growers in Australia.                 For a long time the beef industry was able to start getting better prices in Asian markets in particular by offering traceability, by allowing the people who were selling to say exactly which farm the meat their customers were buying had come from. Bulk handling and only being able to work through a single exporter had prevented the wheat industry from being able to access this. Yet it is now true that there are wheat growers in Western Australia who have worked on deals where restaurants using noodle wheat in Japan are able to advertise exactly where their wheat is coming from. There is a wheat grower in New South Wales who has webcams that are live in South Korea where people are able to see the product that they wish to purchase being grown. It is way of engaging directly with those Asian markets in a way that only has benefit for those innovative growers. We have a situation where that sort of business innovation is being denied to those growers to go to the final stage of a fully deregulated market by members of the Liberal Party.                 There were two great speeches of Liberal Party principles given when this issue was dealt with last night. One of the speeches of Liberal Party principles was given by a member of this House who is no longer a member of the Liberal Party, yet we had a better assessment of Liberal Party free-market principles from the member for Fisher than the changes in policy that we heard from those holding the line of how the Liberal Party has changed under this leader of the opposition. Does anybody actually believe that the Liberal Party of John Howard would have voted against deregulation?                   John Howard stood at this dispatch box proclaiming a need for Murray-Darling reform. We still do not know if the party is going to support the Murray-Darling plan notwithstanding that it was foreshadowed in legislation moved by the water minister, who sits as a member of their front bench. We have a party now that is not willing to stand up for something as radical as what you might call free enterprise. You realise very quickly that the Liberal Party, which was able to maintain a true principle of free market under John Howard, under Brendan Nelson, and under the member for Wentworth, has become a very different Liberal Party under this Leader of the Opposition. Every grower that is being told that this opposition wants to be able to tell them who they are allowed to sell to and who they are not knows how much it has changed.

 I thank the member for that question. As well as pointing out these two very important projects where we have seen the state government in Victoria refuse to cash the cheque from the federal government, I have heard it reported today that the state government has gone around to all of the locals hospital boards and passed on their $616 million of cuts to those local hospital boards to deliver. This is incredibly disappointing. We know that those local hospital boards need extra funding and that is why, over coming years, the Commonwealth will put $1 billion extra into the Victorian health system - a 26 per cent increase.                  What is extraordinary about this is that, as health minister, I have not actually had the experience of a state government saying no to funding. Actually, the Queensland government did reject some funding for mental health beds, but the Health and Hospitals Fund money is money that the Victorian government applied for. They asked for funding and they submitted 11 projects that were so needed in those local communities, and now they do not want to cash the cheque. It is beyond me and so very disappointing, because I know that those patients in Victoria need that care. I think what has happened is that the 'no' from November has translated into -

I had one of those ultrasecret things called a press conference - one of those ultrasecret things! That is what you do, isn't it? You call a press conference in front of the full Canberra press gallery and conduct it for the best part of an hour if you do not want people to know what you have said! Gee, the member for Mackellar is onto something there! I refer the Deputy Leader of the Opposition -                      to this question, which was put to me during the press conference by Sid Maher of the Australian. I stand by the answer I gave to Mr Maher's question.

  I thank the member for Canberra for her very important question about the difference that a Labor government is making to Australians and to our nation, including those Australians who live in her electorate right here in Canberra, in the ACT. On Saturday we mark the five-year anniversary of the Rudd government and of the government that I lead. Across those five years of Labor government, we can say we are proud of the achievements that, working with the Australian community, we have brought to our nation - and I do say very strongly 'working with the Australian community' because when you are looking to deliver profound change, when you are looking to deliver major improvements for Australians, it requires government to act, but it also requires businesses to play their part, unions to play their part and civil society to play its part. I am proud of the way in which we have been able to work together with business, with unions and with civil society for change.                 First and foremost, because we are a Labor government we made decisions during the days of the global financial crisis that would keep the maximum number of people in jobs. We have created over 800,000 jobs and we are also ensuring Australians feel the benefits of work by ensuring that there is a tripling of the tax-free threshold and people get to keep the first $18,200 they earn without paying a cent of tax to the taxman. We are proud that we abolished Work Choices and we have introduced fairness and decency at work, and we have added to it this year, in this parliament, through better arrangements for those in shipping, better arrangements for truck drivers around the country and better arrangements for building workers, for clothing and trades workers, for public servants who are getting pushed out of work by state Liberal governments and for workers when they lose their jobs in circumstances where their entitlements are not fully paid.                 We are also very proud of what we have done to create an opportunity agenda - improving education so people genuinely get a chance at a decent life through having the skills to realise a secure job, or a series of secure jobs, over their working life. We have readied our nation for this time of change in our region in what will be the Asian century. We have delivered major reforms in the environment, including the most recent work of the minister on the Murray-Darling Basin. We have rolled out the National Broadband Network. We have delivered a huge infrastructure package for this nation's future and, proudly, this week we will introduce into the parliament an entitlement for every Australian child to an excellent education and the creation of the National Disability Insurance Scheme. That is our positive agenda for 2013.

  In answer to the deputy opposition leader's question: I dealt in detail with the circumstances in which I provided legal advice for the incorporation of this association at my marathon press conference in August, and those matters have been gone into again in the press conference that I have just conducted, and I stand by those statements. My role in relation to this matter was as a lawyer providing advice to clients based on their instructions to me. I did not incorporate an association; that is for the Registrar of Incorporated Associations to do. I did not operate the association. I was not an office-bearer of it. I did not deal with any transactions associated with any bank accounts the association may or may not have had. I had no knowledge of those bank accounts.                 So, to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition: I gave legal advice based on client instructions about the incorporation of an association. I say to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition - and, really, it goes to much of the sleaze and muckraking that the opposition has been engaged in - if she has a real allegation of wrongdoing by me, then put it. I did note last week that, when the Deputy Leader of the Opposition was interviewed on radio - I believe it was Radio National - on three occasions she was unable to articulate what it was that I needed to answer. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition has never brought forward a substantiated allegation of wrongdoing by me; neither has the Leader of the Opposition. Once again, this morning he was unable to articulate what questions I should answer. The opposition are doing this today, and I anticipate we will do it for nine or 10 questions, however many are in question time, and there will probably be a motion to add to it.                 This is all happening today - and I think the Australian people should clearly understand this - because the Leader of the Opposition is determined to continue to pursue a negative strategy. He had hoped to tear this government down. He had hoped to tear me down. He had hoped to ride into office on the basis of a dishonest fear campaign about carbon pricing. That dishonest fear campaign is running out of political puff and, in those circumstances, into a vacuum, because the opposition has no ideas for the nation's future. All they have left is filth and smear and sleaze, because of their inability to come to the dispatch box and put one idea for the nation's future. As I said at my press conference a little earlier today, these are not John Howard's Liberals; this is an entirely -                      different creature with no ideas about the nation's future.

  I thank the member for Petrie for that very important question, because there has been a very strong endorsement of the resilience of the Australian economy by the IMF in their annual report - a very comprehensive report on the resilience of the Australian economy. I would just like to quote a few things that the IMF had to say about our economy. They said there was a well-coordinated response to the global financial crisis, and they went on to say:                 Five years on, both the economy and the financial sector continue to outperform most of their peers.                 The IMF then went on to say, in praising the adept handling of the fallout from the global financial crisis:                 _ prudent economic management, and strong supervision of the financial sector, has kept Australia on the dwindling list of AAA rated countries.                 So what the IMF is saying is that, unlike the rest of the world, the economy here has been very resilient - so much so that we have had 21 years of growth.                 We are now the 12th largest economy in the world. We have improved that ranking by three since those over there were last in government. There have been something like 800,000 jobs created in Australia, whilst around the rest of the developed world millions of people have lost their jobs. And we are headed back to surplus, with modest debt. This is a very substantial achievement for Australia and for the Australian people. Interest rates are now much lower than they were under the Liberal Party. If you have a $300,000 mortgage, you are now saving around $4,500 a year in repayments compared to what occurred when those over there were last in office, when there were interest rate rises - 10 in a row.                 So the point is that the IMF is pointing to the resilience of the Australian economy. And because of our good budget management, we have put in place some historic reforms. We have boosted the age pension and introduced paid parental leave; we have tripled the tax-free threshold; we have increased the childcare rebate and we have increased the superannuation guarantee - all designed to make our economy much more resilient. And we put in place the Asian century white paper. These fundamentals are there for everybody to see.                 This report from the IMF completely torpedoes the low-rent scaremongering that we hear from the Leader of the Opposition, and from the shadow Treasurer, who talk our economy down every day of the week. We on this side of the House will get on with building on the strength of the Australian economy by putting in place the fundamental reforms that the Prime Minister was talking about before - fundamental reforms when it comes to school improvement and, of course, the national disability scheme. All of these things are important.                 We have seen the carbon scare campaign waged by those opposite fade away. And what have we got now? We have got another smear campaign because they do not have any policies.

  My role as a lawyer was to provide legal advice acting on my client's instructions. If the Registrar of Incorporated Associations forms a view that such an association being incorporated was in breach of the relevant legislation then that would be a matter for them. I remind the Deputy Leader that my role was to provide legal advice. The entity that determined to incorporate this association is the Western Australian registrar of incorporated associations. If she is contending that the registrar of incorporated associations did not act in accordance with their legislation then that is a matter she should take up with them.

  I thank the member for Dobell for his question and, indeed, for a policy question from that side of the House. Perhaps it will be the only one that comes from alternate numbers today. He has a concern. He points towards the growing population in his electorate and on the Central Coast. I know that the member for Robertson shares his concern about commuting times, particularly for rail. Those slow commuting times put pressure on the F3. That people spend hour after hour on that freeway, that they spend more time on that freeway than they do at home with their kids, is a real concern for family life in his electorate.                 It is expected that by 2036 the population of the Central Coast will increase by 30 per cent. That is one of the reasons we have undertaken, as part of a commitment we made during the last election campaign, a high-level study into high-speed rail for the east coast. Part of what the first stage of that study showed was that it was not just about the long-distance trips between Sydney and Melbourne and Sydney and Brisbane, which are of course some of the busiest air routes in the world; it was also about the commuter traffic, particularly between the Central Coast, Newcastle and also Canberra and the difference it could make in taking pressure off the growth particularly in the outer suburbs of Sydney by making it possible to get from the member's electorate of Dobell to the city in around 40 minutes. Many people in Sydney would take longer than that. Indeed, sometimes it takes longer than 40 minutes to get from Marrickville into the CBD. So that would make it extremely competitive.                 We are having a study to produce the facts - the proper costings, the proper rail corridors, the proper time lines and the proper patronage figures - so that we can then have a debate from early next year about whether the community is prepared to pay the cost of this. We know there is a high cost to high-speed rail, but we also have to consider it in the context of the regional development opportunities that would exist and also in the context of the costs that would not exist for rail and road on a regular basis. This is a study that will be handed down early next year. I thank the member for Dobell for his ongoing interest in this issue.                 We know that in Europe and Asia high-speed rail is a growing part of the transport solution. Of course, they have much denser populations than Australia does across the vast expanse of this continent, so the challenge here is much greater.

  I thank the member for Shortland for her question. I know that she and the member for Newcastle, the member for Charlton and the member for Hunter, along with people on all sides of this House, have particularly welcomed the royal commission. Those in the Hunter region have responded for a long period of time to the awful reports of child sexual abuse that are alleged to have occurred in their community.                 I think in this House everyone is very clear that child sexual abuse by anyone at any time is a wretched crime. We know that it destroys young lives and we know that those young people are then haunted forever when they become adults. It is because of this that there has been an overwhelming response to the Prime Minister's announcement that a royal commission will be conducted. That response has enthusiastically come from all corners of the country. I want to acknowledge here as well the opposition and those on the cross bench, who have also enthusiastically and constructively engaged with this debate.                 Getting the ground work right is essential for us to be able to ensure that the royal commission can work effectively and can investigate responses to instances and allegations of child sexual abuse in institutions across the country. I want to report to the House that, as well as a number of meetings the government have been conducting with stakeholders, we have received more than 270 emails and 33 submissions - these are detailed comments that have been provided - as well as over 1,000 hits to the website. We are making sure that we constructively and carefully look at all of these responses to ensure that the community can have its say in the formation of the commission.                 The submissions that have been received so far highlight a couple of important things: the importance of designing the hearing process appropriately so that victims feel supported through the process of preparing and giving evidence; and the need to appoint multiple commissioners with broad expertise. Legal expertise and child protection expertise are those that were most commonly mentioned in the submissions. Also the view of many who have put in comments to the government is that the commission should take whatever time is needed to get it right but also include timely reporting, with suggestions of every one or two years, with the recognition that the commission will need sufficient time to investigate thoroughly.                   Importantly, though, these 300-odd emails and submissions from stakeholders have sent a very strong message - that the commission needs to focus on systemic issues of child sexual abuse to make sure that recommendations can be implemented in a timely manner. It is very clear that the community wants the commission and all governments across Australia to do everything we can to make sure that what has happened in the past is never allowed to happen again. Therefore this will be a priority for our government and an important issue for society as a whole to confront to ensure that we do all we can to stop this type of pain occurring again in the future.

  To the Deputy Leader of the Opposition: once again I dealt with a comparable question in the press conference today. But let me be very clear with the Deputy Leader of the Opposition because I think she is confusing a few things here. I acted as a solicitor providing legal advice on the instructions of clients. In terms of compliance with the rules of an industrial organisation, whether it be the AWU or any other industrial organisation, obviously that is a question for the members and office-bearers of that association. So if she is concerned about the upholding of AWU rules then that is a matter that she needs to pursue with the AWU, although I do note she would be seeking to pursue with them a matter almost two decades old.

  I thank the member for Kingston for the question. She has been a passionate advocate for restoring the Murray-Darling Basin to health. Australia now has a Murray-Darling Basin Plan. The plan is legally binding and the establishment of the plan follows a long line of processes which have occurred over the years while government has changed back and forth.                 The process that we are in at the moment goes all the way back to 1991, when there was an outbreak of blue-green algae. At that point, instead of the Murray-Darling simply being a negotiation between the states, the river itself negotiated back and it negotiated hard, sending a message loud and clear that if we did not manage the rivers properly none of us would be able to use the water. The Keating government followed up in 1994 with a COAG agreement that set the framework which water reform follows today. Under the Howard government we had the National Water Initiative in 2004 and, in 2007, the establishment of the Water Act, overseen by the then Minister for the Environment and Water Resources, the member for Wentworth.                 When the Rudd government came in we then had under Minister Wong the establishment of the Murray-Darling Basin Authority and large amounts of water starting to be accumulated and reserved for the purposes of environmental water, to restore the system to health. We now under the Gillard government have a situation where Australia has as force of law a binding Murray-Darling Basin Plan. In arriving at this plan, the parliament has been well served by the work of the Windsor committee, which has brought different members of the parliament together and asked for methods by which this reform could be achieved in a way that is sensitive to communities. Wherever we could reach the environmental objectives that the reform demanded in ways that were sensitive to communities - through minimising buyback, through maximising environmental works and measures and infrastructure investment - we have done so.                 But make no mistake: while we have compromised on the way of getting there, there has been no compromise on the ambition of the reform itself. This reform does restore the Murray-Darling Basin to health. This reform does mean that we will not see again the drying up of the system at the South Australian end the way we have in the past, that we will not see the drying up of Hatter Lakes or the Narran Lakes, and that we will not see those sorts of blue-green algae outbreaks on the 1,000-kilometre scale which characterised the early 1990s.                 I want to refer to the fact that from five o'clock today the Murray-Darling Basin Plan will have been tabled in this parliament and will be available for disallowance. I understand there has been a statement from the Greens saying that they intend to move disallowance. I just want to make clear to the parliament that if we can only resolve to continue to fight and not reach a solution we are no better than the generations that have failed before us.

  I think the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has now diverted off from any matters involving me and she is involved in a furious dispute with whoever was the registrar of incorporated associations in WA at the time.                     They are chanting, 'You set it up!' - and that is the point that you do not understand. Let me explain it to you, because here we are once again with smear. I remind the House - and I will take this opportunity, given we have taken an interjection about something that is factually wrong and is 100 per cent smear - of what we have had in this parliament. We have had the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ask questions before. On 1 November she claimed I set up a fund in 1992. That claim is false. I provided advice on the incorporation of an association under Western Australian law. On the same day, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition said I was involved and advising Ralph Blewitt in a defamation action in 1993. That claim is false. It is directly contradicted by the published defamation file, which shows that other lawyers at Slater &amp; Gordon had responsibility for this matter. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition has also described me in this parliament as the lawyer advising on the conveyance of a Fitzroy property. That statement is false. It is contradicted by the published file, a statement by the then partner in charge and a statement made by the firm itself. So, when we were last dealing with this matter in question time, in the space of two days the Deputy Leader of the Opposition misled the parliament three times. So, to those on the opposition front bench who are starting to interject, I would say: do not follow your leader and your deputy leader into this sleaze and smear and the making of false claims in this parliament. Three times the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has misled this parliament. That is a matter she ought to apologise to this parliament for and to the Australian people for.                     On the deputy leader's question, I would remind the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that the entity that incorporates associations is the registrar under applicable law. It is the registrar that makes the decision as to whether or not -                      the requirements of the legislation have been complied with. No amount of shouting changes that simple fact. It is exactly the same as if one were incorporating a company and it is the relevant company authorities that work out if the Companies Act has been complied with. So, if she has formed the view that this association ought not to have been incorporated, she needs to take that up with the registrar in Western Australia.

  I thank the member for Moreton for his trade policy question. Indeed, it is the 24th question from the government side of this chamber on trade policy. The contrast is that I have, in the 788 days since walking into this chamber as trade minister, received not five, not four, not three, not two, not one question -                       Dr EMERSON:                     from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and shadow trade minister but none. In fact, the last time I received a policy question from the opposition was 1,022 days ago. In that amount of time, Captain Cook left England, he went to Tahiti, he sailed past New Zealand, he discovered Botany Bay, he documented Botany Bay, he explored Botany Bay, he left, he went to Indonesia, he got some repairs and he headed home to England - 1,022 days!                     Dr EMERSON:                     The fact is: in the last week, we have finalised the Malaysia-Australia Free Trade Agreement, which will provide 99 per cent duty-free access for Australian exporters into Malaysia. That will go through the parliament tomorrow or the next day. Last week, the Prime Minister and I were in Phnom Penh, where the Prime Minister participated in the launch of a Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement covering 30 per cent of the global economy. The Prime Minister and I participated in a meeting of the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement parties. That was chaired by President Obama. Both of these are pathways to a free trade area for Asia and the Pacific. While we were in Phnom Penh, we promoted Australia's plan for the future - Australia in the Asian century, offering fantastic career opportunities for young Australians. That is our plan for Australia. Here is the contrast: we have got a government with plans and policies; we have got an opposition with fear and smear - two years of fear and now we are on to smear. The reason for that is that the Leader of the Opposition is a policy weakling. So much is he a policy weakling that there is Essential research out today that shows -                      Dr EMERSON:                     There is Essential research out today that shows that the carbon price is much more popular than the Leader of the Opposition. So miserably has he failed in his fear campaign that they are on to smear. This parliament is going to witness a triumph of plans over fear, of policy over smear - and you will get what is coming to you from this smear campaign that you have engaged in.

  For those who are normal, are engaged in worrying about jobs, health and education and have not followed the minutiae of this matter, let me just explain for their edification. The claim that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has now made is a claim that appeared in the Age. I think the name of the journalist who made that claim is Mark Baker. The correspondence he refers to has never been produced, so the claim has been made but no correspondence has ever been produced.                 What I can say to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is what I have said in answer to her earlier questions. I provided legal advice about the incorporation of the association. Then, of course, the association is only incorporated if the relevant authority, the registrar, is satisfied that the normal legislative needs and details have been satisfied. Clearly, the registrar must have been so satisfied, or they would not have incorporated the association. If the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has formed the view -                      Thank you very much, Speaker. I was just indicating that it is clear what my role was. I provided legal advice. It is also clear what the registrar's role was. It is the registrar that makes the judgement about whether or not the relevant legislation has been complied with. If the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has formed the view that this association ought not to have been incorporated, then that is a matter she should take up with the registrar in Western Australia - although, given that we are talking about the best part of 20 years ago, I think it is highly unlikely that we are talking about the same individual. But that is a matter for the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to pursue in Western Australia with the registrar.

  Thank you to the member for Corangamite for his question. Australia's economy, with the introduction of the carbon price - after 150 days of its operation - is still growing. We still have low unemployment. We still have strong business investment. We have low inflation, and we have much lower interest rates than when the coalition was in government. Those are the facts, and they do not accord that well with the fear campaign that the Leader of the Opposition conducted month after month after month in a cowardly performance to try and terrify people into supporting the coalition.                 The point that my colleague the Minister for Trade made earlier - about having an opposition leader, after all that fear and all that mendacity, less popular than the carbon price, which was supposed to destroy towns and regions - was quite telling. Remember his claim that it would destroy hundreds of thousands of jobs? In fact, the figures show -                      Thank you, Speaker. I would like to thank the member for Wentworth, because it was a point well made. Let us just look at some facts. The prediction by the Leader of the Opposition was that hundreds of thousands of jobs would be lost. That is what he said. The figures are showing 25,000 extra jobs added to our economy since the carbon price came into operation. In fact, when you look at the way that the economy is changing and businesses are adjusting to it, we are improving energy efficiency. We are reducing emissions intensity in our economy. We are reducing greenhouse gases. The carbon price revenue is being used to support businesses to reduce their emissions.                 One of the projects in this respect is carried out by Thiess Australia, a company that has been referred to by some of those opposite from time to time. Its Tamworth based abattoir is developing a biogas project which has been made viable by the carbon price operation, which will cut its energy costs by $327,000 a year. Also, last week Siemens, a large international company, announced it would work with a contracting firm to manufacture up to 20 wind towers in Whyalla for the Snowtown II wind farm project. That is the Whyalla that the Leader of the Opposition said would be wiped off the map.                 As this year draws to a close, the carbon price is unquestionably having a positive effect on the economy in reducing its emissions intensity, and every mendacious claim that the Leader of the Opposition made is being shown up. Is it any wonder that his net approval is so low?

  Whilst I am not entirely sure of the point of the deputy leader's question - she did not appear to get to it - on my role in relation to providing legal advice for the AWU reform association, the nature of my role is dealt with in the Slater &amp; Gordon internal review document from 1995, which has now been in the public domain for quite a long period of time.                     I dealt with this very clearly in a very long press conference that I gave on 23 August, and I refer her to all of the things that I described there. I refer her to the fact that I have dealt with this matter again today. That is the sum total of it. It is dealt with in some detail. So, whilst the Deputy Leader of the Opposition will keep twisting and turning and bringing in more irrelevancies -                      because, of course, the opposition do not have any positive plans for the nation's future, so they have to fill the air with sleaze and smear. No amount of asking questions on this matter is going to take the matter further about my role than what I have already very clearly dealt with on the public record.

  I thank  the member for Capricornia for her question. She has been a strong advocate for the significance of the Northern Australian Ministerial Forum, which essentially deals with a coordinated strategy across the whole of the Top End of Australia north of the Tropic of Capricorn.                 I want to pay tribute to the member for Brand because, in a previous role in this chamber, he was responsible for advocating, through the Northern Australia Land and Water Taskforce, the establishment of this forum. We held in Kununurra last week the fifth meeting in less than two years of this forum. It had two important things coming from it, apart from the material that it received in relation to beef, where obviously, with the closure of the beef market into Indonesia, there is a realisation that reliance on one market and one country is not the way for the beef industry to go. The diversification that has happened there in terms of logistics, in terms of markets and in terms of abattoir facilities was all reported on and significant progress was made.                 Carbon farming was also discussed with regard to opportunities for Indigenous Australians with savanna burning, in terms of not only trading the credits but improving the management of the soils, along with water and land tenure - these were all discussed. What was also significant was the location, Kununurra, which has seen the coming together of a partnership between the federal and state governments, something that was started under the previous Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, and Colin Barnett 3½ years ago. This has now come to almost complete fruition, with the expansion of the second stage of the Ord River development, and the opening whilst I was there of new TAFE facilities in both Kununurra and Wyndham, new school facilities, a medical centre, a wharf and jetty at Wyndham and the Mirrawong-Gadgerong's - the Indigenous holders of the land - new building. That new building is significant because they have played a really constructive role in dealing with the land management issues and the discussions around native title. Also present at this meeting was the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory. He has understood the importance of the next stage of the Ord development involving water going into the Northern Territory. So not only do we have a partnership between governments; we have cross-border issues being dealt with.                 This is an example of a location based approach to regional development - something that we in the Labor Party fundamentally agree with in developing partnerships and working to achieve an outcome for the regions that builds on their fundamental strengths. This is something that we have implemented that those on the other side never had the wit to, and we want the opportunity to keep going with it.

  To the deputy leader's question, no, that is not the reason. I put the reason on the public record in the press conference that I did in August about how this was a matter that I was not intending to charge on, how it was routine to do small matters for unions without fees and I consequently did not open a file.                 To the Deputy Leader of the Opposition I say that this is bordering on the embarrassing now to savour the questions. Let me assure her that I did not fake the moon landing, I was not responsible for the assassination of JFK, I did not shove Harold Holt on a Chinese submarine - just before she gets to those questions. Because where these conspiracy theories are getting us to is truly absurd and generally embarrassing, and all of it of course is a cover-up for the fact that this man has got not one idea for the nation's future.

  I thank the member for Hunter for his question - a positive question from the government side of the parliament, not one positive question in the whole of question time from those opposite. They say they do not want to throw any mud, but all they can do day after day is throw mud - not one question from the Leader of the Opposition, not one question on the National Disability Insurance Scheme. Leave it to the government to make sure that people with disability no longer have to wait at the end of a phone for a respite place. No wonder they are ashamed and never ask a question about disability, because they are the people who never, ever come here and raise the issues that confront people with disability and their carers every single day.                 This government is proud of what we have done for people with disability. Of course, it is this government that made sure that we increased the Disability Support Pension, increased the carer payment, made sure that services are available for children with autism and made sure that people who are desperately looking for a supported accommodation place can actually get a better chance of looking for one. It has been up to this government to deliver all of these changes for disability - never done by any of those opposite.                     In fact, when you had the chance in government to do something for people with disability, you slashed the funding for disability. So it has been up to this government to do the work for people with disability. It is this government that will introduce the legislation for a National Disability Insurance Scheme, and we will get on with that job.

  Given the expiry of the time, I am not actually sure if the Deputy Leader of the Opposition asked a question, but let me endeavour to answer it. I will start by making the observation that yesterday the Leader of the Opposition thought he could sit in this parliament with a cloak of invisibility around him. What was visible to every member of the Australian public was his dirt file. Here we are again today with the dirt file -                      As we see the opposition move files around the chamber, let us just remind ourselves that yesterday the Leader of the Opposition, despite his silence, brought his dirt file to the chamber. Here we are today dealing with the opposition's dirt file. We are dealing with the opposition's dirt file because this is a man who has no policies for the nation's future and so he is filling the vacuum with sleaze and smear.                     On the Deputy Leader of the Opposition's question, I have answered this on a number of occasions. I answered it as early as 1995, and no amount of yelling from the opposition changes that fact. In 1995 I dealt with allegations about renovations on my property. I dealt with them again in 2001. I dealt with them again in 2006. I dealt with them again in 2007 after the Liberal Party shopped around a dirt file on me. I have dealt with them on multiple occasions over the course of this year. I say to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition: check the transcript from yesterday. I stand by that transcript and what I said about my renovations. I stand by the transcript of my press conference in August. I have dealt with these allegations time and time again. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition knows that and ought to check the now very available public record.

  I thank the member for Deakin for his question and for raising in this parliament issues that matter to the Australian people. Clearly we already know from the tactics of the opposition that they will not today raise issues that matter to the Australian people. They will not today raise questions about jobs for Australians. They will not raise questions about health. They will not raise questions about education - and the list goes on. I believe Australians are sick of the Leader of the Opposition and his sleaze and smear tactics. They want to see this parliament use its time properly for the issues that matter in their lives. I thank the member for Deakin for a question that matters to the lives of Australians.                 We as a government have a laser focus on jobs, because there is nothing more important to the future of Australians than knowing that they can get jobs, that they can hold secure jobs, that they can have the prospect of a better job and that their sons and daughters can look forward to growing up to be full participants in an economy that can offer them the benefits of work. We have the highest number of Australians in paid employment ever. This has taken hard work. It is taking hard work to keep modernising our economy so we can ensure that that ability to offer Australians jobs continues in the future. We are proud that there are 800,000 more jobs around than there were five years ago. We are proud of what we have done to support the manufacturing sector in difficult times. Of course, we are getting on with creating the jobs of the future, including through the rollout of the National Broadband Network.                 With a strong and resilient economy we can offer Australians benefits. We are proud we have moved up three places to be in the top dozen largest economies by size in the world. We want to keep moving up those rankings. That is why we are so focused on delivering on our plans for the nation's future during this Asian century of growth and change. It is why we are so focused on delivering on our plans for the future of education, because you cannot win the economic race of the future unless you can win the education race. With the benefits of a strong economy, we can provide people with new benefits, new prosperity to share. I am proud that we are working hard to improve dental health, including in partnership with the states, so that children in low- and middle-income families can benefit. I am proud that we are able to direct that care to where it is needed the most - to children in low- and middle-income families. These are the kinds of things you can do if you have a purpose, if you have a plan and if you work hard on policies for the nation's future.

  Dear me, we are down at the bottom of the barrel now, aren't we? We are down at the bottom of the barrel. These allegations are untrue. They have always been untrue. They have been known to be untrue for decades. Here is the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, in line with the Leader of the Opposition's strategy, down at the bottom of the mud basket now, desperately picking through, desperately scraping at the bottom of the mud. And why is she doing that? Because we have seen the opposition, through the deputy leader, across days in parliament come in and mislead this parliament. I made clear yesterday the misleading of this parliament by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition -                      I made clear to the parliament yesterday the way in which the deputy leader misled the parliament. It is a matter for her as to whether or not she apologises to this House and to the Australian people for misleading them. Since then, of course, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has gone out to do a number of interviews where the misleading has just got worse and worse and the allegations more and more wild. But the Deputy Leader of the Opposition confessed during those interviews to being in the company of Ralph Blewitt last Friday. She has had her own Godwin Grech moment -                      I have dealt with the question - thank you, Speaker. I am now dealing with the lack of standards of the opposition and the company they keep.

  I thank the member for Greenway for that very important question. Everyone on this side of the House has a plan for the future, unlike the rabble opposite who can only come in here and throw smear around as a substitute for putting forward considered policies for the future. We on this side of the House understand how important it is to make investments for the future. Our economy is a beacon of resilience compared to other developed economies around the world, and that has been because past governments, mainly from our side of politics, made the investments for the future and understood the importance of creating jobs now and well into the future.                 One of the reasons our economy is a beacon of resilience is the decisive action that we on this side of the parliament took at the height of the global financial crisis. A consequence of that has been that we did not go into recession and we did not experience the capital destruction and the skill destruction that has occurred across other developed economies. The consequence of that, as the Prime Minister said before, is our economy is 11 per cent larger than it was at the end of 2007. We are now the 12th largest economy in the world.                 But we know that, if we are to be assured of the future, we have got to keep making the investments for the future. Part of that is good fiscal policy, and because we have put in place good fiscal and budget policy the Reserve Bank has had the scope to adjust interest rates down - the equivalent of six interest rate cuts since November last year. What that means for a lot of people out there who are doing it tough with the cost of living is that, if you have a $300,000 mortgage, you are paying $4,500 a year less than you were paying when the Liberals were last in power. And nobody forgets what happened with interest rates when they were in office: they went up 10 times in a row, despite their claims that they would keep them at record lows.                 So we understand the importance of good fiscal policy, we understand the importance of policies which assist families with the cost of living and we also understand the importance of investing for the future so we can lift productivity and make sure that we are creating jobs well into the future, which is why the government is so focused on investments, not just in the NBN but, most particularly, in education, because we know that is the key to growth in the Asian century. Just compare all of that - compare our plans for the future - with what those opposite are saying at the moment. They are simply stuck in the mud bucket of the past. They do not have a single costed policy that they could put forward in this parliament. Why is that? Because essentially they are led by a policy lightweight. The Leader of the Opposition has not got a clue when it comes to economic policy. He is all venom and no vision.

  I have dealt with these matters publicly.                     Before the dirt team starts catcalling, let us be very clear here. I have dealt with these allegations publicly and I can guarantee that what the Deputy Leader of the Opposition refers to was not to my benefit and did not pay for renovations at my home. This is smear, pure and simple. What the Deputy Leader of the Opposition said in her question before - the allegation there about clothing - was smear, pure and simple.                     Well, the allegation about whatever the -                      There is no amount of screaming that makes this falsehood true. I have answered this clearly and publicly on the public record now since 1995. I paid for the renovations at my home. This is smear, pure and simple.                  Let us see how the opposition has put this smear, pure and simple, together. First, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has spent time with a man who has said he believes he is guilty of fraud and is looking for immunity from that fraud as well as a series of other assertions about his conduct that he himself has made that would make you wonder why the Deputy Leader of the Opposition would spend time with such a person. Then the Deputy Leader of the Opposition today has referred to an affidavit from Bob Kernohan. It is a matter of longstanding public record that this affidavit was drawn up by John Pasquarelli of One Nation. So there we have the Deputy Leader of the Opposition meeting with a man who, on his own admission, is guilty of fraud, and there is the Deputy Leader of the Opposition coming into this parliament and relying on the work of One Nation for smear, pure and simple.                     Thank you very much, Madam Speaker, and you are absolutely right; the terminology 'childish antics' is absolutely right.                      I have answered the question. It is absolutely right - childish antics, sleaze and smear, because we are dealing with an opposition with not one policy for the nation's future, a man who is incapable of generating a policy for the nation's future and a man who does not have the guts to front this sleaze campaign himself.

  I thank the member for his question and thank him for asking a question which is about a policy matter and a policy matter of extreme importance to the nation's future - that is, how we deal with the legitimate aspirations of Indigenous Australians for control of land, how we deal with land rights and with native title. I am proud that the government has a strong record on native title, that Labor has a strong record on native title and that, in this year, we have marked the 20th anniversary of the Mabo decision. The Mabo decision is one of those things that make you reflect on the nature of political debate and how that political debate is viewed with the remove of history. A divisive political debate where Labor was opposed every step of the way by the conservatives, where they sought to persuade Australians that their backyard was at risk, is now, with the remove of 20 years, accepted as bipartisan settled policy. It might remind people of a few other things that are being debated in this parliament during the course of this year.                 Our 2009 reforms to the Native Title Act gave the Federal Court a central role in managing native title claims. Since those reforms, the rate of consent determinations has increased almost fourfold, and I think we would all be very happy to see that: parties working together and coming together for consent determinations. The Attorney-General has recently introduced legislation to bring native title mediation under the control of the Federal Court to ensure that all parties have proper ability to be heard, along with the authority and procedural fairness that comes from court processes. We are now also introducing further reforms to native title, including clearer good-faith provisions, and the Attorney-General is introducing these this week.                 In relation to specific changes to native title respondent funding, I can advise the member that these funding changes are nothing new. They were announced in the 2011 budget along with changes to legal financial assistance schemes across a wide range of areas. They follow an independent review on how government can best ensure that finite legal resources, the assistance funds, can help those in need.                 The government has provided commercially viable businesses with generous government funding for native title claims for the past 20 years. Now that native title processes are well established, it is not necessary for taxpayers' money to go to commercially viable organisations for native title matters. The revised scheme will continue to provide assistance for new or novel matters and for the costs of disbursements related to native title claims.                 I hope that information assists the member. I know that he is very passionate about the pursuit of such issues, and I thank him for the question.

  I thank the member for Fraser for his question. The apology that I delivered yesterday on behalf of the government has been widely and well received. I acknowledge the support of members of the House for that apology, in particular the member for Fadden, who spoke yesterday on behalf of the opposition, strongly supporting the government's announcement yesterday, in particular, the apology.                 The member for Fraser asked what we are doing to make sure that an apology will be backed up by concrete reform so that we never have to see the need for such an apology again. Members will recall that all of these matters arose in the aftermath of the so-called ADFA Skype incident, where the government set in train a series of reviews, a range of cultural reviews, asking the Sex Discrimination Commissioner, Liz Broderick, to conduct a review of the treatment of women in the Australian Defence Force Academy and the Australian Defence Force generally; the decision by the government to allow all areas of combat to be open to women; and the DLA Piper review, which I dealt with yesterday.                  In response to the cultural reviews, earlier this year the Chief of the Defence Force, General Hurley, and the then secretary, Duncan Lewis, published Defence's overarching response to that, described as Pathway to change. That document is now essential reading for all members of the Defence Force. In that document the Chief of the Defence Force and the secretary make it clear that in the past there have been mistakes but from here on in there is zero tolerance, there is no acceptance for the turning of a blind eye and there is no acceptance for inappropriate conduct. In the course of yesterday I also announced more detail in terms of the government's and Defence's acceptance of all of the recommendations of the Sex Discrimination Commissioner into the treatment of women in the Australian Defence Force.                  The member graciously referred to the apology yesterday as historic. There were two other things yesterday which became public which I also regard as historic. Firstly, the government and Defence announced that, when it came to allegations of sexual assault, sexual abuse, harassment or discrimination, restrictive reporting would be allowed - in other words, reporting on a confidential basis outside the chain of command. This is unheard of, but we have seen very good experience of this in the United States in recent years. Secondly was the statement by the chiefs of the service committee - the Chief and Vice-Chief of the Defence Force, the secretary and the various service chiefs - that implementation of these reforms would be non-negotiable. Yesterday I said 'our actions and commitment into the future will ensure that the apology given today to those men and women in the Australian Defence Force and the Department of Defence who have been subject to abuse will never have to be repeated'.                  In the end, ministers present and future, chiefs of the Defence Force present and future, secretaries present and future and service chiefs present and future will be judged by the way in which we ensure that all of the reforms are implemented to ensure that this never happens again.

  Let me refer the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to where I have dealt with this publicly and take her through this matter just so that she is not misleading the parliament. I dealt with this publicly yesterday. I refer the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to dealing with it publicly. There is a media report today of what I said yesterday and that media report is incorrect. I said yesterday: 'I do not, to the best of my knowledge - I do not remember $5,000 being put in my bank account.' I then went on to explain how my normal experience across my working life of going to the ATM and checking my balance is that you are more likely to get a surprise on the downside rather than the upside. But I had taken steps, because I did want to be in a position, if possible, to produce my bank records, because I thought this matter was likely to be raised. I am not in a position to produce my bank records, simply because the Commonwealth Bank does not retain bank records from 17 years ago.

  I thank the member for Reid for his question. He would know that his constituents have seen over $91 million invested in 111 projects, benefiting 43 schools across his electorate. But the fact is that Australians are faced with a future. When you think about the future, it is education that is absolutely crucial. It is absolutely crucial to our national prosperity.                  Last week we saw new analysis by PricewaterhouseCoopers, finding that if we improve our schools to the world's best standards then we could generate over $3 trillion over the life of a child born today. That is the productivity capacity of a good education for Australian students. We have had five years of reform and delivery - reform like the national partnerships, the My School website and delivery where we have seen improvement in facilities right around Australia in schools. Now we have an unprecedented opportunity to take the next step - a national plan for school improvement, a plan that for the first time ensures that all schools get the funding they need to deliver a great education to all students, a plan that recognises the clear link between disadvantage and student performance, a Labor government plan that is underpinned by the principles of equity, excellence in teaching, transparency and accountability, and informed choice for parents. I am asked about alternative plans. The plan was labelled as mad by the shadow minister opposite, who, at the time of the last election, had identified only cuts for education in this country - cuts to trade training centres, cuts to the national partnership to improve teacher quality. In fact he has had a pretty terrible year. It has been 764 days since he has asked a question on education. But here is the opposition's spokesman who thinks that one in seven teachers should be sacked, that we should be considering class sizes that are bigger. And now he has had a brain-fade today by saying that My School should be demolished - the information on the My School website no longer available to parents, no longer available to teachers, no longer available to those of us in this House. That is where we are with the opposition.                 I am asked about the impacts. Here we are, with a broken funding system on offer from Mr Abbott and Mr Pyne that could see Australian schools around $2 billion worse off over four years, a party that believes there is no connection between low socioeconomic background and student performance, and an opposition leader who believes that the current level of support to 6,743 government schools right around Australia is an injustice. They can carry on with the veneer of smear in this parliament. We will carry on with getting a national plan for school improvement delivered.

  I thank the member for Hindmarsh for the question. The plan was tabled in the parliament at five o'clock yesterday afternoon and became immediately available for disallowance. Overnight a disallowance motion was moved in the Senate by the Greens Senator Hanson-Young and was moved in this house by the member for Riverina and seconded by the member for Murray.                 There is a report which has come online, on the adelaidenow website, by Mark Kenny over the last hour-and-a-half or so which indicates that the coalition as a party will not be supporting disallowance of the plan and will be supporting the additional 450 gigalitres. I want to acknowledge that and welcome that. What that means is that we now have a situation where Australians know, basin communities know and people who care about the Murray-Darling Basin know what the Murray-Darling Basin plan will be, what the approach will be - and they are in no doubt that the basin will be restored to health. They are in no doubt now that for the first time in a century the national approach to the basin that always should have been there will now be there, is now law and will remain law.                 It will be the case that members of this parliament will be asked to vote on the disallowance motion that has been moved by the member for Riverina and seconded by the member for Murray. So I should make clear to the House, in answer to the question for the member for Hindmarsh, exactly what disallowance would mean, because it is a similar message for senators dealing with the Hanson-Young resolution. Once disallowed, the plan loses all force of law immediately. It can be reintroduced six months later, but only in an identical form, which would then mean that, if disallowance were successful in either house, the entire process which has been going on since the last election would need to recommence from scratch. Effectively, we would be looking at a situation where the reform - long-awaited and built on over decades - would come to nothing.                 I have to say that there are some members of the House who have always opposed basin reform and are at least, I guess, being consistent in that view. But I do have to take issue with the attitude that the Greens have taken on this - in the name of the environment. There would be nothing worse for the Murray-Darling Basin than for this plan to be thrown out. There is nothing good for the environment in the approach that the Greens are taking on this issue. There is no doubt that if the Greens were successful in this part of the campaign the next drought would look exactly like the last drought looked. We would see a system approach drought with no level of resilience at all. The members of this House who have committed to reform are on the right side of history on this issue and are making sure that a much-needed reform will serve the basin well into the future.

  I thank the member for La Trobe for her question. In the lead up to the last election the Prime Minister committed that building a modern mental health system would be a priority for this term of government and that we would introduce a new annual report card on mental health and on suicide prevention - a responsibility to the new National Mental Health Commission, which we created earlier this year as part of the government's $2.2 billion mental health reform plan.                 Today, Professor Allan Fels, the chair of the commission, delivered the first of those annual reports. It is very different to the traditional reports on mental health, which have tended to count things such as hospital beds and doctors and nurses in the health system. While these are undoubtedly important things, this report shifts the focus to telling us how Australia's mental health services are performing from the perspective of people actually using them. The report tracks the degree to which we are supporting those Australians to lead a 'contributing life', to use the language of the Mental Health Commission. Importantly also, the commission does not just focus on the health system; it also looks at those other things that determine the degree to which these Australians are able to live a contributing life - stable housing and a chance of a job, just to name a couple.                 In broad terms the commission's report reinforces what I and others in the government have been saying for some time now: while there is much that we are going to expand and improve mental health services, there is still much for us to do. The report card reinforces, for example, the importance of the government's investment in effective, community-based responses to suicide risk. It also urges all of us to focus more on the physical health needs of Australians living with mental illness, in particular, and on their much lower life expectancy. There are also important messages for state governments around the delivery of their long-standing commitments to drive down rates of seclusion and physical restraint in their hospital systems and to prevent situations where Australians with mental illness are discharged from those same hospitals into a situation of homelessness.                 The commission intends to build on this report with an even greater focus in future years on the experiences and the views of those who actually use the system - views that will be a valuable guide as the government continues to implement our plan to build a modern mental health system. I am very pleased that the report has already received such strong community and media attention. On behalf of the government - and, I am sure, on behalf of the Prime Minister - I extend my thanks to Professor Fels and the other commissioners for their dedication to this task and for their hard work.

  I did nothing wrong. Nothing the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has said or done during the course of today actually raises, as a matter of fact, any wrongdoing. What we have seen from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is that she has repeddled allegations I first dealt with in 1995. She has repeddled matters I dealt with comprehensively on the public record yesterday. She has repeddled matters out of an affidavit drawn by a person associated with the formation and operation of One Nation. She has repeddled these matters associated with making wilder and wilder and more and more ridiculous claims in the media.                  This is because the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, and the opposition generally under this leader, are on a mission of sleaze and smear but they have not got anything credible to say. They are just repeddling incredibly old allegations or matters I have dealt with comprehensively on the public record. Indeed, the Manager of Opposition Business's point of order to try and get an out-of-order question into order actually made the point that these matters have been dealt with by me in statements comprehensively made.                  So, to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition: I have dealt with this matter over many long years. I have dealt with it comprehensively in front of the media. I have answered questions in here. I have been truthful in those answers. I did nothing wrong, and no amount of smear, repeddled from the best part of 20 years ago, will ever change that.

  I want to thank the member for Blair, who is a very strong advocate for better health services in his electorate, including better cancer care in his electorate. We believe that this country has an excellent health system - an excellent health system that can be made better - and we are working every single day to make it better.                 In dental, for example, we have just invested an extra $4 billion that will mean 3.4 million children will grow up being able to see a dentist as easily as they can now see a GP. And we have put extra money into public dental services, too. We have introduced plain packaging - a world first. We have introduced Gardasil vaccination for girls as well as boys - also a world first. We have expanded bowel cancer screening and there is $20 billion extra for hospitals. We also have world-leading Medicare Local organisations.                 What do we get from those opposite? - obviously, no vision, no ideas and constant negativity. The only thing we have heard from the shadow minister lately is that he is going to cut health jobs just like his mates in Queensland. Medicare Locals are the next big step in primary health care. Medicare Locals employ doctors, nurses, allied health professionals, psychologists, Aboriginal health workers, social workers and others. They provide services like GPs after hours, psychology, childhood immunisation and allied health services in rural and regional areas. They build on what GPs have always done, but they do it in a way that is coordinated and locally driven - local solutions for local healthcare gaps.                  They deliver solutions such as, in Blair, with the West Moreton-Oxley Medicare Local working with locals to provide the first after-hours service in Fernvale; or the Lower Murray Medicare Local, which teamed up with the Royal Flying Doctor Service to help transport Indigenous people with chronic conditions in remote communities to medical appointments. Why does the Leader of the Opposition want to stop that?                 Greater Metro South Brisbane Medicare Local partnered with Mater Health Services and Micah Projects to make sure that homeless people get decent care. Why does the Leader of the Opposition want to stop that? The shadow minister's own Metro North Brisbane Medicare Local has GP services for homeless people and a mobile dental van. Why do those opposite want to stop this? They want to stop this because they have always hated Medicare and they will stop the next front in the rollout of Medicare services. They come in here with an amendment. Their amendment is a $3½ million rebranding exercise. That is not policy; it is an expensive mistake.

  Thank you very much, Speaker. I will answer the part of the Deputy Leader's question you ruled in order. I dealt yesterday comprehensively with my state of knowledge about these matters. And I dealt comprehensively yesterday with assertions about what I should have reported when I dealt with that comprehensively yesterday. I stand by those answers. Those answers are correct. They are honest answers. So, once again, we have the Deputy Leader of the Opposition either dealing with matters -                      The Deputy Leader of the Opposition's question proceeds on a false premise. I remind the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that, in order for an association to be incorporated in Western Australia, the intention to incorporate that association has to be advertised. It was so advertised in the West Australian newspaper on Friday, 6 March 1992. So persons who bought or read the West Australian newspaper on that day or who had cause to look back on those records at some later date would have seen it - it was there very publicly. It is a requirement of association law. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition is trying to create a false premise about what could be known about this association. I refer her to the fact that the incorporation was publicly dealt with in the newspaper.                  More generally, the opposition's questions today have been all about smear and innuendo. The questions they have asked are ones I have dealt with on the public record as long ago as 1995. If the opposition genuinely thinks there is a serious allegation against me at the heart of all this, why hasn't the Leader of the Opposition asked a question? The Leader of the Opposition has asked me questions up hill and down dale about matters like carbon pricing. He has engaged in hard-hitting speeches in this parliament. He has never been shy of insults. He has never been shy about giving me a character assessment.                     If the opposition genuinely thought there were anything serious at the base of all this, why wouldn't the Leader of the Opposition have the guts to get up and do it himself? We know the answer to that. The Leader of the Opposition is trying to pretend to the Australian people that he is not the person holding this bucket of mud when he most clearly is - and clearly he is doing that because he is incapable of producing a policy or plan in the nation's interest.

  I thank the member for Throsby for his question and for having been such a strong advocate for the 12,800 small businesses in his electorate. He asked me what we have been doing to help small businesses in this country. The first thing we did was to ensure that they did as well as they possibly could when confronted with the global financial crisis. We invested in the economy at a time when private investment was contracting and jobs were at risk. We invested and, as a result of that investment, thousands of small businesses were prevented from hitting the wall - which is what would have happened if those stimulus packages had not been put in place. I remind the House that Tony Abbott and the opposition voted against most of those initiatives.                 Those stimulus packages are a major reason for the current state of the economy. We have very low unemployment, we have confined inflation, we have economic growth just under four per cent, our economy has grown by 11 per cent since the global financial crisis and we have a low ratio of debt to GDP - one-tenth of the average for OECD countries.                      We also have - and the member for North Sydney should know this - a lower official cash rate than at any time during the Howard years. Indeed, it is less than half what we inherited. It was 6.75 per cent when we came into office. As a result, we now have an environment in which small businesses can not only survive but thrive - not only as a result of the stimulus packages but as a result of specific measures such as the loss carry-back initiative, the instant asset tax write-off and the tripling of the tax-free threshold from $6,000 to $19,200. All of these measures will assist small business in this country.                 I was asked about other approaches. Today the ANZ released research showing that small business sales in the three months to the end of October were up by 3.6 per cent and that sales for small business for the year have increased by 8.3 per cent. This is fantastic news for small business. We know it does not result from the efforts of Tony Abbott. We know he is not a friend of small business.                      He has already said he will oppose the instant asset tax write-off and that he will cut the loss carry-back initiative. He opposed the tax cut and will cut other initiatives this government has put in place for small business. He has no plan for small business and he has no plan for this country.

  I again refer the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to my answers yesterday, which were correct and truthful answers. I also refer her to the answer I gave to her last question, in which I said that the premise she is trying to create about the association and knowledge of it in the public domain is not correct. I refer her once again to the advertising of the incorporation of this association in the West Australian.                     Thank you, Madam Speaker - the point of order goes to a misleading of the Australian people which has been at the heart of the opposition's case, and clearly the member for Sturt does not even understand the issue. I did not create a fund, I did not create a bank account, I did not deal with a bank account. I have said that clearly on the public record. I provided legal advice on the incorporation of an association, and I am pointing the parliament to the advertising of that incorporation. If the Leader of the Opposition wants to interject across the table, why does he not have the guts to get up and ask a question?

  I thank the member for Kingston for her question on policy. The government has been very active on both the trade and foreign policy fronts. Recently in Phnom Penh the Prime Minister and I were at the launch of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership negotiations directed towards a free trade area for Asia and the Pacific. While we were there we attended a meeting hosted by President Obama on the Trans-Pacific Partnership, also directed towards the ideal of a free trade area for Asia and the Pacific. I have had the opportunity to meet with Indonesian trade minister Gita Wirjawan, coordinating minister Hatta Rajasa and agriculture minister Suswono.                 I spoke personally very recently with China's commerce minister Chen Deming and with WTO Director-General Pascal Lamy. The Prime Minister and I met with Prime Minister Noda of Japan. I have met with Malaysia's trade minister Mustapa Mohamed, Russia's trade minister Andrey Belousov, the Deputy Prime Minister of Turkey, the South Korean trade minister and Michael Froman, Deputy National Security Adviser to the President of the United States of America.                 Foreign policy has been prosecuted very effectively by foreign minister Bob Carr, who has met with Secretary of State Hilary Clinton, with Indonesian foreign minister Marty Natalegawa, with the Malaysian foreign minister, with the foreign minister of Japan and with the foreign minister of France. We have won a seat on the UN Security Council, we have co-hosted the AUSMIN talks with the Minister for Defence. All of these are directed towards pursuing Australia's national interest.                  I was asked about alternatives. The only high profile meeting the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has had in recent days is with Ralph Blewitt. That is a great testament to their policy, is it not? The judgement on the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is not one that I cast; it is the judgement of the Leader of the Opposition who in a CEDA speech recently said in relation to the member for Kooyong, who was in attendance:                 _ I've got to say it's nice to have someone in the Parliamentary Party who understands foreign affairs at last.                 What an indictment on the Deputy Leader of the Opposition - even the Leader of the Opposition regards the Deputy Leader of the Opposition as a policy-free zone.                    The member for Cowan then left the chamber.                     Dr EMERSON:                     This parliament is supposed to be a clearing house of ideas, not of smears, and the only party which is interested in ideas and policy is the Labor Party, the Gillard Labor government, and those opposite should be condemned for their 20 questions of smear.

  I thank the Leader of the Opposition for the first question he has asked me this week. I have been asked 18 questions by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition this week, and this is the first question on foreign affairs. But where is the Deputy Leader of the Opposition? She is nowhere to be seen, like she has been seen nowhere today. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition is now an embarrassment to the Leader of the Opposition and the opposition generally. There she is, unable to ask a question about foreign affairs.                     I am certainly dealing with foreign affairs questions. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition is unable to ask a question about foreign affairs, was pulled off attending the National Press Club and did not go to the Leader of the Opposition's book launch because of how embarrassed the opposition is -                      Yes, I know you are embarrassed.                     In answer to the Leader of the Opposition's first question for the week, let me assure the Leader of the Opposition that I, as Prime Minister, and this Labor government - like Labor prime ministers in the past and Labor governments in the past - are firm supporters of a two-state solution to the peace problems in the Middle East. We would all want to wake up in a world where Israel could live behind secure borders, its people in peace and no longer fearing rocket attacks from anyone outside their territory. We would all want to wake up in a world where the people of Palestine had their own nation and they too lived in peace behind secure borders. That is the world in which we would want to live. That is the world which we have always wanted to see come about. Labor has been and always will be: a supporter of a two-state solution in the Middle East; a strong and firm friend of Israel; and working with the Palestinian people to realise their legitimate aspirations for a homeland and for a state. That is what we will continue to do.                 The Leader of the Opposition is asking this question: (1) because he needed to ask a question sometime this week; and (2) because the deputy leader is now such an embarrassment that she cannot pursue her portfolio areas. But the Leader of the Opposition is asking this question because he wants to play a little bit of political carry-on. I remind the Leader of the Opposition of this: it has been bipartisan policy across the major parties in this parliament to support Israel, to support peace in the Middle East and to support two states in the Middle East. This side of the parliament will always hold faith with that, and we will always take that issue with the utmost seriousness. It will not be this kind of political plaything to try to resolve your embarrassment today.

  I thank the member for Bass for his question and I thank him and his colleagues - my colleagues - for their interests, their passion and their commitment to ensuring that every child in every school gets a great education. I want to thank my colleagues for turning out in such numbers this morning to support a piece of legislation which is close to our Labor hearts - to see introduced into this parliament an education bill that will create a new era for education in our nation and that will ensure that for every child in every school, as part of their citizenship entitlement, we commit to them: that they will get an excellent education; that we will work as a nation - as a people - to improve the quality of education for every child in every school; that we will ensure that every school has a school improvement plan; and that we are focused on the transparency of results - something that the opposition, when it was in government, failed to do. It could not get into the hands of Australian parents, Australian teachers, Australian governments, state and federal, the kind of information that is necessary to guide education policy.                 I am proud that because of the work of this government we now have the information we need to drive an era of improvement and change; that we can talk about the achievements of every school; that we can point to - because we have done it - what improves education for children in schools; and that we can show some certainty about what drives up results in literacy and numeracy, and educational achievement around the country.                 Now is the time, having done all of that work across five years in government, to move to the next stage: to ensure that there is a national plan for school improvement; to ensure that every child's education is properly funded; and to ensure that we drive our schooling system for our nation into the top five schooling systems in the world and that our nation realises the full economic promise of the century in which we live, this Asian century of change.                 We laid out in our white paper, our national plan for the nation's future, our determination to make sure that we win the economic race by winning the education race. I was proud to bring to the parliament this morning personally as Prime Minister, working with the Minister for School Education, Peter Garrett, a bill to enshrine that commitment to an excellent education at the heart of our national life. And I think it is to be regretted that members of the opposition - including the shadow minister for education - think education is so unimportant that they could not even be bothered to be here.

  To the Deputy Leader of the Opposition's question: I think the matter she raises was canvassed in the West Australian, as we know from parliament yesterday. She thinks that is a secret document, the West Australian but I refer her to the West Australian where these matters were dealt with.                     Madam Speaker, on a point of order. The AWU fatal accident or death fund from Boulder was not referred to in any newspaper yesterday, and therefore the Prime Minister cannot be relevant by dismissing it in that way.                     Given the Manager of Opposition Business may have misheard, but he certainly misquoted, I was not referring to a newspaper yesterday; I was referring to the West Australian from several weeks ago.                  I am amazed to get this question from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, who is unable to remember who she spoke to a week ago - and she is asking me to deal with events of 20 years ago! She is unable to tell who she has got on the phone but here she is, day after day, pretending that she is interested in the answer to questions about 20 years ago. For the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, this throwing of mud really turned into an embarrassment yesterday. She is humiliated and today was pulled by the opposition -                      from any public appearances because she is so embarrassing to them. To the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, I refer her to what her colleagues are saying about this campaign and to the statements of Hugh Riminton on Channel 10 last night -                      The quote will take us centrally there. Hugh Riminton on Channel 10 last night said -                  That is the point of order, Rumpole.                     I am quoting Hugh Riminton from Channel Ten last night:                 They -                  that is the opposition -                  are accusing the Prime Minister of acting illegally, when senior frontbenchers are conceding privately -                  conceding very cheerfully -                   _ that they don't have any evidence to back up that very serious charge at all.                 The cheerful concession is because they too know that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition's performance on this matter has been embarrassing. If the Deputy Leader of the Opposition were serious about this issue how come she did not give a press conference to deal with it?

  I thank the member for Moreton for that very important question on policy. Everybody on this side of the House is concerned about policy - how we can make this country a better place for our children and our grandchildren. That stands in stark contrast to those opposite who are simply running a smear campaign.                  The OECD report once again confirms how resilient our economy is, unlike those of most other developed economies. Our economic fundamentals are strong. We have solid growth, low unemployment and contained inflation. This country will grow faster than most other major developed economies this year and next. We are going to grow faster than the OECD as a whole.                 The OECD report reaches this conclusion on resource investment in Australia:                 Mining investments should continue to expand vigorously in 2013 in view of announced plans.                 That was backed up today by the Bureau of Resource and Energy Economics. They have issued an update of the value of committed projects. When we are talking about committed projects, we are talking about projects which are locked in. The value of such projects has increased by $7 billion over the six months to October - something the Minister for Resources and Energy and the government are very proud of - to reach a record high of $268 billion. When you look at all the projects on the drawing board, the value is a staggering $650 billion. This project pipeline has not been immune to what has occurred with the terms of trade and what has occurred with international commodity prices. But what this information is telling us is that the prospects for our resources sector are very bright.                  We know the world out there is uncertain and that our prospects are not necessarily assured. But we also know that you need a plan for the future in this Asian century. That is why the government is very closely focused on productivity, skills and education in particular. That is why the bill the Prime Minister introduced into the House this morning is so important. We know that over the next five years we have to put in place the reforms to ensure we maximise the opportunities which will flow to this country in the Asian century. What a clear contrast that is to those opposite - out there every day playing the politics of smear and sleaze and with no policies at all. We have an opposition leader going the biff, trying to knock out everything and everyone. It is all about aggression and not about outcomes. We on this side of the House are absolutely focused.                     I withdraw. A smear campaign from those opposite has simply backfired and they have been hit with mud, from head to toe.

  I have dealt with questions about these matters, about August 1995 and September 1995 and the issues that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition raises. I have dealt with them at press conferences and in this parliament. I think the issue today for the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is at what point will she apologise for making an absurd allegation against me yesterday, then denying the making of it and then being forced into a humiliating retreat? At what time will she apologise to the members of the press gallery -                      Thank you, Madam Speaker. As I was saying, when will the Deputy Leader of the Opposition apologise to the press gallery for having misled them yesterday about her degree of contact with Mr Blewitt, and when will the Leader of the Opposition, who is responsible for this campaign of sleaze and a smear, acknowledge it for exactly what it has been? Today we have been treated to the absurdity of the Leader of the Opposition, who has spent days hiding behind his deputy, running away from her. She was instructed not to go to his book launch, his big so-called positive announcement; running away from her -                      The problem with all of this campaign of smear is that the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition got a bucket of mud - they had one waiting from 2007 - and they tipped it over the deputy leader. That is their problem, not mine.

  I thank the member for New England for his question. There is probably no area of water reform more complex, and where the science involves more variables, than underground water. In terms of the plan, there was a significant difference of opinion between what New South Wales officials believed was a sustainable use of groundwater and what the Murray-Darling Basin Authority believed was a sustainable use of groundwater. On Eastern Porous, which covers the Gunnedah area right through to Sydney Basin, there was a difference - not massive - of around 15 gigalitres; on Western Porous the difference was massive. Where the authority was recommending 116 gigalitres as being sustainable, New South Wales believed that figure should have been 222 gigalitres. In the community meetings no issue caused more unity between people who looked at it from a conservation perspective and people who looked at it from a production perspective than making sure we were careful on groundwater. What was said in the meeting in Adelaide and what was said in the meeting in Griffith, and the members of parliament who were present at those meetings will know this, indicated that the issue of groundwater was a very real concern and people wanted us to take a cautious approach on it.                  The New South Wales government is asking us to not have a further scientific process to resolve this issue. I am not willing to agree to that, the environmental movement would not support that and irrigation communities would not support that, and it would be taking a risk with the Murray-Darling Basin that I am not prepared to recommend this parliament take. For that reason we have within the plan a scientific process to go through a full scientific verification over two years covering what New South Wales believes are the right figures and what the authority believes are the sustainable figures. If the scientific evidence ends up showing that the New South Wales figures are sustainable, then they would be allowed to go ahead. You can go through all the challenges that communities will go through to deliver a good outcome on surface water; but, if you take an unreasonable risk with ground water, the whole thing gets undone - and that is a risk that the government are not prepared to take, that we do not believe we could recommend to this parliament. While New South Wales might be willing to ask us to take that sort of risk without the scientific evidence, it is something that I could never recommend as a sustainable option for the Murray-Darling Basin.

  I thank the member for Makin for his question. I would also like to take this opportunity to welcome the Italian delegation who are in the chamber today. This delegation, led by Mr de Mistura, the Italian Undersecretary of State, is the largest ever Italian economic delegation to come to Australia, with more than 35 companies and more than 50 people. What they see in our strong economy are opportunities for investment that will benefit not only these Italian companies but also Australia. It is because we have the fundamentals right that we can benefit from international construction expertise and healthy competition in the infrastructure construction sector, which delivers better outcomes for the Australian taxpayer. That is why foreign investment is welcome in Australia: better outcomes for the Australian taxpayer.                  We have practical examples as a result of the work that I have been doing over the last few years. The Legacy Way tunnel project in Brisbane is a good example. The Italian firm Ghella and the Spanish firm Acciona, in partnership with local firm BMD, were the successful bidders on this $2 billion project, and they were many hundreds of millions of dollars lower than the next bid. They bring their expertise, particularly in tunnelling, to Australia. Rizzani de Eccher, another company in the delegation, is also involved in a major infrastructure project, the $812 million South Road Superway in Adelaide. This project is the biggest investment in a South Australian road project ever and the state's most complex engineering road project to date.                 These outcomes are a direct result of the dialogue between the Australian government and Italian companies, as well as initiatives such as the Foreign Direct Investment Promotion and Attraction Strategy for Major Australian Infrastructure developed by my department and Austrade, who have played a very important role in these issues.                 We on this side of the chamber are encouraging investment in infrastructure through a range of measures. Through the infrastructure working group we have also cut red tape so that prequalification applies: if you apply in one state, you can operate right throughout the economy, thereby ensuring that there is a benefit for the nation's productivity.

  As the matter grows more and more embarrassing from the point of view of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, I remind her that in this House and outside this House I have consistently answered questions about this matter and how I provided advice as a lawyer on the association, and no amount of smear changes that simple fact.                 In relation to smear and the line of opposition questioning today, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition's questions have been based on Michael Smith's blog today. That is her only source, Michael Smith -                      In answer to the point of order by the member for Mackellar and to the question in general: I have answered questions about my role as a solicitor in relation to providing legal advice on this association. I am also pointing out to the House that the opposition's tactics today have been dictated by Michael Smith's blog. Who is Michael Smith? He is the man who was sacked for wanting to defame me, basing that defamation on an affidavit drawn up by John Pasquarelli of One Nation fame. Who is Michael Smith?                     I am dealing with this in the sense that the source of these allegations is Michael Smith. Who is Michael Smith? He is the man accompanying Ralph Blewitt around Australia. Who is Michael Smith? He is the man who rang the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and handed the phone over so that she could speak to Ralph Blewitt. What is the Deputy Leader of the Opposition's version of these events? It is that Michael Smith rang her up and she had no idea who the phone was going to be handed over to. Who was she expecting - Humphrey B Bear? No; he can't talk. Tom Cruise? No; he's not in Australia.                     Who on earth was she expecting on the phone? And why didn't she tell the truth about it yesterday?

  I thank the member for Greenway for her question. I know of her abiding interest in education. The fact is that this is a truly historic day for education in our country. The introduction of the Australian Education Bill marks a turning point away from the politics of division and negativity towards the new national focus on improving education for every student in every school, irrespective of where they are living and irrespective of their means.                 The Australian Education Bill, which was introduced this morning by the Prime Minister, is the next big step in this government's response to the most comprehensive review of school funding that we have had in nearly 40 years. That review - the Gonski review - said that the current funding system was broken, that too many students were being left behind, particularly students from poorer communities, Indigenous communities and students from regional areas. On this side of the House -                      The fact is that the shadow opposition spokesman and the opposition leader chose to absent themselves from the House this morning when this bill was introduced. No more needs to be said.                 We outlined, in this bill, a fairer funding model based on the needs of every student, with additional support for those students who need extra support - a new national plan for school improvement, with additional funding reforms tied to the investment itself. That is how we make sure that every student is given the opportunity for an excellent education, and it is how we make sure that every student gets the education they need for the high-skills, high-wages jobs of the future. That is how we keep our economy strong. This is a true Labor reform.                 I am asked about alternative policies. Under Mr Abbott and Mr Pyne, education program after education program has been placed on the chopping block. Look at what they have said about the level of support for public schools and injustice - the argument that schools should have larger class sizes, that My School should be gutted, that one in seven teachers, or around 43,000 teachers, should be sacked, and that goals for Australia to be in the top five performing nations are 'mad'. At the end of the day, they are sticking to a broken funding system that would see Australian schools as much as $2 billion worse off over four years.                 For a preview of what is on offer from the coalition, just look at look at Liberal-National coalitions in the other states: savage cuts to TAFE in Victoria, damaging cuts to youth services in Victoria, and the deepest cuts to education that we have ever seen in New South Wales. When we introduce an Australian Education Bill into the parliament we do it because, on this side of the House, we stand for making sure that every single student in Australia gets the best education they can. That is the way of the future.

  This has now become truly embarrassing. Here we are. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition was out there with this huge conspiracy theory yesterday, with these big allegations against me. She was out there making false claims, then forgetting that she had made the false claims, then denying the false claims, and then not telling the truth about the nature and number of her conversations with Mr Blewitt. Then, today, so much of an embarrassment is she that she cannot go to the Leader of the Opposition's book launch.                     So much of an embarrassment is she that she is the one who has to ask these questions while the strategy is now being done over there without her. To the Deputy Leader of the Opposition I say in all sincerity: please, stop embarrassing yourself. It is just getting too painful to watch.

  I thank the member for Wakefield for his question. He represents many people employed in the automotive manufacturing centre. In fact, there are about a quarter of a million Australians employed in the automotive industry. It is unquestionably the bedrock of Australia's manufacturing industry. This Labor government is supporting the car industry through difficult times with our $5.4 billion new car plan. That support is vital. It was confirmed yesterday by the managing director of General Motors Holden in Australia, Mr Mike Devereux, who stated that, without that government assistance, there would be no car-making capacity or car industry in this country at all.                 It is important to record that in March GM Holden committed more than $1 billion over the next 10 years to keep building cars in this country, supported by an investment by state and federal governments totalling $275 million. In fact, Mr Devereux said yesterday that, if that government support was removed, Holden would then review its investment commitment. He also remarked that comments by those in the coalition, creating uncertainty about the future, were creating significant doubts about that investment.                 What is the policy of those opposite? What is it? We know the member for North Sydney has been going around saying that he is opposed to support for the car industry at all. The member for Sturt has condemned Mr Devereux's comments, creating further uncertainty. We know the policy position of the Leader of the Opposition is to cut $1½ billion from the new car plan.                   The member for Indi then left the chamber                   .                     As the member for Indi leaves the chamber, I will say that she commented today that she was not sure that the coalition did have a policy but that they will try to have one by the time of the next election. What a joke! A quarter of a million people depend upon this industry and you have different members of the coalition espousing different policy positions and creating investment uncertainty. That is exactly what General Motors Holden were commenting upon.                 Let's make something absolutely clear: this side, Labor, supports the car industry and supports the people who work within it and that side, the coalition, do not support the industry and will not support the people who are employed in it. They have already pocketed the $1½ billion in savings to fill their $75 billion black hole. All of their claims are completely unbelievable. They are going to cost people their jobs.

  I have dealt with those claims previously. I have dealt with them in here and I have dealt with them outside the parliament. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition is at the bottom of the mud bucket now and she does not actually have any new mud left. The problem for the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is that she and the Leader of the Opposition came into this parliament with a strategy of smear. Together, they got the mud. They used the old Liberal Party dirt file and added to it.                     The strategy was that the Leader of the Opposition would be quiet as the Deputy Leader of the Opposition threw the mud. Here we are on day 3 and it is the Deputy Leader of the Opposition who is covered in mud, but it is time that the Leader of the Opposition took personal responsibility.

  I want to thank the member for Lyons for the question. Anyone who knows anything about Tasmanian issues and forestry issues over the last decades would know that there has been no greater champion of making sure you can have sustainable jobs in the timber industry than the member for Lyons. He has dedicated his political life to it.                 It then comes down to the question, when we look at the intergovernmental agreement: why is it that we now have a situation where people who have their entire lives done nothing but try to make sure there are sustainable jobs for timber communities are saying this is an agreement that they want? This is in the context of Tasmanian members for years having a view that they are tired of being treated as political footballs. Tasmanian people out there trying to get solid employment then found a situation where they were around the table for the first time. Those groups that had been part of conservation campaigns sat down at the table with industry and asked, 'Are we able, with no politicians in the room, to come up with a sustainable plan that will actually give us a way forward for jobs in Tasmania?'                 This is at a time when there is massive change happening in the timber industry across the country. You only have to look at the job losses that have been happening in Eden, or to look at the challenges that have been happening in mills in South Australia as well, to see that there is a massive change going on in the forestry industry, way beyond the normal boom and bust cycle that that industry has known. That is why I think everyone who had sat around the table for two years to come up with an agreement would have been appalled to see the reaction from Senator Colbeck, simply describing the agreement, in his own elegant way, as c-r-a-p. That was the description put out by the spokesperson for the opposition of the opportunity that is in front of Tasmania right now.                 I have to say I have not tried to vary the agreement by one millimetre from what industry have said they need. But anyone should be minded to look at the media release from Ta Ann. You do not have to know much about the timber industry to know that, to make the jobs add up, you need to have your woodchip part of it, your sawlog part of it and your peeler billets. All the peeler billets go through one significant operator there, Ta Ann, who are saying that to continue operating in Tasmania they need the support of this agreement. That is what they need. And what does the opposition do? The opposition says, 'Here's a chance to get a little bit of political leverage, and who cares if we're playing games with jobs in Tasmania?'                 No-one went to the table. Certainly you would not find the member for Lyons going to the table simply on the basis of conservation outcomes. It is on the basis that this is a real opportunity to make sure that we have a sustainable future for jobs in Tasmania at a time of massive transition. Anyone who is prepared to ignore that needs to know that they are ignoring the needs of Tasmanians on the way through.

  In answer to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition's question, I have dealt with these matters fully. I have dealt fully with my role in providing legal advice on the incorporation of this association. I have provided detailed answers on this. They were provided in press conferences; they have been provided in this parliament. What this desperate tactic shows is that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is actually out of questions on this matter, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is out of credibility on this matter and the Leader of the Opposition's strategy of negativity and sleaze and smear is running out of puff as well.

  I thank the member for Capricornia for the question. As a member representing central Queensland, she understands the importance of the resources sector and of us as a nation consolidating the current investment pipeline. On that note, I am pleased to advise the House that despite a dramatic drop in commodity prices over the last 12 months - in actual fact a bigger drop than any of us expected - we have been able to further consolidate the huge amount of capital investment in Australia at the moment, right across the resources and petroleum sectors. I must say, this is exceptionally important. It goes to the heart of what this government is about. It is about jobs and investment and strengthening the underpinnings of the Australian economy, which is what the Australian community actually expects us to be debating and talking about on a regular basis in this House.                 In that context, could I remind the House, as the Treasurer said today, that we now have in the resources and petroleum sector $268.4 billion committed in capital investment currently under construction in Australia. That represents 87 major projects. Importantly, 51 of those projects are in the minerals sector, 18 in the gas and petroleum sector and a further 18 in infrastructure. Perhaps more importantly, 11 of those projects are actually megaprojects, representing investment of more than $5 billion each. It is interesting to note that, of the 10 major LNG projects under construction in the global community at the moment, seven are under construction in Australia, to the tune of about $170 billion -                      Madam Speaker, I didn't know the third test had started in Perth! Putting that aside, can I say, in addition to the 87 projects committed, we have also got 277 projects in the pipeline. I am pleased to say that, over the course of the next week, I will be having discussions both in India and in Singapore about three of those key projects which represent further investment opportunities for Australia in 2013. They include two in the Galilee Basin, by GVK Hancock and Adani, both major projects with the capacity to open up the Galilee Basin. I will also be having discussions in Singapore with potential investors in the Roy Hill iron ore project, which hopefully will go to find an investment decision about the middle of next year.                 I raise these questions because the Australian community understands the importance of attracting further investment, despite a dramatic drop in commodity prices, and in doing so maximising employment and training opportunities for Australia. That is what the Australian community wants us to speak about. That is what we are committed to continue to do and that is what we will go forward on in terms of our plan for the future - further investment and jobs for ordinary Australians.

  We are at the stage where, if they are not getting their questions out of the Michael Smith blog then they are basing them on newspaper reports from a number of weeks ago. Once again, we are in a situation where the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is asserting things she has got no sources for, except she read them somewhere.                     There is no amount of overacting that makes this line of questioning any more credible. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition, having shredded her credibility yesterday, is now going through the files of old newspaper clippings.                      It is truly pathetic - and the bellowing does not help. At some point the Leader of the Opposition has to say what he stands for in these matters. Does he back the Deputy Leader of the Opposition in yesterday for her dishonest statements or not? This sleaze and smear out of Michael Smith blogs - how pathetic is it? All over to you.

  I thank the member for Parramatta for her question on policy matters before the Australian people. I know that, like me, she is very proud to be part of a government that has prioritised increasing the affordability, the accessibility and indeed the quality of Australian child care.                  As a government we have massively increased the childcare rebate. Of course, we increased it from 30 per cent to 50 per cent. We increased the cap to up to $7,500 per child per year. As a result of that we know that this is bringing real relief to parents. An average family on $75,000 a year was spending 13 per cent of their disposable income on their out-of-pocket childcare costs under the coalition government. Under this government, as a result of our increased investments, that family is now spending some 7.6 per cent of their disposable income on child care. So we know that our measures are working; we know that they are increasing affordability.                 There has been a staggering 20 per cent increase in the number of children in child care just since we have been in government. That includes a nine per cent increase in the last 12 months alone. So we are a government that recognises that families rely upon our action and our policies to help them balance their work and their family and to help them access quality childcare services. But I was asked by the member for Parramatta if there are any alternative views.                 I can inform the House that there are indeed some quite alternative views. Last week the opposition leader released the coalition's so-called childcare policy. Guess what it was. It was that they are not going to have one. The opposition leader - proving once more that he might be good at doing a sound bite, although not this week, but he is a lightweight on policy - actually announced that the coalition will not reveal what childcare programs they will cut. He revealed that the coalition will not reveal whether they will reduce the childcare rebate. They will not reveal whether they will means test the childcare rebate. They will not reveal whether they will abolish the childcare rebate altogether. In fact, they will not tell Australian parents what they will do at all, except that they will place it in the too-hard basket and then palm it off for review after the next election.                  This is an absolute joke from an opposition. It may seem like a big game to come in here with no policy and instead focus on negativity and on smear, but to the hundreds of thousands of Australian families out there who are relying on government investments, on government assistance, which we are very proud to have increased, this is a very real issue. We know that childcare policies are absolutely necessary and we are incredibly proud of the ones we have put forward. We know that modern governments need proper childcare policies in place, and this opposition have shirked their responsibility.

  We are not only at the bottom of the barrel now; we are through the bottom of the barrel and we are tunnelling underneath. I refer the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to my statements about this matter on the public record. I refer the Deputy Leader of the Opposition -                      If she wants to stop yelling and carrying on - we know she is embarrassed; no amount of screaming is going to fix that. I refer the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to the statement of Slater and Gordon about the circumstances of my employment with the firm. These things have been on the public record for some time now. This is truly pathetic and embarrassing to watch - a humiliation for the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. There was a series of acts of dishonesty outside the parliament yesterday, seeking to mislead the press gallery. And every smear, every untrue word is endorsed by the Leader of the Opposition, because that is who he is - a man without a plan for the nation's future; a man with only negativity and smear. And what he really fears is: he is a man whose political strategy has come to an end.

  I thank my colleague the member for Newcastle for the question, because working with industry to clean up asbestos has been a feature of the work of the government, the trade union movement and the Labor Party for many years. In particular, on this side of the chamber we stand up and fight for the rights of victims of asbestos diseases. One of the things that I am most proud of from my time in the trade union movement was the achievement of a multibillion-dollar compensation fund for victims of James Hardie. In that dispute -                      I have noted what you have said.                     I withdraw. I am very proud that, in that dispute with James Hardie, the law firm in which the Prime Minister was once a partner, Slater and Gordon, which has been the subject of some discussion in recent times, acted as my legal advisers. In fact, that firm and many other labour law firms have worked very hard over numerous years to fight for compensation for asbestos victims.                 On the other side of the chamber, the deputy opposition leader of course acted for a company against victims, to oppose their compensation. She acted for a company that had this to say in 1977: 'Even if the workers die like flies, they will never be able to pin anything on CSR.' That is who you acted for.                     Well, there has been a lot said about the morality and the conduct of lawyers in acting on behalf of their clients; where is the morality in that - to represent a company with that sort of view, that workers are going to die like flies? On asbestos, we know where we stand. And we know where you stand.                   The member for Brisbane then left the chamber.                     I think it is noteworthy that, when we were conducting, in the labour movement, the campaign to achieve justice for asbestos victims of James Hardie, I received, as leader of the trade union movement, a lot of support from Labor governments. I did not have one call or one iota of assistance from the Howard government or its then health minister, Tony Abbott - not one iota of assistance. We know where we are on this position. The only thing that the Leader of the Opposition has contributed to this, that is of memory to anyone, is an insult to Bernie Banton. A kick in the guts to a dying man it was. A kick in the guts to a dying man - that is your contribution to this issue. This government has a very proud record of standing up, cleaning up asbestos and fighting on behalf of victims, and we will not be lectured to by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition about ethics and morality, or you, hiding behind her.                   The member for                    North Sydney                    then left the chamber.

  Here we are, the Leader of the Opposition has had 15 minutes to put up or shut up and where is he back to? Old allegations. Fifteen minutes to put up or shut up and he is back to old allegations. The Leader of the Opposition had his opportunity to clearly state to the Australian people what I had done wrong, and he manifestly failed to do so. I wait for the apology that should come following his performance on the Today show this morning.                      The Leader of the Opposition well knows that in 1995, in an interview with Slater &amp; Gordon, I answered questions about the incorporation of this association and its objects and purposes.                      Whoever shouted that shouted an untruth to the parliament.                     The Leader of the Opposition well knows that in a press conference in August I explained the objects and purposes of the association. I did that again at a press conference this week. The Leader of the Opposition should know that it is Ralph Blewitt who sought the incorporation of this association, signed the form and took responsibility for then incorporating it. The Leader of the Opposition should well know that the commissioner then incorporated the association, obviously having been satisfied about the nature of the association and that it acquitted WA law. Any other statement by the Leader of the Opposition is sleaze and smear and untruth. This is a man who this morning alleged a crime and today has backed that down to conduct unbecoming, and who now is just scrabbling around grasping at straws to try to extricate himself from the fact that he has put himself in exactly the same position the member for Wentworth did with the Grech and Utegate affair - he has gone out and made an allegation he cannot possibly substantiate because it is untrue.                  As I have said on numerous occasions, I did nothing wrong in this matter and no amount of sleaze and smear from the opposition will ever change those facts and that truth. Here we are today with no clear allegation even being put by the opposition. I anticipate that the opposition will keep dipping into this bucket of mud because the truth is they do not know how to do anything else. They do not know how to talk about jobs, how to talk about education, how to talk about health; they cannot be bothered coming to the chamber when we are introducing school funding legislation, they cannot be bothered sitting in the chamber when we are introducing the National Disability Insurance Scheme. This happens day after day after day after day. This is a Leader of the Opposition who is sure full of political brawn. If you want someone to lift heavy weights, he is your man. What he will never be able to do is lead this nation.

  I thank the member for Hindmarsh for his question, and thank him for raising a real issue of concern to Australians. What Australians in this parliament know is that real issues of concern to them will never be raised by the Liberal or the National parties. All we will ever hear from them is sleaze and smear. All we will ever hear from them is fear-campaigning and negativity. Whilst they get on living in a mud bucket full of sleaze and smear, we are getting on with building the strong nation that Australians deserve, and making sure that the benefits of a strong and resilient economy are shared, particularly with those Australians in the most need.                  I was appalled this morning when I introduced the National Disability Insurance Scheme legislation into this parliament that the Leader of the Opposition and the senior leadership of the opposition were too busy with their mud bucket to even come in and support the introduction of that legislation; too busy with the mud to come in and deal with the National Disability Insurance Scheme. Despite their disregard for people with disabilities, despite the fact that they so manifestly do not care, we, on this side of the parliament, are working hard to ensure a transformation in the way in which people with disabilities are supported in our community.                  We are bringing to the Australian community the next great Labor reform, just like Medicare ended for all time the spectre that if you had a major illness in your family, that it could break family budgets, that you would not get the treatment that you and your loved one needed. Just like Medicare ended that spectre for Australians in terms of illness, the National Disability Insurance Scheme will end that spectre for Australians in terms of disability. Now if someone gets a profound disability, there would be precious few families in the nation who could fund the cost of providing care and support from private means. That means people are reliant on what is currently a fragmented and underfunded and patchwork system of support available to people in communities.                  That is not good enough to give people with disabilities the options and choices that Australians should have. We want to make sure that Australians who are struck by disability - whether they are born with it, whether they acquire it, whether they get one of the most debilitating illnesses that progresses over a lifetime - they get the kind of care and support they need. The legislation this morning is the legal foundation stone of bringing this change for Australians. Of course, we will launch the National Disability Insurance Scheme in sites around the country from 1 July. A great Labor reform, and we are proud of it.

  Is it not interesting that the Leader of the Opposition had 15 minutes to make an allegation out, and did not go to these matters that the deputy leader raises. There she is with her sections of the legislation, waving them around, pretending again to be Miss Marple while needing to make sure that she does not run into a television camera in Parliament House because she does not want to front up to the media for her lack of honesty about her dealings with Ralph Blewitt. Let me just answer the Deputy Leader of the Opposition's question full of argument. She referred to an interview as an exit interview. To what is she possibly referring? If she is referring to the interview of Slater &amp; Gordon in 1995, why would she refer to it as an exit interview, other than to mislead people? Why would she refer to me misleading the commissioner when that did not occur, and she cannot make that out, and the transcript of the interview that I had in Slater &amp; Gordon does not bear out that allegation? Why would she be in this parliament misleading about my state of knowledge about the association when I have answered that clearly in here and on the public record? Why is it that the opposition - having gone out there this morning and accused me of a crime, having not been able to back that allegation in here in parliament today in a 15 minute address - is now using the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to make things up and put them in the most colourful and prejudicial terminology?                 What this is about is an opposition being absolutely at the bottom of the mud bucket -  absolutely at the bottom of it. They have nothing to raise that is substantive in any way. They are trapped into continuing to question on this matter this week because they are worried how it will look if they drop off these questions. It will look like their strategy is out of huff. I have news for the opposition. Even with them asking these questions today, even with the Leader of the Opposition's 15-minute address - or perhaps because of it - it is clear that their political strategy is out of huff. It is clear that their political strategy is no longer working for them. Negativity got them a long way. They are hoping that sleaze and smear will get them the rest of the way, but the problem is Australians now have an accurate assessment of the character of this man and they do not like what they see. Australians know that he will never have his chief of staff wandering around with a file that says 'jobs' or 'health' or 'education' under her arm, because he will never have a positive policy for the nation's future. We will get on with building that future - you live in the mud.

  I thank the member for Shortland very much for her question and, most importantly, for adding her voice to the call for change, to support the calls of so many people with disability, to support the calls from carers and to support the calls from family members that have finally been heard.                 I say a very big thank you to the Prime Minister and to the Treasurer of this country for their support for the introduction of the National Disability Insurance Scheme. For the first time this country is going to right a wrong that has needed righting for so long. People with disability and their carers have waited such a long time for this change. Finally, the Prime Minister introduced the legislation to establish the National Disability Insurance Scheme today. Here on the floor of this parliament today, the voices of people with disability, and of their carers, were heard. They were heard loud and clear. It is because of those voices, because of the campaign that has been run by people with disability and their carers for years. For years they have been calling for reform and finally this government will make sure that it is delivered.                 The legislation, when enacted, will put choice and control in the hands of people with disability, and that is what is so significant about this legislation. Yes, it will make sure that we deal with the terrible lottery that the Prime Minister has referred to, but it will also make sure that people with disability themselves will be able to control the care and support that they need to live independent and dignified lives. The legislation will establish a national scheme, it will establish the national agency to deliver it, and it will make sure that we launch the scheme in a number of parts of Australia, including the Hunter, and I thank the member for Shortland and the other members in the Hunter region for their very strong support of this initiative.

  I thank the member for Melbourne for his question. Whilst I understand he and I do not agree on the policy here, at least he is prepared to ask a question about policy and about something that has an implication for members of the Australian community. The reason, I think, the member for Melbourne and I do not agree about this policy is (1) I have a view that people who are in comparable circumstances in relation to parenting payment should be treated the same.                  I remind the member for Melbourne that the reform we have engaged in is for a class of people who were being treated differently under earlier rules, to be brought into compliance with the way in which others are being treated by the parenting payment system. The focus of our reforms and the reason for that is that we actually believe it is very, very important for kids in single parent families to see that their parent, who is very often a woman, the mother, as the member for Melbourne indicated in his question, is a person who has a job and goes to work. Now, of course, when children are very small, there are all of the stresses and strains that people usually find with trying to balance having very young children and maintaining an attachment to a job - and usually with very young children, this is a part-time job. We certainly know from all of the analysis that there is about disadvantage, that if a child grows up in a family where no-one works, and that is their experience year after year as they go through primary school and then secondary school, that will be an indicator that that child has been marked for a lifetime of disadvantage. We do not want to see that.                 So our aim here is to get more single parents off income support and into work once their children are at school. Many of these parents will be eligible for additional support, including the childcare benefit, childcare rebate and the jobs, education and training childcare fee assistance subsidy. The number of people accessing jobs, education and training childcare fee assistance has increased by more than 10,000 people to almost 31,500 people as a result of our continuing reforms, and this year the figure is expected to rise again to around 35,000. What is more, spending on this program has doubled because parents are accessing child care for longer hours, meaning that they are in training, studying or working longer hours. Then, of course, we are investing in skills development and training and new career advice - an investment of $100 million to support people on their journey to work.                 The member for Melbourne and I will continue to have a different view, but I thank him for a policy question.

  I thank the member for Throsby for that very important question, because I think all members have seen a very clear contrast today. The government is focused on the future - making the essential investments to build a resilient economy but also making sure that we take everybody with us to make sure that everybody has a stake in our prosperity. That is why everybody on this side of the House is so proud of what we are doing with the National Disability Insurance Scheme. But it is not just that. We understand the importance of building a more resilient economy. We understand the importance of investing in education. We understand the importance of paid parental leave. We understand the importance of health reform.                 We understand all those things, but here today is a really stark contrast with the opposition, which just stands for fear and smear. We have seen it on display right through this week. We have not had a single question from the opposition on the economy this week - not one. We understand the very big challenges for the future, so when we go to the people later next year there will be a very clear contrast. There will be those on that side of the House, who are led by a thug who knows nothing else but smear, and the people on this side of the House -                      I do withdraw. They will be led by an opposition leader who, when it comes to policy, is simply a weakling. There are no plans for the future. The reason we can put in place important social reforms for the future is that we have a resilient economy. You can see that in terms of the capital expenditure figures that are out today. Total capital expenditure is expected to be a staggering $173 billion this financial year, up from $155 billion in 2011-12.                 You would never know that if you listened to the opposition. They are constantly at war with the facts. Whether you are talking about the issues that were raised in this House earlier today, whether you are talking about investment figures, whether you are talking about the level of the dollar or whether you are talking about a surplus, they are constantly at war with the facts. That is why the Leader of the Opposition is simply unfit to run a $1.5 trillion economy, and that has been on display not only to members of this parliament today but to all of the Australian people.

  We had 15 minutes for the Leader of the Opposition to outline one clear allegation against me and he failed to do so - 15 minutes for the Leader of the Opposition to actually back in his spurious claims against me this morning, 15 minutes for the Leader of the Opposition to justify why he and his team have been in a mud bucket of sleaze and smear week after week, month after month. He had 15 minutes to justify -                      And there we have it, even in the interjection - more sleaze, more smear, more unsubstantiated allegations. He had 15 minutes to explain why his deputy did not tell the truth publicly about her dealings with Ralph Blewitt, 15 minutes to deal with these issues, and spectacularly failed to do so. No amount of carry-on, no amount of grasping at straws is going to change the fact that the Leader of the Opposition is drowning in a sea of sleaze and smear, and there is a reason for that.                     There is a reason why this man is drowning in a sea of sleaze and smear, and it is that he does not have one idea for the nation's future. Instead of wasting our time, as we are invited to do by the Leader of the Opposition, we will get on with building great Labor reforms like the National Disability Insurance Scheme, using our time to improve the lives of the Australian people -                      something the Leader of the Opposition will never understand.

  I thank the member for Fraser for his question, which is the last question of 2012. As we move from 2012 into 2013, I want to say to my Labor colleagues and I want say to members of the public listening to these parliamentary proceedings: we are proud of what our nation has achieved during 2012. We are proud of our nation and its achievements during the course of this year. As a government, we are proud that we have played our part, working alongside the Australian people. We are proud that our economic stewardship has meant that people have the benefit of jobs, unlike those in so many advanced economies around the world. We are proud that through the Asian century white paper we have delivered a plan for our nation's future.                 We are proud that our budget discipline has meant that there is room for the Reserve Bank to move on monetary policy and that Australians are paying lower interest rates. We are proud that Australian families with a typical mortgage of $300,000 are now paying $4,500 less a year on their mortgage than they did when we came to government. We are proud that we have worked with Australian families on their cost-of-living challenges through benefits like the Schoolkids Bonus. We are proud we have changed our tax system so you do not pay a cent of tax on the first $18,200 that you earn. We are proud that we are readying our economy so we will be winners in this century of growth and change - with the NBN, with skills, with traditional infrastructure. We are proud that we are getting ready to seize the future.                 We are proud of what we have done in health too - making sure that people get benefits in dental care and rolling out GP superclinics and integrated cancer care. We are proud of our mental health reform agenda to help Australians who need mental health support at some time during their lives. We are proud of those changes, which are Labor changes. And we are proud that we have set a program of work for 2013 which will be about making sure that every child gets a great education and a genuine opportunity in life and making sure that we develop and deliver the National Disability Insurance Scheme. We are proud of these great Labor reforms and we are proud that we have stared down, on carbon pricing, the most reckless, negative campaign ever run in Australia's history. We are proud we are a government of change and building. We are ashamed to sit in a parliament with a man of negativity and sleaze and smear. We are ashamed that the opposition has not one plan for the nation's future. In 2013 we will come back ready to win the contest of ideas. You will not even be in the contest.                 With those words, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper.
