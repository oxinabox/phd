     - On the point of order, this clearly, as with the last question, goes to the relationship between the code of conduct and the behaviour of the members of the executive - in this case, the Prime Minister himself.
     It is impossible for the parliament to be able to be conducted and for question time to serve its purpose if we cannot ask whether the public statements of ministers, parliamentary secretaries and prime ministers are accurate.
     If we cannot ask that then question time becomes meaningless.
     That is the purpose, intent and substance of this question.

     I want to ask the Prime Minister -  -  - Can the Prime Minister confirm that in March 2003 departmental officials from the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, Treasury, the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade formed an IDC to discuss the management of freedom of information requests from the opposition regarding the government's dealings with the Manildra Group?
     Can the Prime Minister also confirm that the meeting took place only weeks after the Liberal and National parties received $200,000 in donations on 14 February 2003 from Manildra?

     Minister, why has the government included in its FTA enabling legislation a new provision to impose criminal offences and $110,000 fines on generic drug companies that lodge false certificates about patents?
     Why won't the government also agree to fine drug companies that lodge bodgie patent applications designed to delay the introduction of cheaper generic drugs into the Australian market?

     Is the minister aware that the drug company producing Zocor, a cholesterol lowering drug, was paid more than $311 million through the PBS last year?
     Minister, isn't it the case that when this drug comes off patent in the middle of next year a manufacturer of a cheaper generic substitute will be required, as a result of the provisions of the FTA enabling legislation, to notify the company producing Zocor of its intention to market the cheaper drug?
     Given that a cheaper drug could jeopardise almost all of the $311 million flowing to the manufacturers of Zocor, isn't it in their interest to file a dodgy patent application and engage in the necessary legal proceedings to -  -  - hold off the entry of the cheaper generic drug -  - Thank you, Mr Speaker.
     As I was saying, isn't it in the interests of the manufacturers of Zocor to file a dodgy patent application and the required legal proceedings to hold off the entry of the cheaper generic, even if that only works for three or six months?
     Isn't it absurd to contend that a $6,000 fine will dissuade a drug company manufacturer in this position from filing a dodgy patent application?
    An opposition member - Bronnie is standing - she wants to protect you, Tony.

     Can the Prime Minister confirm that the unanimous report of the Senate committee on the FTA states:While the new legislation does not allow a court to prevent the TGA giving marketing approval to a generic, a court could order the generic manufacturer not to market their product before litigation was finalised.
     The new notification requirement may dissuade generic manufacturers from taking a risk in bringing generics to market before the patent claim is settled.
     This would be to the detriment of the PBS, which benefits from accessing cheaper generic drugs before litigation is settled.
    Prime Minister, given that even government senators acknowledge the risk of pharmaceutical companies using dodgy patents to delay the entry of generic products, why won't you now support Labor's amendment and pass the FTA?

     Minister, isn't it a fact that there is no new evidence to justify a reconsideration of this recommendation?
     Will the minister now admit that requiring ATAGI to reconsider the matter is part of a strategy to force ATAGI to withdraw the recommendation for the new injectable polio vaccine and spare the government its continuing political embarrassment about not matching Labor's plan to fund the vaccine?
