 - The leaked memo does not show that. The leaked memo, as confirmed by the interlocutor of the foreign minister, does not show that. You know that. You know that that discussion between the foreign minister and the High Commissioner concerned comments that the foreign minister made about the Multinational Interception Force. The foreign minister has explained that in some detail - and, I think, very convincingly - today, and so has the New Zealand High Commissioner.</DOC>

 - First, can I thank the honourable member for Gilmore for her question. I appreciate the serious interest she shows in this profoundly serious issue. The government knows only too well that it is deeply important that the United Nations remain engaged on the issue of Iraq, and of course the United Nations is so engaged, through both the Security Council and the weapons inspectors. We believe that the United Nations Security Council should be centrally involved in decisions on this issue.The government is strongly of the view that the Security Council should remain the key forum for considering whether further steps may be necessary to ensure Iraq is disarmed of weapons of mass destruction, and this has been the government's view throughout. This is a view that has been expressed at a number of levels by the Australian government to other governments. It is a view I have expressed on several occasions to Secretary of State Colin Powell. It is a view that I have discussed at some length during the last 10 days or so with my European counterparts: with Javier Solana, the European Union's high representative on foreign policy; with Chris Patten, the EU commissioner on foreign relations; and with the foreign ministers of France and Germany. This is a view that we have discussed.We have supported continually the role of the United Nations Security Council. I think there is very much an increasing international consensus that it would be appropriate and it would be desirable, if the United Nations weapons inspectors in the end, tragically, are not able to do their job - and that is a conclusion, and we have not reached that point yet, though we have come quite close to it - if the weapons inspectors do reach that conclusion, for this matter to go back once more to the Security Council for consideration of a further Security Council resolution. I think there is an international consensus around that, and that is certainly the view of the Australian government. I note that it was a view very strongly expressed by British Prime Minister Tony Blair when he recently met with President George Bush at Camp David and in Washington. So the government will continue to play an active role in ensuring the United Nations has a central role in the whole of this process.Let me conclude by saying again, as I have said on so many occasions, that we deeply hope that, at this very late hour, Saddam Hussein and his regime will change tack and decide to fully cooperate with the United Nations weapons inspectors - not to cooperate just on process or just on substance, as Hans Blix said, but to cooperate fully on both process and substance. That is the best way for war to be avoided. We hope Saddam Hussein understands that message and understands it only too clearly.</DOC>

 - The answer is no. I would like to point out to the Leader of the Opposition that it is possible, in a conversation lasting three-quarters of an hour, to canvass a lot of subjects. Quite clearly, one of the things that came up in that discussion was the continued defiance by Iraq of the proper demands of the United Nations. Both the foreign minister and the New Zealand High Commissioner have put into context that discussion. The foreign minister was referring to the Multinational Interception Force. I know that it suits the political purposes of the Leader of the Opposition to try and represent things otherwise, but I remind the House that this conversation took place on 24 October 2002; the decision taken by the Australian government to deploy forces to the Gulf occurred on 10 January 2003. Self-evidently, the discussion between the high commissioner and the foreign minister could not be put in the context of the deployment of those forces. The foreign minister has already explained at great length the nature of that discussion, and I frankly do not have anything to add to what he has already said. But I take this opportunity because it goes to the heart of the issue raised by the Leader of the Opposition - that is, whether a final decision has been taken by this government to involve itself in military action against Iraq. The answer to that question is that no such final decision has been taken. The reason no decision has been taken is that the processes of the United Nations are still being worked through. It would be a very foolish government surrendering the flexibility that any government may have if it were to give - as the opposition leader falsely alleges; and he knows the allegations are false - some kind of unconditional commitment. The reality is that no unconditional commitments have been made. Quite obviously Australia has, unlike many other countries, put itself in a position to contribute to a military operation against Iraq if we judge in the national interest that those circumstances require that we do so. We have put ourselves in a better and stronger position than most other countries to do that. The Leader of the Opposition can spend the rest of question time today, he can spend all of question time tomorrow and he can spend all of his waking hours making those allegations. They are false and they will remain false. I have made it very clear that, by the deployment of Australian forces, we are putting ourselves in a position to participate and to participate effectively and in circumstances that will guarantee the maximum possible safety for our forces. There is nothing unusual or unprecedented about the deployment of forces in advance of a final decision to commit to military conflict. They were the circumstances under which the deployment was made in 1998 - a deployment supported by the then Leader of the Opposition, the member for Brand. They were the circumstances in which that deployment was made. The member for Brand knows that you can deploy in advance of making a final decision without being falsely accused of making a final decision and of keeping that from the Australian public, because that in reality was what we did with his support in 1998. I repeat: for the reasons I outlined in my statement yesterday, the government hopes that, if there does become a necessity for military action, that process occurs after all of the processes of the United Nations have been gone through and that a new resolution authorising force comes forward. I do not believe that that is necessary as a matter of international law, but I believe that if you had a second United Nations resolution you would get more countries supporting the action called for in the resolution and more countries participating - and that is therefore desirable. Of course it may well be, as I said yesterday, that the result of the United Nations deliberation is that you do not have a black and white situation: you do not have a total rejection of enforcement or you do not have some kind of mandating of military action - you get something in the middle. In that event, governments and political parties, not only here in Australia but around the world, will have to make decisions about what their attitude is. We have put ourselves in a position, if we judge it at the time to be in the national interest, to commit to military conflict. That decision has yet to be taken. That will be taken against the circumstances and all of the information which is available at the time. Nothing in that leaked memo yesterday contradicts that. The discussion between the foreign minister and the high commissioner related to the Multinational Interception Force, and in those circumstances the claim made so vigorously by the Leader of the Opposition is, as usual, quite wrong.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Wentworth for his question. I can inform him that, since the House last met, the international economy continues to disappoint, with weakness in Germany, France and Japan, and with Canada alone of the G7 economies showing signs of sustained recovery. The United States growth was 0.2 per cent in the December quarter - a respectable 2.8 per cent for the year - but it was led mainly by consumer spending. Until we see sustained evidence of business investment in the United States, people will continue to perceive downside risks on economic growth in 2003. The US President sent his budget to Congress in the last day and has put forward a budget program with a projected deficit of 2.8 per cent of GDP for the United States in 2003 - a sum of some $US300 billion. In Australian terms, that would be the equivalent of a deficit in our budget of $A20 billion in the forthcoming year. Obviously, that is very substantial fiscal stimulation, which we welcome. And we welcome the fact that fiscal stimulation, together with monetary policy, is now being put forward to stimulate a return to sustained growth in the United States, which is still so important as the engine of economic growth to the world. As world growth picks up, Australia's exporters should find better opportunities. Aside from the international situation, which continues to disappoint, the drought in Australia continues to extract a very heavy price, with agricultural production in the September quarter very substantially down. I would expect the effect on exports in the agricultural sector to continue in January, February and March. We continue to await the breaking of the drought and hope that it will come before the planting season for the winter crops in March and April of this year.Notwithstanding a very difficult international economy and notwithstanding a very severe drought, led by the non-farm sector Australia continues to be one of the most strongly growing economies of the world. Our GDP grew at 3.7 per cent to the end of the December quarter, business investment is very strong at 12.2 per cent, and in the year 2002 more than a quarter of a million new jobs were created in Australia. There are real opportunities for the people of Australia, notwithstanding very difficult international and climatic conditions.This government remains determined to continue the strong economic record that it has put in place and to continue to reform those areas of the Australian economy which require continuing improvement. Led by an opportunistic Labor Party, the Australian Senate has now decided to try to prevent necessary economic reform in this country. We have put in place important changes in relation to welfare reform and PBS reform. We have put before the Senate important changes in relation to labour market reform. We say this to the Senate: the reforms of today will drive our economic prospects of tomorrow, just as the reforms of the last seven years drove our economic prospects through this period of international weakness. We call on the Australian Labor Party to cease and desist from its opportunistic position in the Senate, to support the necessary economic reforms and to give Australia the kind of economic opportunity that it deserves into the future.</DOC>

 - The Leader of the Opposition was given an answer to the first two questions and I can only return to it. Of course they discussed the UN processes. What the foreign minister referred to was the Multinational Interception Force. The reason why he was clearly referring to the Multinational Interception Force was that the conversation took place on 24 October. The decision to deploy in the context of possible military action against Iraq was not taken until 10 January. Self-evidently, it could only have been in relation to the Multinational Interception Force.I know the Leader of the Opposition is casting around for something, but can I say to the Leader of the Opposition that he will not find it here. On 24 October, there had been no decision taken to deploy any forces in the context of a possible operation against Iraq. The vessels that had been deployed were part of a Multinational Interception Force established pursuant to Security Council resolutions, described not just by the government but also by the former Leader of the Opposition. On these matters, it always does to trawl through the statements of the former Leader of the Opposition. In answer to a question asked of him on Meet the Press on 28 March 1999, he was asked whether the opposition agreed with an announcement made by the government that HMAS Melbourne would go to the Gulf. It was the eighth time that we had been on battle stations there with regard to containing Iraq. This is what was he was asked:Do you support the decision to send the ship again?Beazley said:Yes. It's actually an enforcement of sanctions rather than containment.He was correctly describing the role of the Multinational Interception Force. That was to enforce the sanctions of the United Nations in relation to the cessation of the 1991 coalition war against Iraq.The two contexts are quite clear. The New Zealand High Commissioner supports very strongly what the foreign minister has said. Self-evidently it could not have related to the deployment which you have criticised. There is a sharp difference between the two situations. I assume that the Leader of the Opposition still supports Australian participation in the Multinational Interception Force. I do not know; maybe he does not. I assume by his silence that he still supports it, and yet he opposes the deployment. Through a combination of his own condemnation of the deployment and his silence about the Multinational Interception Force, he must see those two things as quite separate. They are quite separate. What the Leader of the Opposition has criticised is the deployment that was foreshadowed by me on 10 January. What the foreign minister was talking about were the ships that had been sent there to enforce the mandate of the United Nations. The original decision to send those ships - correctly, with our support in opposition - had been made initially by the Hawke government in 1991 and ships have been maintained there. The foreign minister made a perfectly legitimate statement in relation to the status of those vessels. I can only again repeat to the Leader of the Opposition that this line of questioning does not give any credibility to your argument. Our position remains in relation to the matter now concerning Iraq, and that is that we hope the processes of the United Nations lead to a peaceful resolution. It is not a great hope; it is a very thin hope. But I have to repeat what I said in my speech yesterday to the House: if there is to be found any hope of a peaceful resolution, it is to be found in all of the countries of the world coming together through the Security Council and calling in the strongest possible terms for compliance with resolution 1441.That is what we are working towards. That is what I will be arguing in my discussions with President Bush and with the Secretary-General of the United Nations, and in my discussions in London with the leader of the British Labour Party, who I have to say has shown conspicuously more backbone on this issue than the leader of the Australian Labor Party.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Flinders for his question because I think it is a profoundly important component of the totality of this debate about Iraq, although these are not matters that are subject to United Nations Security Council resolutions.I am delighted to see in the gallery William Hague, the former leader of the Conservative Party - a seriously good man. Just the presence of him and his charming wife there remind me of the strength of the British parliament - in particular the British Prime Minister and the opposition in Britain - on this question of Iraq. I notice with a great deal of interest that in all the critiques from the Leader of the Opposition on this issue of Iraq he never mentions the name `Tony Blair'. He always criticises George Bush and John Howard but he never criticises Tony Blair, Iain Duncan Smith or William Hague.The honourable member for Flinders has raised a very important issue, and Britain is one of the countries along with the United States which has released reports cataloguing Saddam's atrocious treatment of his own people. Saddam Hussein became the first leader in the world systematically and aggressively to gas his own people. During a campaign in 1988-89 the Iraqi military attacked more than 40 Kurdish villages with chemical weapons.  -  - I would have thought members of the left of the Labor Party would be particularly focused on these egregious human rights abuses. I would have thought for the left this would be a very big issue, not a subject of constant interjection and mirth.The regime has summarily executed opponents. In February 1998, 400 prisoners at the Abu Ghraib prison were executed. Two months later 100 detainees from the Radwaniyah prison were buried alive. -  - I notice members of the opposition think this is an enormously funny issue. I actually happen to think that human rights abuses in Iraq are extremely serious. As I was saying, the killings in the prisons were supposed to clean out the prisons. More than 3,000 people have been killed in a similar fashion since 1997. Saddam's regime has poisoned political prisoners by giving them slow acting poison - thallium - which slowly infiltrates the system and takes several days to bring death. Iraqi citizens have often been decapitated in front of family members and at other times they are shot in front of family members and the family is charged for the cost of the bullet. Under Saddam Hussein's orders, Iraqi citizens are systematically tortured. Beatings, rape, breaking of limbs and denial of food and water are commonplace in Iraqi prisons. - Saddam Hussein's regime has also invented unique and horrific methods of torture, including electric shock treatment, pulling out fingernails, suspending individuals from rotating ceiling fans, dripping acid on victims' skin, gouging out eyes and burning victims with a hot iron or a blowtorch. Large numbers of Kuwaiti citizens were murdered, tortured and raped during the Gulf War. More than two dozen torture centres in Kuwait City have been discovered, and photographic evidence confirms reports of electric shocks, acid baths, summary execution and the use of electric drills to penetrate victims' bodies.Many innocent civilian citizens were also used as human shields. In 1994-95 alone, large numbers of soldiers had portions of their ears cut off for deserting the army. An X was branded on the forehead of these soldiers so that Iraqi citizens did not think they had been wounded as war heroes. Doctors who refused to perform these atrocities were threatened with reprisals and many have been arrested and detained. The Iraqi authorities also issued a decree in 1994 making it illegal for doctors to perform plastic or corrective surgery for victims of branding and amputation. Indeed, in 2000, a new Iraqi decree was issued authorising the government to amputate the tongues of citizens who criticise Saddam Hussein or his government.I have spent a moment reminding the House of these atrocities, which have been collated by not just the British and American governments, but also non-government organisations in Amnesty International, because it is one of the reasons why the international community - and certainly very much this government - feel deeply and passionately about this issue. This is an evil and wicked regime led by an evil and wicked man. We make no apology for him - he is an evil and wicked man. The thought of somebody with this type of record with chemical and biological weapons and with the prospect of also having nuclear weapons is, for us, truly horrific.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Wannon for his question. - That is right, Mr Speaker. He will go and be 12th man in a minute and get the drinks for everybody. - I thank the honourable member for Wannon for his question and recognise the member for Wannon's keen interest in -  - the export effort that is being undertaken by Australia's exporters, both agricultural and merchandise and services. We all recognise the difficult global economic environment at the moment - the global economic environment is slowing down and softening. We managed our way through the economic recession in East Asia in 1997 but at that time, it is important to note, exports to East Asia were 52.5 per cent of the total value of Australia's merchandise exports in 2002. In fact, between 1997 and 2002 Australia's merchandise exports to the East Asian region increased from $48 billion to $62.7 billion - that increase obviously sustaining a significant number of new jobs in Australia - a 31 per cent increase in just five years into the East Asian region. As I say, this was achieved against the backdrop of the economic recession in East Asia in 1997 and more recently the softening of the global economy.The latest ABS figures for December 2002 highlight that total exports to East Asia remain firm and are up two per cent over December the previous year - again, at a time when the global economy is very soft. We have seen exports to China rise by 23 per cent, exports to Japan rise by seven per cent and exports to Indonesia rise by five per cent. We have an excellent reputation in East Asia, and this has certainly been illustrated in recent times by some of the significant deals that have been done by Australian exporters - for example, the LNG gas deal with China, worth $25 billion over the next 25 years; and, more recently, in the last month or so, the LNG deal that has been done with South Korea, which is worth $1 billion over the next seven years. This demonstrates the confidence in us of our key trading partners in the region. We have recently completed and we will shortly sign a Singapore free trade agreement, a Thai free trade agreement is well under way and progressing very well and we are engaged in negotiations with China and Japan on trade and economic agreements with those major economies in North Asia.Last year I travelled to Indonesia, China, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia and Brunei to promote Australia's export interests throughout the Asian region. Not once during that time was a negative reference made about our strong alliance with the United States by any of those major trading partners that we have in the region. A key message I received in all those countries was that Australia's exports were competitive, Australia had quality products and reliability of supply and it was seen as an important economic player in the East Asian region.I might suggest that the Labor Party could take a leaf out of the government's book and look at the way in which our trade relationships have developed and strengthened in East Asia in recent years. It has been done in a very diplomatic way and in a successful manner - not, as alleged, by stepping away from Asia but by stepping up to Asia.</DOC>

 - I do not have the benefit of the record of exactly what I said. I certainly did indicate that, initially, the Kanimbla would be joining the Multinational Interception Force. I did say that -  - but I do not think that alters in any way the two issues before us. The gravamen of the attack by the opposition is that the foreign minister was prepared to disclose some deep, dark secret to the New Zealand High Commissioner which the government is now not willing to do, and the deep, dark secret is that on 24 October, apparently, we had already decided to commit ourselves to a military operation against Iraq. Stripped of all the permutations, what the Leader of the Opposition is asking the House to believe is that, effectively, on 24 October last year the foreign minister told the New Zealand High Commissioner that we had already decided to commit ourselves to a military operation against Iraq. That is absolutely absurd. Nothing that I said - correctly and appropriately - to the men and women of the Australian Defence Force when the Kanimbla departed in any way alters the fact that on 24 October the foreign minister was not talking about a war commitment against Iraq; he had in mind the position of the Multinational Interception Force.The situation in relation to a final commitment is that we have not taken a decision in relation to a final commitment. For the purposes of the debate, let us assume that discussions, deliberations and so forth go on for another year. I am not saying they will - in the current circumstances I think it is highly unlikely - but let us assume that they do. The Multinational Interception Force will still be in the Gulf, because it will still be enforcing the sanctions imposed by the United Nations in 1991. When the foreign minister was talking about the withdrawal of the ships and the difficulties imposed, what he clearly had in mind was that it would be very difficult - impossible in a diplomatic sense - in view of our obligations to the United Nations. Let us assume for the purposes of the discussion that things did go on for another six, nine or 12 months. The Multinational Interception Force would still be there. We would not think it appropriate to pull those ships back. I assume the Leader of the Opposition would agree with me on this, but maybe he does not - he is very silent on this. We would think that our obligation would be to leave the vessels there and we would hope to get the support from the current Leader of the Opposition that we got from the former Leader of the Opposition.They are obviously related issues. We are dealing with the same area of the world; we are dealing with the continuum of a dispute with Iraq. The situation simply remains that, until all of the circumstances that will enable us to make a final decision have elapsed, that decision will not be taken. I have never disguised the fact that we have put ourselves in a position to make a contribution. For months now, senior ministers and I have indicated that contingency military planning with the United States has been going on. Contingency discussions and planning have occurred between the United States military and the Australian military. As the Leader of the Opposition should know - and I know that many who sit behind him do know - if you are a country that wants ultimately to be in a position to make a contribution if you believe the circumstances are right, you have to involve yourself in preparation and contingency planning. There is no point in not acknowledging that, and I have never sought to disguise it. If this country does decide to take part in military action, I want our soldiers, sailors and airmen to be in a position to do it safely and effectively. I do not want them disadvantaged by hasty, last-minute preparations. I do not want them to be in a position where, because of political manipulation, they are put at greater risk than they should be put. I do not want that to occur. I want them to know that they have the opportunity of getting ready.I also happen to believe that predeployment can increase diplomatic pressure. That was the view that your predecessor correctly took in 1998 and it is the view that the Secretary-General of the United Nations has correctly taken. The Secretary-General of the United Nations has said to the world that, if it had not been for the American build-up in the Gulf area, the weapons inspectors would not now be in Iraq. The reality is that the United Nations did nothing about Iraq for four or five years until they were re-energised - and I think I use the words of the former Leader of the Opposition in describing the United Nations in 1998 - or reactivated, and they were reactivated by President Bush when he went to the United Nations General Assembly on 12 September and said, `It is your responsibility under the obligations of the United Nations charter to do something about Iraq's serial noncompliance with the resolutions of the United Nations.' All of that is the relevant history to where we are now. We all hope - difficult though that hope may be to embrace with a great deal of enthusiasm because of the difficult situation we find ourselves in - that there can still be a peaceful outcome.If, in the end, that hope disappears and the government of this country decides that it is appropriate that Australian forces be part of an operation against Iraq, we - by our predeployment and our actions - will have put ourselves in a position to do that effectively and efficiently. But that does not mean, as alleged falsely by the Leader of the Opposition, that we have already decided to do that and that we have told others without telling the Australian people. That is the charge made by the Leader of the Opposition, and he will go on making that charge while he has breath. He can do that. It is not correct. It is self-evidently foolish of any government, of any persuasion, to throw away the flexibility of retaining, until the last moment, the opportunity of taking that decision. I do not know the final outworking of the Security Council process, I do not know the shade of grey that may come out of the Security Council - and neither does the Leader of the Opposition. That is why, until I know that, the cabinet will not be making any decision about a final military commitment. That is the position of the government. The Americans understand that, the British understand it, other countries understand it, the New Zealand High Commissioner understands it. But the Leader of the Opposition - for his own base political purposes - refuses to understand it.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Curtin for her question. I recognise the interest she has shown all along in this issue. A lot of members on this side of the House have shared the view of the Prime Minister and me that it is quite undesirable for World Cup cricket matches to proceed in Zimbabwe. The Australian government have said on many occasions that we would prefer that the International Cricket Council move the six games which are scheduled to be played in Zimbabwe, by a number of teams, to a more appropriate venue. For our part, we do not want to see our great cricketers used as pawns by President Mugabe in a propaganda campaign, and I do not know that many cricketers - Australian and otherwise - want to be used in that way.It is unfortunate that a part of the World Cup should be held in a country whose government has systematically undermined democracy, human rights and the rule of law. It would betray the cricketing ideal of fair play and hand, as I mentioned before, a propaganda victory to President Mugabe. Recently, our high commissioner in Harare, Jonathan Brown - who is an outstanding Australian diplomat - visited Bulawayo, which is where the Australian team is scheduled to play on 24 February against Zimbabwe. His report back from Bulawayo was disturbing. Amongst other concerns is a shortage of fuel. He said that queues for fuel, if I recall correctly, lasted for approximately two days. He made a very serious point, and that was that he had the expectation that there would be demonstrations in Bulawayo at the time of the Australia-Zimbabwe cricket game on 24 February. He had been told this by the opposition. They will obviously use this as an opportunity to highlight their plight. He went to the police, who said that they would control the demonstrations, but when the high commissioner asked whether the police would give an undertaking not to crack down excessively on the demonstrations, thereby creating a confrontation, the police would not give that undertaking.Consistent with that point, yesterday riot police used unnecessary force at the High Court in Harare to disperse a crowd of opposition supporters, journalists and diplomats - including the American ambassador - at the so-called `treason trial' of the MDC leader, Morgan Tsvangirai. Our travel advice for Zimbabwe was updated on 3 February, a couple of days ago, and it notes the likelihood of protest activity in the period surrounding the World Cup. It points out the heavy-handed police responses to past protests and that they had resulted in injury to protesters and innocent bystanders, and it advises Australians to avoid protests and large public gatherings. Around 400 tickets have been sold to Australians for the game in Bulawayo, so we have not only the team, the management and the like to be concerned about but also the Australian spectators. Jonathan Brown, the high commissioner in Harare, has met with the Australian Cricket Board and the Australian team, and he has sat down with the Australian team and discussed this issue closely. He has also been in communication with the International Cricket Council and will maintain our communication with them. I note that yesterday the England and Wales Cricket Board announced that it will formally request the International Cricket Council to move England's Harare match to South Africa for safety and security reasons. I welcome that request by the England and Wales Cricket Board. It is, of course, ultimately a matter for the Australian Cricket Board and the International Cricket Council to decide what to do. We have always said that we would like the International Cricket Council to make a decision to move all matches from Zimbabwe so that no team would be penalised by boycotting a game there, the competition could continue to run in a fully competitive way but, at the same time, President Mugabe would not have the propaganda victory that he would otherwise have.</DOC>

 - I can only repeat what I have said earlier: no secret undertakings have been given to the President of the United States or to the British Prime Minister. I have made no secret of the willingness of this government - if, in the final analysis, it judges the circumstances to be right - to consider and to commit military forces to an operation. I have made no secret of that.Regarding what the Leader of the Opposition has referred to - I do not know the full context of the person's letter and I respect the anxiety of the parent of any service man or woman at the present time - I can only say, as I did to the service men and women when they left, how much the government supports them and how much I believe the overwhelming majority of Australians support them. I was perfectly candid with them. When they left, I said what they were going for as best I could at that time.I do not know finally what will happen. I do know this: if something does happen, I would want them to be prepared.  - The cruellest thing that you can do to the armed forces of this country is to leave them in a position where they are put in danger without adequate preparation. That, at its heart, is one of the reasons why we have been involved in contingency planning. It beggars belief that a nation that is contemplating making a military commitment would do absolutely no preparation in advance of the decision to make that military commitment. It beggars belief that you would do that. Yet this, in a sense, is the construct of what the Leader of the Opposition is asking this parliament and the Australian people to do.I do not apologise for one second about the fact that we have put our armed forces in a position to do their duty magnificently if we ask them to do it. I will never make an apology for that. I have too much respect for them. I say to the mothers and fathers of service personnel that we will always ensure that, if they are put in a position of danger, they will have been given all the opportunities and so forth to be ready.But, if the Leader of the Opposition is going down some trail of asking about contingency planning, let me save him the effort. Of course there has been contingency planning. There has been contingency planning - and we disclosed it months ago - between the United States military and the Australian military. When I addressed CEDA in November and announced that the SAS would be coming home from Afghanistan, I said that the ADF was undertaking contingency arrangements against the possibility that they might be required. It has been out there on the public record. I have made no secret of that fact. I am proud of the fact that we are getting our people ready in case they are needed. That is my duty to them and to the Australian people, and the Leader of the Opposition knows this. He cannot have it both ways. He cannot say that he wants to create the best circumstances for the men and women who defend this county if they go into battle yet deny them the opportunity to be trained, prepared and ready for that conflict should it come. That is what the Leader of the Opposition is asking this House to believe. I believe the House and the Australian people will totally reject him. - The whole of it?</DOC>

 - The very credible presentation made to the United Nations Security Council overnight represents the latest chapter of damning evidence against Iraq. It is a compelling illustration of the extent to which the weapons inspectors appointed by the Security Council have been deliberately and systematically misled by Iraq. The critics of the United States and the critics of this government have called for more evidence of the claims made against Iraq. Last night, our time, in New York, before the Security Council, the world saw a very compelling case made by a very compelling and credible Secretary of State. What that presentation revealed was a deliberate, systematic campaign of deceit, distortion and deception on the part of Iraq. What the presentation from the Secretary of State requires the Security Council to do is to live up to its obligations as contained in resolution 1441.  What the Secretary of State demonstrated so tellingly in a 90-minute presentation was this. Iraq has deceived, misled and been guilty of obfuscation - and not with the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, France or Germany. Rather, it has been guilty of all those things with the weapons inspectors of the Security Council of the United Nations. What Iraq did, it did to the United Nations. The body that Iraq deceived was the United Nations. It may have been the presentation of the Secretary of State of the United States, but the deception was aimed at the heart of the credibility of the body which is empowered under the charter of the United Nations to carry out the wishes of the world community.Everything in the Powell presentation reinforced what Dr Blix had said. Blow by blow there was a reinforcement of everything that Dr Blix had said - the provision of the telephone intercepts, which demonstrated very clearly a pattern of shifting material away from the inspectors; the reference to the removal of references to nerve agents in discussions and communications concerning material; and all of the other evidence of how sites have been doctored in respect of visits by weapons inspectors. Self-evidently, when you add what the Secretary of State said to what Dr Blix has said - when you add all of these things together - what you have is a damning indictment against Iraq and the strongest possible evidence that what the United States has been saying, what we have been saying, what the British have been saying and what many others have been saying is absolutely correct.The critics of the United States have called for proof. We had a damning indictment contained in the Blix report. We now have an even more damning indictment contained in the presentation by the Secretary of State. The material in the presentation could hardly be more damning. It draws on corroborating information from many sources, including Australian intelligence and material from a number of other countries. The tapes of Iraqi conversations, satellite imagery and testimony from human sources used in the briefing demonstrate that Iraq is actively and systematically avoiding the UN weapons inspectors in defiance of the resolution of the Security Council of the United Nations.This presents the Security Council with a direct and unavoidable challenge. Does it do something about the contempt displayed by Iraq or does it melt away in weakness in the face of this impudent behaviour so clearly demonstrated not only through the work of the weapons inspectors but now, very tellingly, in the presentation by the Secretary of State? Nobody can doubt Colin Powell's credibility; nobody can doubt the credibility of this presentation. It went beyond the expectations of the cynics and the sceptics - chapter and verse.The presentation contained very powerful information. It did provide new evidence of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction programs and Iraq's involvement in terrorism. It did present identified facts and patterns of behaviour that support the allegations. There was direct evidence, and very compelling evidence. It found weapons of mass destruction related documents in the home of an Iraqi scientist. The inspectors have found undeclared chemical warheads. The presentation included satellite imagery of Iraq cleaning up facilities before weapons inspectors arrived. It provided intercepted communications from the Iraqi Republican Guard regarding efforts to conceal a modified vehicle and forbidden munitions.In the face of evidence like this, how can members in this parliament pretend that there is not a very compelling case against Iraq? More importantly, how can the Security Council retain the credibility of the United Nations if it does not do something about Iraq's defiance? This presentation is a challenge to the credibility of the Security Council. If the Security Council does not act in the face of this firmly and effectively to enforce its own resolution, the Security Council will do, as I indicated in my statement last Tuesday, immense and ongoing damage to the credibility of the entire United Nations organisation. </DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition. Let me take him through the sequence of events. I announced on 10 January, following a meeting of the National Security Committee of cabinet, that some forces would be forward deployed to the Gulf in preparation for any military action that the government might decide to commit Australian forces to. Prior to this announcement, I had made it clear that the Australian Defence Force military planners were aware of and had engaged in prudent contingency planning with their US counterparts for possible military action against Iraq. I have been saying this for quite a number of weeks; indeed, months.I mentioned in parliament as early as 19 August 2002 - Hansard, page 4802 - that Australian military liaison personnel had been placed in the US command structure since the start of the war against terrorism. At a doorstop interview on 5 September and again on 24 September and in a radio interview with Neil Mitchell on 4 October, I again said that contingency discussions had taken place between Australian and US military planners. That is as far back as October last year.On 20 November 2002, in an address to the Committee for Economic Development of Australia, I repeated that Australian military personnel had engaged in contingency discussions with the United States and in addition I indicated in that same speech that the Australian Defence Force, as the public would expect, had undertaken contingency arrangements against the possibility of an involvement in military operations.It does puzzle me, and I think it will puzzle members on this side of the House, that the opposition thinks there is something wrong with the idea of getting our military ready in case they are asked to undertake duties. That is essentially what has been occurring. I make no bones about that and I have never sought to disguise it.In relation to the Kanimbla, Australian ships have been operating in the Gulf as part of the maritime interdiction force on and off since it was established and continuously since the middle of 2001. On 17 October 2001 I announced that Australia would maintain a naval presence in the Multinational Interception Force as part of its overall contribution to the war against terrorism. On 2 September 2002 Defence's Maritime Headquarters directed that HMAS Kanimbla be prepared for a routine rotation to the MIF. The Navy has two amphibious transport ships, HMAS Kanimbla and HMAS Manoora.Both ships had previously deployed to the Gulf as part of the Navy's standard rotation. HMAS Kanimbla had already served in the Gulf from December 2001 to March 2002. HMAS Manoora returned from operations in the Gulf in mid-2002. HMAS Kanimbla underwent specific preparations for MIF duties at Fleet Base East, Sydney, between 14 and 31 October 2002. HMAS Kanimbla was to be prepared to deploy in March 2003.HMAS Kanimbla sailed to Melbourne and conducted a port visit between 3 and 9 November 2002. Following this visit she then completed some outstanding maintenance work until 23 January 2003. Following my 10 January 2003 announcement, the Chief of the Defence Force ordered on 13 January that HMAS Kanimbla was to be on 48 hours notice to sail from 20 January 2003. HMAS Kanimbla's deployment to the MIF was subsequently brought forward from March 2003 to January 2003. HMAS Kanimbla, as the Leader of the Opposition will know because he was there, departed Fleet Base East on 23 January 2003. The exercises have been raised. Let me inform the House that HMAS Kanimbla conducts joint amphibious training with the Army on a routine basis. From 16 to 27 September 2002 HMAS Kanimbla participated in Exercise Swift Eagle in the Shoalwater Bay training area as part of its planned amphibious training. Exercise Swift Eagle is con-duc-ted every two years. The 2002 exercise was approved by the Defence leadership in March of 2001. Personnel from Ross Island were drawn from 10 Forward Support Battalion, who embarked on HMAS Kanimbla with two landing craft - medium LCMHs  - as part of the routine training activities. At the conclusion of the exercise the LCMH remained embarked on HMAS Kanimbla to undergo the inte-gra-tion and continuing training in the lead-up to the planned deployment of HMAS Kanimbla to the MIF.The rest of the note relates to the foreign minister, and we have dealt with that. But that is the situation regarding the HMAS Kanimbla.</DOC>

I know all members of the House will recognise the concerns of the member for Herbert.Can I inform the House that those members of the Australian Defence Force who are being predeployed to the Gulf region under Operation Bastille will receive, upon entering the relevant area, conditions of service equivalent to those currently applying to ADF personnel in the region involved in the war against terrorism and the Multinational Interception Force. In the event that the government takes a decision to participate in military action against Iraq, new and more generous conditions of service will apply to those directly involved in combat operations.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Macarthur for his question. I know he has a very great interest in this issue and has been communicating very sincerely, and with strength, with his constituents on this matter.Secretary Powell's presentation to the Security Council, as the Prime Minister has already said, provided further deeply troubling and compelling evidence that Iraq is not cooperating with the United Nations inspections. This corroborates, confirms and reinforces the report by the United Nations Chief Inspector, Hans Blix, 10 days ago to the Security Council, in which he made it clear that Iraq, whilst cooperating in terms of process - that is, allowing inspectors to move around Iraq relatively freely - was not cooperating in matters of substance. Secretary Powell's report underlines also, I think, a point that the Australian government has been making for quite some time; that is, it is not a question of how much time inspectors have - whether they need more time or less time or whatever it may be - it is a question of whether Saddam Hussein and his regime cooperate with the inspectors. You could give inspectors another 12 years on top of the 12 years Saddam Hussein has already had, but if there is no cooperation from the regime of Saddam Hussein, the inspectors will not be able to do their job. On the other hand, if Saddam Hussein cooperates fully with the inspectors - with UNMOVIC and the IAEA - then, in the context of full cooperation, obviously adequate time needs to be provided. In terms of the next stages for the United Nations, I would draw the House's attention to essentially two events, and I think it is important to understand this. First of all, Hans Blix and Mohamed ElBaradei, the heads of UNMOVIC and IAEA respectively, will go to Iraq at the weekend - on 8 and 9 February. This visit is going to be particularly important. They have made it very clear that, in agreeing to return to Baghdad, the government of Iraq must finally show to them a willingness to cooperate on things such as providing missing data from Iraq's declaration of December; the accepting of U2 surveillance flights over Iraq, which so far Iraq has refused to accept uncon-ditionally and in line with the demands of United Nations inspectors; and allowing private interviews of Iraqi scientists - unhindered and unin-hibited by Iraqi officials - to proceed. It is our view that it is appropriate for Hans Blix and Mohamed ElBaradei to go to Baghdad to give Saddam Hussein an opportunity to prove that he is prepared to make a dramatic change in his policy, which has been a policy of obstruction, obfuscation and playing cat-and-mouse games with the United Nations, at least up until now. Clearly, this visit at the weekend is crucial. Saddam Hussein must change his ways and cooperate fully with the United Nations. Blix and ElBaradei will subsequently report to the Security Council on 14 February. Obviously, that report is going to be extremely important in guiding the council members in the next step of their deliberations.I think it just has to be repeated over and over again: the onus in this debate about Iraq is on Saddam Hussein. He is the person on whom the onus rests to comply with United Nations Security Council resolutions and to cooperate with the United Nations. Many people in this House and in the community speak highly about the United Nations. It is Iraq which is not complying with Security Council resolutions and it is Iraq which is not cooperating with United Nations inspectors - and the world is demanding that Iraq does, consistent not just with Security Council resolution 1441 but with earlier Security Council resolutions. We very much hope that the build-up of forces in the Gulf region will be a clear warning to Iraq of the consequences of noncompliance with international law and the demands of international law.It is worth reminding the House of something said by Kofi Annan, the Secretary-General of the United Nations and an enormously credible and able man - in my view, the best Secretary-General of the United Nations there has been in living memory. He said, `There is no doubt in anyone's mind that military pressure' - the pressure of troops moving closer to Iraq - `got the inspectors back into Iraq after a four-year absence.' That is Kofi Annan's view. The combination of this military pressure and a determined Security Council membership offers the best prospect for the peaceful disarmament of Iraq. I hope that this combination of things - the rule of international law, Security Council resolutions, the United Nations inspectors and, frankly, the threat of force by those countries which have been prepared to make that contribution will ultimately lead to Saddam Hussein disarming and disarming peacefully. </DOC>

 - When you have discussions with a close ally, you talk about a lot of things. I can assure the Leader of the Opposition that our position is as I have outlined it. Our position is that we have undeniably and unashamedly put ourselves in a position to make a contribution if in the final result we decide that a contribution should be made. In furtherance of that, we have had our military and the American military consulting for many months. We had people placed in the command structure, as I indicated a little while ago. I have never sought to disguise that. - Those on the other side who bring a little more commonsense to this debate would know that you have a whole range of discussions with a close ally. I certainly do not carry in my mind the precise date, and I will undertake to see if I can further enlighten the Leader of the Opposition. Our position is as I have outlined it, and I make no bones about the fact that we have addressed this issue in a very direct fashion. We have a different view from that of the opposition - we actually have a position on this.It is very interesting that we have now had 25 minutes of question time and the most important matter about Iraq around the world today is the Powell presentation to the Security Council but that has not been mentioned by the opposition, just as there is a name of a world leader that dare not crop up in a Labor Party contribution - Tony Blair, the name that dare not be uttered by the Australian Labor Party. You can spend all of your waking hours attacking the President of the United States and attacking others, but you do not attack Tony Blair. The problem is that Tony Blair is a Labour Party member and he is also right, and that creates quite a difficulty.If there is anything further I can provide to the Leader of the Opposition on that matter, I will. While I am on my feet, I would like to add to an answer I gave earlier to a question asked by the Leader of the Opposition - I think it was his first question. It was about the people who were there with the ships. I have been advised by the defence department that, on 24 October last year, there were no ADF forces in the Middle East that were not there in support of Operation Slipper - that is, our contribution to the war on terrorism - with the special forcesoperations in Afghanistan or with the MIF. So, even if your interpretation is right, you are still wrong.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. His question really complements a question that was asked yesterday by the member for Flinders. I appreciate the concern shown by the member for Ryan and the member for Flinders, which reflects the concern of many Australians about the human rights record of the regime of Saddam Hussein - which, I would say, is the worst human rights record of any country on earth today.One particularly noteworthy and, frankly, quite appalling aspect of Secretary of State Powell's presentation was evidence that, in an effort to develop weapons of mass destruction - chemical, biological and nuclear weapons - Saddam Hussein's regime had experimented on human beings. Secretary Powell presented intelligence information indicating that, since the 1980s, Saddam Hussein's regime has been experimenting on human beings to perfect its biological and chemical weapons. One source said that 1,600 death row prisoners were transferred in 1995 to a special unit for such experiments. One eyewitness saw prisoners tied down to beds, experiments conducted on them, blood oozing around the victims' mouths and autopsies performed to confirm the effects on the prisoners.The thought that any regime could conduct experiments on human beings for the purpose of improving an arsenal of weapons of mass destruction is abhorrent to all decent, fair-minded and reasonable people. As I said yesterday, on the question of human rights abuses Saddam Hussein is in a league of his own. The information presented by Secretary of State Colin Powell simply adds to Saddam's long, grisly record of abuses of his own people. Thousands of Iraqis simply disappear without being seen again. I remind the House - and I am sure many members do not know this - that the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Iraq to the Commission on Human Rights has documented 16,496 cases of disappearance. Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International place the number of disappeared people between 70,000 and 150,000.In trying to address the threat of Saddam's pursuit of weapons of mass destruction, it is in that context - apart from any other context, and there are plenty of other contexts - absolutely impossible to ignore this simply grotesque human rights record. Indeed, his treatment of his own people underlines why he poses such a threat to his neighbours and to the broader international community. I said this yesterday and I will say it again: the thought of somebody like that, a regime like that, continuing to have chemical, biological and nuclear weapons is a horrific threat to the international community.</DOC>

 - I will see if I can provide the Leader of the Opposition, after further inquiry after question time, with some more information. It will probably be a date sometime late last year. I do not know offhand, but I cannot quite see the point of this line of inquiry. Of course, if a government in its internal discussions decides that it might at some time in the future forward deploy forces, it stands to reason, in fairness to the armed forces, that it should do some preparatory work in taking and announcing that decision. Therefore, it might throw up a date before 10 January. I would be certain it would throw up a date before 10 January, but I will see if I can further enlighten the Leader of the Opposition. It is not going to alter the fact that we have not disguised for a moment that we would engage in contingency planning with the United States. We have never disguised that. The Leader of the Opposition knows that. What the Leader of the Opposition has got to face is putting together a coherent position for his own party on this issue.   -  - Well, the official Labor Party position may be one thing, but I notice suggestions that there might be an unofficial Labor Party position, and that is entirely another thing. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Kooyong for his question. I can inform him that the government does intend to continue the strong budget policy which it has had in place since its election in 1996. In this financial year - 2002-03 - the government is budgeting for a small surplus of 0.3 per cent of GDP, notwithstanding the fact that most of the countries of the developed world, including the United States and the United Kingdom, are in substantial deficit. The OECD average budget position in 2003 is a deficit of 2.9 per cent. That is the average. The US budget deficit for 2003 is forecast to be around 2.9 per cent. In Australian terms, that would be a $20 billion deficit if we were at the US position or if we were at the OECD position in the forthcoming year.In addition to that, the repayment of government debt means that Australia's debt to GDP ratio is 3.6 per cent. That is less than 10 per cent of the OECD average, which is 47.3 per cent. The OECD average of the developed world is 47.3 per cent; Australia's is less than 10 per cent of that. In its most recent analysis, Moody's - which upgraded Australia's credit rating to AAA, a rating which was lost under the Labor Party's 13-year economic management - noted that the government is putting in place changes to deal with the long-term demographic change. But it noted this:The government is putting forward changes in eligibility requirements for income support and measures to increase labour market flexibility. However, the government's lack of a majority in the Senate may pose some difficulties in enacting some of the more politically controversial changes.What Moody's is saying is that Labor Party oppositionism in the Senate is now holding back Australia's economic prospects, and this is being noted around the world. As the government moves on these demographic changes, mindless oppositionism from the Labor Party is becoming a significant holdback for Australia. Two budgets ago, not in the May budget last year but in the budget before, this government laid down a program to reform the welfare system - Australians Working Together. Two budgets later, that has still not passed the Senate. In last year's budget we put down measures to reform the PBS system. That has still not passed the Senate as we go into this year's budget. In last year's budget the government put forward measures to reform the disability support pension. They have still not been dealt with in the Senate notwithstanding that we are coming up to this year's budget - mindless oppositionism, led by a mindless opposition leader. What you see from this opposition leader is an obsession with process which he uses to mask his lack of principle. If you are discussing Iraq, it is not an issue about Hussein and weapons of mass destruction; it is an issue of what was in a memo of a record of a conversation between the foreign minister and the New Zealand High Commissioner. That is the issue. When you are reforming the tax system, it is not about whether you want a broad based indirect tax or not; it is about bringing lettuce leaves into the parliament and putting them at the dispatch box.When it was about changing the great structures of Australia's tax system, he promised for three years his famous policy of roll-back and at the end of three years brought forth a gnat. He laboured so long for so little. We see this over and over again. When the Labor Party say that we should reform the disability support pension because it is masking unemployment, as the member for Werriwa says, and you actually roll something through the parliament up to the Senate, they reject it - not because there is principle, but because of a mindless oppositionism led by a mindless opposition leader who masks his lack of principle with this preoccupation with process. No wonder we are seeing it now in relation to international affairs - `When did you know it? What was the date of this? What was the date of that?' Apparently there is no interest at all in the regime of Saddam Hussein and what to do about weapons of mass destruction. It is a question of getting through a divisive issue which the Labor Party cannot come to terms with and which the opposition leader is not prepared to lead on. We have seen it in the economic debate; we now see it in the foreign affairs debate. This side of the parliament is interested in doing what is right for the Australian people and building a long-term opportunity - and we will continue to do it.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Maranoa for the question because it gives me the opportunity to put a few facts on the table about what is actually happening in relation to relief for farmers around Australia. I am, frankly, sick and tired of state premiers, radio commentators and would-be agri-politicians seeking to undermine and discredit the efforts of the Commonwealth government to provide assistance to farmers and, indeed, to white-ant the assistance that we are already providing to farmers right around Australia.Let us start with a couple of very important facts. The reality is - in spite of claims by Premier Carr yesterday, parroted and echoed by certain members opposite and one or two radio commentators - that it is simply untrue to say that there are no farmers receiving federal money and that they have to wait for exceptional circumstances declarations to receive assistance. That is simply wrong, and it has been repeated by people like Premier Carr, dishonestly, day after day. As at 31 January, 3,649 farmers are receiving federal government drought assistance amounting to more than $50 million. - More than $50 million has already been provided by way of Commonwealth assistance to farmers around Australia - and that does not include assistance such as extra health care and access to additional education assistance, which is also available. It is important to note that this is real money. This is money that is actually in farmers' pockets. It is not like the illusionary promises we are getting from state governments around the place; this is actual money in farmers' pockets. It is $350 every week for needy farm families to put food on their table and to meet their basic needs. And it is not just one payment of $350; it is provided this week, next week, next month, after the New South Wales election, after Easter and, indeed, to those receiving exceptional circumstances, it is provided for up to two years. It is ongoing assistance; it is not just to meet the emergency needs at the present time but also to help farmers through this recovery phase. Obviously, these costs are going to mount and get bigger every week. The number of farmers who are seeking to receive assistance has doubled in the last fortnight, and I would expect that number to increase - particularly if we could get a bit of cooperation from the state governments to put these measures effectively into place. We estimate that the cost of the measures that have already been announced will go to around $900 million. But we have not limited the expenditure; we will provide whatever is needed to ensure that assistance to farmers - the welfare assistance and the business support necessary to get them through these difficult times - will be available in a timely way.The honourable member asked about exceptional circumstances declarations. He would be pleased to note that a large area of his own electorate in south-west Queensland was declared to be in exceptional circumstances yesterday. That area covers something like 21 per cent of the state of Queensland. Assistance was also announced yesterday for north-east South Australia, in the electorate of the honourable member for Grey. And today assistance has been announced for some 1,600 dairy farmers in the Goulburn irrigation and Riverina areas, in the electorates of the members for Murray and for Farrer.As a result of these announcements, these farmers will be eligible for income support for two years. In addition to that, they will be eligible for interest subsidies of up to $100,000 a year and they will continue to be eligible for the assistance on the $100,000 that was available during the interim phase. As a new initiative from this government, businesses in those regions will also now be eligible for support. This government, for the first time, is providing business support to those businesses in rural communities that are adversely affected as a result of drought. These areas will join farmers in the Western Division of New South Wales, the Riverina, Walgett, Coonamble, Burke, Brewarrina, Peak Downs, Darling Downs and the northern and southern wheat belts in Western Australia, which are eligible for full exceptional circumstances assistance.It should be pointed out that these farmers have not had to wait for this announcement to receive assistance. They have already been eligible since at least 9 December - in some cases earlier - for income support and interest rate subsidies. We have acted promptly to provide assistance. We have dealt with the 17 applications that were delivered to the federal government over the Christmas and New Year period, and the National Rural Advisory Council met yesterday to consider the last of those applications - except for one from Victoria for which the data has not yet been provided. We have moved very quickly to ensure that instant assistance is available to farmers, even while their applications are under consideration.There has also been a suggestion that the number of farmers receiving assistance is quite small. I brought along a map, Mr Speaker, which you may not like me to display, that demonstrates very clearly that a very large proportion of the area of Australia is now covered by federal government assistance - the whole of New South Wales. Premier Carr should acknowledge that 100 per cent of the farmers of New South Wales who meet the income and assets test have been eligible for Commonwealth assistance since at least 9 December and, in many instances, even earlier. His claims that no-one is getting anything are simply dishonest and do not accurately reflect the facts. Our efforts to provide real and practical assistance contrast dramatically with his own efforts. The New South Wales Farmers Feder-ation told me earlier today that Premier Carr has so far made more than 50 announcements costing a total of $68 million which he has dressed up as drought assistance, but in reality only $13 million is ever designed to go to farmers.  - Only $13 million is ever designed to go to farmers. The rest of it is for the sorts of things that governments are normally expected to do - issues that, in many cases, are not even directly related to the drought. In the honourable member's state of Queensland, the situation is probably even worse. There, the state government admitted in an answer to a question on notice just before Christmas that the total amount of money that they have actually paid to farmers in the two years until that date was only $2.2 million - $2.2 million for the whole of Queensland. - The whole of Queensland. You have Minister Palaszczuk and Premier Beattie claiming that they are spending $20 million and $30 million, but that is on things like weather forecasting services, bureaucrats' salaries, farm seminars and the like; it is not money in the pockets - money of the nature that is being provided by the federal government.I know that Mr Carr is a bit sensitive at the present time, because this week the coalition announced its drought policy in New South Wales, which will provide an additional $50 million to the farmers in New South Wales - real money, real benefits to the farmers of New South Wales. But what I felt was even more refreshing about this policy was that they have made a commitment to sign up to the Commonwealth's proposed reform of exceptional circumstances measures. We have been trying to reform these measures for three years and have been getting no cooperation whatsoever from the states. No state government will sign up to reform the EC arrangement. So I congratulate the New South Wales coalition on their willingness to provide real and meaningful assistance to farmers in that state.What was even better about their policy was their commitment to work cooperatively with the federal government to deliver assistance to farmers. If the state governments would work more cooperatively with the Commonwealth, assistance could be provided more quickly, more appropriately and in a coordinated way. So I welcome this commitment by the New South Wales coalition to work with the Commonwealth, and I hope that other states will follow suit. Premier Carr likes to call himself the farmers' friend. But friends stand by you in a crisis. They are there when you are in trouble. They do not pretend that they are doing something when they are not doing anything. The reality is that the farmers of New South Wales and the farmers of Australia are in need of friends in this crisis. We are determined, in spite of the lack of cooperation from the states, to provide assistance to farmers in a practical and timely way and to work with them through these really difficult months so that the Australian rural industries can recover promptly once the rains return.</DOC>

 - The reason that I will answer the question is to point out to the Leader of the Opposition that I in fact dealt with this issue in the answer I gave at the beginning of question time, when I made it perfectly clear that, if there is a commitment to military operations, those involved in the military operation, like those Special Air Service personnel who served in Afghanistan, will go onto a higher rate. Here we have the Leader of the Opposition again playing these little word games. That is what he is doing. I know exactly what the Leader of the Opposition is doing. Because the word `warlike' is employed in relation to the MIF, he says, `Ah, we've finally got him. That means that we are committed to a war.' Let me spell it out in the plainest of English so that even the Leader of the Opposition can understand. As these people are on the way, they are remunerated at what you might loosely call a normal rate. When they enter the theatre, they will be remunerated the same as those people in the Multinational Interception Force. If there is a military deployment, those who are involved in the operation will get paid at a still higher rate, like those in the SAS. Whatever the description that is used, that is the way it works. If the Leader of the Opposition thinks that that proves that we have declared war, then he is even more barmy on this issue than I imagined.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Deakin for his question. I understand that, of the 88 Australians killed in Bali, two were residents of the electorate of Deakin. I commend the member for Deakin for his support of and assistance to the families of those deceased. I add my commendation to those other members of the House for their support of the families of residents of their electorates who were killed or injured.The Australian Federal Police continues to work closely with the Indonesian National Police in the investigation of the Bali bombings. So far there have been 17 arrests made in Indonesia directly related to the Bali bombings. Other arrests have arisen from the investigation or are peripheral to the investigation. More recently, we have seen a number of people suspected of being associated with Jamaah Islamiah arrested across the region. These arrests do not necessarily relate directly to the Bali bombings. The arrest of Ali Imron on 13 January was a significant breakthrough. Imron was the first suspect arrested who had a detailed knowledge of the events of the night of 12 October 2002 leading up to the explos-ions. The Indonesian National Police are in the final stages of the preparation of dossiers on those arrested. The location for the trial has not yet been determined; however, it is expected that the trial will commence during late February or March this year.The Australian Federal Police has a team supporting the Indonesian prosecution and providing assistance as required. This team has, to date, collected more than 30 witness and victim impact statements in support of the prosecution. It is not yet known whether there will be a requirement for any of these witnesses to attend and give evidence in the proposed trials in Indonesia. In support of this process, the AFP has also established a dedicated family liaison team with officers throughout Aust-ralia. These officers have responsibility for liaising with the families of the Bali victims and ensuring that they are provided with accurate and timely informa-tion regarding the investigation and potential prosecu-tions. Investigations by the Indonesian National Police are continuing with a view to apprehending other suspects regarding the bombings. The allegation of a link between the cleric Abu Bakar Bashir and JI is a significant development, with several suspects claiming to have met Bashir both before and after the bombings. These claims are being investigated, as are the extent of the activities of JI throughout the region.There are currently about 45 Australian law enforcement personnel deployed in Indonesia for Operation Alliance. This includes members of the AFP, the Australian Protective Service and state police services. Approximately 15 AFP officers are dedicated to Operation Alliance in Australia. More officers are allocated to this investigation on a needs basis. The disaster victim identification process is expected to be completed by 14 February, at which time all the body parts which are identifiable will have been identified. As at the end of last year, Operation Alliance had resulted in the expenditure of $7,510,000 and as at the end of the year a total of 83,073 hours had been attributed to the operation throughout the AFP. The opposition has, in the course of the Iraq debate, made the ridiculous suggestion that the government has focused on Iraq to the detriment of countering terrorism in the region. The continuing close cooperation between the AFP and the Indonesian national police on the Bali bombings investigation is just one example that shows that this is simply not the case. The government takes the threat of terrorism seriously and will continue to do everything it can to protect Australians and Australian interests from the threat of terrorism at home and abroad.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Cowan. I know he has a very genuine interest in these matters, as do members on both sides of the House. I cannot answer the question because I do not know without making inquiries of my colleagues. I undertake to the honourable member to make those inquiries as quickly as I can and to come back to him. I also undertake to make the response available to all members. I think the care of people who lose loved ones in combat and the care of people who are the victims of war is a great responsibility of governments and over the years it has been one of those issues where both sides of politics have made good contributions. I know that under the former Minister for Veterans' Affairs, the member for Bowman in the Keating government, there were many good initiatives brought in, which we supported.Under this government and under successive ministers for veterans' affairs, including the member for Maranoa and now the member for Hughes, a similar approach has been adopted. I will always be responsive to suggestions and advice from the other side when it comes to the care of our veterans and it is in that spirit that I answer the honourable gentleman's question. I will come back to him as soon as I can.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Grey for his question. I note that the honourable member for Grey represents Woomera and also Port Augusta and, in that sense, is very familiar with some of the difficulties of managing detention centres and the extensive employment issues that are relevant within his constituency. I must say that the Woomera break-out was quite organised. An incident of that character does not just happen. When you know that some 15 detainees were in the sterile zone and had obviously moved there before the outside group approached the centre, it is obvious that there was some considerable linkage, contact and liaison.In something that was so well organised it was a matter of very considerable concern to me that those who approached the detention centre by vehicle sought to run over a detention officer who was merely doing his work. When you have people come with tyre levers and iron bars and then proceed to whip one detention officer around the legs and another across the chest, you can see that this was a very sinister, premeditated and deliberate act. It is certainly not the sort of action that we would expect from well-meaning people who advocate on behalf of unauthorised arrivals on the pretext that all of them have bona fide asylum claims. What disappointed me particularly was that some organisations and advocates have condoned these attacks as being appropriate. If you read the reports of various radio stations around Australia, particularly in Brisbane, you will see that there were people suggesting that, because detention officers were detaining people, they were legitimate targets. I found those comments absolutely outrageous. I am sure the member for Grey - with these people as constituents of his - would agree that there is no way that anybody going out to do their work should be subject to actions of that sort. I have read the reports of the ACM staff who sought to contain this incident and I want to commend them for their gallant behaviour. To be endeavouring to put people back through a hole in the fence when somebody is attacking you with an iron bar I think is very much beyond the call of duty. I have written to the detention officers involved to commend them for that.In relation to people who have been apprehended for harbouring, I do not know whether they were involved in that aspect of the incident and I would not want to make any suggestion or comment about that. That is a matter for the courts to deal with. I am told the police have arrested and charged three people in the Burra region over the escapes and for harbouring escapees. The police have been able to apprehend all of the six detainees who were broken out. Three of those have already faced preliminary hearings and have been remanded in custody; the other three are likely to have their preliminary hearings today. Another man is being held while inquiries are being made to establish his identity. Going by the name he has offered, it seems to me that he is trying to conceal his identity. I do not know from that whether or not we are dealing with somebody who may have previously escaped or is otherwise unlawful.An opposition member - What was his name? - It almost sounded like Father Christmas. That was not it, but it was something similar. I am grateful to the South Australian police and the Australian Federal Police for their efforts and cooperation in this matter. They have acted very professionally, worked the matter through and dealt with it substantially. I want to add that we have been remarkably effective in locating escapees generally. While I do not have the figures with me, the bulk of people who have escaped detention in recent years have been apprehended and the activities of the compliance officers and police in dealing with those issues have been important. In relation to this particular incident, I am glad that it has been resolved as quickly as it has.</DOC>

I can assure the member for Cowan and our veterans that the government is having bona fide discussions with the AMA on this issue. Indeed, I will be meeting with the President of the AMA, Kerryn Phelps, later this afternoon.

 - The recent bushfire crisis has been particularly acute in the electorate of Indi, so I thank the member for her question. Although disaster relief is the responsibility of state governments, it is important for all governments to do what they can to help emergency services volunteers, particularly at times of extended natural disaster such as the current bushfire season. A number of members on both sides of this House have expressed their concerns about the possibility that New South Wales Rural Fire Service volunteers and Victorian Country Fire Authority volunteers could be dismissed because of their work to protect communities in trouble. This government believes that the majority of businesses do what they can to support emergency services volunteers. Indeed, some businesses extend paid leave to bushfire brigade volunteers and to State Emergency Service volunteers at times like this.In order to reinforce the best instincts of employers and to reassure emergency services volunteers, I inform the House that the government has decided to amend the Workplace Relations Act to make it unlawful to dismiss a worker who is absent from work for emergency service during emergencies. That is a decision that the government has taken. I intend to move the amendments in question during the sitting week after next. I am sure the amendments will have the support of both sides of the House, and I will look forward to their speedy passage through the parliament.</DOC>

 - I can assure the Leader of the Opposition and I can assure the Australian people that I will communicate the policy of the government to President Bush. The policy of the government is what I explained to the House. This is the last question I will have before I go overseas, and I treat the question seriously. It is fair to say that throughout this week we have had a very comprehensive debate. It may not be the last debate on this issue. That will depend on whether the government does, in accordance with the proper constitutional processes, finally take a decision to commit to a military operation.That point of decision has yet to arrive. If we do, that decision will be the subject of a debate, as the decision to commit to East Timor was and the decision to commit to the Gulf in 1991 was. I hope, and I guess all of us hope, that there will be no further debate on this issue and that, in the fullness of time, commonsense might possibly prevail. There is only one country that can really deliver peace, and that is Iraq. There are a lot of things I can say to the President - and, indeed, say to the man whose name never passes the lips of the Australian Labor Party, and that is the leader of the British government. I think the British Prime Minister on this issue has shown leadership, strength, determination and intelligence.  - This is one of those issues where one might have imagined that attitudes, in the national interest, might transcend party lines. You have seen that demonstrated in the United Kingdom. You have seen the leader of the British Labour Party display a strength and determination in his assessment of the national interest that has been absent in this country on the part of the leader of the Australian Labor Party. The Labor Party may disagree in different ways with the policy that has been articulated by me on behalf of the government. But, when I have looked back over the last few days and I have looked at the response of the Leader of the Opposition, it has been overwhelmingly a negative, political response. The Leader of the Opposition has not endeavoured to articulate a comprehensive alternative Labor Party strategy on this issue. - The Leader of the Opposition has used every opportunity debate and question time have afforded him to personally denigrate the President of the United States. We have heard plenty of criticism of the President of the United States, but frankly not enough criticism of Iraq from the Leader of the Opposition.I will tell you what I will be saying. I will be saying to the President of the United States, as I have said to the opposition and to the Australian people, that overwhelmingly it will be in the interests of everybody - including, and most importantly, the Security Council of the United Nations - if a resolution is adopted in the event that military force appears to be the only alternative to secure compliance with the decisions of the Security Council of the United Nations. This, more than anything else, is a test for the United Nations. If the Security Council fails this test, history will judge it as having done long-term damage to the cause of the United Nations. The onus is, therefore, very much on the 15 members.But the most important thing that I will say - not only to President Bush but also to the British Prime Minister, to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, to the President of Indonesia and anybody else I meet - is that the reason that Australia is concerned about this matter and the reason it directly affects the national interest of Australia is that a world in which you run the risk of the evil of weapons of mass destruction in the hands of rogue states joining the other great modern evil of international terrorism is not a world that I believe Australians want to live in. I believe that the Australian people want their government and their opposition to do all in their power to prevent those twin evils coming together. That is the message I will give to President Bush and that is the message I believe the overwhelming majority of the Australian people endorse.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. As I have indicated, and as is well known now, the Prime Minister is in the United States at the moment as part of a trip to meet with President Bush. Following that, he will move on to the United Kingdom. He has already had a round of meetings in the United States, and from Washington he will go on to New York to meet with the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Kofi Annan, and with Dr Blix. The Prime Minister will be taking this opportunity to express Australia's strong preference for a new Security Council resolution, which we have referred to time and time again in this place and more broadly across the country. This is not because we believe that a further Security Council resolution is needed for legal reasons but because we believe that it would help garner and build international support - in fact, the very international support and solidarity that might maximise our chances of securing the very peaceful outcome that we say we are all looking for.The Prime Minister will be emphasising the Australian government's view that the Security Council needs to live up to its responsibility for maintaining international peace and security. Any failure by the council in the end to mandate enforcement action against Iraq in response to noncooperation would greatly harm that organisation's standing. That is a very important point. This matter has gone on for some 12 years now, and it should be brought to resolution. Dealing with North Korea will also be more straightforward and more likely to produce a satisfactory outcome if the United Nations Security Council does not deal weakly with the Iraq situation. It is important that the council shows unity of purpose on Iraq, as Iraq will exploit divisions in the international community if it is given the opportunity. I reiterate that the onus plainly remains on Iraq to change its approach.It is also interesting to note that not so very long ago one of the Leader of the Opposition's colleagues, the Premier of Queensland, confirmed the legitimacy of the government's policy position when he commented to the effect that, while he would prefer UN support for any action taken - our position entirely - he can foresee circumstances where Australia may have to consider other options in its national interest. The government has made its position quite plain - there is no doubt or ambiguity about it - and it is pursuing the national interest as I believe all people would expect it to.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and for the interest he shows in the issue. Given Australia's interests in securing Iraq's disarmament - and hopefully that can be done peacefully, as the Acting Prime Minister has pointed out - we have been following the progress of the United Nations weapons inspectors in their discussions with Iraq over the weekend. After meeting with Iraqi officials at the weekend, Dr Blix and Dr ElBaradei said they had seen the beginning of a change in Iraq's attitude to inspections - although I note that Hans Blix made clear it was a beginning, not a breakthrough.While they have not yet been able to resolve the question of Iraqi permission for U2 surveillance flights over Iraq, which is something the UN has made clear it regards as fundamentally important, I understand Iraq has said it will permit some private interviews of Iraqi scientists. That is a requirement under Security Council resolution 1441. Apparently, two or three - perhaps up to four - of these interviews have taken place. After some months of waiting, we hope it will not be two, three or four interviews but that the United Nations inspectors will have full access to all scientists and former scientists whom they wish to interview.While the government obviously are pleased that there are some extremely limited but positive signals, we must not forget what this process is all about. Inspections were not designed for inspections' sake; they were designed to verifiably disarm Iraq. Iraq has had over a decade to comply with Security Council resolutions to this end, and it still has not done so. This means that a beginning of a change in attitude by Iraq, to use the words that have been used by Hans Blix, is clearly insufficient. Iraq must demonstrate a complete change of attitude and a cessation of evasion tactics. We cannot tolerate any further this cat-and-mouse game that has been going on for so long. Partial cooperation on a few issues here and there, designed to avert the enforcement of resolutions, is not good enough. I would note that disarmament is, after all, not a new demand on Iraq; it is a demand that has been there since 1991.In conclusion, to those who say that the inspectors should be given more time for the sake of it, we have always said that the issue is not so much a question of time; it is a question of cooperation. If the Iraqis do cooperate - and cooperate fully, as they are required to do under international law - with the UN inspectors, then in those circumstances adequate time must be given. If Iraq do not properly cooperate, if there is just a continuation of a cat-and-mouse game - just the occasional concession made here and the occasional concession made there to try to spin out the process, and to spin it out indefinitely - then in those circumstances that does not constitute full cooperation as is required by international law, and the Security Council will obviously have to address that situation. The key issue now is going to be what sort of report Hans Blix and Mohamed ElBaradei provide on Friday, New York time. Of course we do not know yet and they do not know yet what effect the visit will really have in terms of day-to-day cooperation during this week. No doubt that will be reflected in the report at the end of the week, and we will be able to look at that.</DOC>

The government have made no commitment. It is as simple as that.

 - I thank the honourable member for Forrest for his question. I appreciate his concern about a number of these human rights issues. As the House will recall, last week I gave some examples to the House of Saddam Hussein's gruesome history of systematic and egregious human rights abuses. I will draw attention to Saddam Hussein's horrific treatment of Iraq's two ethnic and religious minorities, the Marsh Arabs and the Kurds, to underline the hideous depths and sheer scope of his brutality. It is a case study of evil.The pattern of abuse by Saddam's regime of the Marsh Arabs and Kurds has been well documented by the international community for over a decade - including, for the Marsh Arabs, by Human Rights Watch in January of this year. The Marsh Arabs have lived in the marshlands of southern Iraq for more than 5,000 years but, as a result of the Saddam Hussein regime's forced resettlement plans and through draining of the marshes and sadistic campaigns of persecution, the number of Marsh Arabs in southern Iraq has, according to Human Rights Watch, gone from 250,000 in 1991 to fewer than 40,000 today.Saddam's regime has bombarded and shelled Marsh Arab towns and villages, deliberately destroyed homes and property through bulldozing or burning, and laid landmines and water mines. He has basically almost wiped out an entire minority within his own country. I note in the newspapers today a report by Baroness Nicholson, who is the Vice-President of the European parliament's foreign affairs committee, claiming that she has some evidence, which she is to present to the European parliament, that Iraqi forces used chemical weapons against Marsh Arabs in 1998. I do not have that information, so we look forward to seeing what her evidence is.Marsh Arabs and Kurds have been subjected to the same kinds of shocking human rights abuses that occur elsewhere in Iraq, including arbitrary and prolonged imprisonment, disappearances, torture and executions. I spoke of those last week. Amnesty International estimates that over 100,000 Kurds, mostly men and boys, were killed or disappeared during the 1987-88 operations known as the Anfal campaign. Between 1977 and 1987, some 4,500 to 5,000 Kurdish villages were destroyed and their inhabitants forcibly removed and made to live in resettlement camps. During 1987, thousands of Kurds were killed during chemical and conventional bombardments. Since 1991, Iraqi authorities have forcibly expelled thousands of Kurds. This systematic, forcible transfer of the population, a process referred to by the authorities as `Arabisation', has been accompanied by the resettling of Arab families brought from southern Iraq to replace those evicted. As I said last week in answer to two questions I had on human rights abuses in Iraq, the thought of somebody with this kind of human rights record having chemical and biological weapons and a nuclear weapons program is for us on this side of the House - and I think for all reasonable, decent-thinking citizens of the world - a simply horrific thought.</DOC>

 - The short answer to the opposition leader's question is, `Yes, we do,' because the government has not made a decision to commit to military conflict and will not do so until and unless we are satisfied that all achievable options for a peaceful solution have been explored. That is a responsible position, that is our stated position and we will review that only when and if it becomes necessary to make a decision outside of a clear outcome from the United Nations. The question has to be asked as to precisely where the difference between the government and the opposition really is on this. As the Prime Minister noted in his presentation on Iraq in the House last week, the Leader of the Opposition himself made this comment:We won't support any military action outside the authority of the UN ... The exception to this position might occur in the case of overwhelming UN Security Council support for military action, but where support for such action was subject to veto.In a more sober moment outside of this place, he went on to say:In other words, we might need to assess such a situation in light of the circumstances of the veto.That was the Leader of the Opposition's position only a very short time ago. If he has changed it, he ought to tell us and tell us why. I again note that Premier Beattie noted late last year that, while it was his preferred position for any military action to be taken under UN auspices, he could imagine a scenario in which he would back Australia's support for the US without UN approval. We would prefer a UN resolution. There is no doubt about that, but we have made it plain that in an unfolding situation we will reserve the right to assess Australia's interests according to those events as they unfold. I reiterate, however, that no commitment in relation to Australia's forces being involved in any conflict has been made.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Moore for his question. I refer the House to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade's general advice for Australian travellers - which is available, I think, on the web site - which notes:Given heightened tensions concerning possible military action against Iraq, Australians in the Middle East should take sensible precautions and ensure that travel documentation, including passports and any necessary visas, for themselves and their dependants is valid and up-to-date.The advice also notes:Australians should also be aware of the possible use of chemical and biological weapons in any conflict against Iraq, and take precautions if they have concerns about their security from such threats in consultation with their employers and local authorities.The advice goes on:There would also be heightened potential for terrorist activity and civil unrest in the event of conflict in Iraq.Importantly this advice is also included in my department's travel advisories for Kuwait, Israel, Saudi Arabia and Jordan. For five years now, my department has warned all Australians not to visit Iraq. I think that is an important point to make; Australians should not visit Iraq. Australians who are in Iraq have recently been advised to depart as soon as possible. Anyone contemplating travel to Iraq for any reason should heed this advice. The government is consulting closely with key consular partners - the United States, United Kingdom, Canada and New Zealand - about the security environment in the Middle East and our consular interests in the region. A senior official from my department attended five-nation consular discussions in Washington last week.I think it is important that we ensure that there is much coordination and particularly exchange of information between countries that run consular systems somewhat similar to our own. Any activation of our own contingency plans will be preceded by public advice that all Australians should depart a country in the region immediately. I strongly commend all Australians in the Middle East or those contemplating travel to the Middle East carefully to monitor the government's travel advisories and to heed their warnings.</DOC>

 - The Prime Minister made reference to Australia's heightened security arrangements and level of alertness on Saturday, and indeed so did I in a separate interview in Sydney. It is the case that Australia's security arrangements have been heightened since September 11 2001 and a further level of alertness was called for on 19 November last year. But we do not have, I might add, a neat parallel with the colour codes and so forth that America has. We have our own arrangements in place in this country at present and we have responded, as we will continue to respond, to the advice given to us by our security agents on the basis of their risk assessment.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Corangamite for his question and his continuing interest in economic policy. One of the reasons that the Australian economy ran more strongly than that of the United States in 2001 and 2002 -  - is that we managed to avoid the kinds of imbalances that developed in that economy, particularly with overinvestment, which led to the US downturn in 2001-02, with the United States being so reliant on the household sector. In Australia, business investment has been more steady. As the Reserve Bank notes today in its statement on monetary policy:... businesses in aggregate are carrying low levels of debt, have strong internal funding, and have generally avoided the mistakes of over-investment that have characterised past business cycles. Against this background, it is not surprising that business investment is contributing strongly to expenditure growth at present or that employment is continuing to expand.In Australia at the moment, we are seeing low levels of debt; good levels of profitability; at a time when the housing sector is pulling back, business investment increasingly stepping up; and a number of very large projects and civil construction programs, which I am sure both sides of the parliament would welcome. Total business investment grew by 12.2 per cent to the September quarter and the measure of profits increased by 16.2 per cent to the September quarter, with the capital expenditure plans continuing to indicate continued strength in business investment.What has supported the business investment that is now so important to Australia's growth prospects? Low interest rates have been a big part of that - this government managed to get interest rates down from the punitive levels that the Australian Labor Party presided over during the 1980s - as have returning the budget to surplus; retiring Labor debt; guaranteeing the independence of the Reserve Bank; holding inflation in check; introducing a new taxation system which allowed business to get full input tax credits on all of the equipment they purchased - a move that was opposed by the Australian Labor Party; cutting company tax to 30 per cent and making it one of the competitive rates throughout this region; and cutting capital gains tax. All of these measures were opposed by the Australian Labor Party throughout the course of the last parliament, in a campaign of negativity led by the member for Hotham, who indicated that, if the government's tax plan were to pass the parliament, all manner of plague would be visited upon the Australian economy. Yet, because this government pushed forward with the kind of economic reform which is essential, Australia managed to come through the United States recession of 2001 and to be recognised as one of the leaders amongst the industrialised nations in growth.But the campaign for economic reform is not yet finished - it must go on. In particular, we have to attend to labour market reform. There have been good runs put on the board by the member for industrial relations - a tireless and indefatigable worker - who took over from his predecessor, Minister Reith, one of the courageous reformers of this parliament. The Australian Labor Party - that party which opposes all reform for the sake of it; that party which does not hold the Australian national interest first and foremost - continues in the Senate to hold back the reforms that are required. We call on the Australian Labor Party to pass labour market reform; pass the budget measures of last May before we get to the budget of this May; and pass the measures of the May budget of the year before so that Australia can achieve its potential and engage in the kind of reform and leadership that is required so that Australians can have the growth and the jobs which they deserve.</DOC>

 - In general terms, we are on a mid-range level of security alert in Australia, and there are some areas where it is high. As I said in answer to the earlier question, since 11 September 2001 we have had a heightened level of alert in this country. We do not have a system that corresponds directly with America's. We do not have the colour-coding system, nor do we have as many levels. But, plainly, our level of security alertness has been increased. Generally speaking, it might be described as mid-range. There are some areas that have a high level of threat, and we are responding accordingly.I hear those opposite say, `Now we're frightened.' We have in this country responsible security assessment authorities. We do respond to the information they give to us. What I can say in this place and to the Australian people is that there is no specific information at this point in time that is leading us to further raise the general level of alert in the country at the present time.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Herbert for his question and for his dedication to protecting the Great Barrier Reef, which, of course, is one of the great icons of Northern Australia and is probably Australia's greatest natural icon. Two things stand out about protecting the Great Barrier Reef: firstly, the Howard government has put in place the most stringent protections in Australian history to protect the reef; and, secondly, when Labor were in office they did nothing actively, except to pursue oil drilling in areas adjacent to the Great Barrier Reef. Water quality in the Great Barrier Reef lagoon is fundamental to offering maximum protection for the reef, including from the effects of global warming. The Commonwealth and the state of Queensland have issued a draft Great Barrier Reef water quality protection plan, which is now out for discussion amongst all relevant stakeholders. This follows a memorandum of understanding between the Prime Minister and the Premier of Queensland on water quality in the Great Barrier Reef lagoon, agreed in August last year. The reef and its World Heritage values are now therefore protected not only by the marine park act itself but by the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act - the most powerful piece of legislation ever put in place to protect the reef, enabling anything that could damage the reef, including from activities outside the World Heritage Area, to be stopped. Currently, the government is also engaged in the most extensive community consultation process ever undertaken in relation to the reef to pave the way for the introduction of further protection of the biodiversity of the reef through the establishment of representative areas. That is the government's record. What was Labor's record? Labor had 13 years to protect the reef, and we now have the shadow minister running around hypocritically suggesting that, somehow or other, there are inadequate protections for the reef. He obviously does not know of the enormous power of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, so he is ignorant and lazy. But, more than that, he is hypocritical, because when the Labor Party had the chance, it actively encouraged oil drilling off the reef in areas such as the Townsville Trough, the Queensland Trough and the Maryborough Basin. In 1991 Alan Griffiths, the then Minister for Resources, put forward a paper from the Department of Primary Industries and Energy promoting petroleum exploration in offshore Australia. He talked about the release of certain reserve areas which would be subject to seismic testing and oil drilling. These areas, which were to be gradually released by the Labor Party, included the Townsville Trough, the Queensland Trough, the Maryborough Basin and the Capricorn Basin. The Labor Party intended to provide anyone who discovered oil in the areas adjacent to the Barrier Reef with production licences. The document released by Alan Griffiths makes this very clear: that the Labor Party was very willing at that time to see oil production in the areas adjacent to the reef. Indeed, the document says:Where an exploration permit holder makes a commercial discovery, there is an automatic right to a production licence over that discovery. A production licence is granted for 21 years and may be renewed for further periods of 21 years. And where production requires a pipeline to transport petroleum to shore, a pipeline licence will be granted.This shows how nonsensical the current claims of the Labor Party are, claims that it has some dedication to the protection of the reef. It is the Howard government that has put in place the most comprehensive plans to protect water quality on the Great Barrier Reef. All the Labor Party can do is to pick up a one-year-old Democrat bill and bring it forward as its own policy -  - because it has no idea itself how to proceed to protect the reef.</DOC>

The fact of the matter is that we would have to carefully assess, according to information being provided to us by our assessment agencies, the situation as it unfolds.

 - I thank the member for Cowper for the question and acknowledge that last week his area, including the Grafton and Kempsey regions, was included in those areas in New South Wales to receive exceptional circumstances assistance from the Commonwealth government. He has worked hard to demonstrate the need, and I am sure this assistance will be greatly appreciated by the farmers of his electorate. This means that the farmers in areas like Grafton and Kempsey - along with those in other parts of New South Wales that are receiving exceptional circumstances assistance, such as Walgett, Coonamble, Burke and Brewarrina, and those in places such as Peak Downs and the Darling Downs in Queensland, the southern wheat belts in Western Australia and the Goulburn Valley in Victoria - will now be able to receive Commonwealth income support payments for two years. In addition to that, they can receive interest subsidy payments of up to $100,000 a year. Small businesses in those regions are eligible for Commonwealth assistance for their interest bills on loans necessary to meet the circumstances that are associated with this drought.This represents a very significant commitment on behalf of the federal government. Indeed, the commitments made by the Commonwealth to assist drought-stricken farmers around Australia amount to more than $900 million. That is real money for farmers' pockets. It does not include contributions to research and development, the AAA package or FarmBis and the like. It is real income assistance and interest subsidies that will certainly help farmers facing these difficult times.Over the weekend the Acting Prime Minister challenged the state governments to match the Commonwealth's effort. He particularly challenged New South Wales to match the Commonwealth's efforts. The honourable member for Cowper will be particularly interested in this: the Commonwealth's commitment to New South Wales alone is $522 million. I join the Acting Prime Minister in challenging Premier Carr to match it. If he is serious about drought, let him put real money forward, money that will actually go to help farmers. Don't dress up existing programs as though they are drought relief. Don't talk about things such as urban water supply assistance, training programs, farm councils and the like as though they actually put money in farmers' pockets. The reality is that New South Wales, along with other states, is providing very little assistance that actually goes to farmers.In fact, the Commonwealth's commitments to assist farmers directly in these times of need would be 20 times the combined commitment of all of the states. It is really high time that the states delivered real and practical assistance to farmers in need. They have adopted an appallingly miserly and uncaring approach to the drought and the suffering that is occurring in regional areas. In some states, not only are the governments not providing any assistance but they are being absolutely negative towards the rural sector. In Queensland, for instance, having only delivered $2.2 million in actual assistance to farmers over the last two years, the state government has just introduced a new tax on farmers' dams, a levy on water. It has raised rail freights, put on new taxes for stock inspection and fruit and vegetable inspection, and now it is proposing a new ambulance tax, which will fall disproportionately on country people. This is the approach of a government that really does not care.If that were not enough, I was utterly appalled to read over the weekend about what is happening in Victoria. Last week the federal government announced exceptional circumstances relief to the dairy farmers in the Goulburn Valley. Within hours the Victorian government announced that they had withdrawn all of their drought assistance for the farmers in that region. That is shameful. It is a disgrace. The state government of Victoria have withdrawn their drought assistance to the farmers of Victoria because they are now getting Commonwealth aid. This is completely against the spirit of exceptional circumstances relief, where the states are supposed to put in an effort first - before they ask for Commonwealth assistance. Premier Bracks was rushing around Victoria telling everybody what he was going to do for drought-stricken farmers before the election. I have actually on occasions complimented Victoria for doing more than the other Labor states to provide help to drought-stricken farmers. But surely this is the lowest act of all. Immediately after the election, Premier Bracks walked away from the promised drought assistance and actually withdrew help that had previously been available to the farmers of Victoria.The farmers in the electorate of Cowper and around New South Wales will be listening very closely to the promises of Premier Carr. Only last week there was another dose of measures dressed up as drought assistance, only two of which actually provide any assistance to farmers. How long will those promises last? Labor has got form. The Victorian Labor Party's election promises lasted until just after the election. Any New South Wales farmer who is listening to the Carr election promises just needs to look at what has happened with Premier Bracks. The moment the election was over, what little assistance they were offering was withdrawn without any apology or sympathy. The reality is that Labor does not care about drought-affected farmers. They are not prepared to do anything. They have been lazy and slothful in the whole exercise. They are not prepared to provide any real support; it has all been empty.</DOC>

 - I am very glad to receive the honourable member's question. The final environmental impact statement has examined the transport options, and I am advised that transport by road was found to be the safest option for a number of reasons. The first and most important reason is the form and nature of that transportation. Low-level waste will consist of inert solids - the waste is produced in the form of solids - so there is no dust, there is no liquid and there is no possibility of spillage. That solid waste is surrounded by concrete and contained in steel drums, which are packed securely inside six-metre long steel shipping containers. There is no possibility of a spillage into waterways or along the transport route during transportation. Containers are designed to remain intact in the event of an accident. Also, some 30,000 packages of radioactive material are transported throughout Australia each year, in accordance with strict, internationally accepted guidelines, without mishap. In 40 years of transportation of radioactive material - the vast bulk of it by way of nuclear medicine requirements - there has not been an accident which has posed a threat to the environment or to life. - The other thing to take into account is that, during the first disposal - which is expected to be in 2004 - some 130 truckloads of waste will be moved from the Lucas Heights facility in Sydney to the repository. I believe it will be in Woomera, but we are still awaiting the Minister for the Environment and Heritage's final determination. That will be done over a period of a month, and it is not going to be a long convoy. Another 40 trucks will move waste stored throughout Australia. That will be a one-off disposal to clear the backlog of 40 years of accumulated low-level waste. There is a need for only 170 trucks. - Then, every two to five years, the repository will be opened to accept waste. It will be a relatively small amount - 40 cubic metres per year, of which 30 cubic metres is produced by ANSTO at Lucas Heights. So you are talking about a handful of semitrailers once the backlog is cleared. In the unlikely event of a serious accident, all states have emergency responses in place to deal with potential radiological incidents. In addition, the Commonwealth would be in a position to provide assistance on request from the states. The short answer to the honourable member's question is that transport of radioactive waste to the repository will be undertaken in a responsible manner, with no contamination risk to the public.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Farrer for her question. The member for Farrer and I travelled out to Jerilderie, two hours west of -  - You do not think it is important? - Jerilderie is a town that has been severely affected and impacted on by the drought, as have the irrigated areas adjoining it by the restriction in the water supply. On Friday, around half the town came out for a discussion about the benefits of tourism - which I understand is making a significant contribution to the income of the town during these very difficult times. It is not just drought that has affected significantly a lot of regional Australia; obviously, the bushfires have had an impact. - I hear the laughter from the Leader of the Opposition. The shadow Treasurer, along with a number of his colleagues, including the member for Canberra, came to see me the other day to talk about the impact of the bushfires on Canberra. We all agreed that we should do what we can to reassure those people who may be coming to Canberra that Canberra remains open for business and that the bushfires have not closed down certain bushfire-ravaged areas. Canberra is open for tourism and those people who do come here for business or on holidays and make a significant contribution to Canberra should not cancel bookings. That is a very important message to send to regional Australia. With a number of people, I will be heading to the areas of Jindabyne and the Snowy Mountains, which have been significantly impacted by the bushfires, on Thursday night. The Minister for Transport and Regional Services was there today. It is important to send a message to those people who have pre-booked conventions in and trips to those regions that these regions are still open for business.From a drought perspective, obviously it is vitally important that the support given by the federal government flow through to the farmers, but it is also important to understand that a number of small businesses in these towns rely on passing trade to help hold up the town. Whether it be the newsagent, whom we talked to, or the gift shops in Albury that rely on passing trade, when the farmers do not have the money in their pockets to hold up local shops, up to 40 per cent of the income of the small shops in those regional centres comes from passing trade and tourists, who bring money into the town. It is important during these times that we use the available mechanisms within government to try and promote this message to the wider Australian public. That is why we have asked See Australia, which is a Commonwealth-funded initiative, to start looking at opportunities - using Ernie Dingo, who is a well-recognised name around Australia - to promote as tourism destinations regional areas that are drought affected. I will be speaking to See Australia about using its existing resources to get together with local communities to send the message to promote bushfire-affected areas.There is still much to be done, but there is one message to bear in mind during this very difficult period. It comes from the owner of Kidman's Camp in Bourke, Peter Simmonds. He says:There is no doubt the drought is bringing them out here. Realistically, tourism is going to be Bourke's only industry this year, so god help those who don't help themselves.We are going to help these communities to help themselves, whether there be drought or bushfire. We will be working in partnership with state and local authorities to make sure that the message goes out to all Australians: do not cancel your holidays; still go out to these areas, because your contribution is vital to these areas during these difficult times.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Grey for his question. In his electorate on Australia Day there were several ceremonies that I know he was aware of and contributed to. In South Australia 700 new citizens joined the Australian family. Australia Day this year was one of our most successful ever, with some 8,400 new members of the Australian family signing up - almost 300 more than in 2002. There were 236 ceremonies this year - while there were just 220 last year - and all around Australia a record number of affirmation ceremonies took place, where Australians by birth and Australians by choice were able to join together and publicly offer a recommitment to Australia and its people and a pledge to maintain obedience to our laws and loyalty to this country.Citizenship and unity are perhaps even more important than ever at this time in our world's history. It is critical here in Australia that everyone seek opportunities to bring us all together inside the tent, to put out the hand of friendship, particularly toward some of the groups in our community who may be feeling a sense of pressure at this time. It is important that those of us, as members of parliament, who are leaders in the community go out of our way to reassure citizens within our wider community - and those who may soon be citizens - that they are very welcome in our local communities and indeed in our nation.Some of the initiatives of the Howard government over the last seven years are worth recounting for the record of the parliament. I guess the Prime Minister's decision to appoint for the first time ever in Australia's history a minister for citizenship is one. Being the person who received that title for the first time ever is obviously a matter of great pride for me, but the decision does actually signal the importance the government has placed on national unity in its agenda. The Australian Citizenship Legislation Amendment Act in March of last year, following the efforts of the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs over a number of years to allow dual citizenship for Australian nationals, was also a signal to the world of our maturity as a nation, demonstrating that we are willing to embrace those in our society - and there are some five million of us - who are both Australian citizens and citizens of other countries.The take-up rate for citizenship in this country has increased to over 75 per cent over the last couple of years as a result of our highly successful and award-winning promotion campaign that, again, has sent signals to all parts of our nation about the importance of working together as people of many backgrounds, beliefs and styles of dress. The introduction of the Let's participate: a course in Australian citizenship booklet has meant that prospective citizens have been able to learn about our national traditions, our civic traditions and, of course, our style of society. Citizenship education to schools under my 2030 program has meant that children all around this nation are able to actively participate in discussions in classrooms where teaching professionals are able to guide their young charges into this important area of national unity.Finally, there is an affirmation which has been introduced all around this country using similar language to our citizenship pledge. I believe it has really captured the imaginations of Australians of all backgrounds, providing a place where we can all stand together, united, with a sense of purpose and a sense of our own individual responsibilities for the future we all should share.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Maranoa for his question and his obvious concern on behalf of the beef producers and exporters not just in the seat of Maranoa but across Australia. As honourable members would know, Japan is our largest market for beef, taking about $1.3 billion worth each year. Australia and the United States are the two largest exporters of beef into Japan. Last year, following the BSE scares in Japan, there was a significant reduction in the consumption of red meat in Japan. As a result of a significant marketing effort by the Australian government, Meat and Livestock Australia and other exporters, we have managed to lift that back up to the standard levels of exports that we normally have into that country.Unfortunately, the Japanese government is considering applying what is called a snap back arrangement in terms of tariffs - that is, taking the tariff on imported beef from 38.5 per cent back up to 50 per cent, where it was before the finalisation of the negotiations of the Uruguay Round. We are currently actively working with those other exporting countries - the United States, New Zealand and Canada - in lobbying the Japanese government, in particular the ministers that we have direct relationships with, not to do this.The safeguard mechanism - which, I must say, is legal - out of the Uruguay Round is flawed because it is founded on a baseline of only 12 months of exports, not an average over two or three years. It is worth noting that this safeguard measure was agreed to in the Uruguay Round by the Labor Party when they were in office. As I said, it is flawed - instead of a natural increase in imports triggering this possible rise in tariffs, it is because the base was lowered last year due to the drop in consumption with the outbreak of BSE. The Japanese are arguing that because we have taken the level of exports back up to pre-2002 levels they are going to apply this extra 11.5 per cent. I will be in Japan at the end of this week, indeed on Friday, and I will be talking with USTR Ambassador Zoellick on the phone tomorrow. We will be doing everything we possibly can to convince the Japanese government that this is not fair. We will be seeking to change this during the current Doha Round of multilateral negotiations.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Hinkler for his question. The Prime Minister is in Washington, although at about this time he is to move to New York. He has had extensive meetings with the Secretary of State, Colin Powell; the Secretary of Defense, Donald Rumsfeld; and President Bush. I should say at the outset that the Prime Minister has taken this opportunity to convey Australia's position, including the government's very strong preference for a second United Nations resolution - although it could be said that it is more than a second resolution. Indeed, in general terms, the UN's resolution to see Iraq dealt with and its weapons of mass destruction removed now dates back some 12 years, which is a very long period of time.That is Australia's primary objective, and I take it that it is the United Nations' primary objective, America's primary objective and possibly even the Leader of the Opposition's primary objective to see Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction removed. That ought to be the focus of this debate, and it ought to be the focus of the ALP's endeavours, policy debates and prescriptions in this place. The central issue is the disarming of a man heading up a regime that is very unfortunate in terms of the way that it interacts with its own people and its neighbours and which poses a real threat to people around the globe, including Australians, potentially now and in the future. These are the issues that the ALP ought to be focusing on. Yet, we see in this debate precious little reference to the major subject of the Prime Minister's discussions in Washington and New York and almost no mention of the Prime Minister of Great Britain's attitudes and strong resolution.In his time with President Bush, the Prime Minister was able to discuss quite a range of issues. One was free trade, about which the Prime Minister indicated that, while there are some real issues to overcome - as the Minister for Trade would be only too ready to acknowledge - there is a real resolution from America to resolve this matter and move it forward. There were discussions on climate change, on education and on the need to assure Indonesia on the Prime Minister's trip home that our objectives in Iraq relate to the removal of weapons of mass destruction; they do not relate to an attack, in any way, on Islam, the Muslim faith or people of that faith. The point has been clearly made again by the Prime Minister in Washington that Australia has not made any decision to join in any military action against Iraq. The United States government plainly understands that, because it has been made clear, both in public and private discussions, by the Prime Minister in those meetings in Washington. What ought to be clearly focused upon and not lost sight of is that we believe that the United Nations 12-year-old efforts to rid Saddam Hussein of weapons of mass destruction are laudable and achievable and that we must be united in our objective to achieve that end result. It is worth noting that the Prime Minister made the following comments in a joint press conference with the US Secretary of Defense, Donald Rumsfeld:We hope that military conflict can be avoided.We do; of course we do. But he went on to say:It can only be avoided ... that can only happen if you get the entire world, through the United Nations, saying the one thing to Iraq: the game is up. You must disarm.And that has been the central objective of the Prime Minister's discussions in Washington.</DOC>

 - I can confirm that the coalition of the willing comprises those who are keen to see Saddam Hussein stripped of his weapons of mass destruction. In that sense, I would hope that we are all willing to do what we can. We have made it very plain, and nothing should be allowed to hide, obscure or disguise the simple reality, that our primary objective is to seek that disarmament, preferably under the cover of further support from the United Nations. Furthermore, we have made it very plain to the Americans that no commitment has been made by the Australian government and that proper process would be followed before any decision was made on any course of action.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Wentworth for his question. I recognise the serious interest he shows in this issue and the commitment he has to seeing Saddam Hussein disarmed of weapons of mass destruction. During the night, Iraq announced that U2 spy plane flights within Iraq would be allowed, and the Iraqi regime also handed over some documentation to UN inspectors. Let me remind the House that Saddam Hussein has a requirement to disarm and has a requirement to do so consistent with Security Council resolutions - that is, to verify disarmament and to work with and fully cooperate with United Nations inspectors, UNMOVIC and the International Atomic Energy Agency, the IAEA. He has an obligation to allow the U2 flights and he has an obligation to hand over documentation.The issue here is whether or not Iraq is fully complying with Security Council resolution 1441; whether or not it is cooperating 100 per cent with the United Nations inspectors. That is the key issue. A little bit more cooperation here and a little less cooperation there is not the issue. The issue is: is there 100 per cent cooperation? Are Security Council resolutions being adhered to or are they not? The process is not about Iraq making grudging concessions and small gestures. It is about Saddam Hussein and his regime answering questions about his programs. It is about Iraq's efforts to produce VX, one of the world's most lethal agents. It is about Iraq's failure to explain gaps in the accounting of 6,500 chemical munitions. It is about unaccounted-for biological growth material which could be used in the production of up to 5,000 litres of anthrax, and it is about the production of missiles with a range which exceeds that allowed by the United Nations. It is important that this House understand that Saddam Hussein has a long history of making last-minute concessions designed to divide the international community and to coax it into a false sense of security. We should never ignore the lessons of history. In 1997, in response to yet another round of Iraqi non-cooperation with inspectors, the Security Council passed resolution 1134, but that resolution was significantly weakened by the abstention of a number of members of the Security Council. Encouraged by these divisions, Iraq announced just days after the adoption of the resolution that it would not deal at all with weapons inspections. Only when faced with the threat of military force did Iraq agree to resume cooperation, in a deal that honourable members may recall was brokered by the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Kofi Annan.The story did not, unfortunately, finish there. Less than six months later, Iraq again suspended cooperation, which led to a new Security Council resolution, passed on 9 September 1998 - resolution 1194. This time, it condemned noncooperation but it promised a review of the whole disarmament process, which of course was one of Iraq's key demands at the time. A day after the council agreed to conduct this review, Iraq -  sensing divisions in the international community - again suspended cooperation with UN inspectors. Again, the threat of force compelled Baghdad to renew cooperation, but again that was short-lived. Honourable members may have forgotten, but in November 1998 the United States and the United Kingdom launched Operation Desert Fox against the Iraqi regime. We should understand what we are dealing with. We are dealing today with the same dictator, employing the same tactics, in possession of the same weapons and weapons systems.

 - In answer to the honourable member's question, I firstly make the point that we have been completely forthright with the Australian people on this. That is really the simple fact of the matter. - If by `the coalition of the willing' you mean have we been prepared to participate as a supporter of the United Nations in applying pressure to Iraq to disarm, yes, we have. The very Secretary-General of the UN has acknowledged that that pressure has helped, that the inspectors would not be back in Iraq if we had not been prepared, as a global community - if you like, the coalition of the willing - to apply pressure. But does that then mean that we have made some secret commitment to war? No, it does not. The President of the United States himself is obviously well aware of that, because the actual transcript of the interview today is quite revealing. The President was asked, `Do you count Australia as part of the coalition of the willing?' The President said:Yes, I do.But, he went on to say:You know, what that means is up to John - that is, the Prime Minister, and the government of Australia -  to decide.He had plainly recognised the Prime Minister's repeated, clear indication that no commitment to military action has been undertaken or made by the Australian government.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for MacKellar for the question. I can inform her, of course, that this government has been committed to strengthening Australia's Defence Force and Australia's security. She would know that, as a person who has been very intimately and closely connected with Australia's defence forces over a number of years. In addition to normal base funding for Australia's defence forces, with this government's commitment to East Timor commencing in 1999-2000 the government committed an additional nearly $1 billion per annum to secure our defence forces in East Timor - a commitment which is still continuing to this day with Australian forces in East Timor and with costs allowed in the current budget year of nearly half a billion dollars in addition to the normal forward estimates. After that, commencing in December 2000, the government laid down a white paper which put out a program for over 10 years: an increase of $27 billion in relation to defence over and above the normal forward estimates and the East Timor commitment. In addition to that, after East Timor and the white paper the government committed in 2001-02 and in the current budget year an additional $523 million to support Australia's contribution to the war against terrorism in Afghanistan and the Persian Gulf.In addition to East Timor, the white paper and the war against terrorism, the government has recently announced an additional predeployment of ADF personnel to the Middle East. I can advise the House that, this morning, the Minister for Defence and the Chief of Army farewelled the Australian Army's 5th Aviation Regiment. The soldiers and the Chinook helicopters are part of the Special Task Force Group. About half the personnel deploying under Operation Bastille have left Australia, with the rest due to leave within two weeks. Funding for the pre-positioning of defence units in the Middle East is currently being met within Defence's existing resources, but the government has indicated that there will be supplementation to cover those predeployment costs and any other costs which are involved. Planning for these operations obviously depends on the way in which things develop with the predeployment, but it could be a significant commitment, which I have previously indicated, of the order of hundreds of millions of dollars - in addition to base funding, the white paper, the war on terror and the East Timor commitment.Obviously, that adds up to a very large sum which this government has invested in defence and security but, from the government's point of view, there is no more important function for an Australian government than defence and security. Particularly at a time like now, when security has been shown to be a matter of interest to all Australians, all Australians need to know that their government is leaving no stone unturned in the fight against potential terrorist attacks - some of which, unfortunately, we have seen in the past. The consequence of this, as we run up to this year's budget, is that defence will be taking priority over other plans or programs that otherwise may have been considered. This is an investment in Australia's strength, in Australia's security. We are fortunate that our economy has been strong enough to sustain this additional expenditure over the course of previous years and, unlike other Western and developed countries, has not been running into significant budget deficits as we fund a build-up in defence and security. A strong economy is part of a strong Defence Force. This government is committed to a strong Defence Force and to securing the wellbeing of all Australians in its effort to strengthen Australia's security. </DOC>

 - First of all, I thank the honourable member for Indi for her question. I know that on this side of the House there are deep concerns about the human rights record of Saddam Hussein and his regime, and the member for Indi is one of those who shares those deep concerns. I have spoken in answer to questions both yesterday and last week about the government's deep concerns about Saddam Hussein's gruesome history of systematic and egregious human rights abuses. This simply underlines the type of regime and the nature of the leader of that regime that the international community is dealing with at this time. Like Iraqis generally, women are subject to a range of degrading human rights abuses, such as prolonged imprisonment without trial, forced resettlement, torture, and of course disappearance, as I spoke about yesterday. But women also are subject to particularly vile forms of abuse, such as rape and executions without trial due to accusations of, for example, prostitution.The Iraqi regime's treatment of women would, I think, shock any decent human being. We are not seeing just isolated incidents. This abuse of women in Iraq constitutes part of Saddam Hussein's policy of political oppression by brutality. So many cases of human rights abuse in Iraq are related directly to Saddam Hussein's determination to hang onto power by violent means. Let me give the House just a couple of examples that have been highlighted by Amnesty International's report on Saddam Hussein's human rights record. These examples are recent examples; these are not incidents that occurred a long time ago. In October 2000 - that is, not much more than two years ago - dozens of women accused of prostitution were beheaded without judicial processes. The killings were reportedly carried out in the presence of representatives of the Ba'ath Socialist Party and the Iraqi Women's General Union. Members of Feddayi Saddam, which is a militia created in 1994 by Uday Saddam Hussein, used swords to execute the victims in front of their homes. Victims reportedly were also killed for political reasons. We also know that women have been raped in custody. Some have been detained and tortured because they were relatives of well-known Iraqi opposition activists. The security authorities used this method to put pressure on Iraqi nationals abroad to cease their activities. - For example, in 2000 a former army general who fled Iraq in 1995 and joined the Iraqi opposition was sent a videotape showing the rape of a female relative. We know from these examples and from Iraq's political system - which is, of course, dominated by Saddam Hussein himself - that the appalling treatment of women is systemic and that treatment comes right from the top. We cannot remind ourselves often enough why the international community - and I think this is an absolutely fundamental question - should deny somebody who behaves in this way, who treats women and his population generally in such an appalling way -  - The consequences of somebody like that having chemical and biological weapons and perhaps even nuclear weapons is not a minor issue. There are an enormous number of interjections, I find, whenever you talk about these issues, as though Saddam Hussein does not matter. But I do think this obviously is a difference between the two sides of the House. We on this side of the House feel very strongly about this; it is a profoundly important issue. For those on that side of the House it is, apparently, a matter for almost constant chatter.</DOC>

 - I think I have made it quite plain that, in terms of our willingness to support the UN in its objectives of disarming Iraq and stripping it of its weapons of mass destruction, we do not hide at all the fact that we have been part of the coalition of the willing - part of that coalition of nations prepared to tackle this issue and try to take it forward. It has also been made adequately plain that that does not mean that we have committed to military action. I, again, quote the US President in the press conference that followed the leader to leader meeting - that is, after all, the most high level and most recent of these discussions and could not possibly more accurately reflect the situation. When asked whether he counted Australia as part of the coalition of the willing, the President said:Yes I do. You know, what that means is up to John to decide.That is a clear acknowledgment. It may not suit you, but it is a clear acknowledgment that Deputy Secretary of State, Richard Armitage, was right when he said just yesterday:A decision from Canberra to support the US in any conflict with Iraq would be enormously important and I hope that at some point in time the government would take such a decision.Mr Armitage acknowledged yesterday that we had taken no such decision and the President of the United States today has acknowledged precisely the same point: we have not made a decision. It is our sovereign right to decide what any involvement in the coalition of the willing might involve in the future and that is the reality of the situation.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. The Prime Minister has had valuable meetings in New York with Secretary-General Annan and the United Nations chief weapons inspector, Dr Blix. He has taken this opportunity to again convey Australia's support for the United Nations process, the need for the Security Council to live up to its responsibilities and this government's strong support for a further resolution. As the Prime Minister has noted, Dr Blix's report to the Security Council on Friday is now the next critical step in this whole process.It is very important to focus on the real issue of substance here, which is the destruction of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. Iraq, for 12 long years, has failed to demonstrate any real willingness to cooperate with the United Nations on its disarmament obligations. While Iraq has made some limited concessions to the inspectors, it would still appear that it fails to understand that it must disarm, and disarm now. We need to remember that the government's objective is the disarmament of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. The obstacle to achieving that goal - what ought to be the focus of our debate in this place - is Iraq's failure to change its attitude towards cooperation with the United Nations. After 12 long years and many United Nations resolutions, resolution 1441 provided Iraq with one last chance to comply with its international obligations. Iraq's failure to cooperate cannot be remedied by more inspectors or more time; Iraq must change its attitude. That is the point that needs to be made here. It has been said - I think by the Prime Minister - that this issue is coming to a head. We are reaching the end of the game.The international community has very good reason to be sceptical of any last-minute offers from this master chess player. Saddam Hussein has a long history of making small concessions at the eleventh hour in his dealings with the United Nations and the international community. Throwing a few morsels at one minute to midnight is not being real about this process. These concessions have never previously led to complete Iraqi cooperation. What little Iraq has yielded up has been the result only of concerted pressure, and the international community cannot allow itself to be fooled or tricked by Iraq into letting it retain its weapons of mass destruction.The elimination of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction program is critical to the security of the international community, including this nation. The latest disturbing tape attributed to Osama bin Laden underlines the urgency of ensuring that weapons of mass destruction developed by rogue states do not fall into the hands of terrorists. The proliferation of rogue states that could blackmail the international community with weapons of mass destruction would be disastrous. The ultimate nightmare would be for those horrendous weapons to pass into the hands of terrorists, who would not hesitate to use them.Let me come back to what ought to be the focus of our debate in this place, and I hope that perhaps this afternoon it might be: the UN Security Council must live up to its responsibility for maintaining international peace and security. The Security Council and the UN would be seriously damaged if they failed in the end to enforce the requirements of their own resolution 1441. It is important, too, that the Security Council show unity of purpose on Iraq, as Iraq will otherwise unquestionably exploit divisions in the views of the international community.</DOC>

 - The Leader of the Opposition knows full well that I am a member of the National Security Committee. He knows full well, too, that we do not reveal discussions around the cabinet table. I have indicated to him that, if there is further information that might be legitimately provided because it is in the national interest, I will do so. But, beyond that, the only comment I make is the obvious one, that from time to time and on a regular basis we consult with our allies around the world on military, strategic and security matters. No-one ought to be surprised by that in any way, shape or form. We have been absolutely open with the Australian people in referring to the fact that we have been engaging in contingency planning in relation to our objective. Let me remind you again that our objective - which we hope you share but about which you have had almost nothing to say - is to rid this man of his weapons of mass destruction in the interests of the security of Australians and the global community now and in the future.</DOC>

 - First, can I thank the honourable member for La Trobe for his question and, if I may say so, the interest that he has shown in the question of North Korea. I appreciate very much that there are some members of the House who have a very real and important interest in this. Let us be clear on two points. First, North Korea's decision to pursue a nuclear weapons program is a matter of deep concern not just to Australia but, much more broadly, to the regional and international community. We do see it as a serious threat to regional security. Second, since October Australia has played an active role - we ought to and we have - in international efforts to find a diplomatic solution to the North Korean nuclear situation.In January I sent a delegation of senior officials to Pyongyang. They had extensive discussions over a period, from recollection, of around 11 hours with North Korean senior officials, including 80 minutes with the North Korean foreign minister, Foreign Minister Paek. The delegation obviously registered the concerns of Australia and the broader international community about North Korea's behaviour - in particular, the expulsion of the IAEA inspectors, the steps taken to reactivate its nuclear program and, above all, perhaps most serious of all, the announcement that it would withdraw from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. When the delegation returned, it brought with it some messages. It was clear from what the delegation heard, particularly from Foreign Minister Paek, that there was to be a focus from North Korea's side on bilateral discussions with the United States. Our delegation explained to the North Koreans that, whilst North Korea may want some kind of security undertaking in writing from the United States, in an environment of a negotiation with the United States they would have to make a commitment to abandon their nuclear ambitions. At first, I think the North Koreans were somewhat resistant to that, but Foreign Minister Paek did send a message that he understood that there was a need for arrangements on both sides.After that visit I spoke with Secretary Powell of the United States and the foreign ministers of South Korea and Japan. Subsequently, when I was in Europe, I was able to discuss this issue further with the EU foreign policy leadership as well as the foreign ministers of Germany and France. In Europe there is a very real interest in and concern about this issue, and I was pleased about that. As the House knows, this is an important issue for the Prime Minister's current travel overseas.Today the International Atomic Energy Agency's Board of Governors, of which Australia is a member, meets. One of the issues that will be addressed is North Korea's noncompliance with its MPT safeguards agreement and other arrangements. The Board of Governors will have to consider whether this matter should be sent to the Security Council. The Security Council will have to consider, in turn, how to deal with this problem of North Korea. Obviously that is a sensitive matter. Coming out of the delegation visit by the Australian team, and from other contacts that other countries had with North Korea, the international community put forward a proposal to North Korea that there should be a so-called five plus five dialogue - that is, the five permanent representatives of the Security Council plus South Korea, Japan, the European Union, Australia and the DPRK itself. I regret very much that the North Koreans rejected that proposal and have simply maintained the position that the only dialogue they will accept is bilateral dialogue.Having said that, Australia has said to the United States that we think that in the end they will have to accept that there must be a bilateral dialogue between North Korea and the United States. It is a point I have made to Secretary Powell on occasions. I was pleased to see the other day that the Americans said publicly - not just privately, because privately they have been quite responsive to that point - that they would, at an appropriate time and in appropriate circumstances, be prepared to enter into a bilateral dialogue with North Korea. This is an enormously important issue. It is one that we are playing a significant role in and are trying to work through. It is appropriate that Australia should do that, as a significant country in the Asia-Pacific. We will continue to work at trying to find a constructive outcome to the problem of North Korea.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. I say to him - and I cannot answer for what goes on in the Security Council -  - I am not a member of the Security Council. This matter, regarding the question of the anthrax injection, has been addressed at length this morning in the Senate estimates process. The timetable for immunising our deploying troops is for the commanding officers of the units to decide, based on threat assessments by the defence organisation and the requirement for each individual to receive information on the immunisation regime. I would like to ask exactly what Labor's point is here. Would they prefer us to not take measures to protect the health of our ADF personnel?</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kooyong for his question and the interest he has shown in the launch of the government's white paper on foreign and trade policy. I know that the Minister for Trade is hoping that someone will ask him a question about the trade side of the white paper. We will have to wait and see whether anyone does, but I am pretty confident it will not be the Labor Party.The white paper demonstrates a simple point, and that is: Australians have every reason to be confident about our country's standing in the world. Our interests are global; they are not solely geographic. Our security and prosperity depend on the quality and strength of the political, economic and defence links that we maintain around the world. I think it is fair to say that those links are very strong. They have been very creative and they have been very productive, but it is true that, as we say in the white paper, Australia cannot afford to be complacent. It is a very uncertain world. I think what happened in Bali on 12 October, as well as the crisis over Iraq and the problems with North Korea, simply illustrates that point very clearly. The fact is that globalisation has been very successful for Australia because we have structured our economy well in order to deal with it, but it does bring major challenges. Let us face it, it is true to say that one of the things that has been globalised has been terrorism.We give a lot of priority in the white paper to counter-terrorism and to dealing with the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and, in doing that, we make no apology for working with key partners, with countries like the United States. It is the world's most powerful country. No nation on earth would dispute that - some resent it, but none would dispute it. We work very closely with the United States of America and, of course, many other partners, including, importantly, our regional partners, in addressing issues both of terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.The white paper makes the point, as any Australian government document on foreign and trade policy would, that our relationship with Asia is an abiding priority. I make this point to the House because there is sometimes debate about the importance of Asia or the emphasis that the government places on relations with Asia: if you take the seven years this government has been in office, our trade with Asia has grown somewhere between 30 and 40 per cent. We have never had more trade with Asia than we have had over the last year or so - never. We have more students from Asia studying in Australia now than ever before. We have enormous numbers of students from Asia studying here. It is a great credit to our universities. I notice that our minister for education, who has been such a champion of this, is nodding his head. It has been an enormous success for us over the last seven years, so this engagement with Asia continues to grow.I think one of the great symbols of our successful engagement with Asia, by the way, was Australia winning its largest ever export contract with China, the LNG export contract. That was a tribute not just to our business people - and it was partly a tribute to them - but to the Prime Minister and other ministers who worked so hard on the political relationship with China that made that possible. I am sure in time the history of that particular event will be written, possibly one day by the Minister for Trade himself. - No, he could do it himself. We make no apology for our close ties with the United States of America. On this side of the House, we are not ashamed of that. We work very closely with the United States. We do have very close personal relationships with the leadership of the United States, and that was illustrated very clearly this week by the Prime Minister's visit to Washington. We make no apology for that. Australia is a significant country, but it is not one of the most powerful countries on earth. The United States is by far the world's most powerful nation. The fact that we have easy access to the United States and are able to work closely with them on great global economic and security issues is an enormous advantage for Australia. I know, as the foreign minister of this country, that many nations around the world envy the closeness of our relationship with the United States.It does not mean we always agree with them. We do often; we do not always. We do not agree with them on some trade issues. We disagreed with them on their approach to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, the biological weapons convention additional protocol and some of the multilateral arms control and disarmament instruments. Sure, there have been points of disagreement but, at least, because of the closeness of our relationship, we are able to sit down with them, we are able to put our case, we get heard and we have often been able to benefit very substantially in terms of our national interests from that close relationship. No-one on this side of the House walks away from the fact that the security relationship with the United States underwrites Australia's security in a very unstable world. If you were to put the argument the other way around - as some on the other side of the House may wish to - that we should sever our ties with the United States, I think that would cause enormous insecurity and uncertainty in the Australian community. We make no apology for our strong relationship with the United States. It is in our interests that we maintain that relationship.Let me conclude by making one other point. It would be a long time since I was asked a question by anyone in the opposition about the issue of the South Pacific. The South Pacific is a very important component of our foreign policy. We put a lot of aid into the South Pacific. We have played a very significant role in trying to address the problems of the South Pacific, not just of an economic kind but of a political kind. -  - Opposition members interject, but they never ask questions about these issues, which seems to suggest that they do not actually seriously regard them as remotely important - as they don't most foreign policy issues.It is with pleasure that I table for the House the white paper on foreign and trade policy. I table the full copy of the document that I know coalition members would like to read. Let me also table an abridged summary, which members of the opposition might find possible to read.</DOC>

 - You ask questions about the National Security Committee. With all due respect to the minister, as the Leader of the Opposition well knows the minister in question is not privy to what happens in cabinet, around the cabinet table or at meetings with the National Security Committee, and I do not believe it is reasonable to put her in a position where she has to purport to be able to speak for them. - The first point that ought to be made is that there is no doubt about the Leader of the Opposition: by sins of omission and commission, he continues to misrepresent, just as he did in this place yesterday when he claimed - and he allowed this misrepresentation to stand - that the Prime Minister had not clearly indicated to the departing forces, at the very departure presentation that he was present at in Sydney, that there was the potential for them to be involved in further actions in the Middle East. I corrected that in this place and he has allowed the misrepresentation to stand. - The attempt to misrepresent the situation continues by implying that the National Security Committee somehow authorised military action which would have precipitated or made necessary a decision to inoculate troops and those other personnel who might be going to the Middle East at some stage last year. This is a further attempt - you can see where it is going - to imply that there has been a conspiracy and that, in reality, we have already made a commitment. -  - Yes, thank you. Confirmed. The sins of omission and commission continue, because in Senate estimates this morning, General Cosgrove made it very plain indeed - and I will quote his words in a moment - that it was determined by the military to engage in discussions with the Americans so that they knew what the Americans were talking about, what contingencies they might be developing. I would have thought all Australians would have recognised that that was a legitimate thing for us to be doing on an ongoing basis. General Cosgrove made these comments - I am quoting:The military officers sent -  -  - Mr Speaker, they claim it is important. They claim it goes to the matter of their concern for the troops of Australia. Their real objective here is to build a case to support their conspiracy theory, which does not stand up. It is that case that I am seeking to demolish now, and they do not want to hear the demolition of it. That is the truth. What about the troops? Listen to what the commander of the troops had to say in Senate estimates this morning. - In relation to any so-called commitment by the Australian government or the military to action in the Middle East, he said:The military officers sent forward were clearly aware themselves not to commit or to suggest commitment by Australian troops, nor to encourage that perception amongst allies.In the same way that you yesterday misrepresented the Prime Minister in relation to his being forthright with forces going to -  - It is particularly relevant inasmuch as the Leader of the Opposition, just a moment ago, confirmed that the question was about trying to establish their conspiracy theory. He himself, out of his own words, established the relevance of the points that I was seeking to make. - Mr Speaker, let me make this quite plain. The government will always do everything we can to ensure that our military are as well prepared and protected as possible for any potential action. But let me also make it quite plain that the very military personnel that we say we respect, and that you at least pay lip-service to, are themselves responsible for making decisions about how to ensure the maximisation of the safety of our fighting personnel.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Cook for his question. I know that since entering the parliament he has been very interested through, and productive in, his contributions to the development of Australia's trade policy as it stands today, and as was published today in the white paper tabled by the foreign minister a while ago.The white paper, entitled Advancing the national interest, presents a comprehensive explanation of the most ambitious trade agenda of any government in Australia's history in terms of the articulation of our pursuits in the multilateral arena, our pursuits in the regional arena and our pursuits bilaterally in covering all aspects of opportunities that are out there for Australia's exporters. It articulates the policy approach the coalition government has adopted post Seattle: the policy approach of competitive liberalisation. We aim to pursue our objectives in the multilateral Doha round, which we see as our number one trade objective. We identify the Doha round of negotiations currently under way as being the best opportunity to secure the interests of Australia's exporters as a trading nation for the future. At the same time, we are prepared to engage bilaterally in negotiations; negotiations such as the free trade agreements that we have concluded with Singapore and that I will be signing with the Singaporean government next week; negotiations that we are about to embark upon with the United States of America; and negotiations that are under way with one of our near neighbours - Thailand.We have articulated that we need to be pragmatic in our approach to trade policy in an ever changing world, both in terms of the structure of global trade and the stature of the global economy. In recent years we have maintained a steady and stable approach, because of our economic policy settings in Australia, through the Asian economic recession and, more recently, in the global slowdown post September 11. We need to be pragmatic in our approach; we cannot get locked away in policy settings of the past. We need to provide every opportunity we can as far as Australian exporters are concerned - multilaterally, regionally and bilaterally. The white paper clearly outlines how we propose to achieve that and how we propose to pursue that.Already, Australia's exporters are reaping the benefits of these policy settings and there will be more to come. We are going to pursue the multilateral objectives through the Doha round at the end of this week. I will be participating in a mini ministerial meeting of WTO ministers in Tokyo.The key objective of our government - and, presumably, of the Labor Party on the other side, seeing as they have the multilateral round as their number one goal - will be the centrality of agriculture and the pursuit of an improvement in trading circumstances for agriculture. Agriculture, Mr Speaker, as I am sure you would agree, is the most important element, the most important ingredient, for a successful outcome in the Doha round. That is our key objective. We will be pursuing that, as well as our bilateral agenda.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. What I can tell the House - and I think this is significant - is that on 11 January, the day after the Prime Minister indicated that there may be predeployments, Senator Hill said:...any forces that may be in an area of operations in which the threat scenario would suggest anthrax is a problem, will be fully inoculated.Insofar as the question goes to the government's concern for the wellbeing of our personnel in areas of high risk, the government has made it quite plain that we understand the need to look after them. As I said in answer to my earlier question, however, operational matters -  - Mr Speaker, is there an interest in the answer or not? - There is? - The question as to actual arrangements for inoculation, the decisions as to what sorts of inoculations ought to be made and so forth are a matter for the defence forces and the CDF. - Plainly, in the Senate during Senate estimates, the ALP has had ample opportunity to quiz the CDF on this matter. I think, really, the point remains that, consistent with his need to look to issues of national security in terms of what is disclosed, those sorts of questions clearly belong to the military.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Page for his question and for his interest. As the House will increasingly be aware, a taped statement purportedly from Osama bin Laden was broadcast on al-Jazeera earlier this morning our time. The statement has been carefully looked at and analysed by experts in the intelligence community, but the early indications from our intelligence community are that this is probably an authentic statement - that is, it is probably a statement made by Osama bin Laden. It sounds like him and, not surprisingly, it contains the usual poisonous anti-Western rantings and conspiracy theories that we have come to expect from Osama bin Laden.This latest statement does contain some very disturbing words. It reinforces this government's concern, if ever reinforcement were needed, that if weapons of mass destruction were to fall into the hands of terrorists this would have devastating consequences for global security. The statement also makes it clear that bin Laden considers, to use an old phrase, that the enemies of his enemies are his friends. It is often said, and understandably so, that Saddam Hussein is a secularist or a socialist - the opposition will know that term - and that, more to the point, Osama bin Laden does not claim to believe in those ideologies. Osama bin Laden is obviously a religious fundamentalist and a religious fanatic, so it is argued from time to time that those two ideologies do not necessarily go together. I can understand that argument. But it is also true that if this tape is genuine - and I qualify my remarks; we think it is genuine but we are not sure - it simply reinforces the view that Osama bin Laden does apply the principle that `the enemy of my enemy is my friend'. This therefore enhances the danger of weapons of mass destruction falling into the hands of a terrorist organisation, not just the terrorist organisations that Saddam Hussein has well-known connections with but possibly an organisation like bin Laden's al-Qaeda.We know that the disarmament of Iraq would reduce the chance of weapons of mass destruction getting into terrorist hands and threatening Australia as well as other parts of the world. The international community knows that. At this time of heightened anxiety, statements like the statement of Osama bin Laden must be completely condemned. He must and he will be held to account for the threat he presents to the civilised world. The government will be assiduous in ensuring that Australians are made aware of any specific threats against us, in particular on the front line of our interests at home and in South-East Asia. As we all know, Australia remains on a heightened sense of alert. But we are resolute in our efforts to pursue the fight against terrorists and prevent those individuals from inflicting harm on Australians.Osama bin Laden claims in this statement to be passing on some lessons that al-Qaeda learnt from Afghanistan. I believe the most important lesson to be learnt from Afghanistan is that al-Qaeda and the Taliban were defeated. This statement, like previous ones from al-Qaeda, only reinforces our determination to be successful in the campaign against terrorism and to eliminate weapons of mass destruction from rogue states.</DOC>

 - I am aware of no security concerns in that area. - I am aware of no specific examples of that. If the spokesman for the other side has something that he thinks in the interests of national security ought to be made known, I suggest to him that there are very responsible ways of bringing that to our attention.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Wannon for his question. I was genuinely surprised to read in the newspaper yesterday that it was being alleged that in early 2000 the Financial Sector Advisory Council, FSAC, gave a warning to me about troubles in HIH. That caused me to investigate the source of this particular allegation to find out who had made it. The person who has apparently made such an allegation is none other than the member for Fraser, the shadow Treasurer. The shadow Treasurer has apparently written to the royal commission saying that he has heard from a person, whom he does not name and who has produced no documentary evidence to him, with an uncorroborated statement that 12 months ago the Financial Sector Advisory Council gave such a warning.This is very curious, because the royal commission has now had 220 days of hearings. The member for Fraser did not see fit during any part of any one of those hearings to name this secret source and give the source the opportunity to give evidence in the royal commission - not once in 220 days. He wrote when it was finished. In addition to that, the parliament has sat in question time for about 75 days during last year and this year, which has given the member for Fraser about 700 questions of opportunity to ask me about this allegation. I have been sitting here - Wednesday of last week, Thursday of last week et cetera - waiting for the member for Fraser, who is studiously ignoring what is going on at the moment, to rise on his crutches and ask me whether or not this allegation that he put to the royal commission was true. If he had asked me whether or not it was true, it would have been a very simple matter, because I would have informed him, as he knows, that FSAC gave no such warning to me about HIH in early 2000 or indeed to the Treasury. But if he really wanted to make his allegation stick, he could have gone to FSAC itself - which the Treasury in fact did on 6 February, assuming that he was going to raise this in the parliament. We asked FSAC if we had missed something, if they had given some elliptical warning which we had not understood and whether they could please confirm when it was made. I table a letter from the Treasury to the Chairman of the Financial Sector Advisory Council, dated 6 February, and I table the reply which came from Mr Maurice Newman on 6 February 2003 in which he confirms:... to the best of my knowledge and belief, and after reviewing my own records, no advice or information was provided by the Financial Sector Advisory Council to Treasury or the Treasurer during the relevant period ...None was received; none was given. No allegations were put during the 220 sitting days of the royal commission. Not one question in 700 questions was actually put so that this matter could be dealt with. What we have is the member for Fraser slinking around the press gallery asking, `When did you know and when did you hear it?' Does this bring to mind any recollections of other members of the opposition slinking around and asking, `When did you know and when did you hear it?' Rather than getting to his feet and being interested enough in the issue to ask one question in 700, he goes slinking around the press gallery, not having the guts to actually ask the question, and trying to find journalists who will peddle this misinformation. This government called the royal commission into HIH. We have fully cooperated with it, and we will provide it with any of the information that is required. If you had the courage of your convictions you would have done exactly the same thing. It is a cheap little stunt from somebody who is not worthy to be a shadow Treasurer.</DOC>

 - The reality is that the information we are providing to the Australian community about terrorism has been widely welcomed. It is recognised as quality information and it is recognised as a worthwhile exercise -  - for around a buck for every Australian. I can only say to you that I hope you never have to eat your words because an Australian somewhere picked something up or noticed something they might not otherwise have noticed, knew who to report it to and thus prevented a very awkward situation. - No, I have not. I was coming to those very issues that he raised, because they are important and relevant. As was very widely publicised at the time, we have essentially knocked together a plan which will be coming forward in the form of legislation. I hope it will be supported in this place, for it is a very substantial increase in screening and security at the nation's airports. All transport areas are under constant review, and we constantly respond to the latest risk assessments and advice on how to raise, and when it is necessary to raise, security levels. In relation to your two airports, they clearly fall into that category where the risk assessment provided to us indicates that only certain amounts of further security measures are needed. That is well known and has been well canvassed. The point is that we made it clear to those airports that if they wished to participate in upgrading security they could. - I was under the impression that these were serious issues and I was prepared to give it a serious answer. - Both airports have been given the opportunity to participate, if they so choose, in the new upgraded security arrangements. The cost is relatively modest. As the tourism industry put it the other day, it amounts to about the cost of a cup of coffee for peace of mind, if you are worried about it. One of your airports, as I recall, has said that it will participate. The other has chosen, on the risk assessments, not to do so.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Makin for seeking information in relation to Afghans in particular, and in relation to the government's success in dealing with unauthorised arrivals and abuse of the asylum system. It is important from time to time to get some accurate information in relation to these matters. I noticed, in some rather noisy interjections in relation to comment from the foreign minister, that people have assumed that little has been done to help Iraqi asylum seekers over a period of time and have failed to recognise that Australia has an ongoing program to assist people in Iraq who have been so adversely affected by the policies of Saddam Hussein.I simply make the point that some 4,000 people from Iraq have had temporary protection visas from Australia in the last four years. Something in the order of 4,000 people have been resettled under the orderly refugee and humanitarian program. In other words, in that period of time some 8,000 Iraqi people have been accommodated by Australia through the protection given to temporary protection visa holders and those who come through the normal program.More importantly, in relation to Afghanistan, let me say that Australia is proud of the success that it has achieved in dealing with this issue. Something of the order of 2¼ million people have returned to Afghanistan through our participation in assisting to create a climate in which that can happen. Of course, the UNHCR called for governments to provide financial assistance to Afghans who wish to return. Australia is providing significant assistance to help such people. We pay for travel documentation, fares, reception and counselling, and there is a cash payment of $2,000 per individual and up to $10,000 per family. To date, some 350 people have returned under those arrangements not only from Australia but also from offshore centres where Australia has been aiding in processing and effecting returns. Another 200 have accepted the offer and will shortly be going home. The package has obviously been well received. I noticed that there were some observations - I think they were from the member for Fremantle - that suggested there were thousands of people still being processed offshore and in offshore detention. Those comments were made in the House yesterday. The fact is that there were 1,515 people in offshore processing, and today there are only 490 people remaining in offshore processing. The bulk of these people have been able to be accommodated as refugees - some have gone to New Zealand, some to Australia and some elsewhere - and very large numbers are returning home. We will continue to process the remaining people.The one point that I would make, and I make this point very strongly, is that people who are in offshore processing centres are protected. They may not be where they would like to be, but they have protection from the claimed persecution that they may have alleged they suffered. - Some are, and some are refugees who have not yet been granted a place in another country. I am saying that they are protected while they are there and, even if they were making claims in relation to other situations, they continue to remain protected while they are there. The important point that I would make is that we have also protected the lives of many people, because we have gone now for some 14 months, which is a period unsurpassed in the last decade, without any boat arrivals of substance at all. I noticed in some information put out by the UNHCR this week about what is happening around the world that Australia has the standout result in relation to the numbers of asylum claims lodged. While you have something like half a million people lodging asylum claims in Europe, of which somewhere between five and 10 per cent will get up, the fact is that, while that has continued unabated, Australia has seen a 50 per cent drop-off in asylum applications - and not just asylum applications from unauthorised boat arrivals. The figures have dropped from about 12,000 a year, which is what we used to see, to about 6,000 last year. That is a standout result of a sort that has not been seen anywhere around the world.I notice that my counterpart has not come back to me with any questions in relation to the matter that she asked about the other day. But I was very interested to read Labor's policy to try to assess whether they had any ideas about how they might remove people from Australia. What I found particularly interesting when I read page 24 of the document was that, if you were trying to understand how Labor would deal with these issues in office, you had to look at the way in which the comprehensive plan of action was put in place in 1989. What did Labor claim then? One of the main features of the agreement was:The repatriation of `non-refugees' voluntarily, with integration assistance funded - I repeat: funded - via the UNHCR, or if necessary involuntarily ...When you go through the document to see whether Labor have a plan as to how they handle returns now, you do not find a plan. But what you do find - and it is a very clear indication - is that Labor in office had arrangements for using international organisations to get returns which they funded.I have not seen details published about those arrangements, but if you would like me to I could go through and look at how you dealt with the Chinese returns or how you dealt with the Vietnamese when you were in office. I could get the briefs out - which I am not really, under government arrangements, allowed to do - and publicise how you were doing it. Tell me that you want me to have access to those documents and I will get the information for you. I suspect that that is exactly what you were doing when you were in office. - I suspect that that was what the Labor Party were doing in office, and they suggest that, if we were dealing with international organisations in relation to securing further returns today, it would be in some way inappropriate.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. As he would be well aware, I am an enthusiastic supporter of the ethanol industry. During the election campaign -  - the government made a commitment to set a target for ethanol usage within the Australian liquid fuel mix and to provide support to the industry to enable it to develop the capacity to produce ethanol for Australian motorists. This particular policy has been developed over recent times, and the government has in fact made a commitment for 12 months to ensure that the excise concession is available to the local industry to enable it to proceed with a degree of confidence and security. But it is necessary to have in place a longer term policy to ensure that the investment that is required to build this capacity can effectively be put in place.Over recent weeks, attempts by fuel companies and others to vilify the ethanol industry have severely affected the capacity of this industry to achieve its potential. Only a few months ago, people rightly considered ethanol to be an environmentally friendly fuel that had the capacity to make Australia more self-sufficient in its liquid fuel needs and to provide a lot of jobs in rural and regional Australia. But the campaign, orchestrated in many respects by members opposite, has damaged the reputation of ethanol, vilified the fuel and given the impression that -  - It has vilified it and given the impression that if you put any ethanol at all in your fuel tank your car will break down before it leaves the service station driveway. That is simply dishonest. - They failed to produce any evidence about the damage it is allegedly going to cause to motor vehicles; they just sought to undermine this industry which has so much potential in rural and regional Australia. I share the honourable member's enthusiasm about ethanol. The government is committed to ensuring that Australia has the capacity to produce the needs of the local industry and to do it locally. I agree with the honourable member that there are a number of proposals in New South Wales, Queensland and other places to build new ethanol plants. The government is looking at ways to give the industry the sort of security it needs to be able to proceed with those investments as quickly as possible.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. She will be pleased - as are other members on this side of the House - that exceptional circumstances assistance from the Commonwealth is now available for the irrigated dairy farmers in her region. These farmers have had particular difficulties. They have used their irrigation water - in many cases they borrowed forward their allocations for next year - and their capacity to maintain their farm businesses has been seriously put at risk.The reality is that, if it were not for the changes that this government has made and the use of predictive modelling, that exceptional circumstances assistance could not have been provided. But, because we have been prepared to go the extra mile to find ways to deliver assistance to farmers promptly and efficiently, that assistance is now available to irrigated dairy farmers in New South Wales and, I might add, also across the border in the electorate of Murray to the irrigated dairy farmers in the Goulburn region. Those farmers are now eligible to receive extended income support for a period of two years and they can access interest rate subsidies of up to $100,000 a year on their new and existing loans. Small business in that area is also eligible, of course, to apply for some assistance from the federal government. This builds on the exceptional circumstances declarations which have now been made, covering a significant part of New South Wales, which are on top of the interim assistance that has been available to every farmer in the honourable member's state since the early part of December last year. This represents a very substantial commitment by the federal government, totalling over $900 million nationally. Of that, $522 million is committed to New South Wales.I think it is about time, as we look around at what other governments are doing, that the states make real efforts to match the Commonwealth's commitment. New South Wales has been full of announcements, but very little money is flowing to farmers. Premier Carr has made something like 50 announcements or more but very few of those are to provide assistance to farmers and very little money is flowing to those who need it. In fact, only two of the announcements made the other day actually deliver anything to farmers. Even then, it takes such a long time in New South Wales for farmers to get any benefits. Up until now, farmers have had to wait six months after the drought declaration before they become eligible for anything. That is the kind of spirit that has been associated with drought relief in New South Wales.Obviously, the irrigated dairy farmers have a particular need for assistance. As I mentioned earlier in the week, I have been appalled at the actions of the Victorian government in withdrawing drought assistance to the dairy farmers in Victoria at the time of their greatest need. At a time when it has been demonstrated that their circumstances have deteriorated to the stage where they are eligible for Commonwealth exceptional circumstances assistance, Victoria has stripped away the assistance that it has provided to those farmers over recent months. That is a disgraceful example of how state governments are responding to this drought. Even for Labor, this is a new low.I feel sorry for the state minister, Mr Cameron, because I think this has been dumped on him by the Victorian Premier. I am sure he was not told when he was asked to be the agriculture minister that Victoria was going to withdraw its drought assistance to farmers in that state. But Premier Bracks has been saying that it was always intended that the state assistance would be withdrawn when the Commonwealth exceptional circumstances assistance was provided. If it was always intended, I wonder why he did not bother to tell anybody. He did not bother to tell farmers when he announced the package on 1 October. There is nothing in the press release about it being an interim measure until Commonwealth exceptional circumstances assistance was provided.He did not tell the farmers of Victoria when he was going around visiting drought-affected areas in northern Victoria. He did not tell the voters of Victoria before the Victorian state election. He did not tell the dairy farmers of Victoria. The UDV were not told. They made it abundantly clear in today's newspaper by saying, `We were never told there would be a cut-off date.' He did not bother to tell the Victorian farmers, yet he is asking us to believe it was always intended that the Victorian government would axe the drought relief. This demonstrates how cold and calculating Labor can actually be. Before the election, without telling any of the Victorian farmers, it had already decided it was going to axe this assistance to them. This is a disgraceful and low act on behalf of the Victorian government and it is dishonest. It has misled the voters of Victoria. The Premier himself effectively gave assurances that this aid would be ongoing. In his announcement on 1 October he said:These grants can be spent on much-needed items such as feed for stock and seed for next year's crop.You can spend it on seed for next year's crop! We have not even reached the planting period yet and he has axed the benefit, so it is not available for seed for next year's crop. It was a dishonest press statement from a dishonest government, deliberately seeking to mislead the farmers of Victoria and strip away their assistance as soon as the election was over. I am sure that the dairy farmers in the electorate of the honourable member for Farrer have not missed what has happened across the border. How confident are they about the assurances that the New South Wales government is giving about their drought assistance? How long will it last after the election? It is a paltry, miserable offer as it is, but it will not survive until the day after the election. New South Wales and the other states have failed to live up to their responsibilities. But this low act of taking away drought assistance to farmers when they need it most brings Labor to a new low. I call on the Leader of the Opposition to condemn his state colleagues for their callous disregard for the farmers of Victoria and have this aid restored immediately. If all this is not bad enough, yesterday Mr Cameron was on Country Hour telling us that any other farmers in Victoria who get Commonwealth exceptional circumstances assistance will also have their state assistance revoked. There will be no state assistance for any farmers in Victoria who get Commonwealth assistance. This is a disgrace and a typical example of what Labor thinks of struggling farmers.</DOC>

 - The fact of the matter is that this was placed on the record. The Prime Minister acknowledged it. He has received, in my view, no financial gain out of this. I doubt that he has even had much opportunity to take advantage of it, quite frankly. The Prime Minister has not breached the rules. He has been open about it. It was referred to in the Courier-Mail months ago, and there is nothing secret or hidden about it. He has been up-front about it, and I believe there is no case to answer.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Aston for his question. As the House would recall, the building industry task force was set up in response to the first report of the building industry royal commission. The job of the task force is to tackle the entrenched culture of coercion, collusion and intimidation which has disfigured this industry for far too long. I can inform the House that in four months of operation the task force has received many hundreds of reports of law-breaking in the industry. The task force has conducted more than 100 site visits and has launched some 46 investigations. Importantly, I can advise the House that the task force is currently preparing 18 prosecutions and has already launched two prosecutions.It is important to put all parties in the industry on notice that if they break the workplace law they face prosecution. I particularly want to direct that comment to any employers who might be tempted to offer strike pay or to obstruct task force inspectors in their work. The government's objectives are to secure zero tolerance of law-breaking in this important industry and to give honest workers, unionists and businesspeople the clean industry that they deserve and that they have lacked for so long.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Solomon for his question. He would be described as a very strong Territorian. One-third of our teenage children who are working full time are working in apprenticeship programs. In fact, there are now 368,000 Australians, more than half of them under the age of 24, undertaking apprenticeships throughout Australia. Of these, 138,000 are in traditional trades. It is important that employers understand that on 1 January this year some very important initiatives became available for them. For example, this government announced last year that another 30,000 school students would be able to undertake apprenticeships. They will be supported by this government to the tune of $31 million over four years. In addition, another 25,000 apprenticeship places were created in innovation, microtechnology, manufacturing, information and communication technology, robotics and photonics. It is critically important that we understand that we need a highly skilled work force not only for employment opportunities for young Australians but also for our future. I have been asked whether or not there are any other policies, and I am aware of them. In the course of more than a year of having had the privilege of being Australia's Minister for Education, Science and Training, the Australian Labor Party is yet to ask me a single question in this House in relation to apprenticeships and training. You can imagine my surprise when one of my staff came in last week and said, `Brendan, you are not going to believe it, but we have got a media release from the Australian Labor Party on training.' I said, `Give me a look at it!' I had a look at the headline, which read `30,000 trained teachers missing under Howard'. I thought, `Oh, here we go again,' and I read further into the story, because the only questions and indeed the only concerns from the Australian Labor Party are in relation to universities. The member for Kingston struggled away as the spokesman on training for a year and, to get him off his back, the Leader of the Opposition gave him a promotion. Wheel in the member for Grayndler, who has not got off his backside yet! I read further into the release by the member for Jagajaga, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, and I thought, `What is this?' - Under the headline `30,000 trained teachers missing under Howard', I then read:This shocking waste of skill and talent is despite a critical teacher shortage that has left many schools across Australia without the teachers they need ...I thought, `30,000 people who had applied for teaching since 1997 had apparently not got a place in university. Had they got a place, irrespective of the fact that more than one-third of them were academically not even up to the job of being teachers, it would have cost $761 million to train 30,000 teachers - and for how many jobs in teaching?' I said to my staff, `Let's ring the state ministers and find out how many vacancies we have in teaching.' What do you know? There are 22 jobs going in New South Wales, none in the state of Victoria, 23 jobs going for teachers in South Australia, and the West Australian minister last week said in the West Australian that West Australia has six unfilled teaching vacancies.The member for Forrest, who spends a lot of time worrying about government accounting, would work this out: if we train 30,000 teachers for $761 million for 51 jobs, there would be 29,946 unemployed but highly educated teachers. This surely has to be one of the policies from what the former Prime Minister Paul Keating described as a `Creanite economist'. The member for Jagajaga will rise in a minute and say, `No, I didn't actually want to pay the $761 million for those 30,000 people to get into university; I just wanted to attack the government and make a point, because I, the member for Jagajaga, am not responsible for anything.' The day you ask me a question about apprentices is the day that the people in Cunningham might send a Labor member back.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. After completing his trip to the United States, the Prime Minister is now meeting Prime Minister Blair and other senior members of the British government. He will be taking the opportunity presented by his time and meetings in London to express the Australian government's great appreciation for the strong, determined and principled stand that the British government has taken on Iraq. Australia and the United Kingdom stand together in seeking to ensure that Security Council resolution 1441 is enforced and that Iraq's weapons of mass destruction are destroyed.Prime Minister Blair, frankly, is to be commended for his leadership on this difficult issue. He has not allowed divisions in his own party to deter him from taking a principled stand. Nobody wants military conflict and nobody has a monopoly on hatred of war, but there are very important issues at stake here - issues which the international community has to face up to. Iraq has refused to adhere to its international obligations for 12 long years. Iraq continues to pursue weapons of mass destruction, which poses a threat to its neighbours and the entire international community. The world must now face the prospect of the twin evils of weapons of mass destruction and international terrorism coming together. We must prevent this eventuality from happening. Unless that is understood and acted upon, the international community may well in time pay a truly terrible price for having failed to act.It is for these reasons that the governments of the United Kingdom and Australia, along with the United States, have been calling upon the international community to speak with a single voice, expressed through the United Nations. As the Prime Minister has put it so well, Iraq will be encouraged and emboldened if it sees a world divided. The reality is that, to the extent to which we lack resolution and lack unity in the face of the current difficulties confronting us, Saddam Hussein will play all of those chinks in our armour for all that it is worth. His skill in this regard is second to none; his track record, his form, is well recognised and long documented. We would be very unwise - indeed, naive - to ignore those realities. Only if the world speaks with one voice will there be any hope that Saddam Hussein will hear our demands and act accordingly. This is the only hope for the peaceful outcome that I believe we do all sincerely want. This is the challenge that the United Nations Security Council now faces - the challenge to face up to its responsibility for maintaining international peace and stability.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Casey for his question, because I know he is one of many members of this House who admire the position that Tony Blair, the Prime Minister of Britain, has taken on the issue of Iraq. As the Acting Prime Minister made clear, the Prime Minister is meeting with Prime Minister Blair this evening, Australian time, in London following on from his discussions in Washington and New York. Clearly, although the two Prime Ministers will discuss a number of issues, Iraq - and, in particular, how to maintain Security Council pressure on Saddam Hussein to disarm - will be the focus of their discussion. We on this side of the House believe that Prime Minister Blair has proven to be an extraordinarily courageous and principled leader in this debate. The meeting between the Labour and the Liberal Prime Ministers will, I think on this issue, be a genuine meeting of minds.Tony Blair has recognised from the start that the global threat posed by Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, and the important role the United States must play in leading international efforts to disarm Iraq, is very real and fundamental. In answer to the honourable member's question, I think he would be interested in something Mr Blair said. He said the other day:Some people think I'm going down this path because Britain is a strong ally of America and I don't want to divide off from America. It is worse than that. It is that I genuinely believe it. If America were not doing it, I would be saying to them, `You should be doing it.'Those are the words of a leader who has the strength of his convictions, who does not hide behind process and who is prepared to confront - that is, he is prepared to do something that I have not seen much of in the sister party of the British Labour Party - antiAmericanism within his own party. In part, what drives Tony Blair's concern is clearly the intersection between terrorism and weapons of mass destruction. Again, I quote him. Tony Blair, the leader of the British Labour Party, said:It is only a matter of time before these threats come together in a devastating way.The Australian government certainly shares that view. Like the Australian government, the British government recognises that the pre-deployment of military force has been essential in keeping the pressure on Saddam Hussein to comply with Security Council resolutions. Indeed, it is noteworthy that the United Kingdom has deployed 30,000 personnel, which includes a range of different ships, different types of aircraft and other commitments. As Prime Minister Blair said:If the process of disarmament can't happen through the United Nations inspectors then it will have to happen by force.Let me finally make this point, because I know the honourable member is interested in this: like the Australian government, the British government is unapologetic about its alliance with the United States. Let me remind the House of what Tony Blair has said on that matter:I will defend that relationship absolutely and solidly, because I think it's important for us and for the wider world. I do not think it right that the United States is made to face these issues alone.That is the leader of the British Labour Party. The honourable member asked me if there was any domestic commentary on Tony Blair. There certainly is from this side of the House, but I notice an eerie silence coming from the other side as I talk about Tony Blair. Usually, when you stand at the dispatch box, there is a fusillade of abuse, but this time there is an eerie silence. There is an eerie silence as we speak of Tony Blair. So too was there an eerie silence during the speeches of opposition members during the debate on Iraq. We have counted 75 speeches by opposition members - that is, in both the Senate and the House of Representatives - and I understand that George Bush was unceremoniously mentioned some 275 times. That is not all that many more times than Saddam Hussein, but it is more times - interestingly, since it was meant to be a debate about Iraq - than Saddam Hussein. How many times did the name `Tony Blair' spill out of any brave opposition member's lips? It happened 24 times - not 24 members and senators - and 24 times in 75 speeches is not a lot. We know that, of those members sitting over there, who sit in front of us day by day, just about all of them think, hour by hour, day by day and week by week, `I wish we had a leader like Tony Blair.'</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. The very extensive further increase in aviation security screening arrangements at the 29 categorised airports across Australia is very much on the public record. As for this constant campaign - because that is what it is - from those opposite in relation to the advice that we have put out to Australian households on terrorism, I can only say that our advice is being very well received. The campaign being run by those opposite for people to return their material is not washing. Only a small number are being returned. But what I have been very interested to learn today is that a very large amount of extra material - more pamphlets and more information - is being sought. This is not a waste of money. Any lives saved, any terrorist attack averted or any suspicions reported which result in arrests of those who would engage in or support terrorism will have made every last red cent of it a very valuable investment indeed, and I would be very careful about prejudging it if I were the Labor Party.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Moncrieff for asking a question about the economy. I do not think we have had a question about the economy from the opposition this year and they are apparently not all that interested in employment and the labour force, so I appreciate the fact that the member for Moncrieff does take an interest in the future of the Australian economy and jobs. I can inform him that the labour force figures for January showed that in the month the number of jobs in Australia rose by 111,000 - that is, an additional 111,000 people were able to obtain a job in the month of January. The unemployment rate declined again to 6.1 per cent, and most of those jobs were in fact full time - there were about 72,000 of them.The Australian Bureau of Statistics also announced that it was changing the sample size, so we must note that a sample change is going on and will have to work its way through the system over the forthcoming months; there may be some statistical quirks. But the last three months have shown sustained employment. Given that the international economy is weak and we are in the middle of probably the most severe drought in 100 years, the fact that employment is still rising shows that there is an underlying strength in the Australian economy. In fact, growth in employment over the year to date has already exceeded the government's forecast for the 2002-03 year.Since the coalition was elected in 1996, there have been 1.2 million new jobs created in Australia. That is the benefit of good economic management. We are now coming up to the May budget, and the Expenditure Review Committee is already meeting and putting together that budget. Whilst we are putting together the budget for this May, the measures from last year's budget have still not passed the Senate. The Australian Labor Party still refuses to pass key measures from last year's budget. Even worse, it refuses to pass welfare reform measures from two budgets ago. We are now in the seventh year of Labor in opposition, and over those seven years the Australian Labor Party has not stood for one new policy - other than oppositionism, other than Senate obstructionism, other than a desire to try and prevent this government from giving better opportunities to young people and to people who are looking for jobs. There may have been a worse opposition in the history of the Federation, but it is hard to name what it was. This is an opposition which is mindlessly opposing for the sake of it, which stands for nothing, which has no leadership, which cannot even determine last year's budget as we come up to this year's budget and which, if it had had its way, would have stood in the way of all of the economic advances that have been made over the last six or seven years. This side of the House believes that strong economic management is good because it gives people job opportunities - 1.2 million new jobs in Australia since 1996. If the Labor Party would get out of the way in the Senate, there would be more opportunities for more Australians.</DOC>

 - Since September 11 all luggage going into cargo holds in flights destined for sensitive parts of the world or high risk assessment areas, including America and Britain, has been screened. I announced recently that we would be moving to 100 per cent checked bag screening for all international flights, complemented by the automated baggage reconciliation system - procedures which will ensure that all hold bags will be accounted for and authorised for carriage. Legislation is coming forward for this. There is an obvious attempt here to raise concerns, to intimidate the travelling public, to denigrate our risk assessment authorities in this country. The reality is that - as has been confirmed by none other than the ANAO - since September 11, this country has had a very comprehensive set of aviation safety arrangements in place, plainly based on very high quality risk assessment. Never has aviation security in Australia, in relation to internal and international flights, been higher. Again, I say that we have a whole series of ASMs - additional security measures - which can be tripped on the basis of upgraded information, increased alerts or heightened security arrangements as those would be forthcoming. If these arrangements became necessary, they would extend so far as to effectively curtail all activity by our airlines and airports. This narrow obsession with aviation security -  -  - Hang on. - This obsession with aviation security and the transport sector fails to recognise - interestingly enough, because I think the objective is to scaremonger - that there are a whole range of areas -  - Mr Speaker, I can only conclude that any genuine concern with international and national security affecting the safety of Australians now and in the future would have seen the opposition concentrating over the last two weeks on the real issues confronting us internationally. We would have actually heard a debate about Iraq and the problems of disarming Iraq.  - We would have heard some mention of the activities of the British Prime Minister. We would have actually had a probing of how it came to pass - </DOC>

 - First, I thank the honourable member for Maranoa for asking me a question on North Korea. That is the second question this week I have been asked on the issue of North Korea. From recollection, I have been asked two other questions on North Korea in the life of this parliament. I may be wrong, it may be three; it may be one; I think it is two. I also note that the opposition spokesman for foreign affairs has said that the issue of North Korea is much more immediate and serious than the issue of Iraq. But the opposition have not asked me questions on North Korea all year; I do not know quite why that is. The International Atomic Energy Agency board of governors has made a decision to report North Korea's failure to comply with its nuclear nonproliferation obligations to the security council, and I welcome that. As an influential member of the board, Australia was clearly deeply involved in preparing the ground for this decision. The resolution expressed deep concern over North Korea's actions and called upon the administration in Pyongyang to remedy urgently its noncompliance. This does send a very strong message that North Korea's failure to comply with its nonproliferation obligations will be met by firm international resolve. It registers more generally that noncompliance with safeguard obligations is an extremely serious matter demanding the highest international attention.We look to the Security Council as another avenue for seeking a peaceful diplomatic solution. Other bilateral and multilateral efforts will continue to move in parallel. I explained to the House yesterday, in answer to an earlier question, the active role that Australia has been playing in trying to take forward the process of ensuring that North Korea draws back from the nuclear program that it has. The Security Council has a full range of options open to it, fairly obviously. We expect the immediate priority would be for the Security Council to register its concerns about North Korea's actions, calling upon it to reverse its nonproliferation treaty withdrawal and to comply with its safeguards obligations. We do not expect, for example, that sanctions will be part of any initial response that comes from the Security Council.I think this development clearly puts substantial increased pressure on the administration in Pyongyang, on North Korea. We are aware that North Korea says that ultimately it wants to have bilateral negotiations with the United States. We said to the United States administration that we think it is not unreasonable for the United States to talk with the North Koreans and see what can be achieved. So we hope that in the fullness of time, in an appropriate circumstance and under appropriate conditions, such bilateral discussions may take place.</DOC>

 - Plainly, the imputation behind the Leader of the Opposition's question is this: that we have signed up to something called the coalition of the willing and that our membership of the coalition of the willing commits us, whatever the UN might decide, to military action in the Middle East. That is right? - Terrific. So the question then becomes: what is the coalition of the willing? - The coalition of the willing, we have just heard, is what George Bush says it is. The next point I want to establish is that the high authority on the coalition of the willing would be the President of the United States - would it not? - because he is the man who you got so excited about who confirmed we were part of it. As a matter of fact, what we did not read into the quotes in this place the other day was George Bush's definition of the coalition of the willing. He actually gave it in that interview. I will read it out. We will go through it. Here is the famous part that you all got so excited about. The journalist said:Could you tell us whether you count Australia as part of the coalition of the willing?President Bush replied:Yes I do.Come on! Get excited. Act like you always do. Then he said - and we have read this bit in ad nauseam as the evidence that President Bush knows that we have not yet made any military decision and has acknowledged it:You know, what that means is up to John to decide.He then went on to describe what he understood to be, and how he defines, the coalition of the willing, when he said:But I certainly count him as someone who understands the world changed on September 11, 2001.Mr Speaker, President George Bush's understanding of the coalition of the willing is very plainly set out in his response to that question:... someone who understands the world changed on September 11, 2001.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Barker for his question and acknowledge the serious interest he takes in our efforts to try to improve the global trading circumstance for Australia's farmers. What do we want to see? We want to see a fairer global trading regime for Australia's farmers for the products that we sell in the global marketplace. As stated yesterday when we released our white paper on foreign affairs and trade, the WTO remains the government's No. 1 trade objective. The meeting this weekend in Tokyo is the second in what will be a series of informal mini ministerial meetings to continue to energise the agenda as far as the Doha Round is concerned, a round that needs a positive outcome on agriculture to be successful. There is no doubt about that, and there is broad agreement on that fact. We will certainly be pursuing that at the table this weekend, both as Australians, individually, and as the chair of the Cairns Group. Since I mention the Cairns Group and the white paper, it was interesting to look at the transcript of an interview that was done yesterday, following the government's release of the white paper, with the member for Griffith - who is leaving the chamber - and the member for Rankin in response to that white paper. It was an excellent paper that was developed, and it has been quite well received by the broader community and the commentators in the media. - It was also interesting to note the unusual circumstance that the member for Griffith did less talking than the member for Rankin. But it was interesting to read the transcript. The member for Rankin was asked a question about our policy perspective on competitive liberalisation - that is, pursuing multilateral objectives and bilateral objectives at the same time - and the journalist was saying that the Labor Party's attitude to this was flawed. The member for Rankin responded:I mean, how can Mark Vaile look the other members of the Cairns Group in the eye and say that on the one hand I want to lead you as a group as a powerful third force in negotiations in the global trade negotiations but at the same time do a preferential deal with the United States?Very simply, the answer is that it is very easy, because all the members of the Cairns Group agree with Australia on this issue. In case the member for Rankin has not noticed -  - The point that I was about to make, and obviously it is one that the member for Rankin does not want to hear, is that the members of the Cairns Group agree with this perspective. As a group, we have been pursuing for many years a fairer deal for the farmers of the world who are locked out of the markets of the world, and we have been frustrated by that. The Labor Party should put their hands up and plead guilty to signing away the interests of Australian farmers in the Uruguay Round, which they did. The members of the Cairns Group -  - It is a fact. - The point that the member for Rankin was raising in his media interview following the release of the white paper yesterday was that members of the Cairns Group do not agree with Australia in terms of our perspective on our trade policy at the moment. The fact is that they do because they are pursuing similar objectives. Chile has just concluded a free trade agreement with the United States of America, and South Africa has a preferential agreement with the European Union. Indonesia and Malaysia are members of the AFTA agreement, the free trade agreement of South-East Asia, and all the Latin American countries are currently negotiating the free trade agreement of the Americas with America. So they are not mutually exclusive. As indicated in their questions yesterday, the journalists completely understand the objectives that the government are pursuing to give every opportunity for Australian farmers and Australian exporters to do better in the global markets. We will continue to do that. Unambiguously we will argue that case. I will argue that case in Tokyo this weekend. The European Union and the Japanese have not been very ambitious at all. They are still locked away back at the Uruguay Round. But we are not; we are prepared to be ambitious. We will lead the Cairns Group in that argument. We will argue the case on behalf of Australian farmers in the national interest as well as in their interest, and we will seek support from the Labor Party to do that as well.</DOC>

 - I welcome the question from the member for Fraser, and I look forward to a question on the economy shortly. I have said already today, and I will say it again: I find it impossible to believe that an executive is worth $32 million. That $32 million belongs to the shareholders of the Commonwealth Bank. And it is the shareholders of the Commonwealth Bank who have the ability, through their influence on directors, to ensure that they receive value for the moneys that they have invested in that company. I would urge those shareholders to look very carefully and to demand an explanation from the directors of that company as to what was actually entered into. From what I have read in the newspaper, the payment is fully taxable - that is, that it will be fully taxed and the tax to be paid will be in the hands of the person who received the payment. In relation to a company, the situation is, and always has been, that a company is taxed on its profit. Profit is income less expenses. The Commonwealth Bank is taxed on its profit in full, and the person who received in their hands the $32 million payment, if it is remuneration, is taxed in full. That is the way in which the tax system operates and always has operated in this country. As for the matter of whether or not the amount is something that the shareholders are receiving value for, I find it hard to believe. We have disclosure rules which require this to be disclosed to shareholders so that shareholders can make their views known to the directors who are elected by them and who are accountable for their decisions. As I have said earlier today, I would thoroughly recommend to those shareholders that they take up all of the options that are available to them.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Curtin for her question. I know how interested she is in Zimbabwe, bearing in mind that she was a leading figure in the Commonwealth Observers Group for the so-called elections in Zimbabwe which, as we know, did not reflect accurately the will of the Zimbabwean people. Zimbabwe's suspension from the councils of the Commonwealth following the expiry of the 12-month period in March was a major point of discussion between the Prime Minister and the Secretary-General of the Commonwealth, Donald McKinnon, in London yesterday. These discussions between the Prime Minister and Mr McKinnon were held against the background of presidents Obasanjo and Mbeki expressing a view that a troika meeting would not be necessary and that Zimbabwe's suspension should be lifted at the end of the 12-month period - the end of the 12-month period being on 19 March.Australia's view is that it does not agree that the suspension would dissolve automatically on 19 March. Indeed, on the contrary, it is the view of the Australian government that, without the consensus of the troika, the suspension will automatically continue until the next full meeting of Commonwealth heads of government, which is to take place in Abuja, the capital of Nigeria, in December. I note that the Commonwealth Secretary-General has discussed this with the Prime Minister. During their discussions, the Prime Minister once more emphasised that there would be no automatic lifting of the suspension in the absence of progress in Zimbabwe. That is a view with which I understand the Commonwealth Secretary-General has some sympathy.Zimbabwe, let us remember, was suspended on the basis of that Commonwealth Observers Group report, with which the honourable member for Curtin is so familiar. The troika set itself a program of comprehensive engagement with Zimbabwe covering electoral reform, sustainable and transparent land reform and interparty dialogue, particularly dialogue between the governing party of President Mugabe's ZANU-PF and the Movement for Democratic Change, the main opposition party. The simple fact is that Australia sees no evidence whatsoever of any improvement in Zimbabwe. - That is a good question. The Mugabe government has rebuffed efforts by the Commonwealth Secretary-General to discuss free and fair elections. Farm invasions and evictions still continue without compensation. The majority of so-called redistributed commercial farms lie unoccupied, clearly very substantially exacerbating the country's tragic food crisis, and many of those commercial farms have been transferred to friends of the regime - to party apparatchiks, as they would say - and not to the rural poor, the people who we are told are to get the land. Laws that impede freedom of speech and association continue to be abused by the Mugabe government in order to stamp out dissent, and the Mugabe government has shown that it is not interested in any serious dialogue with the main opposition party, the Movement for Democratic Change. As honourable members will know, it is in fact quite the contrary: harassment of opposition supporters and MDC officials - arrests and the like of sitting MPs - continues apace.As the Prime Minister said the other day, to readmit Zimbabwe to the councils now would reflect poorly on the Commonwealth. Remember that at the very heart of the Commonwealth is the Harare declaration - ironically. The Harare declaration outlines the core principles of the Commonwealth: the principles of democracy and human rights. The fact is that Zimbabwe does not uphold those principles of democracy and the rule of law. It does not apply those principles. They were not applied in Pakistan when the coup took place, and Pakistan was suspended from the councils of the Commonwealth. The same thing happened when there was a coup in Fiji. There is no case whatsoever for bringing Zimbabwe back into the councils of the Commonwealth.Finally, I note that the England cricket team has made a decision not to play in Zimbabwe. I think one of the honourable members interjected regarding the cricket team. We have expressed the view on many occasions that we would like the International Cricket Council to transfer all matches from Zimbabwe to other parts of Africa - presumably, to South Africa. I wrote to Malcolm Gray recently expressing that view, and Mr Speed has written back expressing the view that the International Cricket Council wishes to persist with the games in Zimbabwe. As many honourable members will know, there have been one or two games played there already. As we have said all along, at the end of the day this is a matter for the International Cricket Council and, in Australia's case, for the Australian Cricket Board, but we regard it as regrettable that cricket matches are proceeding in Zimbabwe as part of the World Cup campaign.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for La Trobe for his question. The car industry is one of the great success stories of Australian manufacturing. It was a virtual basket case 15 years ago. Now it exports some $5 billion worth of high-quality product per year and employs nearly 100,000 Australians, which is an increase of some 20,000 in the last seven years. The car industry has rarely been helped by the activity of the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union. Last year, strikes orchestrated by the AMWU cost the industry some $400 million in lost production and resulted in tens of thousands of workers being stood down. The industry's strike rate is six times the national average. Last year the AMWU gave $818,000 to our friends opposite, and the AMWU has three representatives in this parliament to protect their investment, including the member for Grayndler.Now the AMWU is ramping up what it calls Campaign 2003. This is a campaign for an 18 per cent pay rise and a 36-hour week - more pay for less work. Not only that, but it wants workers' entitlements to be paid into a union-controlled trust fund, even though statutory and community standard entitlements are guaranteed by this government. I regret to inform the House that Campaign 2003 has already begun, with a series of strikes and bans directed against a Victorian components manufacturer in defiance of an industrial commission recommendation. This campaign is now threatening to destroy the viability of this company and destroy the jobs of its workers. It is also threatening to lead to thousands of stand-downs in the car industry next week.I think it is important to make a few things clear. When unions are not genuinely bargaining and when strikes are threatening to shut down Australia's most important manufacturing industry, this government will intervene in industrial commission proceedings. If union officials and others break the law, they will face prosecution by this government. I have to say that for too long workplace relations have been a province of law without order. For too long, we have had too much legal process and not enough law enforcement. The era of industrial law without an industrial policeman is now over. This government will not stand by and see the great industries of Australia vandalised, and we will certainly not allow the jobs of decent, honest Australian workers to be sacrificed on the altar of union power.</DOC>

 - The member for Barton will be pleased to know that I entirely share the disgust which has been expressed by people such as the Treasurer about this kind of payment. -  - I think, along with all members of this House, that millions of Australian workers are entitled to feel badly ripped off by this decision to award so much money to an executive. But the important thing to note is that shareholders and directors of companies have responsibilities, and I very much fear that the directors of the companies concerned have let down their shareholders in allowing this kind of package to stand. - On the subject of doing the right thing by workers, I am proud to say that this government has created 1¼ million new jobs since 1996. This very day we know that job numbers are at an all-time record, full-time jobs are at an all-time record and participation is at an all-time record. Not only that, but the workers of Australia are enjoying unprecedented wage rises. Average weekly full-time earnings are up by 13 per cent in real terms under this government. Basic award earnings are up by five per cent under this government. Under the former government, basic award earnings actually fell by three per cent. Let me make it very clear. Under the former government, executive salaries were not controlled and workers' pay fell. We do not believe in imposing a Stalinist regime on anyone's pay. Workers' pay has increased under this government and it will continue to increase.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Corangamite for his interest in, and support for, the aeronautics industry in Australia - particularly his support for the Avalon Airshow, which showcases many industry achievements. Whilst the member for Corangamite showed his support for Avalon, it was disappointing to see the member for Corio use it as a place to stage a demonstration. I am not sure what sort of message that sends to the aviation and aeronautics industry in Australia. I also thank the member for Corangamite for his question, because these days we have to rely on this side of the House for questions on industry and innovation. The Treasurer has expressed his frustration that there are no questions from the other side of the House on the economy. There are no questions on innovation or industry either. - This week it was my pleasure to be part of the official opening of the Australian International Airshow and to announce the 2002 winner of the Lawrence Hargrave award. This award is Australia's most prestigious aerospace award. It was named after one of Australia's aeronautical pioneers, Lawrence Hargrave, who used box kites to test and develop aerodynamic principles later used in rotary engines. Australia has a very proud history in aeronautics. Australians were the first to fly over virtually all the major oceans of this world, and a previous winner of the Lawrence Hargrave award, Dr David Warren, is the inventor of the black box flight recorder - a remarkable effort. The recipient of this year's award, Dr Gordon Long, helped develop a stress test for the FA18 Hornet tail section. This work is worth millions of dollars to the RAAF and is an outstanding achievement for the Australian aerospace industry.The Australian aerospace industry continues to punch well above its weight and has a one per cent share of the world market, worth some $2 billion. It employs some 11,000 people in companies as small as CEA Technologies, which produces the world's best radar systems right here in Fyshwick, Canberra. There are, of course, other major aerospace companies operating in Australia - including Boeing, BAE and Raytheon, to indicate just a few. Australia is world renowned for its strengths in engineering design and development, particularly in the area of advanced composite materials. Australia stands at the cusp of a great opportunity with the $400 billion joint strike fighter program. There is little doubt in our minds that, with the full support of the government through our innovation programs and research and development programs, Australia will continue to take a major share of that. - Thank you, Mr Speaker; that has made my day. Australia will continue to have a major place in the aerospace industry and will go on to turn great Australian ideas into jobs for Australians.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Cowan for his question. As this issue is causing a great deal of interest in the media at the moment, I would like to read through a short chronology of the events.  -  - We are not sitting on this report and it will be released shortly, as I said in the MPI last week. Earlier last week I was given a briefing by my senior officials from DVA on the preliminary aspects of the report, which I covered in my speech on the MPI last week. I want to assure the member for Cowan and run through the chronology of this important report, because this is one of the most comprehensive health studies on Gulf War veterans that has been undertaken.On 5 July 1999 the then Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Mr Scott, announced that there would be a health study of Gulf War veterans. On 30 December 1999 the scientific advisory committee was appointed. On 3 July 2000 a contract was signed with Monash University to undertake the independent study. On 2 August 2000 a study pilot commenced and the first medical appointment was made for a pilot in Melbourne. On 27 September 2000 the pilot was successful and recruitment packages were sent to approximately 3,700 participants, 1,862 of whom were listed on the Gulf War veterans nominal roll. On 15 October 2002 the draft findings were presented to the consultative forum. On 23 October 2002 the draft findings were presented to the scientific advisory committee. Between 13 and 31 January this year there was reformatting and editing of the report. On 16 January this year updated information was provided by Monash University. Late on Friday, 31 January 2003, publication arrangements were made. These arrangements continued to 7 February this year when a further correction to the text was actually made by Monash University. This required further changes and refinements to the report. As I said, the report will be released as soon as possible. I table this chronology in the House.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Dunkley for his question. I am aware of the criticisms that Mr Castles has made. Ian Castles is the former Australian Statistician and a man with a long and distinguished career dealing with issues of economic growth. Ian Castles has raised a number of issues in relation to the methodology used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in its Special report on emission scenarios, a key assessment of future economic paths and associated emission scenarios through to 2100.This report from the IPCC is the basis for modelling the long-term effects of climate change. It led the IPCC to the conclusion that global warming from 1990 through the 21st century to 2100 would range from a 1.4 to a 5.8 degree Celsius increase in global temperature. Mr Castles contends that the assessment is based on unrealistically high emission scenarios, which are in turn the result of implausibly high economic growth rates in the developing countries. These come about, according to Mr Castles, from the use of inappropriate market exchange rates rather than the correct use of the purchasing power parity approach in comparing income levels in different countries.Australia has facilitated the discussion of Mr Castles' analysis at the IPCC. I am happy to report that the intergovernmental panel has extensively discussed Mr Castles' criticisms at a recent workshop in Amsterdam and is proposing to organise some further meetings on the issues later in the year. The key objective of this is to ensure that our understanding of the threat posed by climate change is based on sound analysis and sound science. Global climate change is a serious issue. Australia is keen to ensure continued and enhanced high standards of scientific integrity, credibility and usefulness of the IPCC as the authoritative, international source of advice on climate change issues.Whether Mr Castles is correct or not, it is important that we recognise that there is no argument that Australia will be affected even by small changes in temperature. Leaving aside the question of the impact of global climate change on the current drought, the Bureau of Meteorology has concluded, for example, that the more severe impact of the current drought arises from the relatively higher temperatures during 2002 compared with earlier droughts such as those of 1982 and 1994. In fact, figures from the bureau show that the average daytime maximum temperatures during 2002 were at record levels. In fact, they were 1.22 degrees higher than the long-term average, compared with the previous record of 0.91 degrees.This illustrates that even very slight increases in temperature put great pressure on our communities and producers, our ecosystems and species and increase instances of skin cancer. The government are going to continue to work very closely with industry to ensure that Australia makes its contribution to the reduction of greenhouse gases, and we have already put in place a $1 billion program. Measures already taken under that program will be reducing Australia's greenhouse gas emissions by some 60 million tonnes of CO2 by 2010, which is equivalent to taking the entire Australian car fleet off the road. In contrast, we are yet to see any sensible proposal by the Labor Party, which is approaching the end of seven years in opposition with no sign of any cogent policy whatever.  - The contrast is -  - that the Labor Party is concerned with empty symbols, with the signing of international agreements -  - and it has not a single constructive policy to help Australia reduce its greenhouse gas emissions. Our government will continue to take a responsible attitude internationally and to ensure that our policies are based on sound science.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Kennedy for his question. I also commend him on his support for a viable ethanol industry in Australia. This is something which this government supports, as the minister for agriculture pointed out in answer to a question in this place just this week. Can I also indicate to the honourable member that one of the major commitments of the Australian government is to the health and wellbeing of the citizens of this country. That is why, for example, we have in place laws in relation to emissions. That is why we have in place laws in relation to antipollution. If, when I have read the learned articles that the honourable member has referred me to, there is anything else I can add by way of answer, then I will do so.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. It goes to the heart of a very important issue, particularly for the very large number of Australians who live in the regions. They are in fact directly confronting one of the greatest threats to their economic security in the nation's history. I think we are at that point. It goes well beyond the impact on farmers. It is now potentially massively impacting on food processing, the abattoir sector, the transport sector, the tourism sector and, indeed, in some parts of the country, heavy industry. Some reports indicate that a very significant number of jobs in the small business sector as well are at risk - potentially as high as 70,000. Every one of us hopes that these grim forecasts do not come to reality and that we get as early a break as possible. I have sought advice today on this important matter. The best forecasts remain those that say that the end of March is the most likely time for a significant break, but I think we need to be realistic and say too that the summary that the met office has presented to me for the next three months remains, frankly, very concerning. Its estimates are that there is only a 50 to 65 per cent chance of more than median rain in the south-west half of Australia over the next three months, that the rest of the country has less than a 50 per cent chance of higher than median rainfall and that there is quite a low chance of median rainfall for north-east Queensland. Worryingly, in New South Wales, the outlook to April is only a 45 to 50 per cent chance of median or better falls in the north-west and 55 to 60 per cent over the south-west. There is a better than even chance of continuing higher than normal temperatures, which, as the minister for the environment pointed out, can in fact be an equally serious problem along with a lack of actual precipitation. In Queensland, whilst there have been some very welcome falls, the outlook is estimated to be about a 30 to 45 per cent chance of being drier than normal until April and a 70 to 75 per cent chance of being hotter than normal.The situation with the water storage system, particularly in the Murray-Darling Basin, is now very serious indeed. Irrigation storages are at about 30 per cent capacity and, at current depletion rates, will be exhausted by the end of May. In the rest of New South Wales, the northern areas will have no allocations next season if the drought persists. All reserves in the south have been used, except for a small amount for the Murrumbidgee that could give 10 to 15 per cent allocation for the 2003-04 irrigation season for some rice planting. In Queensland, if the drought continues, most systems will be without water in 2003-04. Stream flows are very low. A number in central and south-east Queensland have stopped flowing. In Herbert and on the Atherton, stream access is on the toughest ever restrictions at 10 to 25 per cent of normal. In the Wimmera and Mallee in Victoria, there have been no allocations this year. Without rain next year, the areas may well run out of domestic and stock water altogether. The Goulburn-Murray started this year on 54 per cent allocation and could be down to 10 per cent next year. In South Australia, we are told some areas may not receive their first allocation for the first time - given they are very conservative allocations anyway in that state - in 100 years.This is a very sobering national outlook. The federal government are seeking to be sympathetic and responsive in the way we handle this and are seeking to help people through. At this stage, we are estimating $1 billion or so will flow from the applications for exceptional circumstances assistance that are before us. We hope sincerely that the drought breaks; there is no substitute at all for a substantial rainfall event. But we are fortunate in this country. The reality is that, in many societies throughout history, this sort of event would have had the nation very worried about something as basic as food security. But such is the surplus production by our farmers in this country that we are not at any point contemplating such an outcome.I would say to the House that I think all Australians affected by this should know that we are concerned indeed. I cannot help but note, though, that over the last two weeks while the very important matter of Iraq has been before this House all we have seen from the opposition is the pursuit of a conspiracy theory. That has been denied, of course, not only by the Prime Minister and the government but by General Cosgrove and the President of the United States as well. Worse than that - and I do not know what the country mayors who were in the audience yesterday thought - at the height of the most serious problem confronting a huge slab of the Australian economy and the people dependent upon it, is that not one question on drought has been asked over the last fortnight. -  - If I am accused on that basis of being a complete disgrace, that might as well be recorded in the Hansard -  - because I should think that it is a disgrace that the Labor Party has not asked a single question about drought over the last few weeks.  - Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for reminding me and reminding the House that today is the seventh anniversary of the election of the government. It gives me an opportunity to say something of what this government have achieved. I will take advantage of the opportunity that the Leader of the Opposition has afforded to me. I would have said something to that effect about the current account. I have not looked at the exact words, but of course I would have. I would have also said something about reducing unemployment. I am proud to say to the House that in the time that we have been in government we have generated 1.3 million more jobs in the Australian economy.I think also I would have said something about interest rates. You do not hear a lot about interest rates from the Australian Labor Party. I am very proud to say that in the time that we have been in government we have reduced the average monthly repayment on a housing loan in this country by a figure of between $300 and $400 a month - a remarkable achievement. Whereas when Labor were in office, including the Leader of the Opposition, the then government used to boast about how they had reduced the real wages of Australian workers, I am very proud to say that in the seven years that we have been in government we have presided over a significant increase in the real wages and the disposable income of Australian workers. The workers' party opposite boasted about cutting the wages of workers. I am proud to report that we have boosted the wages of workers in the time that I have been in office.The Leader of the Opposition also invites me to say something about debt. I am very proud to remind the Australian Labor Party, to remind the House and, particularly, to remind the Leader of the Opposition that by the end of this financial year the net federal government debt to GDP will be three per cent. That compares with an average of about 49 per cent for all the countries of the OECD, 47 per cent for the United States and 79 per cent for Japan. The strength of the Australian economy now is more evident, more real, more broadly based, more widespread and more internationally recognised than at any time since the late 1960s. Also take into account symbolically that we have recovered our AAA credit rating. When did we lose that? We lost that at the time of the then described banana republic, in the words of the former Treasurer and fellow Prime Minister Mr Keating. I want to thank the Leader of the Opposition for reminding me of some of the things that I said before I became Prime Minister.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Boothby for his question. The arrest of Khalid Shaikh Mohammed is a major breakthrough in the war against terrorism. He is regarded as having been the real mastermind behind the attacks on the United States on 11 September 2001. He is the No. 3 man in al-Qaeda. It is a major victory in the global campaign, and it does strike at the heart of al-Qaeda's global network, including in our own region. Khalid is a killer and a dispatcher of killers who spent his life planning the murder of innocents throughout the world. Not only is he regarded as the technical mastermind of the attacks on America on 11 September 2001 but he is also under US indictment for a conspiracy plot based in the Philippines to bomb airliners in South-East Asia in 1995. He is also reported to be involved in the brutal murder of the Wall St Journal's Daniel Pearl, the 1998 US embassy bombings in East Africa and the attack on the USS Cole. He is known to have many links in South-East Asia terrorist networks, including that of Jemaah Islamiah. He is said to be linked to two al-Qaeda operatives, one currently in the United States and the other in the Philippines' detention, who were behind a 2001 JI plot to bomb Australian and other Western embassies in Singapore. His detention is a major advance in our goal of unravelling terrorist networks and, potentially, preventing further operations. May I take this opportunity to congratulate the agencies of the United States and the agencies of Pakistan for their very effective work in bringing about the arrest of this person. Particularly may I pay tribute to the stoic, determined and courageous fight of Pakistan and its leader, General Musharraf, against international terrorism. I do not think there is a world leader who has put more on the line in the fight against world terrorism, in many respects, than General Musharraf. I regard his personal courage and leadership on this issue as having been quite outstanding. He and the people of Pakistan deserve the respect and the admiration of the world not only for what they have done in relation to this recent arrest but also for the great determination and leadership they have displayed against considerable odds and in the face of considerable domestic opposition and difficulty in the war against terrorism.</DOC>

 - I do want to say something about today's balance of payments figures. Before the December quarter, imports were seven per cent higher, led principally by a strong increase in capital goods - in particular, a large rise in civil aircraft imports, which is the re-equipping of the Qantas fleet. Because it is a capital investment, one would expect over time that it will work out in additional profits for the company concerned. In the same quarter, export volumes were flat but were led down by rural exports falling by 3.3 per cent, as one would expect in the worst drought in 100 years in Australia. As I previously said, with the drought being the worst in 100 years, not only would the rural exports be down in the December quarter but I would expect that the drought will flow into rural exports in the March and June quarters. We may see some recovery by December if the drought is breaking - and we certainly hope that it is breaking. As you would expect in the worst drought in 100 years, obviously rural exports are down but, because the Australian economy runs stronger than the other economies of the developed world, capital imports are up and that will reflect itself in business activities. In passing, I might also indicate that company profits, which were released today, were very strong indeed. Take Qantas, for example. It is one of the few profitable airlines in the world and that is why it is restocking its capital fleet.Can I indicate that the banana republic was not in fact the worst current account deficit, unlike what was said by the questioner. The current account was 6.4 per cent during the banana republic, but it was 6.6 per cent in 1989-90 when Labor gave us the recession we had to have as a result of the current account deficit, and it was 6.5 per cent in 1994-95. The allegation, of course, that this is the worst is completely wrong. Can I also indicate a critical difference between, as the Prime Minister did, the Labor current account deficits in excess of six per cent, because I think the House will be interested in this. Not only did we have high current account deficits but we had the Labor way of managing current account deficits, which was interest rate rises. In 1985-86, when the current account was at 6.4 per cent, there was of course no drought, let alone a drought of 100 years severity. In 1985-86, the standard variable mortgage interest rate stood at 13.5 per cent.Opposition member - What was it in 1982? - Somebody says, `What was it in 1989-90?' We had no drought in 1989-90, nor one of 100 years severity. But, as the current account went to 6.6 per cent of GDP, the standard variable mortgage interest rate paid by the battlers of Australia rose under the Hawke-Keating-Crean-Beazley governments to 17 per cent. In 1994-95, when there was no drought, let alone one of 100 years severity, and the current account stood at 6.5 per cent, the standard mortgage variable interest rate stood at 10.5 per cent compared to 6.5 per cent today.As the Prime Minister said, over the last seven years what have we seen in the Australian economy? Firstly, low interest rates - and that is good for young families who want to buy houses. Secondly, we have seen 1.2 million new jobs in this country. What have we seen in relation to the people in work? Higher disposable income. What have we seen in relation to government debt? We have seen $80 billion of Labor's debt paid off. Can you imagine what the situation would be had we not paid off Labor's debt? There would be another $80 billion in relation to the public and private debt in Australia. But most of all, in relation to all of that economic management, this has been done without the cooperation of an opposition that was interested in good policy. It has been done across the opportunism of this opposition, which has sought to frustrate and delay at every turn. The only thing we can say to the people of Australia is: thank heavens you were not successful in doing it.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for La Trobe for his question, the interest he shows in this issue and the way he represents his constituents. Iraq has, I understand, destroyed a total of 10 al-Samoud II missiles out of a stockpile believed to be of over 100. This latest effort by Saddam Hussein is a continuation of a game he has played for the last 12 years whenever he finds himself with a serious deadline. We should not forget that Iraq should not have developed missiles in the first place with a range of over 150 kilometres. Those missiles contravene United Nations Security Council resolutions. So Iraq should not be given credit for minimal and late displays of so-called good behaviour. Iraq has simply corrected an earlier transgression. Iraq has clearly not taken a fundamental decision to cooperate fully with the United Nations. Its cooperation remains grudging and minimalist despite the obligation in Security Council resolution 1441. These are words that many members of the House may not recall from that resolution: `that Iraq cooperate immediately, unconditionally and actively'. Several months have now passed since the passage of that resolution and by no stretch of any imagination could anyone claim that Iraq has cooperated immediately, unconditionally and actively. It is very obvious that they have not.Steps taken by Iraq recently are no more than a cynical attempt to deploy a smokescreen over its intention not to disarm. After all, I note the other day that Iraq miraculously, and without the presence of UNMOVIC inspectors, excavated two biological bombs. Honourable members might remember that Iraq put in a declaration on 7 December saying they had no chemical and biological weapons whatsoever. But miraculously, recently, they uncovered two biological bombs with no United Nations inspectors present. Iraq is said to have around 500 of these bombs and two have turned up. That is a remarkable thing. The simple fact is that Iraq has failed to explain the whereabouts of 6,500 chemical munitions with a potential chemical agent content of 1,000 tonnes; 8,500 litres of anthrax; 650 kilograms of bacterial growth media, which could be used to make 5,000 litres of anthrax; and 1½ tonnes of VX. Where is all that material? Why is it that one or two things are dug up here and there, and there are one or two concessions made here or there, but we never know what happens to the substance of Iraq's stockpiles?Saddam Hussein has done this for 12 years. He plays a game of trying to divide the international community - and, in the main, in the last 12 years he has been quite successful. To keep the international community divided - to keep, in particular, the United Nations Security Council divided - is a key objective of Saddam Hussein. That is why we get these grudging concessions here and there when deadlines approach. But, of course, they are minimalist concessions. They are not full cooperation as is demanded by the United Nations Security Council with the United Nations inspectors. That is why, in his 1 March report, Dr Blix made it clear that Iraq still has not addressed key disarmament questions and that it could have used the period up until 1 March to answer questions and produce credible evidence, but it did not. The fact is that Dr Blix described Iraq's efforts so far as `very limited'.It is because Iraq is clearly not cooperating and has clearly not fulfilled its obligations under Security Council resolution 1441 that this government holds the view that a new resolution should be passed through the Security Council - the resolution which is cosponsored by the United Kingdom, the United States and Spain. That resolution confirms that Iraq has not taken, as it was obliged to take, the final opportunity offered to it to comply with Security Council resolution 1441. We obviously hope that before too long it will be possible for that new Security Council resolution to be passed by the Security Council. We are optimistic that that can be achieved, but it is going to take a good deal of diplomacy in order to achieve it. The important thing is that for 12 years Saddam has successfully divided the international community and the Security Council. If the international community wants Saddam Hussein disarmed, the only way to do that is to show a unity of purpose and unity in the Security Council. As long as the international community is divided, Saddam Hussein will be able to continue to get away with his cat-and-mouse game and retain his chemical and biological weapons - a man who is the world's most brutal dictator.</DOC>

 - The answer to the honourable member for Rankin is that I certainly would have said something about foreign debt, and I may have said something to that effect. The record is there and I do not walk away from it. But he invites me to say whether, as Prime Minister and in terms of the performance of this country, I feel proud when I go around the world. The answer is: yes, I do. The reason that I feel very proud as I go around the world is that I know I have the incredible privilege of being the Prime Minister of a country that is now held in higher esteem and in greater regard, and which is seen as a stronger nation than it was seven years ago.It is very interesting that, on the basis of one figure, the Labor Party should choose to focus the debate on the economy. I thank the Australian Labor Party very much. They are obviously not taking the advice of the former chief of staff of the former Leader of the Opposition, who counselled them against focusing on the government's strengths. But I thank them very warmly for enabling us in this question time to talk about the strengths of the Australian economy. The Australian economy is now seen, justifiably, as having outperformed every other developed economy over the last five years.If you go right across the gamut of economic comparisons you cannot escape the conclusion that, over the time this government has been in office, we have experienced the most sustained period of economic growth since at least the late 1960s. If you look at the character of the Australian economy in the 1960s and compare it with the character of the Australian economy now, you will see that in the 1960s the Australian economy was heavily protected, highly regulated and, as a consequence, was insulated - not very successfully, as time was to demonstrate - in the 1970s from the ravages of a harsher and more difficult world. If you come forward in time, particularly to the last seven years, you see the Australian economy living in a more open, competitive environment. Despite that, the Australian economy has been able to outperform the other developed economies of the world. I would like to pick up the point so ably made by the Treasurer about the attitude of this opposition and compare it with the attitude of the coalition when we were in opposition. Whenever the former government put up a decent idea - and it did on one or two occasions - we backed it. Can you imagine where the cause of lower tariffs would have ended if we had run the sort of populist campaign amongst working people in Australia about tariff reform that the Labor Party is endeavouring to run on things like Telstra? Can you imagine where the debate on financial deregulation would have gone if we had run a fear campaign about the entry of foreign banks and the progressive deregulation of interest rates? Time and time again, when we had the opportunity in opposition to stand up for Australia instead of taking the opportunistic course, we stood up for Australia. By contrast, every single reform and every single measure to strengthen the Australian economy that we have undertaken over the last seven years has been opposed by the Australian Labor Party. It opposed labour market deregulation and taxation reform. It is opposing measures right at the moment to preserve the sustainability of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, one of the great egalitarian welfare measures that this country has devised.I say to those opportunistic men and women who currently occupy the opposition benches that, unless we as a nation are prepared to take steps to preserve the sustainability of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, it will no longer serve the interests of the average Australian. It will become unaffordable. New drugs will become unaffordable. It will no longer be the boast of this nation that we have a pharmaceutical benefits scheme that puts life-saving drugs within the reach of all Australians and not just wealthy Australians. That is what the opportunistic bunch who sit opposite us at present stand for: you stand for opportunistic opposition. You do not believe in anything. You do not articulate anything. You do not stand for anything. All you believe in is opposing the government, and I think the Australian people think very poorly of you as a consequence.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Curtin for her question. I can inform the House that over the last 17 years - or really over the last 20 years, I suppose I could say, since the election of the Hawke-Keating government in 1983 - there have been four movements in Australia's international credit rating. Australia was first downgraded in 1986, by both Moody's and Standard and Poor's. That was the first downgrading of our credit rating. The second movement of our credit rating came in 1989, under the Hawke-Keating government, when we were downgraded again. The third movement came in 2002 where, after five years of sustained economic effort, Moody's upgraded Australia two places and restored our AAA rating. The fourth movement came during the period that the House was up, when Standard and Poor's, in the fourth movement in 20 years, restored Australia's AAA credit rating on foreign currency bonds and made Australia part of that pack of nations which is in the first row of the world again. That is something we lost under Hawke and Keating and something we recovered under a coalition government.Standard and Poor's said this when it upgraded Australia:Australia has one of the strongest fiscal positions, including `AAA' rated sovereigns ... net general government debt to GDP is projected to fall to 3% at year-end 2003 from 20% seven years before.With respect to the private sector, Standard and Poor's says that Australia's reliance on foreign savings is:... mitigated in Standard &amp; Poor's view by the high credit standing of Australia's major banks, by the depth of the foreign exchange and derivatives markets ... by substantial claims on nonresidents by the Australian private sector ... which are not captured in ... [the] International Investment Position presentation.So one of the things I have been intrigued by in all these questions about foreign debt is the fact that we have not had any mention of Australia's credit upgrading by Standard and Poor's. It may well be that the Leader of the Opposition is right and Standard and Poor's is wrong. But those of us who know the economic credentials of the Leader of the Opposition and compare them to Standard and Poor's will not think it is a close-run thing. Standard and Poor's is an independent agency that rates the governments of the world. It is not controlled by this government, and the fact that it upgraded Australia as a result of the strong fiscal position, thoroughly reversing the downgrading of Australia under the Hawke and Keating governments, is an independent indicator of what the Prime Minister said - that under Hawke and Keating Australia fell in the league tables and under this government we have recovered. That is why Australians can hold their heads high again - because, along with France, Germany, the United States and the United Kingdom, Australia now has its AAA rating back.I should say, in explanation to the House, that Australia never lost its AAA rating on domestic bonds; it was on foreign currency bonds - that is, bonds which are issued in foreign currency or fall due in foreign currency. That was because of balance of payments concerns, which began with the banana republic and were worsened under Labor in 1989. It has been a long road back, but after those downgradings in 1986 and 1989 Australia stands tall again, and a coalition government was pleased to undo the last damage of the Hawke-Keating years.The Prime Minister has also made the valid point, I think, that there were good things that Hawke and Keating did. They did do some good things, and I have always said that: they floated the dollar; they let foreign banks in - and that led to this new banking system, which some of the troglodytes of the Australian Labor Party now attack; and they began the reduction of tariffs, which this government has continued. They did some good things. We have always given credit where credit was due. But let me tell you what they did not do. They ran up $80 billion of government debt in their last five years and they could not get it down. Let us see what else they could not do: they could not get an interest rate below 10½ per cent; they could not get 1.2 million jobs; they could not reform the taxation system because, although the then Treasurer believed it had to be done in the interests of Australia, they could not get it through the union veto. - `Rubbish,' he says. They could get it through the union veto, could they? They were just going to do GST in the 14th or 15th year? He is rewriting history now, saying that it is rubbish that Labor refused to introduce a GST because of a union veto - that is rubbish! This brings me to the Leader of the Opposition because, in all those changes where Labor did good things supported by the coalition, not all the members of the Labor Party supported them. I have told the House before about this, and I cannot get over it. I have been reading a portrait of Paul Keating by Don Watson. Let me remind the House of where everybody was during those reforms. Don Watson said:Mickey Mouse was a name to be feared by all advisers ... To be touched by those two words was poison. Bleeding heart, froth, fairy floss and Creanites were others. A Creanite was someone who sympathised with industry policy of the kind advocated by Simon Crean. These names were dreaded in the way that Trotskyist, revisionists and tendencies were dreaded in another time and another place. You knew your economic credibility was shot.If we go back to what was actually happening there, the opposition was cooperating. Who was in opposition to the few good things that the Labor Party did? That group of Creanites, now rapidly dwindling; they are the few people that can take no credit for the changes of those days. When the Creanites got control of the Labor Party, it was the end of economic policy as we now know it. What is the evidence? Objections to PBS increases, which the Keating government put in place and demanded be increased. Objections to welfare reform, when we used to have the member for Werriwa demanding it, claiming it, wanting it to be done and saying we were using it to hide the unemployment rate. This is a Creanite opposition that has decided, in the week when Australia's credit upgrading was finally regranted and when we put to bed the bad things of the Keating government, to come out and remind us that they are still here, for better or for worse - and much more for worse.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Maranoa for his question, and I note that the opposition spokesman on foreign affairs interjects with a question. For the record, he has not asked a single question in the House of Representatives on the issue of North Korea since he has been in that position. - And nor have you, for that matter, either. - The government does remain deeply concerned about the provocative behaviour of the North Korean administration and, in particular, its pursuit of a nuclear weapons program. I visited Seoul last week to attend the inauguration of President Roh and to meet key figures in his new administration. I had lunch, for example, with the incoming foreign minister, Mr Yoon. South Korea is an important regional partner for Australia. It is our fourth largest trading partner and our third largest export market. It is important that members of the House understand that.It was also a very good opportunity for me to hold discussions on North Korea with leaders from countries with key interests in the peninsula - that is, with not just the South Korean leaders, whom I have already mentioned, but also Secretary of State Powell, Vice-Premier Qian Qichen and Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Losyukov, who members of the House may recall was at one stage the Russian ambassador here in Canberra and who had very recently been in North Korea. In those discussions, I reaffirmed the fundamental importance of a peaceful, diplomatic solution to the problems of North Korea and pressed the need for a multilateral setting in which the United States and North Korea might, amongst other things, be able to have some bilateral contact and even quite broad-ranging discussions. We had hoped that the proposal for a so-called five-plus-five meeting might take place. The North Koreans have so far rejected that but we continue to pursue it, as do others.I also flagged a proposal for a meeting of key countries in the region to address the question of whether it would be possible to have some kind of multilateral security guarantee for North Korea, and that group of countries would of course include the United States. Finally, I urged China to use its unique and overriding influence to persuade North Korea to not just participate in a five-plus-five meeting but also more generally pull back from its nuclear ambitions and return to the nuclear nonproliferation treaty.I think my visit reinforced the energy that Australia has put into trying to find a solution to the problem of North Korea. As the Prime Minister said the other day, I do not think there is any country that has made a more enthusiastic effort to try to address this problem. Nevertheless, we recognise that this is an extremely fraught and difficult issue and one that the international community needs to continue to focus on very significantly. That is not to say it should ignore a persistent violator of Security Council resolutions like Saddam Hussein. We should be able to focus on both issues at once; indeed, we must do that. But there is no doubt that we, for our part, will have to continue to be actively engaged in trying to find a resolution to the problems of the Korean peninsula.</DOC>

 - The short answer to the question is no. The slightly longer answer that I know the member for Lilley would be very disappointed if I did not provide to the House is as follows. In the seven years that we have been in government, we have done three very important things in relation to family payments. The first of those is that we have massively boosted them by about $13 billion, a not inconsiderable sum. We have boosted family payments by $13 billion. The second very important thing that we have done is greatly enhance the choices available to Australian families, particularly but not only to Australian women.  - The third thing we have done is recognise the growing importance in the Australian community of the desire of Australian families to have an appropriate balance between their work and family responsibilities. It is very interesting, when you look at the figures, to see over the last 40 years a very major change in the participation patterns of Australian women. But, when you look at those changes, you find that there has been very little change - and this is borne out by some research recently conducted by Professor Bob Gregory of the Australian National University - in the participation rates in full-time work of Australian women over that 40-year period and a major change in the patterns of part-time work.In Australian society now we have a situation where you need to devise family policies that fit the interests, aspirations and desires of different categories of families and provide them with new choices. That is what the government's policies have done. We have boosted the value of the benefits. Along the way, we have eliminated the bias that used to exist against single income families with a child under the age of five years, and that was an important policy goal that the government set ourselves. We have expanded by some 400,000 or 500,000 - subject to correction on the precise number - the number of child-care places. We have maintained the affordability of child care. In fact, the cost of child care immediately fell after the introduction of the new taxation system, and we have greatly expanded the opportunities for the women of Australia to participate in part-time work. I am particularly proud of the achievements of this government over the last seven years in providing choice to Australian parents in two very important areas. - One of those areas is the caring arrangements for their children, whether by a parent remaining at home full time or full time for a while and then part time or whether in paid child care. The other thing I am very proud of is the way in which we have expanded the choices available to Australian parents in the area of the education of their children. Despite the furious attempts of the Australian Labor Party at the time of the last election to generate an envy mentality in the Australian community, to revive the old class warfare about independent schools -  - I was expanding on the concept of choice, something the Labor Party has a lot of trouble grappling with. I remind the Australian Labor Party that the Labor Party has witnessed not only the expansion of choice for Australian parents via the family payment system - which has boosted the value of family benefits by about $13 billion - but, on top of that, this government preside over the massive expansion of choice available to Australian families in relation to the education of their children. The symbol of the failure of the class prejudice driven campaign of the Labor Party on this was the defeat of the former member for Dobell at the last election. He was the major spokesman for the envy brigade in this parliament before the last election, and he suffered the ignominy of losing his seat.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Mitchell for his questions. I am aware of a proposal from the New South Wales Greens to support a trial of controlled availability of heroin and other drugs of addiction from specifically licensed clinics to registered addicts. On behalf of the government, I denounce that policy. It is irresponsible. It is not in the interests of Australia, it is not in the interest of drug addicts and it runs completely counter to the experience of the Tough on Drugs campaign which has been carried out over the last four or five years. I congratulate the Leader of the Opposition in New South Wales for his spirited opposition to this policy and his principled disavowal of any preference deal between the coalition parties and the Greens. I call on the Premier of New South Wales to take the same principled approach to the allocation of preferences. I can remember, in another environment, plenty of sermons coming from the other side about the allocation of preferences. I condemn these proposals from the New South Wales Greens. They amount to the legalisation of illicit drugs and if they were ever introduced they would destroy efforts to rehabilitate people - young people in particular - who were using drugs and would send exactly the wrong message to young people. - I take the opportunity, in answering the question asked by the member for Mitchell, to record the government's gratitude for the recent advice from the National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre, which showed that fatal heroin overdoses in the 15- to 44-year-old age range fell by 58 per cent in 2001, following a fall of 24 per cent in 2000. I would be the first to acknowledge that you cannot assume from that that the problem has been solved. I do not make lavish claims, but I do claim that the whole basis of the more permissive policy advocated by the Greens - and, a couple of years ago, a somewhat more permissive policy advocated by sections of the Labor Party in New South Wales and elsewhere - was based on the proposition -  -  - People interjected at that. The opening of heroin injecting rooms represents, in my view and in the view of many people concerned with the drug issue, a more liberal, more permissive approach to the drug issue. That is exactly what I have in mind. The advocacy by some in the Labor Party around Australia of heroin trials represents another example of that. The whole basis of the argument that you should adopt a more permissive approach is that the current policy is not working. The evidence, such as it is, is that the current policy is beginning to work. The current policy should be given an opportunity of working more effectively and over a longer period of time before people start suggesting that it has been a failure. These figures - a drop of 58 per cent in the number of deaths in 2001 - are a clear indication that the Tough on Drugs policy is working. Since 1997 this government has committed $840 million to a Tough on Drugs strategy which balances law enforcement, drug treatment and education programs.Over the last three years there has been a 23 per cent reduction in the proportion of people reporting the use of illicit drugs. Over seven tonnes of illicit drugs have been seized, and these seizures and associated arrests have contributed to the disruption of major heroin importation and distribution networks. In the year from July 2000 to June 2001 there were 30,000 treatments provided to drug users by Tough on Drugs funded treatment services, and that was an increase from about 19,000 in the previous year. A further success was the 2001 National Illicit Drugs campaign. The evaluation of that campaign showed that 78 per cent of parents spoke to their children as a result of that campaign about the drug problem.Over the period that Tough on Drugs has been in operation, it has been variously sneered at and criticised by the members of the opposition. We have maintained our strong commitment to the Tough on Drugs campaign. It is tough on the drug peddlers, it is designed to educate young people against the dangers of starting illicit drug use and it is also designed to fill the gap that existed in the past in providing more rehabilitation services. I am pleased to say that, in the main, we have had the cooperation of state governments in the implementation of this program. I want to say emphatically on behalf of the government that there will be no relaxation of our support for the Tough on Drugs campaign. We believe the signs, tentative though they are, are that this campaign is working. That ought to be a source of hope and encouragement and not of political derision from all people involved in politics and concerned about the future of young people. I think the policy of the New South Wales Greens is a disgrace. I congratulate John Brogden for disavowing a preference deal with the New South Wales Greens, and I call upon Mr Carr to exhibit similar courage and leadership.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Jagajaga for her question and for drawing attention to a very important issue. The fact is that the Higher Education Contributions Scheme was introduced by the then Labor government in 1988-89, a very good initiative supported by the coalition then in opposition. It was introduced because the then Labor government realised that the only way that you could even hope to offer a university education to all Australians who wanted to get one was to introduce some form of user-pays, income-contingent payback system upon graduation. The facts are that today there are 1,800,433 Australians who owe the Commonwealth money in relation to HECS, the average HECS debt is $8,000, 91 per cent owe less than $16,000 and 80 per cent owe less than $12,000. I might also add that the university graduate leaves university with an average HECS debt of $15,000, and within 18 months every university graduate has earned more than all the money that they owe for their contribution to their education. They pay for one-quarter of it. So, overall, the total debt is $8,000. Pretend for a minute that I am Eddie McGuire on Who Wants to be a Millionaire. Of course I am a St Kilda supporter and I support the Swans in Sydney, but pretend I am on Who Wants to be a Millionaire. - For $8,000, (a), you can go to the Melbourne Trader and buy a 1992 Commodore VP V6 automatic with mags, an immobiliser and a 10-stack CD player; (b), you can have a three-month backpacking holiday in Asia and Europe with a Eurorail pass and $55 a day spending money; or, (c), you can get a university education. That is a pretty hard one. I think I will use the audience lifeline: if I want to earn a million dollars, am I most likely to get it from the 1992 Commodore car, the holiday or the university education? -  - There is a very serious point that needs to be made about university graduates - those Australians who have the privilege to have a university education and to have three-quarters of it paid for by Australian taxpayers, many of whom have never seen the inside of a university. The important point to be made is that their average lifetime earnings are, for men, $622,000 more and, for women, $413,000 more than the earnings of those who have not been to university; their lifetime unemployment rate is one-quarter that of those who have not been to university -  - and I might also add that graduates' starting salaries are 83½ per cent of average weekly earnings. The point is that, if you want Australian higher education to be affordable, to be accessible and, most importantly, to be of a world-class standard, it is critically important that we recognise that HECS is a program to be supported. It has expanded for the simple reason that there are more students in Australian universities. We have extended loans to postgraduate students, and we are now requiring students to meet some costs commensurate with their lifetime earning income.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Dobell for his question. I know that he is vitally interested in regional migration, representing as he does a very important regional area in New South Wales. He is very much aware, as I am sure most members are, that this government has had a record second to none in relation to obtaining a better dispersal of the migration outcome. In fact, over the last four years or so about 17,000 people have been influenced by the range of programs and initiatives that have been put in place to obtain that outcome.From 1 March this year the government introduced new business migration criteria to enable greater regional dispersal of business migrants. This initiative has as its key state sponsorship. It provides an opportunity to link prospective business migrants to state-specific economic and development objectives. It improves linkages with state and territory business services to help them successfully establish business ventures. In essence, this measure gives the states greater influence over the number and nature of business migrants who settle within their jurisdictions. Mr Speaker and colleagues, I want to assure you that this innovative approach is one which we will continue to implement, particularly with the assistance of state governments. - A good deal of interest has been expressed by state governments in working with us on these initiatives. One state that has particularly expressed a degree of interest in these matters is a state that has argued that the immigration program is much larger than it ought to be. In New South Wales the Premier has argued over a long period that Sydney is overburdened by migration and that, as a result, he wants to see a smaller program in New South Wales. He has gone out and argued for that. I met with him last year and I said to him, `I want to work with you on these issues. If there are too many people coming to Sydney, you ought to be working with these initiatives that will get a better dispersal of the migration program and you ought to be encouraging me in looking for as many - and as innovative - ways of achieving that as possible.' What have I heard since that time? There have been a number of meetings, but as I put items for discussion on the agenda he knocks them off.One of the things that has particularly surprised me is that the New South Wales government wants to be schizophrenic about development. On the one hand it argues that it wants Sydney to be a financial hub and on the other hand it argues that it should be a centre for regional headquarters. But you can do that without people. You can have it as a financial hub and you can have it as a regional headquarters, but you can do it without people. In fact, the only area of the migration program in which Premier Carr has expressed any interest in cutting back is skilled migration. The reality of that is that, even if people have established businesses in Sydney, they are not going to stop bringing in people to do the work that is necessary; they are still going to bring them in, even if they have to bring them from interstate. It will not stop the impact of people in Sydney.The one area in which the state could have an influence is in relation to other areas of migration. It could, if it wished, focus on, say, enhanced sponsorship arrangements for family migrants if they were prepared to settle regionally as against in New South Wales or Sydney. That measure would have an impact, but I suspect he thinks it would have an impact upon the intentions of voters in the New South Wales election - because sponsors have votes. It really means that Premier Carr is out there arguing, day after day, that you could have some impact on the inability of New South Wales to deal with planning issues and the needs and aspirations of the people of Sydney by reducing migration overall; but, when he is asked to put up in relation to initiatives that could produce an effective dispersal of migration in Sydney, he runs away from them.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Perth for his very helpful question on this very important issue. The issues raised by bulk-billing are important, and I think the first thing we should do is understand the original design of bulk-billing. Then we can come to the question of comparisons between -  - the bulk-billing rates under the former government and those under this government. Then we can come, in conclusion, to a comparison between the future policy of this government and that of the alternative government of this country. I think it is worth while to go back to the introduction of the Medicare system, which followed the election of the Hawke government in 1983. This is what the policy that was taken to the 1983 election had to say that is relevant to this issue:Doctors will be free to choose their method of billing the patient. They can charge the patient nothing and recover 85% of the scheduled fee directly from the public funds. It is expected that doctors will use this bulk billing procedure for pensioners, low income patients, the chronically ill and those in need.I will come to another quote about bulk-billing, from 1987, that is also relevant. This is a very important public policy issue, and I would have thought that the Labor Party would want to be sensibly engaged on it. It was never intended by Labor, when it introduced the Medicare scheme, to guarantee the universal availability - or even the high availability - of bulk-billing for people who were not pensioners, low-income patients, chronically ill or in need. In 1987, Dr Blewett had this to say:What we have mostly in this country is not doctors exploiting bulk-billing but compassionate doctors using the bulk-billing facility to treat pensioners, the disadvantaged and others who are not well off or who are in great need of medical services, which was always the intention.According to my advice, the average rate of bulk-billing for GP services when Labor was in office was slightly below 68 per cent - therefore, it was less than its current level. In the 1991 budget, when the bulk-billing rate was around its present level, Labor could not have cared less about bulk-billing. In fact, in 1991 the then minister for health wanted to introduce a copayment of $5. Brian Howe, who in many respects was responsible for some good social policy, said:I am aware of reports which say that this charge will discourage bulk-billing and encourage doctors to lift their fees. I must stress that the Government does not control or determine doctors' charges or whether they bulk bill or raise an account to the patient.In other words, he said that was not a matter for the government to control. He was endorsing the long-held view that the purpose of bulk-billing was to protect the less well-off. It was never the intention of the Labor Party then - and it was not the view of the opposition then, nor is it the view of the coalition in government now - that it should be an aim of policy to universally guarantee bulk-billing to everybody in the community, including people on very generous incomes.I am advised that bulk-billing rates remain very high for disadvantaged groups. Bulk-billing rates in the most disadvantaged 10 per cent of areas throughout Australia have averaged above 90 per cent since 1996-97, and bulk-billing rates for patients aged 65 years and older have averaged above 80 per cent - that includes not only disadvantaged people over 65 but all people over 65 since 1996-97.As I indicated yesterday, there are some deficiencies, particularly in rural and outer metropolitan areas, largely because of the shortage of doctors in those areas. This issue has been brought to my attention by members sitting behind me, because most of the rural and outer metropolitan areas are represented by coalition members on this side of the House. The government are currently turning our mind to a number of policy responses to address that issue. I want to make it very clear that it was never the policy of the former government, and it has not been the policy of this government, that we can in all circumstances guarantee bulk-billing for everybody. That is simply not possible. What we can do is commit ourselves to the maintenance of a high availability of bulk-billing for the less fortunate and for concession cardholders in our community. That has been very much not only the policy but also the practice of this government in the time that we have been in office.That brings me to policy alternatives. Policy alternatives are fascinating. We saw policy alternatives on display yesterday from the Leader of the Opposition. Not only did he get his gym shoes and his CD-ROMs wrong - ignoring the fact that that issue had been addressed several weeks ago - but this morning he attacked the private health insurance rebate. The Leader of the Opposition said that there was something radically wrong with the private health insurance rebate. I think most people in Australia are getting suspicious that, if the Leader of the Opposition had his way, he would abolish the private health insurance rebate. His colleague from Perth not only wants to abolish the private health tax break but also wants to increase the Medicare levy. That is what the member for Perth wants to do. Over the past few days, the Leader of the Opposition has earned himself the reputation of being a serial mistake-maker. He had a few problems with the strategic missile defence system when he talked about it being based on nuclear weapons. He made a few mistakes about its alleged nonavailability to countries other than the United States. On top of that, this is what he had to say at a doorstop this morning -  - No, it is about the private health insurance rebate. This is what he had to say:Yes, there are other areas in terms of the private health rebate. If you look at the $2.3 billion, even Mr Schneider - who is the Director of the Australian Health Insurance Association - admits that only $700 million out of $2.3 billion goes into hospitals.Wrong! The amount that goes to hospitals is $1.537 billion, or 71 per cent of the total amount. I made some inquiries and I am informed that Mr Schneider denies having made that claim. The reality is that the Leader of the Opposition wants to get rid of the private health insurance rebate, and the member for Perth wants to increase the Medicare levy. Gradually, bit by bit, the alternative health policy of the Australian Labor Party is coming on-stream. It is not a very impressive health policy, and it is no wonder. The Leader of the Opposition does not even understand the fundamentals of the existing health policy, so how on earth has he got any hope of constructing a logical alternative?</DOC>

 - I can inform the member for Aston, and other members of the House, that this coalition has been determined to reform the unfair dismissal laws ever since they first entered the federal jurisdiction in 1993. This government received a mandate at three elections to reform the unfair dismissal laws. Three times it received a mandate for reform, but that mandate has been frustrated 27 times - at the last count - by blocking votes from members of the Australian Labor Party.  I should inform members opposite that the respected Melbourne Institute for Applied Social and Economic Research produced late last year some new evidence about the economic consequences of the unfair dismissal laws. According to this research, the unfair dismissal laws as they stand mean that 12 per cent of businesses make greater use of fixed-term employment contracts; 21 per cent of businesses are more likely to employ casual staff rather than permanent staff; and 40 per cent of businesses say that the unfair dismissal laws make it less likely that they will employ unemployed people. These are the unfair outcomes of the unfair dismissal laws.The Melbourne institute concluded that the unfair dismissal laws have cost business $1.3 billion and have played a role in the loss of 77,000 jobs. It also concluded that the unfair dismissal laws have reduced employment by nearly one half of a per cent, resulting in a cut in jobs of nearly 50,000. I know this kind of economic modelling is an inexact science, but plainly it shows that, if you are serious about getting unemployment down, you have to be serious about reforming the unfair dismissal laws. Members opposite who have studied this situation know that we have to change the unfair dismissal laws. For instance, the well-known and well-informed member on this matter - the member for Hunter - has said:Well my wife consistently tells me -  this is the lady who can't join the Labor Party because she is not a member of a union - she could afford to put on one person or would like to put on one more person, but is fearful of unfair dismissals, she is fearful of going through the barrier to another level of red tape and regulation. All those perceptions are out there, all of them are well founded ...Good on the member for Hunter! He is not always right but he is dead right about this. I would respectfully suggest to the 64 per cent of Labor senators who are former union officials that they ought to listen to the member for Hunter, they ought to put the workers' interest ahead of the union interest and they ought to pass the government's fair dismissal laws in the Senate today.</DOC>

 - Let me make it very clear to the shadow minister that in the 13 years under a Labor government executive pay was not controlled. Not only was executive pay not controlled but basic award earnings, thanks to the Leader of the Opposition's accord policy, fell by -  -  - This government does not believe in regulating executive salaries - just as members opposite did not believe in regulating executive salaries when they were in government. When it comes to low-paid workers, this government has given the low-paid workers of Australia a seven per cent real increase. That compares with a five per cent real decrease when members opposite were in power. -  - As for executive payouts, like the Treasurer and like the Prime Minister, I believe that many of these executive payouts are a cause for grave concern. I think it is very important that directors and shareholders pay greater attention to executive payouts. For that reason, I am very pleased that the Australian Stock Exchange is going to make it compulsory for these things to be disclosed.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Moore for his question. He knows what small business is about - he worked in small business. He would certainly be a rare find if he were a member of the Labor Party. Strike action and industrial thuggery by militant trade unions causes untold grief to the wider community and of course particularly to small business. On the weekend we heard of the union movement's threats to disrupt Australia's ports. This is a direct threat to the exporters of Australia's 1.1 million small businesses. Victorian Trades Hall Secretary Leigh Hubbard was quoted talking about blocking essential supplies for any Australian troops in Iraq. He said that the union movement has to look at the issue.A spokeswoman for the ACTU claimed that it was all a bit of a beat-up. It is not a beat-up for the CFMEU National Secretary John Maitland to call for national stoppages over military involvement in Iraq. It is not a beat-up for the MUA's Western Australian Secretary Wally Pritchard to refuse to rule out disrupting troop supplies in the event of conflict with Iraq. It is not a beat-up for the Newcastle Trades Hall Council Secretary Gary Kennedy, in a direct threat, to call for civil disobedience and breaking the law if necessary in the event of a possible war with Iraq. And it is not a beat-up for the head of UnionsWA Dave Robinson to refuse to guarantee supplying the troops in the event of a conflict with Iraq. It is a clear campaign from the Labor Party and a clear campaign from the union movement. It did not happen during Gulf War I - why is it happening now? This is union militancy cutting directly to the core of Australian activity. It does have an impact on the wider community and it does have an impact on small business.The Leader of the Opposition is fond of running with the hares and hunting with the hounds. He would say one thing about stamping down on the trade unions in the event of these sorts of threats. We are providing the Leader of the Opposition with a real and tangible way of standing up to the unions. Before the Senate we have the small business protection bill. That bill has been to the Senate on two or three previous occasions, and the Labor Party continues to oppose it with the support of the Democrats. That bill is about giving ACCC protection to Australia's 1.1 million small businesses should they become the innocent victims of a sympathy strike. That bill is going back to the Senate for a vote in the next week. It is truth or tell time for the Leader of the Opposition; it is time to tell the truth or it is time to tell a lie. The Leader of the Opposition has a choice: he can stand up for the workers of Australia, small business and the wider community or, as he has shown, he can stand up for his mates in the union movement.</DOC>

 - The answer to the first question is yes. The answer to the second question is yes. The answer to the third question is that the Leader of the Opposition has got it all wrong. -  He has got it all wrong because the proposition behind the Leader of the Opposition's question is that universality equals a situation where, effectively, bulk-billing is required to be made available to everybody. That was never in contemplation. Can I take the Leader of the Opposition back to 10 October 1984. - The member for Lilley laughs. I am quoting from the speech of then health minister Dr Neal Blewett when he introduced the Medicare system. Medicare was introduced in 1984; Medibank was introduced in 1972 by the Whitlam government. I remember both events.An incident having occurred in the gallery -  - No, I am going to sit down while this is on. - No, I am not going to. Get the House in order. In introducing the Medicare scheme, the then government made it perfectly clear that bulk-billing was intended to be made available for the less well-off in the community. - The whole structure of the Medicare scheme was that it should be available for the less well-off in the community. Let me read from the speech of Dr Neal Blewett. - One year after Medicare was introduced, this is what Dr Blewett had to say:This scheme is about the less well off in our society. We have said to every doctor in the country that he is free to bulk bill any patient he wishes. We have indicated particularly to doctors that the people who are chronically ill, the people who most regularly go to doctors, are the most appropriate people to be bulk billed. That was not allowed under the old scheme. There was no automatic provision for bulk billing for these people, as there is under this scheme.We have said that for families with young children who may have a lot of illness doctors can bulk bill and we will automatically pay the 85 per cent. For the mass of people we have improved the situation by giving them automatic gap protection.He went on to say in that same speech:We have given the less well off in our society the opportunity to be bulk billed by their doctors. I am glad to say that a significant proportion of the medical profession has taken up that challenge and that something like 45 per cent of all services are bulk billed under Medicare.That speech, made by the then health minister, Dr Neal Blewett, one year after Medicare was introduced - if you look at the second reading speech of the relevant legislation - makes it perfectly clear that Dr Blewett was not asserting the proposition put to me by the Leader of the Opposition. What was being argued then was that bulk-billing should be available to certain groups in the community. When I gave the undertaking that the Leader of the Opposition has referred to, I knew what the policy was, and that undertaking has been kept to in full. This government has maintained Medicare, despite all of the allegations that were made. We have maintained the universal principles of Medicare. - We have maintained the universality of Medicare. The universality of Medicare never embraced, when it was introduced by the Labor Party, what the Leader of the Opposition is saying it did. The Leader of the Opposition is, 20 years after the event, putting words into the mouths of the authors of Medicare that were not put there in 1984. Can I say to the House that we have maintained Medicare, we have improved Medicare, we have subsidised the taking-up of private health insurance and we have expanded the health opportunities and the health situation of Australians. As I have indicated to the House, we are addressing some aspects of bulk-billing which are clearly under strain as a result of the lack of supply of doctors in outer metropolitan and rural areas. When we have completed that examination, there will be something said about it. Can I say to the Australian people: as I promised in 1995,we support Medicare; we always will. We support its universality and we reject the dishonest rewriting of what Medicare was meant to include by the Leader of the Opposition.</DOC>

 - First of all, can I thank the honourable member for Page for his question and for the interest he shows in our relationship with the Philippines. Can I also say that I am delighted to see in the gallery the Philippines Secretary of Foreign Affairs, Blas Ople. He is enormously welcome in our country today. I am sure all members agree with me when I say we are delighted to see him. This morning, the foreign secretary and I signed a memorandum of understanding on combating international terrorism. We are delighted to sign such an agreement with the Philippines, particularly as Australia and the Philippines enjoy such strong and longstanding bilateral relations. We have substantial trade links, we have a very significant defence cooperation relationship, we cooperate closely on security issues more generally, we have a development assistance program in the Philippines and I think honourable members know we have very substantial people-to-people ties.The conclusion of this memorandum of understanding on counter-terrorism is a very important development in the relationship between Australia and the Philippines, and it demonstrates the commitment of both countries - countries which have been victims of acts of terrorism - to fighting terrorism. The terrible tragedy of the Bali bombings and the various threats made against our embassies in the region over the past two years have brought home to us the serious nature of the threat of terrorism. I note from the press conference the foreign secretary and I held today the Philippines' particular pleasure at the capture of Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, whose activities have included a planned attempt to assassinate the pope in I think 1995 as well as an attempt to hijack some 12 American airliners flying from South-East Asia to the United States. The capture of Khalid Shaikh Mohammed is a matter of great comfort not only to us in this country but also I think very significantly to the Philippines.As we have said on many occasions, if we are going to be successful in combating terrorism internationally, it cannot be done by any one or two countries acting alone. There has to be international cooperation, and we as a government are focused very much on that. In February last year, the Prime Minister was in Jakarta and the memorandum of understanding on counter-terrorism was signed with the Indonesian government. We now also have counter-terrorism memoranda of understanding with Malaysia and Thailand and hope to enter into like agreements with Fiji and India. This simply underlines the growing level of cooperation in the region on combating terrorism. I am sure that, through this arrangement with the Philippines, there will be much better exchanges of information and intelligence, there will be capacity building through training, education and technical assistance and there will be much closer cooperation between our customs, immigration and even transport authorities. As I said, we are delighted to have the foreign secretary of the Philippines, Blas Ople, here in Australia. I know all members of the House will be delighted to see him here and to see this further and very substantial strengthening of our relationship with the Philippines.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Sturt for his question. I can inform the House that the OECD released its assessment and recommendations in relation to Australia overnight in Paris. The OECD is the organisation to which the developed economies of the world belong. It shares economic assessments between those countries and provides independent recommendations. I will read to the House the finding of the OECD on the Australian economy:Dogged pursuit of structural reforms across a very broad front, and prudent macroeconomic policies ... have combined to make the Australian economy one of the best performers in the OECD, and also one notably resilient to shocks, both internal and external. Incomes growth has remained brisk, employment is expanding, inflation is under control, and public finances are healthy.I take it that both sides of the House will welcome the fact that the independent OECD has found that the Australian economy continues to be one of the best performers in the OECD. I have seen some in the opposition who appeared a little disappointed that the OECD had made such a finding. I will go on to make the point that the OECD does not just make an assessment of an economy, it makes recommendations as to how things could be improved. And it is very important that we look at some of the recommendations that the OECD has made about improving Australia's economy. I will just go to two. The first one says:... spending on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme - the fastest growing component of the health care spending - and developing a more affordable and better targeted aged care system, are essential for containing spending pressures ...What does the OECD say that Australia could improve? Australia could improve the management of its pharmaceutical benefits scheme. Which side of politics is working on that recommendation? This side of politics is working on that. What did the OECD also recommend? The OECD also recommended tightening eligibility requirements for the disability support pension - again, a measure which this government put down in last year's budget. We await the Senate - and the oppositionism of the opposition in the Senate - to try and get those important reforms through.Yesterday the Labor Party said that it was concerned about the balance of payments. As I noted yesterday, the drought is biting very deeply into our balance of payments but a political party that was concerned about areas where the Australian economy could be improved would be a political party supporting this government's reform measure. What do we get? We get Simon and the Creanites sitting over there on the other side of the parliament voting against everything that could improve Australia's prospects.I say to the Australian Labor Party and the Senate that the benefits that we have in the Australian economy today are from the reforms that we have put in place over a number of years. The reforms we put in place today will drive Australia's prospects in future years and the coalition wants to give Australians better opportunities. That is what the Liberal and the National parties stand for; not the mindless oppositionism of Simon and the Creanites. I have noticed that the Financial Review has been doing a retrospective on economic reform in Australia. - When I talk about those people who stand against economic reforms I refer to the member for Hotham and the member for Batman. The expression `Creanite' was not one of mine but one of the former Prime Minister, Mr Paul Keating. -  - As I said, I refer of course to the members for Hotham and Batman when I talk about those who oppose economic reform in Australia. In the retrospective that I notice the Financial Review has been doing on the days when the Labor Party had economic policy in its mind, Mr Keating bemoaned the fact that, since leaving office, Labor has shrunk away from economic responsibility. He said this:More's the pity that the Labor Party between 1996 and certainly 2000, vacated the field of competition and productivity.That is what Mr Keating said. When the Labor Party decided to dumb down and go oppositionist, the Labor Party vacated the field in this country. This government has had to pick up the ball in relation to all of those hard areas - like GST, like labour markets, like the PBS, like disability - and drive those reforms forward. So what could the Labor Party do in the interests of Australia? Get out of the way. Stop blocking these measures in the Senate.You do not actually have to take the word of the coalition in relation to this. The OECD, overnight, has recommended measures in relation to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and the disability support pension. We could be in a position where we bring down this year's budget without the Labor Party having voted on last year's budget measures. We could be in a position where those reforms have been held up for more than 12 months. Those of us who want job opportunities for young Australians - and a country that gives them all the benefits, which we form a tax base to fund - are the people in the Liberal and National parties. We intend to drive economic reform because we intend to make Australia the greatest place it can be.</DOC>

 - I have not seen the quote of the former health minister. Whilst I can recall the quotes I have made, I do not take it upon myself to endorse a version of quotes made by my colleagues. Whether that quote was accurately reported or not, what I said earlier stands. That is, the universality of Medicare has been retained by this government and the universality of Medicare never embraced, in the eyes of those who formed Medicare, the notion that you have put forward. It never did.As far as the government are concerned, we intend in the very near future to address a number of the strains that exist in relation to the bulk-billing system. There are difficulties in some of the outer metropolitan and rural areas of Australia but, as I indicated yesterday, it is simply not possible for the government - it has never been possible for this government and it was never the design or within the contemplation of the former government - to guarantee bulk-billing for every Australian citizen. That is not my understanding of universality. It never has been, it is not and it never will be.It was not the understanding of universality put forward by those who formed Medicare. Why else would Dr Blewett have spoken as he did when he addressed the parliament in 1984? Why else would Dr Blewett have spoken of the scheme being introduced for the less well-off in our society? We have said to every doctor in the country that he is free to bulk-bill any patient he wishes. We have particularly indicated to doctors that the people who are chronically ill and the people who most regularly go to doctors are the most appropriate people to be bulk-billed. Why, if bulk-billing was meant to be available to every citizen, did Dr Blewett use that language?We are talking about what bulk-billing means. I go back to the words of the author of the Medicare system. The author of the Medicare system was Dr Blewett. He was the health minister in 1984, and when he introduced the scheme he clearly did not have in contemplation a guarantee that every citizen would have available the benefits of bulk-billing. If that were the case, why did he include the following in the legislation establishing the scheme? Clause 12 of the bill set out the rate of Medicare benefits and went on to say that that rate would be 85 per cent of the scheduled fee, with a maximum patient payment of $10 for any one item where the scheduled fee was charged.If the original design of Medicare was that universality of bulk-billing would be the norm - in other words, that every single citizen would be entitled to bulk-billing - why did the author of Medicare put in the legislation a maximum patient charge of $10? If you have bulk-billing, you do not have a patient charge. The whole idea of bulk-billing is that you are paid directly by the government, and there is no over-the-counter cost to the patient. That is the whole principle of bulk-billing. The Labor Party is now trying to say that Medicare always envisaged that every single person would have the benefit of that facility, yet the founding legislation contemplated a cap being imposed upon the patient contribution. In other words, the assertion being made by the Leader of the Opposition is contradicted by the Labor founder of the Medicare system itself.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Ryan for his question. I recognise the extensive number of exporters in his electorate that have access to a number of government programs, including the EMDG Scheme, which has helped a lot of his exporters to participate in the growth in exports from Australia. This morning, the Australian Bureau of Statistics released the balance of trade figures for January, which indicated that, compared with December, there has been a $700 million increase in Australia's exports. There has been quite a significant turnaround from the December figure. It also indicated a $929 million decline in imports, which saw a massive turnaround in the balance of trade. Exports for January were valued at $13.2 billion, which was a six per cent increase on December 2002 and the highest monthly figure since June 2001. It proves correct some of the comments that were made in the OECD report about the Australian economy, which was released today. The report said:A judicious mix of macroeconomic structural policies has resulted in exceptional economic performance, which is expected to continue.While this country is in the grips of arguably the worst drought in 100 years, and facing a very soft global economy, we have managed to turn around the export performance by $700 million. - Those opposite would do well to be reminded that, when they left office, $99 billion worth of goods and services were exported out of Australia, and we are now exporting about $152 billion worth of goods and services. This has been achieved whilst we have been in the grips of a drought. There has been a decline in rural exports, as has been indicated by a number of commentators and in the ABARE report out today.We need to recognise that the export sector helps to sustain those jobs we have in Australia. There have been 1.3 million jobs created since 1996. One in five jobs in the job market relies on exports, and one in four jobs in regional Australia relies on exports. In 2001-02, the number of exporters in Australia grew by 6,450 - in 2001-02, there were 6,450 new operators actively engaged in the export market. There was a 25 per cent increase in the number of exporters earning export income for our country. Exporting companies are generating jobs and income and developing infrastructure and production facilities. The government's sound economic management over the last six or seven years - which had been opposed by the Creanites and the Labor Party every inch of the way - has created an environment that has enabled our export sector to grow and strengthen. I have given you the statistics that show where we have grown to today.Australia's ability to weather the current global slowdown is largely a result of the hard efforts of the Australian community putting in place and capitalising on the reforms that our government have implemented during our term in office - reforms that have been opposed every inch of the way by the Australian Labor Party. What are the indications for the future? I quote the OECD report again, and the Labor Party would do well to listen:All the indications are that the continuing effects of previous reforms will continue to help the economy to combat shocks in the immediate future. In order to meet the longer-term objective of raising living standards towards the highest in the OECD, further reforms to labour, product and financial markets and to social policies will be needed, that will encourage more people to join the labour force, remain in it, and steadily raise their productivity.So there is the challenge from the OECD. That is the challenge that our government - the Liberal and National parties - are meeting with the policies that we are putting in place and the reforms we are proposing to implement in the Australian economy. These reforms are being opposed every inch of the way by the Australian Labor Party. We all remember when they were in office. On a weekly basis they quoted the OECD. There is the challenge from the OECD: for the Labor Party to support the policies and the legislation we want to put in place to make Australia a much stronger economy in the future.</DOC>

 - The government has delivered in full on the commitments I made in relation to Medicare and its universality - absolutely. The universality of Medicare has been maintained. Any reading of the original Medicare system, which was introduced by the Labor Party, would confirm that it was a scheme built upon the universality of a rebate to all people treated by doctors, free treatment in public hospitals and the maintenance of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. That has been maintained. It is true that, after its introduction in the 1980s, the then coalition parties opposed Medicare. - But it is also true that prior to the 1996 election, and in fact on or about the dates cited by the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Perth, I indicated that the coalition would, if elected, maintain the Medicare system. That is what we have done. We have maintained full faith with respect to the commitment that we have made. - As I indicated yesterday, the average bulk-billing rates under the former government were no greater than they have been under this government. If you are arguing that, because 100 per cent of people are not bulk-billed, that is some breach of the universality of Medicare, I remind you that you never had universal Medicare in 13 years. That is not the universality of Medicare, and those members who sit opposite know that. The member for Perth has been talkative on this subject. He has also been talkative on the subject of tax increases. In a doorstop on 27 February 2003, this is what the member for Perth had to say -   - On 27 February 2003, in a doorstop in Perth, the member for Perth had this to say:I've made the point consistently as I again do today. We've got the health rebate, the 30 per cent rebate, under review.The opposition certainly have got the 30 per cent rebate under review. They have it more than under review; they have the 30 per cent tax rebate for private health insurance in their gun sights - if they ever get into government. - The spokesman for Health on the other side not only started talking about cutting a tax concession; he then went on to talk about tax increases. He had this to say:The Medicare levy is well regarded by Australians because they can see directly where the money goes. And so whilst no government or opposition wants to be talking about increases in taxation, if you have a look at any areas of increase so far as raising funds for health purposes are concerned, then I think you've got more chance of getting community support for that by using the levy because the public can see directly where the funds go. There is a burst of candour from the member for Perth. He was saying that it is his policy to lift the Medicare levy in order to get more money for health. At least I give him a tick for being honest. He then went on to say:I think it is the case that if there are increases in the Medicare levy, provided that the community - the public - can see exactly where those funds go and if they go directly to a health outcome, then you've got more chance of getting support for that than a general taxation increase.In anybody's language, the member for Perth is saying two things. He is saying that the 30 per cent tax rebate is open for business, as far as the future Labor government is concerned: `We'll get stuck into that, and we'll use some of that.' He is also saying that a future Labor government would contemplate increases in the Medicare levy. I give the member for Perth full marks for being candid. It is more than I would give his leader because his leader, in what must rank as an extraordinarily inept interview on the Sunrise program, said, `I've got no plans to increase the Medicare levy - no plans at all.' While the Leader of the Opposition has ruled it out, the member for Perth has ruled it in. He then went on to confirm that the tax rebate for health insurance did remain under review. He then pretended that only $700 million of the $2.3 billion collected went to hospitals - something that anybody who has a basic understanding of the situation would know is absolutely untrue.The government remain committed to Medicare, and we have been committed to Medicare since we have been in power. The universality of Medicare has been maintained under this government. We will be considering ways of addressing some of the strains that are being exhibited in relation to bulk-billing in outer metropolitan and rural areas of Australia. When that consideration has been completed, we will have something further to say to the Australian people.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Macquarie for his question. As members are very much aware, the OECD has just released its regular economic survey of Australia. For the very first time it includes a chapter on the economics of migration as it pertains to Australia. The OECD found Australia to be an immigration country par excellence. It found that Australia's current immigration policies have been successful in improving the economic return to Australia. It attributed this to our selection policies with their emphasis on skilled entry and to our successful approach to the settlement of new migrants. It noted that the Australian immigration system is one of the most sophisticated in the world in the degree of detailed information used to enable the selection to take place. It also noted that our system is based upon academic research. It is focused increasingly on selecting migrants that will increase the existing incomes of Australians and avoid budgetary costs.Of course, that endorsement by the OECD reflects the reforms made since 1995-96 by this government. These reforms include the rebalancing of the migration program towards skilled entry, the strengthening of the points test and the targeting of skills for including states, territories and regions of Australia. The program for 2003 will be the most highly skilled and largest program in a decade. I think that is further evidence of the path that the OECD has identified and is encouraging others to adopt in relation to using migration as an effective economic tool.The migrants themselves are doing considerably better. If you compare those who came in 1993-95 against those who came in 1999-2000, the unemployment rate experienced by migrants 18 months after arrival has now been halved. In other words, they have an unemployment rate that is close to the national average, and that is a very significant improvement. Nearly 50 per cent have a higher income and we have very high labour force participation rates as well. The evidence is there to demonstrate that the reforms to the migration program have benefited migrants and benefited other Australians. It has not in any way diminished our capacity to respond to genuine close family reunion claims. It has not in any way diminished our capacity to assist with the resettlement of refugees and others in humanitarian need, but it has brought about substantial economic benefits for Australia. The report of the OECD is a report by an independent arbiter that demonstrates just that.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker -  - The truth is that bulk-billing has never been available for all Australians. It was not available for all Australians under the Labor government and it has not been under this government. - The Leader of the Opposition knows that -  - I will repeat what I said to the Leader of the Opposition. The bulk-billing system has remained as available under this government as it was under the former government. - I can only - as I think the House would expect me to - deal in reality and not in misrepresentations and fantasies. The truth is that bulk-billing has been as available under this government as it was under the former government. - In fact, the Leader of the Opposition asked me a question based upon an interview I had on the Sunday program when I was Leader of the Opposition. The question quoted by the Leader of the Opposition was that the interviewer apparently said to me: `Fraser made certain statements, and changes occurred. What guarantee do we have that you won't change Medicare and you won't change bulk-billing?' In answer to that, I ask the House to look at what has happened over the last seven years. Forget the political rhetoric; have a look at what has happened. We have now been in power for seven years, and I ask the House: has the Medicare system been retained intact? Yes, it has. Has the Medicare system been strengthened by the introduction of greater incentives for private health insurance? Yes, it has. - The Leader of the Opposition says no. In other words, the Leader of the Opposition does not want the Australian people to have the choice, supported by a $2.3 billion tax incentive, that private health insurance affords. Let me return to the issue of bulk-billing, which has so preoccupied the Leader of the Opposition. Let me repeat the simple unassailable fact that bulk-billing has been as available under this government as it was under the former government. -  - Those in opposition shout out, `No, it hasn't,' but let us have a look at the figures. The average utilisation of bulk-billing under the former government was no higher than what it has been under this government. I repeat: the average availability of bulk-billing under the former government was no greater - in fact, I think it was one percentage point less - under the former government than it has been under this government. We have not tinkered with Medicare. We have maintained and strengthened Medicare. We have maintained the availability of bulk-billing. - We recognise that the principal reason for bulk-billing was, in the words of Dr Blewett, to assist the less well-off in the community. I agree with Dr Blewett. We will continue to maintain the integrity and the universality of Medicare, and we will address any deficiencies that emerge in relation to bulk-billing.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Indi for her question. She, like other members, will be pleased about the rain that has been falling in quite a number of parts of Australia. It certainly has made a significant difference to a number of farmers. I was pleased to be in the electorates of the honourable members for Gilmore and Cowper last week, and it was good to see the way the areas have greened up. It encourages people in country areas - it lifts their spirits - when it starts to rain. But we do know that it is going to take more rain in most areas before the drought can be said to be broken and, indeed, there are some areas where there has not been any relief at all. The federal government recognises, though, that after a drought it takes time for farmers to recover, and that is why, under our exceptional circumstances arrangements, assistance will be in place for two years to help farmers through that recovery phase.The honourable member asked about the number of farmers currently receiving benefits. As of today, close to 6,000 farmers are receiving Commonwealth assistance, and over $64 million has already been paid out in direct payments to farmers - real cash in their hands at a critical time whey they need assistance with the extra costs associated with this disastrous drought. In total, the Commonwealth has committed to something like $900 million in special assistance and EC payments to farmers on the basis of the applications that have already been received.However, the government continues to receive applications from the states for new exceptional circumstances areas. Today I have referred to the National Rural Advisory Council for their consideration applications from the eastern Riverina, the Northern Tablelands - including parts of the Gloucester Rural Lands Protection Board - and parts of northern New England. Last week an application from the Sunshine Coast area in the electorates of the honourable members for Fairfax, Fisher and Blair was referred for consideration, and the farmers in that area of the Sunshine Coast are now eligible for interim assistance while their application is under consideration.The federal government are standing by farmers during these tough times. We are there to lend a helping hand and to ensure that they have a capacity to survive the drought and hopefully return quickly to productivity when the rain has fallen. That contrasts sharply with what is happening in the states. Without exception, the states have made a miserable effort in assistance to Australian farmers, providing only the most paltry of assistance. In Victoria there was a worthwhile initiative taken by the Victorian government to provide cash grants to farmers in need, and I know the honourable member for Indi was as disgusted and appalled as all others were when, as soon as the Victorian election was over, the state government axed those benefits for the most needy Victorian farmers. It was a disgraceful and shameful act. Without warning, the measures were simply abolished when the election was out of the way. And it gets worse. Today Mr Cameron, the new state minister in Victoria, is actually asking the Commonwealth to declare EC for another 40 shires in Victoria even though he has not lodged an application for EC assistance. The only reason he wants to do that is so that he can get out of giving more assistance from the Victorian government to the farmers of the state. That is an absolutely shameful approach that Victoria has taken to these issues.Do you think that they have actually learnt from, or are ashamed about, what they have done? Far from it. The Victorian Premier was on ABC radio on 25 February. When he was asked why they had axed their drought relief immediately after the state election, he said:I am hopeful that other states will change in accord with what we have done. I think what we have done has been on the basis of very good sound advice.So he is actually proud of having withdrawn the assistance without warning - and he is giving advice to other premiers that they should follow suit. I am sure the farmers of New South Wales across the river will be watching, because there is an election coming up very soon and they are hearing the advice from the Victorian Premier, who is flushed with electoral success, that what you do straight after an election is to axe the assistance that you promised before the poll. That is the way Labor treat farmers. That is the way they consider that assistance should be provided. It is all well and good before an election but, once the election is over, that is the end of it. They drip in a tiny bit of assistance before the election but straight after the election the tap is turned off. New South Wales farmers certainly need to be aware that Labor have form on this issue. Labor have policy on this issue. Their last successful premier is telling the other premiers that they should axe their state assistance, and that is what New South Wales farmers can look forward to if New South Wales returns a Labor government in a couple of weeks time.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I have had no forewarning of when the next shipment of spent fuel rods will depart from Lucas Heights in Sydney for reprocessing by COGEMA in France. I am not expecting that to happen for some time yet. I can assure the honourable member that all the security that has guaranteed the safe shipment of previous spent fuel rods to France will apply. There may well be heightened security, given the events that have occurred since the last shipment, which was at least two years ago. I should stress that the government places the greatest importance on safety and security at the Lucas Heights Science and Technology Centre.The government take advice, principally from ASIO, in regard to maintaining, expanding and enhancing our security measures and our security awareness at the facility. Details of these measures must necessarily remain confidential to ensure their effectiveness; however, at the site itself they include strengthened physical security measures and enhanced guarding arrangements by the Australian Protective Service. I will inquire into the particular aspect of transport that the member has raised, which is the security of the containers themselves. But I reassure the member for Cunningham that nothing, in either the transport or the operation of the Lucas Heights research reactor, is left to chance. We take advice, we constantly assess and review security and we act accordingly. I will get back to the honourable member on the particularities.</DOC>

 - In answering the member for Petrie, I should acknowledge that the precise role of trade unions is often the subject of some controversy in this House. Even so, here in Australia, by general consent, trade unions have a vital role in our workplace relations system and they enjoy full freedom under the law in accordance with the freedom under the law that is enjoyed by all Australian citizens, individually and collectively. Unfortunately, I can report to the member for Petrie that freedom under the law is certainly not enjoyed by trade unions or unionists in Iraq. Saddam Hussein has taken the same bloodthirsty approach to unions and unionists that he has taken to the Kurds, to the Marsh Arabs and to people in neighbouring countries - indeed, to anyone who questions his absolute power.Almost Saddam Hussein's first act on assuming power was to personally execute dozens of Iraq's leading citizens - including, it is reported, the then head of the Iraqi trade union movement. In 1991, the ILO reported that at least one Kuwaiti trade union leader was murdered in cold blood before his own family and that 23 other Kuwaiti trade union officials had disappeared at the hands of Saddam's death squads. In 1999 it was reported that Uday Hussein, who Saddam hand-picked to head the Iraqi journalists union, had sacked hundreds of media workers because he said they did not sufficiently enthusiastically support the regime. Also in that year, Uday Hussein jailed four student union leaders because they had not sufficiently severely cracked down on dissident students inside Iraq.Members opposite would be well aware of the words of Ben Chifley. He called our objective:... the light on the hill - which we aim to reach by working for the betterment of mankind not only here but anywhere we may give a helping hand.In light of Labor's historical concern for human rights and in light of Saddam Hussein's proven record of torture and murder against unionists and union officials, I was surprised, to say the least, when UnionsWA and the Secretary of the Victorian Trades Hall Council threatened a campaign of strikes and bans in the event that Australian armed forces should help disarm Iraq. On issues of war and peace, I certainly would not question anyone's sincerity, but these union officials need to understand that they are offering aid and comfort to the world's worst tyrant. When communist union officials tried to prevent the construction of the Woomera rocket range, even Doc Evatt had the courage to publish a rebuke under the title `Hands off the nation's defences'. That was the advice that Doc Evatt gave to communist union officials back in the 1940s and 1950s. Australia needs Labor leaders of at least that level of principle, courage and insight in the trying days and months ahead.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Jagajaga for her question. It is obvious how impressed I was with that article. As far as higher education is concerned, the Australian Labor Party has done a great disservice to the nation's future over the last year, because what this government has been doing is thinking about how Australian universities are -  - Whatever the differences, philosophically and politically, between the two major parties in this country, there are some things that are critically important to the kind of Australia in which our children will be living - and few are more important than higher education. In fact, in 1956 when the then Prime Minister Robert Menzies was asked why he was taking the Commonwealth government so strongly into university education, he said it was because upon it - being an educated democracy - will rest this country's moral, intellectual and material prosperity. What we need to do as a nation is make decisions today about Australian universities which will determine the kind of country in which our children will be living in a generation from now.There are four priorities that drive this government in looking at universities. The first is equity. We need to do whatever we can as a country to see that more students from low socioeconomic backgrounds are able to get access to Australian higher education, in particular students from rural and regional backgrounds. The second is that we want an emphasis on quality. We want to make sure that students, prospective students, their parents and employers can make reasonable judgments about the quality of a university and have it measured and available to them. The third is that we want to end this one size fits all funding arrangement for universities. Australian higher education is on a collision course with mediocrity in the long term as long as we continue to fund and administer the University of Melbourne in exactly the same way as the University of Ballarat or the University of the Sunshine Coast. Imagine if the Labor Party were running the car industry. They would set the price of the cars; they would tell the manufacturers how many cars they could make; they would tell them what colour they ought to be; and, further to that, they would send them the money to make them. That is the Labor Party approach to universities. The fourth priority is sustainability. We must have a higher education system in this country that is put on a long-term funding basis for our future.Inherent in the remarks of the question put by the member for Jagajaga is this idea that in some way the Labor Party had all the solutions in relation to higher education. In 1992, 100,000 Australians could not get a place in an Australian university, 1.2 million Australians could not get a job and Australians were paying 17½ per cent on their interest rates and 22 per cent on their business overdrafts. The other thing, as the Prime Minister has alluded to today in relation to health, is that Australian higher education was accessible to all Australians based on merit before Gough Whitlam stuffed it up. Then, you got into a university on the basis of merit and you got a scholarship. What the Menzies government did was make sure that it was available to all Australians - and this is what this government is about.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Macarthur for his question. He has real life experience in small business, as do so many people in the coalition ranks - and how we wish Barney Cooney was back in the Senate! There could even be a Barney Cooney fan club over here, I think, because Barney Cooney was the last Labor senator who ever worked in a small business. -  - That is right; that is a very small business! Last night at 9.30, the Labor Party, the Democrats and the Greens in the Senate rejected for the second time in this parliament the Trade Practices Amendment (Small Business Protection) Bill 2002 [No. 2]. Last night, the Leader of the Opposition put the interests of the trade unions ahead of the interests of 1.1 million small businesses in Australia. The timing could not have been worse. What is the Labor Party going to do when Wally Pritchard from the Maritime Union of Australia in Western Australia keeps his threat to set up a picket line at Fremantle docks over Australia's involvement in Iraq? What is the Leader of the Opposition going to say to the small textile exporter or the small manufacturer who cannot meet their offshore commitments because they cannot get through the picket line set up by the MUA at Fremantle? And what is the Leader of the Opposition going to say to all those small exporters who try and take legal action to protect their interests but have not got the deep pockets of the unions to buy the best QCs, the best silks, in the land? What we tried to do with this bill was give Australia's 1.1 million small businesses the opportunity to be represented by the ACCC if they are the innocent victims of sympathy strikes. Our bill was not about rights or entitlements. It was simply about providing legal protection to Australia's small businesses. Last night, the Labor Party put an end to that.  - Yesterday, the Leader of the Opposition was railing against militant trade unions over their threats on Iraq -  - and last night he went and backed the trade unions. The Leader of the Opposition could never be accused of being disloyal to his customers, because his customers are the trade unions. He is standing by Gary Kennedy at the Newcastle Trades Hall Council. He is standing by Dave Robinson at UnionsWA. Even today, in a further development, he is standing by John Maitland at the CFMEU, who indicated that shutting down the docks is still on the agenda of the union movement. If Australia's 1.1 million small businesses needed any evidence whatsoever of the priorities of the Leader of the Opposition, they need not look any further than last night in the Senate where, for the second time, the Labor Party put the interests of their trade union mates ahead of the interests of Australia's workers.</DOC>

 - I can certainly understand the frustration and the annoyance of workers on comparatively low earnings at the excessive payments which have been made to people on very high earnings. I can certainly understand that. But this government's attitude and policy to executive salaries is exactly the same as the former government's attitude. Our position, where the regulation of executive salaries is concerned, is precisely and absolutely that of the former government: we do not believe in it. What we do believe in is trying to do the right thing by the ordinary workers of Australia, and that is why, since March 1996, basic award earnings in this country have gone up. They have gone up by seven per cent in real terms. By comparison, between 1983 and 1996, basic award earnings - the earnings of the ordinary battler out there that members opposite claim so much to represent - actually fell. They fell by five per cent in real terms. This government will always do the right thing by the workers of Australia. We have always done it in the past; we will always do it in the future.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Makin for her question. I can indicate to her and to the House that this government has been and is committed to improving the health services for Australians. Indeed, we have had questions about health today, but there is one measure which indicates our commitment to the health of all Australians and indeed to the Medicare system, and that is the amount of expenditure over the last seven years of government. What this government has done is increase expenditure on Medicare by $2 billion - from $6 billion to $8 billion. As a mark of the indication of our commitment, there has been a $2 billion increase in expenditure on Medicare. If you look at it in terms of the services that are actually offered to Australians, you see that the number of services to patients funded through Medicare has increased to some 227 million, which is some 30 million more than there were in 1996. So, on two major measures - in terms of the expenditure actually made and in terms of the services actually delivered - there is an absolute commitment to this and an increase in the health services for Australians. In addition to that, there has been the 30 per cent private health insurance tax break for almost nine million Australians. So an average Australian family is now saving between $750 and $1,200 a year in relation to their health insurance. Indeed, for one million Australians whose earnings are less than $20,000 per year, this is a substantial benefit.In relation to policies for rural and remote areas of Australia, the coalition has spent around $2 billion on targeted rural health and aged care. In 2000-01, the government provided $562 million over four years to fund 14 rural health initiatives in the integrated package called Regional Health Strategy: More Doctors, Better Services. This was the largest ever single injection of funds for rural health programs. We are seeing results from that. The number of GPs practising in rural and remote areas increased by 4.7 per cent between 2000 and 2002 and by 11.4 per cent over the last five years. These initiatives include the Rural Retention Program, the Rural Locum Relief schools and the HECS reimbursement scheme. For outer metropolitan areas, we are spending some $80 million earmarked for the More Doctors for Outer Metropolitan Areas program - a program that I note the opposition spokesman on health, the member for Perth, just recently remarked on as being unsuccessful, a program which has just started this year. If it is unsuccessful, we take it that that is another thing that he wants to abolish if he is ever to win government.I was asked about any alternative policies. We have been promised an alternative health policy from the opposition and we have not yet got one, but there have been some musings which indicate the direction in which it is going. First of all, we are told that the 30 per cent rebate is under review. What that means for some of those nine million Australians is a tax hike should the Labor Party ever win government - a $750 to $1,200 tax hike per family. In addition to that, we had Mr Smith, the member for Perth, musing last week - as the Prime Minister indicated earlier - about the Medicare levy. The newspaper headlines tell the story. We see in the Adelaide Advertiser: `Medicare levy rise proposed by Labor'; in the Hobart Mercury: `Labor flags Medicare levy rise'; and in the Melbourne Herald Sun: `Labor floats higher levy for Medicare'. One thing is sure: once the Labor Party start to muse about policy, it is clear that they are talking about an increase in taxes, an increase in the Medicare levy and a decrease in the private health insurance rebate. Indeed, health for Labor is a tax slug for ordinary families.</DOC>

 - I stand shoulder to shoulder, hand in hand and arm and arm with the Treasurer on this topic. Of course there are some problems. - Of course the OECD makes an important point. But this government certainly takes the whole issue of poverty traps seriously, and none takes it more seriously than does the Treasurer himself. In fact, in the new tax system package, marginal tax rates on all incomes of under $60,000 were reduced by between three and 13 per cent. It was the biggest income tax cut in Australia, it was the biggest benefit to families in Australia's history and it was the biggest attack on poverty traps in Australia's history. But, if members opposite were serious about addressing the problem of poverty traps, they would pass the government's working credit initiative - an initiative announced in the 2001 budget, designed to ensure that people moving from welfare to work get to keep more of their income in those vital first few weeks of employment; they would pass that bill. Instead that bill has been stalled in the Senate for almost two years. They do not have any credibility. They cannot possibly be serious about this unless they pass the government's legislation.</DOC>

 - Unlike those in the Labor Party, this government believes in empowering local communities to restore their own natural environments. In the first phase of the Natural Heritage Trust, some 400,000 volunteers were involved. The second phase of the trust takes this to a new level with its aim of empowering regional communities to develop and implement strategic landscape-wide environmental restoration. I am very pleased to say that most states have responded very well to this strategy. But I was amazed to hear the New South Wales Premier the other day praising himself lavishly in public for his concern with the environment. When you look around the country, the most obvious fact is how poorly Premier Carr and his government have done on key issues of the environment and natural resource management. This is illustrated very starkly in this drought year by the fact that in New South Wales farmers along the Murray are on 10 per cent of their normal water allocations, while on the other side of the Murray, because of long-established sound water management practices, farmers are still receiving up to 100 per cent of their allocations.New South Wales's unsatisfactory management of water resources is legendary. Premier Carr, both as environment minister and Premier, has failed totally to correct it. Last year the National Competition Council found that it had been unable to assess New South Wales's progress in providing water regimes to stressed rivers because it was taking so long to develop final water plans in that state. Last week we had the Wentworth Group report on vegetation to Premier Carr. Again, the failure of the New South Wales government to put in place satisfactory vegetation management regimes is absolutely legendary. So is the failure of Premier Carr to put in place a satisfactory framework to allow communities to manage environmental issues in their own regions. That is a framework that should be owned by local communities and not dominated by bureaucracies. Such a framework is absolutely essential for the fully satisfactory implementation of the National Action Plan on Salinity and Water Quality.Unfortunately, just like the federal Labor Party, Premier Carr thinks that bureaucrats in city office blocks always know best. We do not, and neither does the Wentworth Group. The Wentworth Group states:Unfortunately in NSW, despite the political desire, this regional model has not been implemented and the centralised planning model has demonstrably failed.It goes on to state:When communities are consulted, they have little choice. When communities are empowered they can become responsible for results. In NSW we have a lot of process and very few outcomes.The Wentworth Group is not being political; it is simply stating what everyone affected by the failure of the Carr government to put in place effective natural resource management in that state knows. It is one thing for the New South Wales Premier to boast how concerned he is about the environment, but on really important environmental issues - on water, on land management, on vegetation - Premier Carr and his government have failed miserably. With their weak leadership and failing policies they have divided Labor federal colleagues, who have, as usual, sat and done nothing about it.</DOC>

 - The answer to the question is no. I would counsel the Leader of the Opposition against believing everything he reads in the newspapers. Let me take the opportunity that the question affords me of making a number of points. The first point I would make is that this government has absolutely no intention of means testing bulk-billing. Let me repeat that: this government has no intention of means testing bulk-billing. - The government has no intention of means testing bulk-billing. Not only do I counsel the Leader of the Opposition not to believe everything he reads in the newspapers, I also counsel him to take a crash course in understanding what Medicare really amounts to. I invite him to understand a couple of fundamental things about Medicare. The first is that the universality of Medicare is comprised of two elements. The first of those is the entitlement of all Australians to free treatment in a public hospital. The second of those is the payment of the Medicare rebate for all GP consultations. They are the foundation principles of Medicare; they comprise the universality of Medicare. The original intention of Medicare was very clearly described by the then health minister Dr Neal Blewett in 1983. When addressing the Doctors Reform Society, he said:You are all aware of the basic elements of the scheme. On February 1st next year, all Australian residents will be guaranteed automatic entitlement under a single public fund to a medical and opthalmological benefit of 85 per cent of the schedule fee, with a maximum patient payment of $10 for any one service where the schedule fee is charged. All Australians will also gain access, without direct charge, to inpatient and outpatient treatment at public hospitals by hospital and sessional doctors.Dr Blewett went on to say, importantly - and I commend these words especially to the Leader of the Opposition:Direct billing will be available to everyone, where the doctor agrees, so that the patient does not have to claim a refund for the cost of medical treatment. But this is a choice left to the doctors.These are the words of the ministerial architect of the original Medicare scheme. The universality of Medicare is the entitlement of every Australian, irrespective of means, to the Medicare rebate for a GP consultation. It is not, as the Leader of the Opposition has so dishonestly and deliberately over the past couple of days endeavoured to claim, some kind of universal guarantee in relation to bulk-billing.This morning, in answer to a question, the Leader of the Opposition had this to say:Now understand what the Medicare levy is, Catherine - that is, Catherine McGrath, the ABC interviewer - it's a contract with the Australian people, it's taken out of your taxes and it entitles people to bulk billing, that's what it does.It is certainly taken out of your taxes, but what it gives you in return is the universality of Medicare - and that is the right to the Medicare rebate as well as the treatment in a public hospital. I am greatly indebted to Dr Blewett. Dr Blewett not only explained it well 20 years ago, but he actually explained it very well this morning in the Canberra Times. I ask everybody to listen very, very carefully to what Dr Blewett had to say this morning:Bulk-billing was a universal scheme in the respect that any doctor could bulk-bill any patient.What a remarkable proposition! Of course any doctor can now bulk-bill any patient. That is not what the Leader of the Opposition is talking about. He has dishonestly tried to represent the universality of Medicare in a completely false manner. He shows no understanding of this scheme. He knows nothing about the strategic defence system; he does not understand that. He does not understand the disbursement composition of the cost of the health insurance rebate. And he demonstrably does not understand a medical scheme that was introduced by his own party.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Canning for that question. I know that all members of the parliament not only will be aware of the attacks in the Philippines overnight but also will be very distressed at the terrible loss of life that has occurred as a result of these terrorist attacks in Davao in the southern Philippines. On behalf of the Australian people, I want to extend my condolences to the President of the Philippines and through her to the people of that nation, with whom Australia has such close and friendly relationships. I want to extend my sympathy also to the families left bereaved by these horrible acts of terrorism. The Australian Embassy is checking at present to confirm whether or not any Australians were amongst the victims of the attack.As I think the House would be aware, the Philippines has grappled with terrorist problems now for a number of years. Unfortunately, the events of yesterday indicate that that challenge goes on quite unabated. I understand that three bombs went off late yesterday afternoon in Davao Province in the southern Philippines. The first was in the waiting area at the airport. Initial reports are that at least 19 people were killed and over 100 injured. Bombs also went off at a bus shelter and outside a health centre. I condemn on behalf of all Australians these wicked attacks, which are aimed at killing and maiming innocent people. These incidents underline very graphically that the war against terrorism must go on with renewed commitment and renewed vigour and that all governments in the region should be vigilant and continue to work together closely to remove the scourge of terrorism.In that context, it is sadly coincidental that only yesterday the Minister for Foreign Affairs signed with the foreign minister of the Philippines, Mr Ople, a bilateral memorandum of understanding on counter-terrorism. That adds to a network of understandings and agreements that now exist between Australia, her agencies and other countries in the region. I thank the foreign minister for his committed work in bringing about the signing of that agreement. I had the opportunity yesterday afternoon myself of discussing the threat of terrorism with the Philippines foreign minister and neither of us, of course, was then aware that within a matter of hours his country would once again have inflicted upon it this terrible blight.Terrorism is the unmitigated evil of the modern world. It has to be fought and opposed everywhere it manifests itself and the world must be completely determined and united in not only attacking terrorism in all its forms but also ensuring that weapons of mass destruction never fall into the hands of these evil people.</DOC>

 - The answer to that question is no. The government has no intention of introducing a means test for bulk-billing - none whatsoever. The government, or the opposition parties as they then were, made a commitment in early 1995 to retain Medicare. We have remained faithful to that commitment during our last seven years in government. We will remain faithful to that commitment. You said in 1996 when we were elected that we would dismantle Medicare. Seven years on you have been proved wrong and seven years from now you will also be proved wrong.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Forde for her question. I can inform the House that the national accounts for the December quarter of 2002 were released this morning, showing that the economy grew 0.4 per cent in that quarter and three per cent over the year. During that quarter the impacts of drought were felt quite considerably. Abstracting the drought, the non-farm economy grew 0.8 per cent and 3.9 per cent over the year. That growth was principally led by business investment, with private business investment up 7.4 per cent in the December quarter, with a 14 per cent surge in new plant and machinery investment. So what we are seeing in the non-farm economy is strong investment, some moderation in relation to consumption, the building cycle continued and a strong economy.Notwithstanding that, we remain in the worst drought in a century, and the effects of the drought are seen very, very clearly in these national accounts figures. Agricultural production fell by 14 per cent in the December quarter and was 24 per cent lower than a year ago. Rural exports fell another 3.3 per cent, with grain exports falling 30.8 per cent in the December quarter. Employment in the farm sector fell by another 20,000, following a decline of 40,000 in the previous quarter. Notwithstanding that, overall job numbers in Australia are up, reflecting the strength of the non-farm economy. But in the farm economy the drought continues to bite very severely.The national accounts show that the effect of the drought should still be flowing through the national accounts into the June quarter. If the signs that the drought is breaking continue then we could expect some positive recovery in the national accounts at the end of this year. But, even if the drought were to break tomorrow, obviously by the time you get crops in, by the time they grow and by the time you get exports, you are still going to have negative effects flowing through until the June quarter. The severity of the drought is shown very clearly in these national accounts. We all hope for follow-up rain to break the drought.As the OECD remarked earlier this week, Australia remains one of the most resilient economies in the world. The fact that, in the face of the worst drought in 100 years, the economy still grows - and still grows in the face of an international downturn and oil prices rocketing in the way they are - indicates the resilience of the Australian economy and the importance of structural changes. From the government's point of view, we believe structural changes must continue. Improvements in the labour market, improvements in relation to Commonwealth expenditure programs and improvements with the legislation of our budget measures - from last year's budget and from the budget two years ago - are still awaiting approval from the Senate. These are important matters that have to be dealt with in this parliament so that Australia can have the kind of structural reforms which are necessary for continuing economic growth.</DOC>

 - I say in reply to the Leader of the Opposition that mainstream Australia is much better off under this government than it was under the former government. It is much better off for three reasons. The first reason is that interest rates are much lower. I have noticed a lot of interviews with one of my predecessors. That is understandable - and I congratulate him on the 20th anniversary of his election - but I notice that one phrase never passed his lips, and that was `interest rates'. I am not surprised, because, under the 13 years of the former administrations, household interest rates, which place a terrible burden on Australian families, went to unbelievable levels. As the Treasurer reminded us yesterday, in response to adverse external developments on the current account the Hawke and Keating governments drove interest rates up to 17 or 18 per cent. That was all they could ever do. - As the Treasurer interjects, all they could ever do was drive up interest rates and drive us into a recession. Can I say to the Leader of the Opposition: if he wants to spend the next 18 months or whatever between now and the next election talking about the relative burdens on middle Australia imposed by my government and the former government, make my 18 months! - The first thing that has made mainstream Australia better off under us is low interest rates. The second thing that has made mainstream Australia better off under us is the fact that, unlike the former Labor government, we have presided over an increase in the wages of average Australian workers. The Leader of the Opposition and his predecessors used to go around boasting about how they had suppressed the wages of Australian workers. They did a very good job too, because they not only presided over an unproductive economy but also ran an accord with the trade union movement that ended up being a fraud on the average Australian worker. The accord did not deliver real benefits to Australian workers. The accord was a fraud on Australian workers. The third reason that mainstream Australia has responded very positively to this government is that we have generated hundreds of thousands of new jobs. There are now 1.3 million more jobs in Australia under this government than there were in 1996.The Leader of the Opposition likes to talk about things I said before I became Prime Minister. Can I say to the Leader of the Opposition: the most serious promise I made in the debates that I had with the former Prime Minister, Mr Keating, was that I would try and do something to reduce Australia's chronic level of unemployment. I am proud of the fact that the government have not only increased the take-home pay and reduced the taxes of Australian workers but generated more jobs for their children. On top of that, we have improved the apprenticeship and training opportunities for young Australians. What you have to remember in this debate about university education, which is very important, is that 70 per cent of young men and women who leave school do not go to university. They want apprenticeship and traineeship opportunities. Those opportunities have more than doubled under the policies of my two colleagues.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. I know that this is an issue of concern to her and to her constituents. Let me tell the House that those people who travel to Iraq with the intention of acting as so-called `human shields' are very misguided and could be in very great danger. On 22 February, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade issued a travel bulletin cautioning Australians not to travel to Iraq. This bulletin cautioned any Australian considering going to Iraq as a human shield not to do so. Australians choosing to travel to Iraq contrary to this advice should be aware that, if military conflict occurred, options to leave Iraq would obviously become very limited and the personal safety of those people could be placed at grave risk. Any means for the Australian government to assist Australian citizens to leave Iraq would likely be severely constrained. My department has also written to the organisations that may facilitate the travel of Australians wishing to be human shields.Iraq has been encouraging international peace groups to send members to Iraq to serve as voluntary human shields. Doing the bidding of a regime like Iraq's is inherently dangerous. Those involved should recognise the appalling nature of the regime requesting their assistance. It is a regime responsible for the deaths of about 1½ million people over the last two decades. It is also important to remember that, during the 1990-91 Gulf War, Saddam Hussein held more than 800 foreign nationals as human shields at strategic locations in Iraq and Kuwait in order to try to deter attack by the international coalition being organised against Baghdad. That practice contravened international humanitarian law and is further evidence, if evidence is needed, that Saddam Hussein has contempt for legal principles protecting civilians in times of conflict. Australians need to be aware that there is potential for this to happen again, against the will of the individuals concerned.This is a barbaric regime. The people of Iraq live in an appalling environment. A culture of fear and arbitrary violence pervades Iraq and has been the hallmark of Saddam Hussein's quarter-of-a-century ruthless rule. The sheer scale of the violence he has visited on his own people, including through the use of chemical weapons, puts Saddam at the top rung of the world's most brutal dictators. Reliable media reports suggest that a number of human shields are leaving Iraq because they are being moved by the regime against their will to strategic sites. I urge Australians to take heed of the government's travel advice and to depart immediately. To those considering becoming human shields, let me say this: think carefully about who you are helping. Whatever your motives, your lives could be in grave danger. You should reconsider.</DOC>

 - I would be very interested to establish exactly where in Melbourne that suburb is. I know the geography of most parts of Australia but I do not pretend to know all the detail. The reason I say that to the honourable member for Isaacs is that the bulk-billing rates in different parts of Australia do vary enormously. I know that, for example, in the member for Isaacs' electorate, the most recent figure for the bulk-billing rate is 70.2 per cent. I know that the bulk-billing rates rise to very high figures. For example, the member for Chifley's electorate has, I think, the highest bulk-billing rate of any electorate in Australia -  - and that is 98.5 per cent. It is actually quite interesting that, when you work your way through these things, you find that there is a sharp correlation between a low bulk-billing rate and normally an outer metropolitan or rural area of Australia. There are some exceptions to that. In fact, Canberra happens to be an exception to that. If you work your way through the figures you do find a lot of support for the proposition that the low bulk-billing rates do tend to go hand in hand with a lack or a small availability of doctors. I say to the honourable member - I know she asked the question very sincerely - that the premise on which the question is based is wrong. We do not intend to introduce any kind of means test for bulk-billing and we do not intend to take any steps to limit the willingness of doctors to provide bulk-billing.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. As has been noted in this place on a few occasions over the last couple of days, the House should be aware that this week's OECD report on Australia was very positive. It confirmed that the policies that we have taken forward have made Australia one of the best-performing advanced economies in the world. As has been noted again this afternoon, the report pointed out that Australia is notably resilient to shocks, both internal and external. The OECD said that this resilience has been shown by the capacity of the economy to withstand the East Asian crisis and the global economic downturn in 2001-02. I would add to that the resilience that has been shown by the farm sector in the face of the current drought. Despite its historic severity, and assuming hopefully that it now has broken and is easing, I think that the damage caused by this drought is likely to be less severe than that of the last drought of some 10 years ago.Economic reform, as the member has pointed out to me, has been of immense value. In the Mallee, lower interest rates have provided an extraordinary flow of investment to industries like horticulture. There have been very serious advancements in wine grape plantings, in wineries - I opened one down there not so long ago - and in value adding, and the benefits have flowed through to rural cities like Mildura and Swan Hill, where I understand they are having trouble finding builders. That is good news. We ought to be reminded that, where there is investment security and the opportunity, you can get very strong growth in economies in regional areas.With respect to this issue of investment security, I was interested to read the OECD's remarks regarding water reform. The report clearly identifies the main water reform challenge as:... dealing with the environmental impacts of water use while ensuring effective property rights in water and meeting the competing demands of irrigators, urban users and stressed rivers.I commend these remarks in the OECD report to those state premiers and treasurers who are still reluctant to embrace the need for clear and secure property rights as the basis for sustainable water policy reform. This is an underestimated area of importance for economic and environmental reform in Australia. Indeed, I think the case has now been firmly established that the regulatory framework for natural resource management in this country needs reform. If we have a resurrection, resulting from that, of investment certainty, you will much more rapidly progress investment and both economic and environmental outcomes.I was very interested to hear from the Murray-Darling Basin Commission that in the Murray-Darling Basin - where over half of Australia's food and fibre is produced - the increase in economic activity would be in the order of one third if the respective governments would accept the Commonwealth's lead in this regard, sort out the investment security framework and allow the system to start moving. That would be a substantial improvement in regional development, job opportunities, investment and export performance in Australia.There is another area of interest to regional Australia raised by the OECD report: rail reform. The report noted that Australia has the sixth lowest real freight rates in the OECD. It is probably arguable that we now have in this country the lowest ever real freight rates. The report pointed out that we also rank eighth in terms of rail efficiency. There is a significant gap between the best performers and us, and we need to close that gap. The report noted not only that we have made real reforms on the east-west corridor - where the Commonwealth has had a great say over it through the Australian RailTrack Corporation - but that there are still some real problems on the east coast routes. As every transport supremo in this country knows, that is where the most urgent transport infrastructure and regulatory reform is needed in Australia. The OECD makes that point again, and the Commonwealth is seeking to take the lead. The more rapidly we get state cooperation in this area, with a doubling of freight volumes coming up in this country over the next 15 or 16 years, the better.The message from the latest OECD report is clear: Australia has reaped the benefits, and regional Australia has reaped the benefits, of reform. That reform process must go forward on a number of fronts. There should be no stalling of this reform. We have heard in this place too much of the Labor Party opposing us on tax reform, on industrial relations, on health reform and on education. I am dismayed to have to add to that list. From his comments in the House this morning, the opposition spokesman on transport indicated that he totally and absolutely misunderstands the nature of AusLink, which is about a long-term approach to transport reform in the country and is widely recognised by people who understand transport as urgently needed. It is obvious that the ALP is going to add to its long list of areas of opposition with this one as well.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kennedy for his question. We all know that water is a great and scarce commodity in Australia and that, in terms of its value to regional communities, that certainly cannot be overstated. I have not had the opportunity to fully assess the statistical figures that the member for Kennedy has put forward, but I shall do that. In terms of his suggestion that I meet with some mayors from Northern Queensland, one of the pleasures of my job is meeting with people from around regional Australia, and I would be only too happy to do so.</DOC>

 - I should, in responding to the member for Deakin's excellent question, acknowledge that the task of change and modernisation is always a work in progress, and it is always in part an unfinished business. It is important to occasionally take stock of what has been achieved if only to encourage the Australian people to understand that reform does matter and reform does work. The OECD has just ranked Australia as one of the world's top performing economies. It had this to say about workplace relations reform:Less adversarial labour relations and greater flexibility are likely to have encouraged innovation, and to have facilitated greater acceptance of new work practices, organisational procedures and modern technologies, and thus contributed to the observed acceleration in productivity in Australia over the past ten years or so.One of the great achievements of the last decade is the fact that labour productivity has accelerated from two per cent a year in the years of centralised wage fixing to three per cent a year now under the government's enterprise bargaining arrangements. The OECD paid Australia a compliment when it said:Today the level of disputes in Australia is only around one-sixth of what it was 20 years ago when Australia was one of the most strike prone countries in the OECD.These beneficial results of more jobs, higher pay and fewer strikes have not happened by accident. They have happened because successive governments have had the guts to take hard decisions rather than wallow in cheap populism. The former Labor government started the process and it was, of course, supported by the then opposition. The current government have continued the process and, sadly, we have invariably been frustrated by the current opposition. Reform must continue and the OECD has specified some of the necessary further steps. The OECD has said that we must simplify awards. Unfortunately, the opposition has said that it is going to block the government's award simplification bill. The OECD says that we must contain the damage from industrial disputes. The ALP has just voted against the government's bill to ensure secret ballots before protected strikes. The OECD says that we must limit disincentives to hiring and, again, the opposition has just voted against the government's fair dismissal legislation.As the OECD has recognised, thanks to reform over the last decade and a half, Australia is a stronger economy and a better society. That is thanks in part to former Labor leaders. Unfortunately, it is no thanks to the current Labor leadership, which seems to have adopted the member for Werriwa's dictum that oppositions can afford to be irresponsible. I very much fear that the workers and people of Australia might ultimately pay a very high price for an opposition leadership which is addicted to scare campaigns.</DOC>

 - Obviously, I cannot confirm that table because I have not seen it. In relation to the conduct of any business, any business that has an expense is entitled to deduct that expense against its profit. - Australian taxation law provides that expenses which are necessarily incurred in the course of conducting a business are deductible and companies are taxed on their profit. So the expenses that a company has - whether they be in the nature of outgoings such as leases, power, light, maintenance or whether they be in the nature of salaries, which are expenses - which are necessarily incurred in the conduct of a business -  - As I was saying, outgoings necessarily incurred in the conduct of a business - whether they be in the nature of rent, light, power, maintenance, salaries or in relation to employees - are deductible from income. Taxable income is that income after the deduction of expenses - that is, tax is levied on profit, not on gross income. - Tax is levied on gross income after expenses. In the hands of the person to whom the payment is made, if it is payment in the nature of income it is fully taxable in their hands, which means that it is taxable at the rate of 48½ per cent. If it were to be taxed in the hands of both the company and the individual, it would be taxable at 78½ per cent. In 13 years of Labor government, the Labor Party never proposed tax of 78½ per cent. But if the Labor Party does propose tax of 78½ per cent, I think it should say so publicly and make it clear. I can only assume the fact that it refuses to say so means that it tries to walk both sides of the street on this issue, as on other issues. - I can only assume that the Labor Party tries to walk both sides of the street to rather give the impression that on one hand it is in favour of a 78½ per cent taxation rate by asking the question but without ever actually announcing that as a policy. If the Labor Party wants to announce as a policy that it will not allow employee payments in the nature of salary or commission to be deducted by a company from its profit, it should do so. It did not do so for the 13 years it was in government, it has not proposed it in any of its policies in the last two elections, but if it wants to do so it is at liberty to do so. Would it make Australian corporate life better? I do not think so because, since we have had an income tax system, Australian companies have always been entitled to deduct employee expenses from their profit. One of the reasons they are entitled to do that, obviously, is so you do not get those high rates of taxation and people are not discouraged from employment. But if the Labor Party wants to argue the case that taxation should be in both the employee's and the employer's hands, it can state a policy. I think what this side of the parliament really finds rather incomprehensible is that, after seven years, the Labor Party omits to announce any policy on any of these issues. - It is a bit like bulk-billing: one would get the impression that the Labor Party is committed to 100 per cent bulk-billing, but does it announce such a policy? Does it actually tell us how it would pay for such a policy? Let me make it clear: the AMA claimed increasing rebates would require a 50 per cent increase in the Medicare levy. The Labor Party would have you believe you could have 100 per cent bulk-billing, without telling you about the 50 per cent tax increase. - The Labor Party would like to have you believe that somehow it is against the deduction of employee expenses, without ever making the policy. - The way the Australian taxation law works - and it has worked in this way since income tax came in, right through the course of the last century and right through 13 years of Labor government - is that, where a business incurs an expense in the course of conducting that business, it is not taken into account in taxable income, because taxable income is on profit, which is income after expenses.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dawson for her question and acknowledge the interest of Australian exporters, particularly the cane growers and sugar producers in her electorate of Dawson, in getting greater opportunities across the world. The government's sound economic management has created an environment that has enabled our export sector to grow and strengthen. This has been firmly backed by the OECD report that was released recently. The OECD report firmly endorses the government's ambitious trade agenda. It also backs the government's trade policy of competitive liberalisation and supports the government's reforms to open up the Australian economy. The OECD report also explicitly backs Australia's commitment to negotiating a free trade agreement with the United States. It recognises that an FTA with the United States would be trade-creating, not trade-diverting. The report says:The complete liberalisation of trade between these two countries, including agricultural products, would bring a net creation of global trade and economic benefits to both countries.That is an endorsement by the OECD of the government's policy position in terms of pursuing a free trade agreement with the United States. Of course it is in the interests of the member for Dawson - and all members, particularly those who represent rural constituencies like yours, Mr Speaker - that we pursue this negotiation with the United States. Just think of the advantage that Australian beef producers could have if we were able to expand our quota of 378,000 tonnes of beef into the United States. Just think of the benefit to the cane growers all along the eastern seaboard, and particularly in the member for Dawson's electorate, if we could expand the quota for sugar into the United States - or the quota for cotton or dairy products.Of course, we need to pursue this policy objective globally in the current environment. Increased access to markets would put money in the pockets of our farmers, particularly, as I say, those of the cane growers in the seat of Dawson and other seats for which sugar is a particular interest in terms of their agricultural pursuits. We will continue to pursue our bilateral trade agenda, which will enhance our multilateral trade objectives at the same time, a fact also recognised by the OECD report when it said, `This agreement should form a base for continued progress in multilateral trade liberalisation.' The OECD report clearly endorses our view that bilateral negotiations and pursuits add momentum and value to what we are pursuing multilaterally. It states that the government's trade policies have brought significant gains to the Australian economy, and we obviously agree with that. We will continue to pursue strongly our trade policy agenda, including our pursuit of bilateral negotiations and agreements - particularly those currently under way with the United States and Thailand - because we believe that they will bring benefits to all Australians and are particularly in the national interest.I now go to the report's most important quote with regard to the Australian economy, which is the quote I gave yesterday. Right at the start of the assessment of the Australian economy by the OECD, it states:Dogged pursuit of structural reforms across a very broad front, and prudent macroeconomic policies firmly set in a medium-term framework, have combined to make the Australian economy one of the best performers in the OECD, and also one notably resilient to shocks, both internal and external.That `dogged pursuit of structural reforms' has needed to be dogged because it has been undertaken, every inch of the way, in the face of opposition from the Australian Labor Party. They have not wanted us to make the Australian economy stronger and more resilient. We are going to continue our reform process, whether or not the Australian Labor Party will support it, because it is in Australia's national interest.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Lilley for his question. We always admire his sense of humour on this side of the House. In fact, when I was a kid I used to watch Al Jolson movies, and Al Jolson had a song which reminds me of the member for Lilley. He used to go, `Swanee, Swanee, how I loves ya, how I loves ya.' - Every time I look at him and I read of his leadership ambitions and I read of those who brief the press off the record - those that are in the ABC club but not in the BBB club - I think to myself, `Swanee, how I loves ya, how I loves ya.' From our point of view, you would be a very welcome addition to the bar table over here - as the Leader of the Opposition studiously tries to ignore what is being said! Why should he be interested in the ABC club - Anybody But Crean? - Having said all that, let me say this: they ask if I am aware of Ken Henry's comments - as it turns out, I am not. They ask if Ken Henry actually has some secret control over Centrelink or the department of finance - alas, that is not the case. I have always found, as the Treasurer, that the Treasury influence is grossly overstated. If you knew them like I do, you would know that they are sensible, warm human beings down there in the Treasury. They are always anxious to give out money, in my experience, and it is the spending departments that restrain them on a regular basis. If you could get rid of those spending departments, you would see what warm, genuine guys they are down at Treasury, and you would love them the way that I do.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Boothby for his question. I know he takes a vital interest in industry in his electorate, particularly the growing fortunes of Mitsubishi. Manufacturing does, of course, play a very vital part in Australia's economy, contributing some $76 billion to the GDP in 2001-02. That is a 15 per cent increase over the last six years. This outstanding performance is not only contributing to the strength of the economy but, of course, creating jobs for Australians. It is worth noting that the OECD has praised `the government's commitment to reform' - and it went on to describe the Australian economy as `one of the best performers in the OECD'. Despite drought, bushfires and possible war with Iraq, the latest Yellow Pages Small Business Index reported a strong rise in business confidence amongst small and medium sized enterprises, proving once again just how resilient these businesses are.As the minister for agriculture knows, agriculture and mining continue to contribute in a significant way to our economic growth. What we have seen, of course, is a surge in high-tech manufactured goods, which is broadening Australia's economic base. We should also note the December quarter ABS capital expenditure survey, which showed capital expenditure in the manufacturing sector increasing by some 20 per cent on the year before. Employment in the manufacturing sector grew by 4.7 per cent between November 2002 and 2003, creating some 51,000 jobs. The AIG PricewaterhouseCoopers Performance of Manufacturing Index further reinforces this employment growth, showing a strengthening in January, most manufacturing industry sectors reporting higher production levels during that month. Of course, last year was an all-time record for our automotive sector - and I know that the Minister for Trade and I are not slow to state that, but I think it is something that this government has certainly paid serious attention to. We have seen January and February sales up by some 3.7 per cent on last year.All of this is in very stark contrast to the years of Labor, for part of which the member for Hotham, now the Leader of the Opposition, was the employment minister. In their last six years in office, Labor presided over a loss of about 100,000 jobs in the manufacturing sector. Remember that I said we saw 15 per cent growth in the manufacturing sector in the last six years - it is interesting that under Labor it was one per cent a year, which is barely a third.Labor's close alliance with the AMWU is continuing to see damage done to the manufacturing sector in Victoria. It is having a damaging impact on the Saizeriya project, which was originally to be a five-stage $1.8 billion project. It is now 18 months behind schedule, and they will only complete stage 1. Manufacturing continues to grow under this government, with its strong support and with the strong economic base this government has created.</DOC>

 - The government obviously has a say in the appointment of the directors of Telstra, as you would expect, as a shareholder. I believe that the appointments which we have made to that board have been good ones. Certainly, nobody has brought to my attention - certainly the Labor Party has not brought to my attention - that they think any of those directors is ill equipped to be a director. If the Labor Party were to do that, of course, we would consider it.Having put those directors in place, the directors themselves have entered into arrangements on behalf of the company for remuneration. I do not personally vet those contracts, nor would it be my responsibility to do so. We as shareholders have responsibility in relation to the directors, and we allow the directors to set the remuneration policy. - If the Labor Party or anyone else believe that any of those arrangements that have been entered into are improper in some particular way, we will be very happy to receive evidence and we will draw it to the attention of the directors.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Dickson for the question he has asked. Yesterday I mentioned to the House that the OECD had assessed Australia as having an immigration program par excellence, and the fact is that, of course, in relation to the way in which we have been able to deal with questions of onshore asylum claims, that has led to a standout result in terms of what is happening around the world. The fact is - and I say this very deliberately - that the number of claims for 2002 as against 2001 has come down by some 50 per cent. That is a reduction from something in the order of 12,000 onshore claims, as against 6,000 for this recent year. The early indications are that that trend is continuing.What do I think that reflects? I can say that what it does reflect is successful government policy. What it demonstrates very clearly is that we have been able to send a very clear message, not only to smugglers who were responsible for part of the cohort but also to others thinking of using the asylum system to obtain migration outcomes, that they will not be rewarded for doing so. If you look at the measures that have had a substantial impact, you have to include our detention policy, our capacity to work with source countries and countries of first asylum and the excision arrangements that we put in place so that the successful Pacific solution that others are thinking of modelling their arrangements on would also be able to work.Of course, it has also brought a number of benefits to Australians generally. What are those benefits? The first is that it has led to significant savings in processing costs. There has been a dramatic reduction in the number of people, particularly children - a group which I know is of interest to members of this House - who are detained. It has certainly ensured that the asylum system is less abused and, most importantly for those who are interested in refugees, it has meant that we have the capacity now to help those who are at greatest risk, particularly in Africa and the Middle East. I make that point very deliberately because this year we have a program that will enable 12,000 refugees and special humanitarian entrants to be actually visaed as part of the offshore program.What can you compare this with? The fact is that, if you look at the international experience, consistently asylum applications have been rising. For instance, in the United Kingdom this year they have 110,000 applications, an increase of 25 per cent. If you look at the revised budget in the United Kingdom, to put it in perspective, it is now costing them something in the order of $A4.6 billion to process and manage that very large number of asylum seekers. If you look at the United Kingdom, last year they had 54,000 failed asylum seekers, and yet the Home Office figures demonstrate that only 13,000 were removed. But that stands in comparison to a recent study by the US Department of Justice, with figures from their audit office which showed that only three per cent of non-detained asylum seekers are removed from the United States of America.So what we have is the standout result around the world amongst developed countries. Central to that has been our detention policy, something that I note the Labor Party from time to time hints that it would like to unwind. Our policies have been effective, and we have been able to demonstrate to those who would want to abuse Australia's hospitality that we are not vulnerable to those sorts of efforts.</DOC>

 - Can I say, in relation to a company, that the money of a company belongs to the shareholders - it does not belong to the government and it does not belong to taxpayers: it belongs to the shareholders. Let us take AMP, which has been in the news recently. There has been some criticism of payments to people from the AMP. That is the shareholders' money - the shareholders of the AMP. Certainly, from our point of view, we believe that shareholders have to be vigilant in relation to their own money and in relation to the directors and the way they manage the company. Can I say in passing, I noticed that the former chairman of the AMP, Stan Wallis, announced yesterday that he would not be cashing his termination benefits, and we think that is a fine example. We believe that is an example of somebody who has shown leadership in relation to that matter. I am sure the shareholders and, I think, the general community recognise the way in which he did that and the fact that that was in the public interest.The way in which company law operates is that a person who invests in a company - and nobody is forced to invest in a company; people choose whether or not they are going to invest in particular companies - gets a right to determine the directors. The directors set the remuneration. The law requires the disclosure of the remuneration of the top five executives. I believe the Australian Stock Exchange is about to release listing rules which will heighten the requirements to actually disclose. This government believes that the Australian Securities and Investment Commission should be given the power to issue infringement notices where there is failure in relation to disclosure. If they want to contest it, they can take it off to a court, but they will be able to do that on the spot, which we think will heighten the disclosure. I have indicated before that the government believes that the appointments it has made to the Telstra board are people of due diligence, that they have been conducting their duties properly. If the Labor Party believes that there is evidence that they have not -  - we would be happy to receive the information.</DOC>

 - I would like to thank the member for Paterson for his question. He is an excellent member. Yesterday and today the Treasurer and other ministers have been outlining to the House the OECD's great report card on the Australian economy. I am also pleased to report to the House that the OECD has found Australia's social security safety net to be very comprehensive and generous. The report said that the degree of net distribution to the poorest 30 per cent is higher than many other industrialised countries. The lowest 30 per cent of the population by household income receive 58 per cent of the social security payments - the highest among the 13 countries in the sample. It also noted that Australia is well placed, relative to other OECD countries, to meet the challenges of an ageing society.However, the report identified, as the government has, that the current system can be improved and that we need to reduce the disincentives in that welfare-to-work transition. That is why the coalition government is committed to welfare reform. Unlike the ALP, who have turned their back on these people who are at risk of being welfare dependent, this government is tackling the hard issues and pursuing welfare reform. Indeed, the OECD recognises that the government is on the right track and it is full of praise. I would like to explain to the House a couple of things that we have done to assist these people through our Australians Working Together package. The first is our personal support programs, where we have invested $154 million over the next four years to assist 45,000 people. Our Transition to Work program particularly assists women and more mature-aged people who have been out of the work force for a long time to get back into the work force. Not to mention the 400 new personal advisers at Centrelink who are, again, trying to better profile people who may be at risk of long-term welfare dependency.But at the moment there is a bill sitting in the Senate, the AWT bill, which, if not passed by the opposition, will have some dire consequences - that is, 2.6 million people on income support will not receive financial incentives to take up paid work through Working Credit; 18,000 people will be denied literacy and numeracy skills which are critical for them in training and to re-enter the work force; and 50,000 mature-aged students and partner allowance recipients will also be denied those opportunities. That is all because of opposition from the Labor Party. The OECD report also provided some support to the government, particularly in our effort for DSP reform:... the Government has also undertaken initiatives to improve the work capacity of people with disability and to tighten the eligibility requirements for Disability Support Pension, to slow the large flow of people into this programme; a revised Disability Reform Bill, addressing this last issue, was unfortunately recently rejected by the Senate.That came from the OECD. Why is it that the rest of the world can see that what this government is trying to do is the right thing but the Labor Party are constantly opposed to it? The answer is simple: they are opposed for opposition's sake.I would like to remind the House why we need to have this DSP reform. Ten years ago we had 300,000 people on DSP; today that figure is 650,000 and climbing. We know that people who end up on DSP very rarely get off it. They languish on DSP until they reach pension age. This government is about focusing on ability, not disability, and it is about time those opposite started to do the right thing and support this bill. Thankfully, there are some opposite who will support this bill. I know we have a very colourful character over there, the one who loves cab drivers - that is, the member for Werriwa. I would like to quote what he said:Something also needs to be done about the outrageous growth in the Disability Support Pension ... The DSP needs to be overhauled and mutual responsibility policies applied to all those with a genuine capacity for work.That was a quote from 26 July 1999. Even the member for Lilley, `the head of the ABC', has said:Solutions must be found to the growth in DSP in order to ensure people with disabilities have the fullest opportunity available to reach their potential and make their contribution.That was your submission to the welfare reform group back in 2000. It is absolutely hypocritical for the opposition to be advocating these critical reforms. We are putting them up and of course they are opposing them. They are hypocritical; they say one thing and do the other. You have got a chance: tomorrow that bill comes back in. You can support the AWT bill, which is all about doing the right thing for people.</DOC>

 - I fully answered this question yesterday but obviously the member was not listening, so I will take him through it again. The government - not exclusively but along with other shareholders - are responsible for the appointment of the directors. The directors who are operating Telstra have the confidence of the government. We believe that they are reputable and are properly managing the affairs of the company. The directors in turn, in compliance with the law, are responsible for remuneration. They have to disclose that remuneration because Telstra is a listed company.Incidentally, if Telstra were not in the private sector, you would not have to disclose the salaries under the Corporations Law. I mention in passing that, if the Labor Party had had its way, Telstra would not be subject to those requirements, because the Labor Party opposed the equity in Telstra and bringing it onto the Stock Exchange. The Stock Exchange is currently negotiating, I believe, with its members for heightened disclosure, and the government are proposing infringement notices for failures in relation to disclosure. If the Labor Party wants to allege that any particular contract is wrong or contrary to the law, we would be happy to receive that information and we would pass it on to the directors.</DOC>

 - I am sure I speak for all members of the House in saying that this horrific and inexcusable terrorist act, which claimed at least 15 Israeli lives and injured at least 40 Israeli citizens, should be condemned without reservation by all people of goodwill, not only in the Middle East but here in Australia. The Australian government continues to hope that both sides involved in the Israeli-Palestinian issue will exercise restraint. Australia remains a strong and unwavering supporter of the right of Israel to exist secure and unmolested behind properly supervised boundaries. Australia also recognises the right and aspirations of the people of Palestine to an independent state.I hope that, as expressed in my statement to parliament, the re-elected Prime Minister of Israel grabs the opportunity of his new mandate so as not to leave unturned any stone that might produce peace in that troubled part of the world. But a prerequisite to that response by Israel must be an end to the inexcusable suicide bombings. It is worth observing that it has been part of Saddam Hussein's promotion of terrorism beyond the borders of Iraq to pay $US25,000 to the families of all suicide bombers who cause death and destruction in Israel.</DOC>

 - I must make a special effort to get to the function, because I am sure I would enjoy it very substantially. I have always found Ziggy Switkowski to be a very interesting speaker, and I have no doubt that he will have an interesting speech to make. Incidentally, I also enjoy the privilege of having Ziggy as a constituent. - It is obviously a deep conspiracy, isn't it, that he is a constituent of mine! How outrageous that a constituent of mine would speak at a function in my electorate. He has every right to speak at such a function. I dare say that, if the Socialist Left controlled Melbourne FEC of the ALP invited him to give a speech, he would probably go there too. I would not have any objections if he were to do that. Ziggy Switkowski is a man who is of age and who can make his own decisions, and I have every confidence in the decisions that he makes. Can I say to any members of the Labor Party that, for a fee, you would be entitled to come along, but I think we would have to charge you double to get in there at the time.</DOC>

 - I think all members of the House will realise the importance of the Timor Sea Treaty and its ratification to bring benefits both to Australia and to East Timor. This is a treaty which governs the orderly development and exploration of the petroleum resources in the joint petroleum development area. The ratification will allow the peoples of both East Timor and Australia and the companies operating within the JPDA to develop those resources in the interests of both nations. Australia has concluded negotiations in addition to the treaty on an international unitisation agreement for the Greater Sunrise field. This apportions the Greater Sunrise resource to Australia and 20.1 per cent to the JPDA. Within the JPDA, 10 per cent of revenues accrue to Australia and 90 per cent to East Timor.It is important to bear in mind that the gross value of the Sunrise field over the life of the project is expected to be in the order of $30 billion to $40 billion. Can I indicate that the benefits downstream in the Northern Territory arising from Bayu-Undan in the JPDA will be substantial. The Northern Territory government has been very active in pursuing its interest, as has Mr Tollner, the honourable member for the area, who is currently in East Timor in relation to this matter. The benefits of the treaty to Australia and East Timor are significant. It will strengthen our relationship with East Timor and it will increase economic activity in both Australia and East Timor. The Bayu-Undan development will involve an LNG processing plant in Darwin to receive LNG from Bayu-Undan, and it will provide development opportunities in the Northern Territory to strengthen its economy.Can I reiterate that the JPDA is split 90-10 in East Timor's favour - that is, the revenues coming out of the JPDA are entitled to taxation split 90 per cent under the East Timor taxation regime and 10 per cent under the Australian taxation regime. From the development of that field, East Timor stands to receive tax revenues of some $5 billion over the life of the project. This is a ratification and a treaty in the interests of both countries - in the interests of Australia and in the interests of East Timor. It fairly divides that resource. It allows for the resource to be developed. It provides economic benefits to the Northern Territory. It provides benefits to the national economy. I congratulate the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who is up there signing at the moment; the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources, who has been part of the negotiations; and other ministers - including myself - who were part of it. The government recognises that this is an important development for Australia and East Timor and that it is in both our national interests.</DOC>

 - The information which I also gave yesterday was, of course, correct. The statement misrepresenting it and claiming to the contrary by the member for Fraser today is false. The taxation law provides that `expenses necessarily incurred in the conduct of a business are tax deductible'. If it is an expenditure of a private nature, it is not necessarily incurred in the carrying on of a business. So to say that, in relation to private memberships or private yachts, they are not tax deductible is merely to illustrate the point that they are not expenses necessarily incurred in the conduct of a business. The general law - it used to be section 51; it has a different number under the new tax act - provides that `if it is necessarily incurred it is tax deductible, but not if it is of a private nature, or not if it is carved out for some other reason of public policy,' as occurs from time to time in relation to amendments to the tax law, `but absent any specific provision, the fact that it is necessarily incurred in the conduct of carrying on a business makes it tax deductible'. That was the case yesterday, that was the case under 13 years of Labor government, that has been the case since the Income Tax Assessment Act was written in 1936, and that is the principle underlying Australia's taxation law: companies are taxed on profits being income after expenses. As I said yesterday, if the Australian Labor Party believes that payments to employees, which are fully taxable at the full marginal rate of 48½ per cent in their hands, should also be taxable in the company's hands - that is, one should bulk up the 48½ per cent plus the 30 per cent company tax rate and have a marginal tax rate on employee remuneration of 78½ per cent - and if it wants to support a 78½ per cent taxation rate, then it should say so. It is entitled to do that. It is entitled to support 78½ per cent taxation rates. But what we do not believe the Australian Labor Party is entitled to do is to slip around with the suggestion that maybe it is in favour of that but, every time it is pinned down, deny that that is its policy. If the Australian Labor Party wants to come out and support 78½ per cent marginal tax rates, let it say so, and we will engage it in that debate. The people of Australia will be entitled to determine it. But let us not have this slippery, slidey opposition coming around, trying to walk both sides of the fence, trying to hold one thing out but never actually announcing a policy. Let me ask this question: does the Australian Labor Party support a 78½ per cent taxation rate or does it not? Would it please inform the public what its position is, and would it clarify the matter? This side of the parliament does not support it, as Labor did not during 13 years, as has not been the case throughout the course of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 and as has not been the case since income tax has applied to companies.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kalgoorlie for inquiring about a good news story for Indigenous Australians. Certainly, this is good news about more jobs for Indigenous people. One of the reasons for the very high level of unemployment amongst Indigenous people is their general lack of paper credentials and qualifications, and risk-averse employers' standard reluctance to give Aboriginal workers a chance to have a go. I can report that, with respect to the Argyle Diamond Mine in the Kimberley region of Western Australia, the percentage of Aboriginal workers has gone up from under four per cent -  - to over 14 per cent in just two years. The member for Werriwa is putting his foot in it! At Rio Tinto, the parent company, the number of Indigenous workers has increased from under 100 to nearly 500 in just six years. There are two factors in this success: first, the local Aboriginal community has nominated suitable candidates for the jobs available; second, and most importantly, rather than consider formal resumes, the company has employed all the Indigenous candidates on a trial basis to give them a chance to demonstrate what they can do in the place that really counts - the workplace. I would certainly encourage other employers to study and copy this approach. It is true that Australian business is keener than ever before to help Aboriginal people. Already, some 64 significant Australian businesses have joined the government's Corporate Leaders for Indigenous Employment program. I would encourage more to do so and to take advantage of assistance of up to $10,000 per worker per year for Indigenous traineeships. It is hard to truly participate in modern Australia without a job. If businesses want to help in the task of practical reconciliation, here is a very simple and straightforward way to help. Argyle mine and Rio Tinto, more generally, are showing Australian business how to succeed.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Riverina for the question. This decision by the Indian government to reduce the tariff on wool will be a major boost to the Australian wool industry. There are some 40,000 producers in this $3.6 billion industry, with many of the best of them in the honourable member's electorate. They will be particularly interested in this new market opportunity that is opening up. Already, India is Australia's fifth biggest wool market. The market increased by 7½ per cent in 2002 to $189 million, but this announcement to reduce tariffs will certainly open up the opportunity for significant additional sales into India. The tariff cut comes upon the concerted efforts of the government and the Australia-India Joint Business Group on Natural Fibres and Textiles to put downward pressure on tariffs, and there have been a number of reductions over recent times which have helped to encourage this very important trade. The reality is that, having lower priced wool available to the Indian industry will make Indian woollen goods more competitive on the Indian domestic market and internationally, and that will translate into larger and more significant sales for the Australian industry. India has a population of one billion people already, and it is growing rapidly, so it is a very important market for Australia. We warmly welcome this tariff reduction. It demonstrates that building a strong bilateral relationship with our trading partners can indeed achieve worthwhile results. I am sure that the wool industry will benefit greatly from the Indian government's decision, which we warmly welcome.</DOC>

 - I do not think there is any possible way of answering that question without effectively giving a legal opinion, but the Prime Minister has already given the assurance publicly that no further resolution is required. In case members opposite are relying in any way upon a recently published view of 43 international law experts, let me offer some comments on it. The statement from those 43 experts is, in my view, political in nature and it uses exaggeration and selective quoting of the law to achieve conclusions that are both wrong and offensive. The statement places qualifications on the ability of the Security Council to authorise the use of force which simply do not exist. - In the statement there is not one mention of Iraq's conduct over the past 12 years. There is not one mention of the over 25 United Nations Security Council resolutions since 1990 that directly and continuously condemn the action or inaction of Iraq in strong terms. There is not one mention in the letter of the innumerable uses by the United Nations Security Council over the past 12 years in relation to Iraq of terms like `condemn', `material breach', `flagrant violation', `totally unacceptable contravention' and `grave concern'. Those resolutions also condemn the repression of the Iraqi civilian population and refer to grave breaches by Iraq of the Geneva conventions.The 43 experts predict the future on the basis of exaggerated accounts of what could happen. The suggestion in the letter that the International Criminal Court would have jurisdiction over the legal basis for any future use of force is simply wrong. The conclusion that Australians would be involved in war crimes is not only wrong but also offensive. The Australian defence forces are trained in the law of armed conflict and would conduct themselves in accordance with that law. Since publication of the statement, the flaws it contains have been highlighted by a number of distinguished commentators. Professor Ivan Shearer, Challis Professor of International Law at the University of Sydney and a distinguished Australian international lawyer, referred to aspects of the statement as being not only offensive but also wrong. I remind the member for Griffith that the government has not taken a decision to commit troops.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Macarthur for his question. I was joined by the member for Macquarie and the member for Ryan on Tuesday morning at a wonderful event: a breakfast to celebrate the changes in the lives of eight young Australians. The NRMA have offered eight scholarships to young people in the ACT - and they have been running this program for three years in New South Wales - to support them in taking up apprenticeships in the motor body repair and spray-painting industry. Kegan Settree, a young bloke there, told me he had left school at the end of year 10. He said that, for the last two years, his life had been relatively aimless but that he had finally found something that he really wants to get into. His parents are as proud of his achievement in getting this scholarship as any one of us would be if they were getting a PhD from a university.The member for Macarthur, himself one of seven children, left school at the age of 15. He spent two months walking from industry to industry, from workshop to workshop, trying to get an apprenticeship. Today, thanks to this government, apprenticeships and training are much easier to acquire. - In the member for Macarthur's day, it was a lot harder to get an apprenticeship. His father said to him, `Son, if you want to set yourself up for life, you've got to get a trade.' Today, thanks to the policies of this government, there are 200,000 young Australians who are doing vocational education and training at school -  - in the automotive industry, in retail, hospitality, horticulture and a whole range of areas. There are 368,000 Australians, half of them under the age of 25, doing apprenticeships and training. That represents a 13 per cent growth on the year before and, most importantly, our completions have increased by 27 per cent in the last year. Importantly, there are benefits for companies taking on apprentices in the automotive industry. Kids are doing automotive courses in school. They have already done a little training at school, which is recognised, and they can then take up the apprenticeship. - As a result of the incentives put in place by this government, if an employer - for example, Peter Donnelly Automotive, in Campbelltown - takes on a school based apprentice, the employer will get $1,375 from this government, an extra $825 for keeping the young person at school and another $825 when that young person completes his apprenticeship having remained at school until the end of year 12.This is about making sure we live in a country where young people have access to apprenticeships and training and that it is as highly valued as any educational or training outcome. The Labor Party, which says that it stands for training and apprenticeships, is completely obsessed with higher education, with universities. We have the collective work of the member for Jagajaga on training. Every statement or media release put out in 15 months by the member for Jagajaga on training fits into a manila folder. These reforms mean that employers find it easier to take on -  -  - There are some people in the Australian Labor Party who do care about apprenticeships and training - the member for Port Adelaide, the member for Greenway, the member for Banks and some others. I can only imagine what they think about the derision about apprentices from the chardonnay set on the frontbench of the ALP. This government is interested in training and giving young people a chance as apprentices. As far as the ALP is concerned, it hit rock bottom when, in 1995, only 1.1 per cent of young people in this country were apprentices in training. Today, one in three young people in full-time employment are young `Pat Farmers' of the modern Australia who are training to be apprentices, training for careers and training for jobs that are going to transform this country.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for McMillan for his question. University education is a privilege. In the fifties and sixties there was a merit based scholarship system which operated to provide access for Australians to higher education. The advent of the Whitlam government in 1972 brought a number of changes, and one of those was to make university education available at no cost to all of those who were privileged to receive it. What the Whitlam government did was herald an era in which Australians raised their expectations of what governments would and could provide. The price that was paid for an entirely free university education was that the men and women who were working as apprentices and mechanics were paying for the university education of a group of people frequently from middle and upper income groups. As the former Prime Minister Bob Hawke told Radio 2GB, only yesterday, in response to a question:Let's make the point very simply and this is not a shot at Gough or anyone else, there is no such thing as free education.He went on to say:And when I was talking about it one of the things that struck me, I was talking to a friend of mine who was extraordinarily wealthy and he said 'this is crazy', he said 'my wife is going back to university and the workers of Australia are paying for it.' - Hawke made the point that the Labor government in 1988-89 recognised, as the member for Brand said at the time:There is no such thing as free, universal education.In 1989, 19 per cent of the poorest students, socioeconomically, in the country were in higher education at the age of 18. Today, it is 25 per cent and growing.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Hinkler for his question. It is appropriate that he asks this question today about sustainable energy, because today is World Sustainable Energy Day. There is a great deal of confusion in the minds of some about sustainable energy, sustainable resources and environmental matters. In Sydney yesterday, a new shop called Relish opened up, specialising in Tasmanian products. The opening was disrupted by demonstrators from the Australian Greens demanding that Tasmanian forestry operations be halted to save the koala. There was even someone dressed in a koala suit. There is just one problem with this: there are no koalas in Tasmania. The Tasmanian koala dwells entirely in the cloud cuckoo land of the Australian Greens. This deluded demonstration symbolises the growing confusion in the policies of the Australian Greens. It is the sort of confusion to be expected when science plays no role at all in policy, when all that matters is the ability to marshal a demonstration. The Australian Greens are now campaigning against wind farms in Tasmania. They say they compromise the RFA, the regional forest agreement, against which they have campaigned for years. They are currently campaigning against Australia providing clean coal technology for developing countries, which defeats both environmental and social justice objectives.This government is strongly promoting the science and technology to clean up our vast coal reserves and to put in place sustainable energy as a realistic clean energy option. Because of the Howard government's world leading program to establish a guaranteed energy market for renewable energy, we will see wind farms in every Australian state supplying some 250,000 megawatt hours of power annually. About 20,000 Australian homes are now using solar energy and generating over 600,000 renewable energy certificates into the bargain. Under the Renewable Remote Power Generation Program, remote communities are now replacing diesel generators with renewable energy. This government's energy policies are based on sound policy and sound science, unlike those of the opposition and the Australian Greens.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Gilmore for her question, because I think this is an enormously important issue and I know that many Australians will want Australia to make a contribution to helping the Iraqi people, who have been subjected to tyrannical rule for over a quarter of a century. - The Iraqi people have suffered enormously under Saddam Hussein. This government will do whatever it can to help them rebuild their lives. - This will be an opportunity to build a stable and prosperous Iraq in which the people can look forward with confidence, at long last, to a bright future free of tyranny. Over the last few weeks we have been involved in very detailed discussions with the United States government, with the United Kingdom government and also with a range of United Nations agencies on a wide range of issues, including post-conflict reconstruction issues. Not surprisingly, these discussions have been discreet and we certainly have not wanted in any way to pre-empt United Nations processes. We have, however, been working assiduously -  -  - I can't hear myself think. - You are supposed to be the leader of a political party, not a child in a primary school. You behave like a child in a primary school on a major international issue. You are a disgrace! -  - I think at least the Australian people will be interested to know that we have been working assiduously to identify how best we can help the Iraqi people to redress the lost years -  -  - As I said, I think the Australian people would be interested, if not the Leader of the Opposition. We want to help the Iraqi people to redress the lost years of fear, arbitrary oppression and deprivation. - We provided an initial $10 million to United Nations humanitarian agencies and the International Committee of the Red Cross for humanitarian assistance, planning and preparation. -  - These funds have supported the pre-positioning of essential relief supplies and humanitarian personnel in the region. A further $7.5 million will be provided for preparations, including to agencies such as UNICEF, the UNHCR and Australian non-government organisations to assist vulnerable communities, particularly Iraqi women and children, and to establish refugee facilities in Jordan. The Australian people can be reassured that we will be making further entirely appropriate and very significant contributions. - I have had no representations from any member of the opposition on this issue but the member for Pearce, in particular, has been assiduous in ensuring that the government addresses humanitarian relief in Iraq. I thank the member for Pearce for the simply tremendous job she has done in advocating for that humanitarian assistance. This government was generous to Afghanistan. After the conflict in Afghanistan we provided - I think I am right in saying this - some $43 million of assistance. We will provide well in excess of that to Iraq when the conflict is over.We are actively seeking to ensure that the suspended UN oil-for-food program on which many Iraqis depend can be resumed as quickly as possible to meet the vital humanitarian needs of Iraq. We support a strong United Nations role in post-conflict Iraq and we welcome the commitment made in the Azores statement by the United Nations, the United Kingdom and the Spanish leaders which foreshadowed a significant role for international institutions, including the United Nations, in reconstruction and humanitarian relief, and establishing a post-conflict administration in Iraq. -  - I am shaking my head in desperate sorrow for you, you pitiful creature. It is, of course, our fervent hope that Iraq will be able -  - Mr Speaker, I am happy to withdraw, in any case. -  - In conclusion let me say that it is our fervent hope that Iraq will be able to establish -  - It is, let me repeat, our fervent hope that Iraq will be able to establish a government which has the support and reflects the will of its people. - We will encourage the establishment of a unified Iraq under a representative government in which all Iraq's communities are fairly represented.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Barton for his question. As a Western country, Australia has been a terrorist target since at least 11 September 2001. As demonstrated by Bali, that threat is not restricted to Australia itself but extends to Australians and Australian interests overseas. As the Prime Minister has indicated, since the predeployment of Australian forces was announced in January, our intelligence agencies have advised that no intelligence has been received requiring the raising of the overall threat level in Australia. Threat levels in Australia were raised following September 11 and a security alert announced by the government on 19 November last year is still in force. Should information become available to the government that requires a change to the threat levels, the public will be advised as they have been in the past. - I have already said that Australia has been a target since at least September 11. And I have already said that the Prime Minister has announced that since the predeployment of forces in January no intelligence has been received requiring the raising of the overall threat level in Australia. - As the Prime Minister also indicated, the question of the impact of Australian involvement in Iraq on the likelihood of a terrorist attack in Australia is part of the current public debate. But it is important to understand that a central reason for our involvement in Iraq is to reduce the longer- and medium-term terrorist threat to Australia and make Australia, and the world in which Australians work and travel, safer.</DOC>

 - First of all, I thank the honourable member for his question. I recognise the hard work he too has put into trying to address this enormously important issue. A large number of countries are involved in the coalition to disarm Iraq of its weapons of mass destruction. There are many countries that are tired of Iraq's delays and obfuscation and that believe the international community needs to act to disarm Iraq of its weapons of mass destruction. Many of these countries have long been concerned about developments in Iraq and now that diplomacy has ended are willing to back up their concerns. Over 40 countries will participate in or support the coalition to disarm Iraq. Among those publicly supportive so far are Afghanistan, Albania, Azerbaijan, Bulgaria, Colombia, the Czech Republic, Denmark, El Salvador, Eritrea, Estonia, Ethiopia, Georgia, Hungary, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Latvia, Lithuania, Macedonia, the Netherlands, Nicaragua, the Philippines, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Spain, Turkey, Uzbekistan, Mongolia, Honduras and Rwanda. Many more countries will be lending their support behind the scenes. Obviously, military action could not be undertaken without the assistance of a range of countries in the Middle East region including, crucially, many of Iraq's Arab neighbours. - I do not think the contribution of Iraq's Arab neighbours to this campaign should ever be underestimated. Contributions that will be made include the provision of troops, basing and overflight rights. For example, Poland will contribute 200 soldiers, including special forces, chemical and logistical units. Poland's president said in announcing this that Poland knew very well what the consequences of neglect and indifference to a military threat could be. Denmark will contribute a submarine, a frigate, doctors and army liaison staff. The Netherlands has already committed patriot missiles to the defence of Turkey and is sending a frigate and submarine to the theatre. Spain has said it will send a hospital ship, a refuelling ship and a frigate. Spain would also allow the use of Spanish military bases and will provide chemical and biological weapons experts. The Korean cabinet will ask the national assembly to approve a plan to send an engineering battalion of between 500 and 600 soldiers.Many countries in the Asia-Pacific region agree with us that Iraq must be disarmed, and they have made strong statements in support of the need for force. I refer to Japan's Prime Minister, Mr Koizumi, who said on 18 March that President Bush had no other choice but to make the decision to issue an ultimatum to Iraq as the United Nations Security Council had not been able to agree on a common stance. Prime Minister Koizumi said that, given past resolutions, another one was not necessary to authorise the use of force. Singapore's Foreign Minister Jayakumar said on 14 March that, if military action had occurred -  - it would be because of Iraq's failure to comply with Security Council resolutions. Singapore had favoured a second resolution, but failure to achieve consensus on one could not be taken as an excuse for inaction. Philippines Foreign Secretary Ople said on 16 March that the forcible disarming of Saddam was mandated by Security Council resolution 1441 and the Philippines would be part of the coalition of the willing. The assertion made by some that Australia is just part of a coalition of three is nonsense. The assertion also made that countries in our region do not support the action led by the United States and the coalition of the willing is equally nonsense.</DOC>

 - I have effectively already answered that question, but let me add to the answer I have just given. Australia, the United States, the United Kingdom and other countries have very close arrangements for the sharing of intelligence. As I have said, there is no intelligence suggesting that, since the predeployment of Australian troops to the Middle East in January, there is a specific threat to Australia. - That takes into account intelligence which is shared by our coalition partners.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Solomon for his question. As all members of the House will know, the government is deeply committed to protecting the safety of Australians overseas and my department's travel advisories, naturally enough, are being reviewed constantly. Throughout the week I have announced strengthened travel advisories for a range of countries in the Middle East. Australians for quite some time now have been urged to leave Iraq using available commercial means. But, fairly obviously, now Baghdad airport is closed. Our advice to those Australians who now remain in Iraq is that, unless they are able to leave overland - and I suspect that would not be easy - they should stay well away from any strategic or military locations.At this stage, at the time I am speaking here, we believe there are 15 Australians still in Iraq. Twelve of them are believed to be in Baghdad and three of them in northern Iraq. This number of 15 includes four media representatives - two of whom are in Baghdad and two of whom are believed to be in the north - seven human shields and four long-term residents. This does not include a number of dual nationals, who are well integrated into the local community, and I do not have a figure for how many dual nationals there are. Advice has been communicated to these Australians that our ability to provide consular assistance is obviously limited in the extreme.In addition, Australians should not travel to Kuwait, Israel, Jordan or Syria, and any Australians who are in those countries are advised to leave. Australians should also defer nonessential travel to Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Bahrain, Iran, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar. Australians should depart, unless their presence is essential and they are satisfied that their safety and their contingency plans are adequate.The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade will continue to provide practical advice that Australians should heed in the event they become caught up in a hostile environment. Our deep concern about security in the region has been exemplified in contingency planning for our missions in the Middle East. Decisions to draw down staff in these missions have been announced in various travel advisories that we have updated. Our embassies in Tel Aviv and Amman have drawn down to emergency staff, and other embassies may very well follow. Our embassies in Beirut, Riyadh, Abu Dhabi and Teheran have directed staff dependants to depart. Australians working for the United Nations have, I believe, all now been evacuated from Iraq. We will continue to consult daily, perhaps even hourly, with our key consular partners, the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada and New Zealand, on further possible contingencies. Any activation of contingency plans affecting Australians will be preceded by clear public advice.</DOC>

 - I have said it more than once; let me say it again. The government has been advised by our intelligence agencies that, since the predeployment of Australian forces to the Middle East in January 2003, no intelligence has been received requiring the raising of the overall threat level in Australia.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Cook for his question and for his interest. As the Prime Minister has said, the government has received formal advice from both the Attorney-General's Department and my department that the legal basis for the use of force against Iraq is unequivocal. Interestingly, that advice is consistent with the advice provided to the United States -  - the United Kingdom - the Blair government - the Dutch and the Danish governments, as well as with the views expressed by the prime ministers of Italy and Japan. The legal authority derives from Security Council resolutions 678, 687 and 1441, all passed under chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations. In resolution 678, the Security Council authorised United Nations member states to use all necessary means not just to liberate Kuwait but to restore international peace and security in the area. Resolution 687 imposed a conditional cease-fire on Iraq at the end of the Gulf War, based on Iraqi compliance with obligations to disarm its weapons of mass destruction. In resolution 1441, which was passed unanimously on 8 November last year, the Security Council recalled resolution 678 as a relevant resolution to Iraqi weapons of mass destruction disarmament, recalled that the cease-fire in resolution 687 was conditional upon Iraqi compliance with its obligations to disarm and decided that Iraq remained in material breach of this obligation.Since 8 November and the passage of Security Council resolution 1441, Iraq has chosen not to comply with that resolution because it has chosen not to `actively, immediately and unconditionally' cooperate with United Nations weapons inspectors. The cease-fire is now revoked. This straightforward legal argument is accepted by many countries and is an argument, interestingly enough, endorsed by the former chief of staff of the former Leader of the Opposition, who is indeed a great supporter of the Labor Party; he stood for preselection for a Sydney seat - the seat of Lowe - and is very highly regarded by members on the other side. The fact is that he has fully endorsed these arguments. In a way, more interestingly for the opposition, in 1998 - and members of the opposition may not recall this - there was an operation undertaken by the Clinton administration called Operation Desert Fox. I can see a blank look on the faces of members of the opposition. - I can always see a blank look on your face. Operation Desert Fox was an operation which included the use of cruise missiles and bombs. Missiles were fired against Iraq. It was a substantial bombing campaign of Iraq. At that time, the then opposition spokesman for foreign affairs, the member for Kingsford-Smith, told this House - this is in March 1998 - that `resolution 678 is still in force'. This was an argument which was repeated by the member for Brand when he was the Leader of the Opposition and by the member for Brisbane who, at the time, was the opposition spokesman on defence. To the best of my knowledge, there was no dissent within opposition ranks about the legality of the Clinton administration's bombing campaign against Iraq and, indeed, the deployment of Australian troops earlier in the year in order to support miliary pressure on Iraq at that time. So it came as a surprise to us on Sunday morning to hear the member for Griffith, who is the current opposition spokesman on foreign affairs, say that the use of force in these circumstances had suddenly become illegal. It was legal in 1998, but it has suddenly become illegal now - perhaps because the Bush administration is in office and not the Clinton administration.Interestingly enough, on the very same morning - it shows how disoriented the opposition is - the Leader of the Opposition was asked, and did not know, whether it was legal or illegal. He then said that he was waiting for advice. Months and months of debate on this issue of Iraq had been going on, but the Leader of the Opposition was still waiting for advice. The incredible thing is that only last night, when he was interviewed on the 7.30 Report, he said that he still did not have any advice. But he added - and I think these are interesting words - that `whether it was legal or not did not matter'. A lot happened during the night, because at lunchtime today at the Press Club he said that he had got legal advice - although he never said who he had got it from - and that the legal advice was important. Yesterday it did not matter; today it is important. It simply exposes the vacuousness and opportunism of the opposition's position on the very serious issue of Iraq. - Mr Speaker, I challenge the Leader of the Opposition to release publicly his legal advice. Indeed, I ask him to table it in the parliament today. We look forward to seeing who wrote it as well. Let me make a final point on alternative approaches. The opposition leader said - and has said on many occasions - that he believes the war is morally wrong because it has not got the authority of the United Nations Security Council. That is his argument. First of all, it does have the authority of the Security Council. Second, let me say that it is an interesting intellectual point that the morality of war is determined ultimately by the five permanent members of the Security Council. - So if France says - as is the case here - that a Security Council resolution should be vetoed, that makes a war immoral. Mr Speaker, that is to contract out your foreign policy and, worse, to contract out your morality to another country. And the people the Labor Party have contracted their foreign policy out to are the French.</DOC>

 - I partially answered this question earlier when I talked about the travel advisories that my department has issued. I do not write them myself; the department prepares them in consultation with our missions overseas. There have been significant changes in the travel advisories, and I articulated five, six, seven or so of those changes that have taken place in recent times. We do, from time to time, upgrade global travel alerts, but I make this point: what the situation is in terms of the security of Australians in Nicaragua, Buenos Aires or Reykjavik may be an entirely different thing from the security of Australians in Amman, Oman, Jakarta or the Philippines. Whilst we do from time to time have global travel advisories, we update them only when we have information which we believe is relevant to every single place on earth. In this particular instance, it is a matter of judgment but my judgment is that the best thing to do is to make sure that we focus primarily on the country-specific travel advisories, because the situation that you might find in Kuwait or in Amman in Jordan is, I would have thought, very obviously entirely different for Australians from the situation that you might find in Buenos Aires or in Panama City.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Petrie for her question. As I indicated in response to questions from the member for Barton, Australia has been on an unprecedented level of security alert since September 11, and the alert that was raised on 19 November last year remains current. As I said earlier, Australia has been a terrorist target since at least 11 September 2001. The government have done a lot to protect the public. We acted quickly and effectively to strengthen our counter-terrorism abilities to reflect the threat. In the last federal budget, $1.3 billion was allocated for extra staff and resources to our security, law enforcement and border protection agencies to meet the challenges of the new security environment. Another $100 million was allocated to further upgrade those capabilities following the Bali bombings. The government also developed a comprehensive package of counter-terrorism legislation, the bulk of which was passed last year. As the House is aware, a key element is the ASIO bill, which is yet to be passed. It is proposed that that be introduced today, and we look forward to the cooperation of the opposition in obtaining passage of this important legislation as quickly as possible.The government has also strengthened its intelligence sharing and cooperative security arrangements with Australia's regional neighbours as well as with traditional partners and other countries around the world. At home, we have strengthened our cooperation and coordination with states and territories to enable a swift and effective response to any terrorist incident within Australia. In Perth this week there has been a national counter-terrorism exercise conducted. The suggestion that has been made by previous questions - that we should increase the threat levels in Australia as a result of the likely conflict in Iraq - I have already answered. As I said, since the predeployment of Australian forces, there has been no intelligence received requiring the raising of the overall threat level in Australia. The level of counter-terrorism alert is under continual review against a backdrop of international developments and of threat information. The Australian system works on the basis of information and response. Our intelligence agencies carefully analyse relevant information and assess the threat to Australia. As I have said, Australia is on a heightened level of alert, and this has involved upgraded security measures and heightened levels of intelligence activity focused on counter-terrorism. As a measure of prudence and precaution, some additional security measures have been implemented with respect to some Australian embassies overseas, some foreign interest in Australia and some Australian interests, including defence facilities. Our intelligence agencies will continue to monitor trends and activities and, should there be any indication of an increased threat to Australia, relevant agencies and the government will respond appropriately. Should information become available to the government which requires a change to threat levels, the public will be advised. As the conduct of our very successful national security public campaign demonstrates, the government takes its responsibilities to inform the public about the threat environment very seriously.</DOC>

 - I am aware of reported threats against Americans, British nationals and Australians by an extremist group, which translated into English means the `Islamic defenders front'. I would have to say that this kind of language is typical of the sort of rhetoric that comes from these diabolically bad extremist groups which seek to pervert and hijack Islam. As the government, we give no encouragement or credit to these groups.The travel advice that we have for Indonesia cautions Australians about what are called `sweeping operations' - raids into bars and so on looking for Westerners - by militant Islamic groups, and we particularly refer to bars, nightclubs and other public places. But this caution has been in place since October 2002. There have been other threats of this kind on quite a number of occasions.In response to this latest threat, the embassy in Jakarta did issue an embassy bulletin, which has been sent to registered Australian citizens in Indonesia. We have advised Australians, as I think the House may recall, to defer non-essential travel to Indonesia since 13 October 2002.</DOC>

 - As the Attorney-General has indicated, on the advice of security agencies, the threat level in this country has not at this time been increased. In relation to transport security, which I know is of very great interest to all travellers in Australia and to all of us generally, I do want to say that the level of awareness across the transport industries and the government agencies responsible for them is at very high levels. I have met this afternoon with the head of the newly created Transport Security Division in my department, Andrew Tongue, and I have ensured that we are indeed ready on a number of fronts. We are in constant contact with our key domestic security agencies and with transport security agencies in key countries around the world. Should the situation change, we will be ready to move immediately to introduce additional security measures.We are not coming off a static base, of course. We already have a range of heightened security measures in place, covering air, sea and land transport and have been working for some time with the states and with the transport industries on transport security issues. In aviation, in particular, we have in place a lot of additional security measures - ASMs at airports and on our aircraft. It should not be forgotten that air security officers are flown on thousands of domestic flights and they are in the air today.An incident having occurred in the gallery -  - We have additional Protective Service officers that have been deployed at our major airports and there continues to be increased screening of goods and people. At the same time, there are stricter security arrangements for international and domestic cargo. My department continues to work with the port sector, customs service and with DIMIA to enhance existing security arrangements, covering surveillance, passenger and baggage screening, security patrols and the application of access controls and identity checks.In relation to shipping, I notice that we have had one or two state leaders commenting on shipping security. As I mentioned earlier, we are working with the state governments around the country to address areas of state transport security and, while we are, broadly speaking, getting good cooperation from some, one or two should have a very close look at their own backyard. There is a little bit of basic work in a couple of our states that has not been carried forward as quickly as it might. A couple of those premiers who have had shots at us in recent days need to have a close look at the level of cooperation that they are delivering in some of their own key areas. I make this point in relation to ships: the passenger lists and the crew lists of ships coming to Australia are checked at least 48 hours before they arrive. Yesterday we met with state counterparts to ensure that appropriate arrangements are in place at state level concerning land transport security. - Again I say, there is, broadly, good cooperation, but I think the pace could be picked up a little, frankly. Those who want to take cheap shots should be careful about what is happening in their own backyard. I want to conclude by reference to another matter that is very important, and that is that transport security arrangements are taken forward in concert with international bodies, and we are seeking to be actively involved at a high-quality level, particularly in relation to the International Civil Aviation Organisation - ICAO - and the IMO, the International Maritime Organisation.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I will check the record but, as I recall, in what was really quite a convoluted question on the day - and it was a bit hard to follow -  -  - No, this is an important issue. I asked the member who asked the question to provide evidence, if he had any, of a specific incursion. To my knowledge, no such evidence has been provided. A number of measures of increased security arrangements for those who seek access to airports have been put in place. The further reissuing of Aviation Security Identification Cards, ASICs, is now in progress. That will result in a significant tightening. In addition to that -  - As I say, ASICs are in the process of being re-evaluated and will be reissued. There will be very strict background and identity checks as part of that. As it stands at the moment, persons wishing to access security restricted areas at security categorised airports, such as those in capital cities, have to display current ASICs or they have to be accompanied by a person holding one. Those cards will be further upgraded over the next few months. The scheme is being extended to cover all airports where passenger screening is mandated and for access to other airport related security sensitive areas such as fuel facilities and critical air traffic facilities. But I reissue the challenge, as this is obviously important: if there has been an incursion -  - Mr Speaker, I hardly think it is the cause for catcalls that I should know about some incident that the member claimed some weeks ago, or presumably referred to. I challenge him to provide some evidence. Is he saying to this House that he is aware of an incursion -  - Virtually, Mr Speaker, because I have clearly set out how the policy works now and how we are extending it and how security and background checks will be tightened with the reissuing of ASICs in coming weeks, as part of the policy that was announced in this place recently. But I reiterate the point - and I would have thought that it was quite a straightforward and reasonable request, if we are concerned about aviation security - that, if the member is aware, as his question implies, of a security breach, I would have thought it was incumbent upon him, delivering on his purported concern for the safety and wellbeing of the travelling public, to provide us with evidence of it.</DOC>

 - The short answer to that question is that we have had travel advisories out on Indonesia for quite some time, which have a high level of warning in them. I remind the House of what the travel advisory says. It says:We continue to advise Australians to defer non-essential travel to Indonesia, including Bali. Threats against Australians and Australian interests in Indonesia remain high given possible terrorist action and civil disorder. Our advice also remains that Australians in Indonesia who are concerned about their security should consider departure.Let me go on, because it is an opportunity to remind people what our travel advisory for Indonesia does say:Australians in Indonesia should continue to exercise extreme caution in commercial and public places frequented by foreigners, such as clubs, restaurants, bars, hotels, schools, outdoor recreation events and tourist areas including resorts outside major cities and historical and cultural locations including Borobodur. We are continuing to receive reports that places of worship, office buildings, international fast food outlets, upmarket entertainment areas, shopping centres and luxury hotels may also be targeted. These reports often focus on locations in central Jakarta.As the House knows, we referred in the travel advisories in relation to Indonesia to a specific threat -  - There has been some discussion about the issue of travel advisories. Not every member of the House has had the opportunity to read the travel advisories. Let me remind the House further that it goes on to say:Australians are advised to avoid travel to Surabaya, west Timor, Maluku and North Maluku, Aceh - and various other places; I will not go through them all - ... and defer non-essential travel to other parts of Indonesia.Then there is another list of places that Australians should avoid. We then go on to say:We continue to caution Australians about `sweeping' operations ...`Sweeping operations' is not an expression we are all familiar with but it essentially means raids. It means people going into bars, clubs and the like and looking for foreigners in particular and trying to ensure that those foreigners are pushed out of the bars and the clubs. So the travel advisory says:We continue to caution Australians about `sweeping' operations (raids) by militant Islamic groups against bars, nightclubs and other public places. These groups may seek to specifically identify Australians in their `sweeping' activities.Finally, and this is relevant as well:Following the listing on 26 October by the United Nations of Jemaah Islamiyah as a terrorist organisation and the detention of Abu Bakar Ba'asyir, Australians are urged to exercise special caution, particularly in Central Java.As far as I know, other countries have -  - The final point that I want to make relates to the gradation of the travel advisory. It is the judgment of my department, which as the minister responsible I share and have allowed, that an upgrade of the travel advice is not warranted by specific threat information. That is not to say we have not referred to the threats of terrorism, the particular places where there could be terrorist attacks and the particular types of locations where terrorists could attack. It is extremely important that people read these travel advisories carefully and take all that into account. But we have not increased the gradation of the travel advice.The United States reissued, but did not upgrade, its travel warning for Indonesia on 22 March. The United States advice recommends that US citizens defer all travel to Indonesia and consider departing. That is the same level of warning that the United States has maintained since 19 October 2002. In the case of the United Kingdom, it reissued its travel advice over the weekend and maintained its warning. It did not increase the gradation of its warning but maintained its warning of the deferral of non-essential travel. That is the same level of warning as ours. Of course, the different countries use different language. We do not all have one writer of travel advisories and sometimes our travel advisories are not the same. Some of the travel advisories about the Middle East have been a little different from time to time. But, as it happens, in the case of Indonesia, the travel advisories have pretty much the same level of warning in all of them.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Cowper. I inform the House that the government is very satisfied with the progress being made by the coalition forces in the military operation in Iraq. The coalition forces, as I think most members would be aware from media reporting, have already made very rapid progress. Operations against Iraq have now been under way for only five days but already in that time the southern oilfields have been secured. This very significant achievement has averted the major ecological and economic disaster that would have ensued had Iraqi forces been able to carry out the regime's plans for the destruction of those oilfields. That, of course, would have been to the immense cost of the Iraqi people. I take the opportunity to reaffirm our view, which we have held consistently - and I know it is a view expressed and held by President Bush and by the British Prime Minister - that the oil assets in question belong to the Iraqi people. That ownership and that trusteeship of those assets will be fully supported and fully respected by the Australian government and I am sure by the Australian people.Coalition forces are operating successfully throughout Iraq on the ground and in the air. A wide range of Iraqi military targets have been successfully engaged and significant Iraqi forces have surrendered or otherwise been rendered ineffective. The coalition nations stand ready to deliver massive humanitarian assistance - food, water and medicines - to the Iraqi people in the next few days as the security situation, particularly in the south, stabilises. It is worth pointing out in this context that our own maritime forces are making an important contribution to clearing waterways at the north of the Persian Gulf so that this can take place.Coalition forces have started to engage Iraqi forces defending Baghdad. There should be no cause for complacency. Many difficult and challenging days for the coalition forces lie ahead. There are pockets of resistance to coalition forces and our coalition partners have sadly suffered a number of casualties in recent days. I know that all Australians will join me in expressing our sympathy to the families of those who have been killed or injured. We have never accepted that this task would be achieved easily or without casualties and loss. The next phase of operations against Iraq's Republican Guard forces deployed outside Baghdad will be very intense and extremely difficult, and nobody should underestimate the intensity of the exchanges or the challenges that lie ahead of the coalition forces.For our part, Australian forces continue to make a very vital contribution. The Chief of the Army, General Leahy, reported this morning that our special forces continue to conduct highly successful strategic reconnaissance and direct action operations deep behind enemy lines destroying enemy facilities and denying freedom of movement to Iraqi forces. I have noticed in some media outlets perhaps a sense of exasperation about there not being more detail available in relation to the activities of Australian forces. Let me reiterate the longstanding and very prudent practice of all governments that have special forces deployed that details beyond general descriptions are never made available for very good reason. This government and the military in Australia have no intention of departing from that approach in relation to our special forces. I could point out that the extensive and detailed reporting through embedded journalists and the like in relation to the British and American forces has not extended to the activities of the American and British special forces that are also deployed in the operation. The same attitude is taken by the United States administration and the British government and the military in both of those countries towards the particular role of special forces.Our Navy clearance diving team is operating in the southern Iraqi port city of Um Qasar, where it will be working to clear the port and approaches - vital to allowing humanitarian and military supplies to flow. Our ships remain on interception operations in the Persian Gulf, and of course in recent days they have provided naval cover for the activities of British Royal Marines in that area.Air operations continue over Iraq. The Australian national commander, Brigadier McMahon, has reported that Australian FA18s have been involved with other coalition aircraft in strikes against Iraqi tanks, defensive positions and a barracks. The C130s are providing vital intra-theatre airlift and our P3s are supporting coalition maritime forces.As I speak to the House I am pleased to report that all Australian personnel and troops on Operation Falcon are safe and well. I know that all Australians are anxious about their welfare as they contribute to this very difficult and dangerous operation to disarm Iraq and to alleviate the suffering of the people of Iraq. I know I speak again for all Australians in conveying to them our very warm good wishes and expressions of hope for their safe return.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. I would have to get particular advice to certify that it was 60 per cent, but obviously the food program bulks quite large and whether it is 60 per cent or some other percentage I do not think essentially alters the thrust of the Leader of the Opposition's question. A number of things have already been done, and in particular by Australia. You may be aware that last week the Minister for Foreign Affairs announced that the Australian government would be acquiring 100,000 tonnes of wheat. That represented two shipments that were bound for Iraq but because of the hostilities could not enter. The idea was that we would acquire it and as a gift to the Iraqi people and in cooperation with the United States we would make this food available. I think from recollection that at the time we took the decision there was something like eight weeks supply, or necessary supplies of wheat in Iraq at the time were eight weeks. So the view was taken that if we and the Americans and others acquired this wheat we would be able to support the emergency food needs of the Iraqi people through that provision. The Americans and the British have large amounts of humanitarian assistance available to be provided to the Iraqi people, subject, of course, to obtaining access to places such as Basra. One of the reasons why that is not immediately available is that the area has been very heavily mined by the Iraqi forces, and through our minesweepers we are making a contribution to the clearing of those mines, which will enable the immediate facilitation of humanitarian aid. I want to assure the House that we see our role not only in enforcing the disarmament of Saddam Hussein but also in making a contribution to the alleviation of the suffering of the Iraqi people. I might also take the opportunity, because the Leader of the Opposition mentioned the oil for food program, of reminding him and the parliament that the United Nations sanctions would never have been necessary if Iraq had agreed to the requirements of disarmament imposed way back in 1991. I might also say that the oil for food program has been immorally and shamefully rorted by Saddam Hussein, who has used the proceeds of it to acquire his weapons capacity and support it. It has to be said - and the Australian public should be reminded - that we had these economic sanctions because Iraq did not disarm. They were imposed by the United Nations because Iraq did not disarm. If Iraq had disarmed, those sanctions would never have been necessary. Worse still, having through his policies made those sanctions necessary, the Iraqi leader has compounded the sins inflicted upon his own people by rorting the very oil for food program which was designed to in some way mitigate the impact of the economic sanctions. So he is doubly guilty of betraying his obligations towards the Iraqi people.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Dobell for his question and for his interest. The United States, the United Kingdom and Australia have been joined by many other countries in the coalition of the willing to disarm Iraq. Over 50 countries have now publicly supported the military coalition. This includes countries which have provided or offered to provide military forces, and I would be happy to provide the list to anyone who is seriously interested in the level of support for the coalition. Importantly, in terms of our own part of the world, I would note that several countries from our region are part of the coalition of the willing in different ways. Japan has been very supportive of the United States policy on Iraq, and some members of the House will be aware that Prime Minister Koizumi made a very strong statement, which I understand he wrote himself, in support of the American position. South Korea has been very supportive, and I also mention Singapore and the Philippines. So there is significant support for the coalition of the willing in our own region. The coalition, though, is notable for its diversity and its breadth, and it is significant that many European countries that have experienced totalitarian regimes in the past, and in the not very distant past, have joined the coalition and have been particularly supportive of the coalition. That is quite understandable given the abhorrence they have of totalitarianism, and that abhorrence has been all the sharper bearing in mind their own recent experiences.Contributions from members of the coalition include the provision of troops, basing and overflight rights, logistical and intelligence support, specialised chemical, biological response teams as well as humanitarian and reconstruction aid. All of these things are very important in their own different ways. Additional countries over and above members of the coalition are providing support and have not been publicly associated with the coalition. As I told the House last week - and it is very important to understand this - military action to disarm the regime of Saddam Hussein would not be possible without the assistance or agreement of a range of countries in the Middle East and that, of course, is specifically referring to a number of Iraq's Arab neighbours.I said earlier that there are countries in our own region that have been associated with the coalition of the willing, and I referred to Singapore. Let me remind the House that Singapore's Prime Minister Goh recently confirmed that Singapore was part of the coalition because it believed it was necessary to address the threat of weapons of mass destruction getting into the hands of terrorists. Singapore has committed financial support for humanitarian aid. I also remind the House that the Korean National Assembly is apparently going to consider the Korean government's plan -  -  - Yes, exactly; it will consider the Korean government's plan to send several hundred engineering troops to Iraq, so there will be a vote in the Korean National Assembly on that in the next day or so. In conclusion, the breadth of the coalition is there and the depth of the coalition is there. It is hardly surprising because an overwhelming number of countries around the world believe that it is fundamentally important to disarm the totalitarian and barbarous regime of President Saddam Hussein.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. I had quite a number of conversations with the President of Indonesia before military operations. One of the reasons I quite deliberately went to Jakarta to see President Megawati after I had seen President Bush and Mr Blair was to express my gratitude to the Indonesian police for the magnificent work they had done in tracking down the people who had murdered 88 Australians in the Bali attack. One of the other reasons I went to see President Megawati was to put into context the policy of the Australian government regarding Iraq, to explain that the action was not in any way anti-Islamic. President Megawati explicitly accepted this explanation and, in fact, it has been reflected in statements made by her; so the proper background has been established. Contact between Australia and Indonesia since has quite properly been between our security agencies - between our police and other security agencies. One of the things that has been very successfully done since the Bali attack is the development of an extensive network of contacts between the Australian Federal Police, their counterparts in Indonesia and their counterparts in other parts of the region.The Leader of the Opposition will recall some discussions that he and I had when we were in Bali together. We both agreed, perhaps approaching the matter in slightly different ways but nonetheless having the same objective, that we needed to develop closer relations between the security agencies of Australia and the security agencies not only of Indonesia but also of the region, and we have done that. In fact - and I am sure I am not disclosing anything I shouldn't - the material in relation to the concern about Surabaya was communicated very rapidly and directly. I know it has been the subject of quite a number of discussions between our agencies and the relevant agencies in Indonesia.If the point of the Leader of the Opposition's question is to elicit from me an assurance that there has been extensive contact at the appropriate level between Australia and Indonesia about the Surabaya warning then I can assure him that there has. As far as the general question of heightened terrorist alerts the reality is that, as I said yesterday, as the Attorney-General has said, as the foreign minister has said, we have been on heightened terrorist alert in this country since 11 September 2001. There was the general warning issued last year in November. On top of that, of course, there have been very specific warnings given in relation to Australian citizens in Indonesia. The foreign minister has gone over that. Different countries express things in different ways.If the Leader of the Opposition is asserting that we have not given appropriate warnings to Australians in Indonesia based on the information that we have, he is wrong. We have gone further than that; we have laid the basis of practical deterrence and practical assistance. That is, to engage the Australian Federal Police and their counterparts in Indonesia, and the state of cooperation between those agencies could not have been better. The testament and the evidence of that is the way in which they cooperated to track down those who were involved in the Bali attack. I think it is fair to say that the security relationship between the two countries in particular could not be stronger. We have explained our position on warnings. There is really nothing more I can add without being repetitious, which I know is against the standing orders.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Forrest for the question. There has been some suggestion that we should raise our threat levels in response to the war on Iraq. As the Prime Minister explained to the House yesterday and again just now, Australia has been on a heightened security alert since the September 11 and we issued a special alert on 19 November last year that remains current. During this unprecedented period of heightened alert against a possible terrorist attack, the government has taken significant steps to strengthen our security arrangements and the capabilities to protect the Australian community. The advice from our security agencies, such as the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, remains that, since the predeployment of Australian forces in Iraq was announced in January, no intelligence has been received to warrant raising the overall threat in Australia. These are the experts with access to the relevant intelligence. Their job is to advise the government on threat levels and the threat environment. The government is acting in accordance with that expert advice and it would be irresponsible of us to do otherwise.It is important to remember that this advice is given after taking into account the fact that we are already on a heightened security alert and that our Commonwealth and state and territory agencies are already operating on that basis. We are already operating on the basis that there is a general increased threat of terrorism. We have taken steps to respond to that threat, and there is no new information that would warrant raising the general threat level at this time. Critics of the fact that we have not raised the threat level seem to overlook the fact that it is already heightened. We are not saying that there is no threat, and neither are our agencies. The government has been quite open with the Australian people since September 11 in sharing, so far as it can, information relevant to public safety. The government has done this even when information is generalised and non-specific - the alert of 19 November is a case in point.As the Prime Minister said yesterday, in the event of a terrorist attack in the coming weeks, wherever it happened, we could assume that the perpetrators would use Iraq as a part of their attempt to justify it. But any such attack would have been in planning for some considerable time, long before the war in Iraq became certain. The government has been open and honest about the terrorist threat to Australia. As a Western country, Australia has been a terrorist target since at least 11 September. As demonstrated by Bali, that threat is not restricted to Australia itself but extends to Australians and Australian interests overseas. Let us not make the mistake of thinking that the threat environment is static.As the Prime Minister advised the House yesterday, over the weekend the government was advised of credible information of a terrorist threat in Surabaya, which led to DFAT issuing the warnings about Surabaya on Saturday. New threat information could come in at any time that may warrant a change to Australia's overall threat level. But what the government has consistently stated is that it takes advice from its agencies on the matter of threat levels, and that advice is currently that there is no information that would warrant a change to the threat level. Our intelligence agencies continue to monitor trends and activity. Should there be any indication of an increased threat to Australia, relevant agencies and the government will respond appropriately.The government takes its responsibility to inform the public about the threat environment very seriously and, should the government be advised by its agencies about information requiring a change to the current threat levels, the public will be advised. The government cannot and will not raise threat levels simply because it would look good or because it seems like a good idea in the coffee room. As I said earlier, it would be irresponsible not to act in accordance with advice from those with access to the relevant intelligence. To do otherwise would undermine the credibility of the system and ultimately the safety of the Australian community. The government takes the safety of the Australian community far too seriously to play games with threat levels.</DOC>

 - I am not specifically aware of the comments to which the Leader of the Opposition has referred, but I am aware of a range of views on this issue. As I have said on a couple of occasions, the relevance of terrorist threats to this country is part of the debate as to whether or not we should have committed to the military operation in Iraq. The government argues that in the medium to longer term, by disarming Iraq of its weapons of mass destruction and thereby not only denying Iraq the capacity to either deliberately or otherwise pass those weapons to terrorist groups, we do not give encouragement for other rogue states to acquire such weapons, thereby increasing the likelihood, as a matter of sheer logic, of terrorist groups getting hold of such weapons. Can I refer the Leader of the Opposition to the several answers I have given. I have given my answers based on information that we have received. I repeat that we have not received any specific intelligence warranting a heightening of the terrorist alert in this country. The Leader of the Opposition, I know, is searching for something. But I can only repeat the information we have. When we get information about a particular threat, we pass it on.</DOC>

 - I suppose we are now five days into the military action to disarm the regime of Saddam Hussein. It is noteworthy that coalition troops are now not far from Baghdad. Obviously the next stage of this campaign will be not only crucial but difficult. We expect that Baghdad will be defended by the so-called special republican guard and a variety of other trusted security forces, including an organisation called Fedayeen Saddam and the special security organisation. Honourable members may be interested to know that Saddam Hussein does not trust his regular troops even to enter the city of Baghdad. One of the main roles of the trusted security forces will be to defend against an uprising by the people of Baghdad, who overwhelmingly are part of the oppressed Shiah sect of Islam.The Fedayeen Saddam, which has been in operation in other parts of Iraq as well in recent days, is a paramilitary group which is headed by Saddam Hussein's son Qusay. According to reputable sources, it was formed to quash internal dissent and disturbances after Iraq's defeat in 1991, with a particular focus on the Shiahs. It numbers between around 30,000 and 40,000, is based in Baghdad and includes a special unit known as the death squadron, whose members perform executions. It operates completely outside of the law. There are reports that the Fedayeen was responsible for public beheadings of women in a series of sweeps through Baghdad in June 2000 to May 2001 under the guise of cleaning up prostitution. It also puts down protests and assassinates dissidents and opponents of the regime. Its soldiers are trained in urban fighting and suicide tactics. They are widely reported to be using deception tactics, such as wearing civilian clothes, basing themselves in civilian facilities and faking surrenders to draw coalition forces into ambushes. It is apparently attempting to prevent Iraqi troops from surrendering, by giving them the choice of fighting or being shot in the back if they surrender.The special republican guard is responsible for protecting Saddam Hussein and providing a military response to any attempt for a rebellion or a coup. It is an elite paramilitary unit, with recruits drawn from Saddam's hometown - which is the city of Tikrit - an area south and west of Mosel and also around Baghdad. These are areas and clans noted for their loyalty to Saddam's person and regime. It is believed that it numbers somewhere in the vicinity of 25,000 men. The third organisation I refer to is the special security organisation and is also controlled by Saddam's son Qusay. It is another loyalist force, a much smaller one. It is a force of somewhere between 2,000 and 5,000 men, also recruited from the loyalist tribes. It plays a major role in keeping a range of other security forces in line, and is Iraq's most powerful security agency. It is the organisation which guards Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction. In a phrase, it is Saddam Hussein's SS. There is no doubt that over the next few days fighting will intensify, when the coalition comes into contact with these groups. We have no doubt that these groups will fight to the end to ensure the regime's survival, as they know that they have no role in a democratic Iraq without the protection of Saddam Hussein.</DOC>

 - I do respect Air Marshall Ray Funnell; I know him well. I have not specifically seen that comment to which the honourable member for Brisbane refers, but I have seen a number of other comments that he has made about our involvement in Iraq. He has been critical of the decision, as have others. It is part of the democratic tradition of this country that we debate these things, and he is contributing to the debate. I could draw the honourable gentleman's attention to remarks made by Dr David Wright-Neville, who is a lecturer in Monash University's Global Terrorism Research Unit. I think he was a former officer of the ONA. I think in fact that he commented very favourably on the character of Mr Andrew Wilkie, who in turn has been critical of the government. There is a mix of different views. The reason I refer to Dr Wright-Neville is that he said he did not think the war would really radically change the threat that we might face here at home. They were the comments that he made this morning. That is just another view.We have to react to assessments made by the people charged with responsibility at the time. The present head of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation is a person who I have great confidence in. He is a person who very closely served and advised the Hawke government. He is a person who enjoys the total confidence and respect of this government. I am certain that the advice he gives is conscientious. We have told you what that advice is. There will be an ongoing debate about the context of the operation so far as terrorism is concerned. I believe, and the government believes, that the action we have taken will over the medium to longer term reduce the likelihood of a massive terrorist attack on Australia. That is our view. Some agree with that and some do not. I respect the fact that Air Marshal Funnell does not agree with that; but others do. I think the advice we are getting from ASIO now is first class, and we will continue to follow it.</DOC>

 - Since hostilities began a few days ago, honourable members will know that Iraq have taken a number of prisoners of war. I understand that the number of prisoners of war they have taken is seven. All members of this House would, I am sure, have seen in the last day or so the deeply disturbing pictures of these prisoners of war being paraded in front of cameras and interviewed by Iraqi authorities. As a party to the third Geneva Convention of 1949, Iraq has strict obligations relating to the treatment of prisoners of war. Pursuant to its obligations under article 13 of that convention, Iraq is obliged at all times to protect prisoners of war against `insults and public curiosity'. Allowing these prisoners to be filmed while being interrogated is a clear violation of this obligation and is obviously deeply upsetting to their families and loved ones. This government strongly condemns this barbaric practice by the regime of Saddam Hussein. - Iraq is also obliged under the third Geneva Convention to treat prisoners of war humanely at all times and to protect them against acts of violence and intimidation. Iraq must not subject prisoners of war to physical mutilation or measures of reprisal. It will be no excuse for Iraqi soldiers to claim they were merely following orders. Individuals will be held accountable for their actions. Bearing in mind the emotions that have been stirred by the use of the photographs and interviews with the American prisoners in recent times, it is our view that it would be preferable for the Australian media to black out or to pixelate the faces of the prisoners of war rather than to fully show their faces. This is a practice used by the media on many -  - Many in the House will recall that in 1991 during the Gulf War the Iraqi regime mistreated American and British prisoners of war, and that mistreatment by the Iraqis was a clear violation of international law. These events of the last day or so are a brutal reminder of Saddam Hussein's violent dictatorship, which the coalition is now determined to end. In the situation that the Australian Defence Force has custody over Iraqi prisoners of war, it will not come as a surprise to this House to know that they will be treated humanely and in full compliance with the laws of armed conflict.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question, and I note he refers to the troops currently serving and our current veterans. The matters that he has raised were the subject of the Clarke review of veteran entitlements, which the government is considering at this moment. I can assure the member that the entitlements that are due to the current veterans - the TPIs and the war widows - are as a result of one of the best repatriation systems in the world: the one we offer here in Australia. As I said, the response to the Clarke review is still being considered by the government and we will be dealing with that in due course.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Cook for his question. One of the very important components - which I will focus on in answer to his question about the rebuilding of Iraq - will be to ensure that the humanitarian needs of the Iraqi people continue to be met. That is why one of the issues that we are addressing at the moment at the United Nations and also with our coalition allies is the need for a swift resumption of what is called the oil for food program. This is a program under Security Council resolutions where, in spite of sanctions, the Iraqis have been able to export some oil and, with the revenue from that oil, buy essential foods, medicines and other commodities.Since 1996, the oil for food program - this is quite an interesting and, in a way, rather disturbing statistic - has met the humanitarian needs of around 60 per cent of the Iraqi population, who depend on food rations from the oil for food program. With sanctions in place as a result of Saddam Hussein's defiance of the United Nations Security Council for many years, as the Prime Minister mentioned earlier, the program has been the only way of getting food and other essential supplies to the Iraqi people. The program is currently suspended and, importantly, the World Food Program estimates that food supplies for the most vulnerable in Iraq are unlikely to last much beyond May. So the oil for food program must be resumed, and it must be resumed as soon as possible.Honourable members will, I am sure, be aware that the Australian Wheat Board has been the major supplier of wheat under the oil for food program. We are working closely, as I mentioned, with our colleagues in the coalition as well as with other countries to secure the speedy resumption of the program as soon as circumstances on the ground permit. I note that the Secretary-General of the United Nations himself, Kofi Annan, has said that, under the current difficult circumstances, the oil for food program is the most practical way of ensuring that urgent humanitarian supplies do in the end reach the Iraqi people. Obviously, we agree with that. I would underline to members of the United Nations Security Council - and I mean all members of the Security Council - that they do bear a heavy burden of responsibility to ensure the oil for food program is resumed, and as soon as possible, in order to meet the essential needs of the Iraqi people. Australia urges the Security Council to act quickly and to resist the temptation to politicise this critical humanitarian endeavour. The oil for food program will be a crucial interim measure to support the population until the economy of Iraq recovers normality - which, of course, is a state it has not been in for many years now. The oil for food program is an essential first stepping stone.There will be many other ways in which we and the broader international community will help Iraq, but I did, in response to the honourable member for Cook's question, want particularly to focus on the oil for food program and the need to resume that program as soon as possible because, as I said, 60 per cent of Iraqis are dependent on it for essential food supplies. If food supplies, particularly for the more disadvantaged sectors of the Iraqi community, are only going to last until around May, which is the estimate of the World Food Program, then time is of the essence to renew the oil for food program resolution.</DOC>

 - The answer to the first part of the question is yes, I am aware of that. The answer to the second part of the question is that I cannot, without getting specific advice, answer for actions taken by the United States government in the United States. The answer to the third part of the question is that we have, in the manner outlined at some length by me, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Attorney-General, responded appropriately to all of the advice we have received about potential terrorist threats and the general terrorist environment not only in Australia but around the world, particularly since 11 September.Let me take the opportunity of saying again that no government - and certainly not this government - can guarantee that there will not be a terrorist attack in Australia. I have never endeavoured to do that, and I never would. What we can do is intelligently respond to advice that we receive and make certain that the travel warnings we give to Australians who travel overseas or who are in other parts of the world are sensible. I have particularly in mind the commonsense proposition that, if you generally warn everybody that it is dangerous to go anywhere, those sorts of alerts are next to useless. What you have to do is to try, on the basis of the information you have, to grade the travel alerts and so forth - as we have done, as the minister explained very patiently yesterday and again today. We are quite happy to go on explaining it with equal patience, because it is an important issue.But can I remind the shadow Attorney-General that different countries express these things differently. The experience of the United States has been different from the experience of Australia and we have to avoid underwarning our citizens. We also have to avoid alarming them. I can recall that over the past few months criticisms have been made about the warnings that have been given. I would just say again to the member for Barton that we have responded appropriately to the professional advice we have received. What the United States does is properly a matter for the United States administration. What Australia does is based on the information that we receive from our authorities.I would like to remind the House again that the reality is that, if any terrorist event occurs anywhere in the world, probably for the next few years, the perpetrators of that will endeavour in some way to link it to the action in Iraq, whether that is, in substance, correct or not. But that is the reality of it. I just repeat again: I am not guaranteeing - and I cannot - that there will not be some attack. I cannot do that. I wish I could, but I cannot and I will not even endeavour to do so. What I will do is keep the Australian public informed of intelligence that we receive that would warrant a change. There has been no such intelligence, but if it is received then of course that will be made known.</DOC>

 - I am aware of those allegations. I have received a preliminary report on them. I can assure members that the claims made in relation to lax security at Melbourne airport do not stand up, and the minor - and I think they are minor - transgressions at Sydney appear to be quite easily rectified. But those claims were made, I have to say, by a member of a union that I think is particularly concerned to extend the interests and the number of people who work for his particular union. I have to say that I do not believe that they were claims that stand up to any great scrutiny on the advice that I have had.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Pearce for her question. I take the opportunity again, as I did last week, to acknowledge her genuine and very sincere concern about the humanitarian situation in Iraq. She has spoken to me in the last 24 hours about the situation, specifically in Basra, and I am pleased that she has taken the opportunity to ask a question about it. Clearly, in the circumstances, it is difficult to get a very full picture of the situation in Basra but I can provide some information on both the humanitarian situation and the reports of political unrest.We are deeply concerned about the situation in Basra. A large proportion of the population is still without power and approximately 40 per cent of the population are believed to be without water. The shortage of clean water is increasing the risk of disease, especially for the most vulnerable in the population. The problems have been exacerbated by infrastructure and systems that were already run down under the regime of Saddam Hussein. An International Committee of the Red Cross team in Basra are repairing the city's power systems at this moment. This is critical to the re-establishment of clean water supplies. To date they have restored power to around 40 per cent of the system. The Red Cross technicians have also now reached the water plant north of Basra, which provides most of the city's water, in order to carry out essential repairs. We are hopeful that these efforts will enable clean water supplies to be restored to the entire population very soon. We cannot be sure of that but we hope that that will be possible.Honourable members will be pleased to hear that Australian Navy divers are helping to clear the southern port city of Umm Qasr to enable humanitarian supplies to be delivered there. I think we are all very proud of the work the Australians are doing. We are hopeful that the mine clearing will be done by tomorrow but of course that depends on the success of the operation not only in clearing the mines but also in ensuring that there is not any renewed military activity. If the clearance is completed very soon it will be possible to get ships back into Umm Qasr. I remind the House that we have 100,000 tonnes of Australian wheat in the gulf region, and that can be delivered very quickly to Umm Qasr in order to provide immediate food aid to the Iraqi people.On the reports of unrest in Basra, I would like to emphasise that the reports of an uprising are not fully confirmed, but it is apparent that forces loyal to Saddam Hussein's regime continue to hold some parts of the city of Basra. I do note media reports that these forces of the regime of Saddam Hussein are engaged in despicable acts, such as using civilians as human shields and shooting people if they try to leave the city. Reports that Iraqi troops turned mortar fire onto their own largely Shia population in an attempt to crush unrest are also deeply disturbing. - The opposition leader asks if they are confirmed reports, and I can say they are not formally confirmed. If reports of an uprising are accurate, this would be an indication of the deep distrust that many Iraqis have in the regime. The events in Basra are a warning of things to come: that Iraqi irregulars are likely to fight hard to protect their interests as military action moves closer to Baghdad, and that progress of military action will be influenced by the actions of these irregulars, who so often show no interest in or no concern for human rights and act in the despicable way that reports suggest they are acting in Basra.</DOC>

 - First, can I thank the honourable member for Hume for his question. Last night the new Israeli foreign minister, Silvan Shalom, rang me to discuss both the situation in Iraq and the situation in the Middle East. I can report that, not surprisingly, this was a very positive and a very friendly discussion between two countries that very much want to see the end of the barbaric regime of Saddam Hussein.By coincidence, today I also met with Ehud Barak, the former Prime Minister of Israel and now the leader of the opposition. The Prime Minister also met with him this afternoon. Ehud Barak was also Chief of the Israeli Defence Force and the Head of Israeli Intelligence. For those who are going to meet him I can assure you that, from my discussions with him this morning, he has a great deal of interesting information to impart on both the Middle East peace process and the situation in Iraq.In my discussions with Mr Shalom, I did take the opportunity to urge him to ensure that Israel did not become involved in the military action in Iraq. That, I think, is extremely important. It is a topic that I discussed with Mr Barak as well during the course of this morning. I had a very positive response from the Israeli foreign minister. I can imagine that only in the most extreme of circumstances would Israel consider becoming involved in this conflict in any direct way. I did assure the Israeli foreign minister that Australia, and the coalition more broadly, are well aware of the threat that Iraq's missiles pose to Israel and to other regional states. As part of the overall coalition effort to disarm Iraq of its weapons of mass destruction, very substantial efforts are being made to inhibit or neutralise Iraq's ability to attack regional countries, and that clearly does include Israel. It is, of course, well remembered that during the last Gulf War Israel was subjected to Iraqi acts of aggression. In 1991, Iraq fired 39 Scud missiles into Israel, many of which hit the heavily populated city of Tel Aviv, where, by the way, our embassy is based. In those circumstances, Israel did exercise remarkable restraint in not responding directly to the attacks. There were endeavours, of course, to shoot down the missiles with Patriot missile systems. Australia is also very mindful of the need to prevent actions Iraq might take to widen the current military action beyond its own borders - and I do not mean just in relation to Israel but also in relation to other countries, such as Kuwait.The Israeli foreign minister took the opportunity to express very warm thanks to the Australian government and the Australian people for the deployment of Australian troops as part of the coalition effort. He explained that this was something that was not only noted but also enormously appreciated in Israel. I urged Mr Shalom, during our discussions, to take advantage of the appointment of the new Palestinian Prime Minister, Abu Mazen, in order to enter into substantive discussions with the Palestinians. I expressed my sincere hope that the road map for peace of which President Bush spoke last week would be carried forward.I think that there is a real sense, in Israel as well as in the broader international community and amongst many Palestinian people, that the appointment of a Prime Minister in the Palestinian Authority, and particularly the appointment of Abu Mazen, offers a real opportunity for the peace process to be taken forward. I had quite some discussion with the Israeli foreign minister about that.In conclusion, it is the view of this government that the disarmament of Iraq and the demise of the regime of a brutal dictator like Saddam Hussein will bring enormous benefits to the Middle East and will be very widely welcomed. It will be welcomed in many of the Arab states, including many of the states which neighbour Iraq. Not surprisingly, it will also be welcomed in Israel, bearing in mind the threats and the confrontations there have been over the years between the regime of Saddam Hussein and the people of Israel.</DOC>

 - I would like to thank the member for her question. Last Friday, I think, I put out a notice that went to a lot of the TV networks encouraging them to show some restraint in the television footage that they broadcast, particularly during hours when children are watching. I also said in that statement - and maybe the Leader of the Opposition might choose to listen - that there are a number of avenues available, particularly for parents and those people who are concerned about the anxiety and fear that might be coming through to children. There are a number of services that they can access on the Internet. As well, there are a number of services they can access by telephone, like Kids Help Line.We did notice, particularly after September 11, the first indications of the distress that it might be causing children. We made an assessment and at times we spoke to a number of the service providers, as my office has done to date. If there is a meaningful request that comes through from an organisation, of course the government will look seriously at that. The coalition government and I, as Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, are very mindful of the distress that some of the imagery might cause both children and parents. A number of services are available, and we are always prepared to listen to the relevant organisations; if they have difficulties in meeting their requirements, of course they can contact my office.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Moore for his question. Next week I will be going to Washington to discuss the issue of Iraq with the United States government. Obviously, a substantial part of those discussions - but not all of those discussions - will be on the post-conflict arrangements. I expect that I will be seeing Secretary of State Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice, and I will also have discussions with the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund while I am in Washington.I also intend to visit New York before the end of next week to talk with the United Nations Secretary-General, and the secretariat more generally, about the post-Saddam Iraq situation. In terms of the United Nations, it will be very important for the United Nations to put behind it the rancour we saw in the lead-up to the military disarmament of Saddam Hussein. There is no question that the United Nations will need to be involved in post-conflict Iraq. It will certainly need to be involved at the humanitarian level. It will need to assist with transitional arrangements to ensure that broader transitional arrangements work, and it will need to be involved with the process of rebuilding Iraq including, very importantly, the mobilisation of international funding for Iraq. After all, Iraq will not just have suffered from military conflict but from sanctions which have been in place for more than a decade and from the simply abominable regime of President Saddam Hussein.We also believe that the United Nations should have a role in the administration of Iraq and that possibly there should be the appointment of somebody such as a special representative of the Secretary-General. There is, for example, one in East Timor at the moment. Although East Timor is an independent country, there is still present there a special representative of the Secretary-General. There is a variety of different ways that that position can operate. If a new Security Council resolution is required to achieve these things, then let me make the point that the Australian government believe it is enormously important that the Security Council not be politicised by some of the council members and that the Security Council ensure that it addresses -  -  - I would have thought it was obvious that the Security Council should address the difficult humanitarian situation in Iraq and there not be any political gameplaying on the Security Council. After hostilities cease, rehabilitating Iraq will be an enormous and pressing task, as I have mentioned. We will do all we can to support the Iraqi people's efforts to establish sound political and economic institutions based on the rule of law and democratic principles. We are focusing on assisting Iraqis to build the capacity to govern themselves. Assistance to governance will help to provide sound policies, stable institutions and the accountable systems that are a prerequisite for sustained growth and reduced poverty. We will also be assisting to create an environment conducive to private sector growth and investments in infrastructure and human capital.Our role does not end there. We will also continue to assist efforts to work with the United Nations, as well as the United Kingdom and the United States, in a number of other different ways. We have deployed officers from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and AusAID to participate in contingency planning for post-conflict Iraq with the United States Office for Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance. That office is based at the moment in Kuwait. Agricultural and economic experts will join the same office shortly. These experts will later be placed in Iraq itself to directly assist the Iraqi people in their reconstruction efforts.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for the question. I have communicated the government's view on a number of occasions to both President Bush and Mr Blair. Self-evidently, there will have to be an interim period, which will obviously involve a leadership role for the United States and the involvement of the United Kingdom - and obviously the Australian viewpoint, and that of others, would also be expressed in those arrangements. After that, I see a very clear role for the United Nations. That has always been our view in relation to the post-conflict arrangements.But let me make it clear that, in order for the United Nations to play an effective role in the post-conflict situation, it will need to display a greater degree of unity than it was able to muster in the pre-conflict stage. I want to say very emphatically on behalf of the Australian government that it remains our view that the United Nations failed to match the world's need in relation to Iraq and it was left to others to match the need of the world. I hope that the role of the United Nations will be constructive.Obviously, if you look at the history of events leading up to the military action, you will see all along a desire on the part of Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States - and indeed many others - to see the Security Council accept its responsibilities. The United States President and the British Prime Minister will be talking about the post-conflict arrangements, and I think they will also be talking about other arrangements. Our views have already been very fully communicated to them. I have every confidence that the foreign minister's visit to the United States next week is the right visit at the right time and at the right level to further put our view - and, of course, I will be in further touch with both the President and the Prime Minister; and if any further personal contact between us is necessary then that will take place. The Leader of the Opposition should understand that the idea that the United States, the United Kingdom and others, having done the heavy lifting in relation to this matter, should just walk away without seeking to legitimately put their point of view about the post-conflict arrangements is plainly unacceptable.</DOC>

 - Firstly, I thank the honourable member for Curtin for her question. I think all members of the House know how vigorous she has been in standing up for human rights in Zimbabwe. She is one member of this House, and there are others, who has been particularly active in that area. Honourable members, understandably I suppose, have been somewhat overwhelmed by all the coverage and discussion about Iraq. That is hardly surprising. But it is worth reminding the House that in recent days there has been an unprecedented level of police and army violence against opposition supporters in Zimbabwe. The repression that has taken place - and it can only be described as repression - follows a predominantly peaceful so-called `stay away' strike on 18 and 19 March, which was led by the opposition Movement for Democratic Change.The government is appalled at the unprovoked, violent repression and intimidation that has taken place. Just in the last few days, several hundred - possibly as many as 500 - opposition activists have been arrested. Many of those people have been beaten and some of them have even been tortured. Over 250 people have been hospitalised and one opposition member has apparently died. Children have been beaten and soldiers have been sexually assaulting women. Australian diplomats have witnessed first-hand the result of several vicious beatings by army personnel, including beatings with sticks wrapped in barbed wire. It is disturbing that this violence follows a speech which was made last Friday by President Mugabe in which he said he could be `a black Hitler tenfold'. That is a very worrying reflection of his ruthless approach to the way he deals with his opponents. This crackdown occurs amid serious allegations of rape and torture camps in Zimbabwe, with particular concern regarding Border Gezi youth camps set up to indoctrinate young Zimbabweans. Not surprisingly, we see no evidence whatsoever of improvement against the Marlborough House benchmarks which were laid down this year.In addition to an escalation in violent repression, the regime continues to encourage systematic harassment of the opposition, electoral malpractice and corrupted legal processes. It resists a transparent, equitable and sustainable land reform program. Let me just take the opportunity to remind the House, because the Zimbabwe government proffers an opposite view, that this government does not oppose land reform as such - this government understands the debates that exist in many countries around the world about land reform - but it does say that if land reform is to take place it should be in full accordance with the law, it should be equitable and the processes should be transparent, not corrupt.The government welcomes the announcement on 16 March by the Secretary-General of the Commonwealth, Don McKinnon, that Zimbabwe will remain suspended from the councils of the Commonwealth until the issue is addressed at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Abuja, Nigeria in December. I note the very positive role that has been played by our own Prime Minister as the chairman of the troika. The Commonwealth's continuation of the suspension of Zimbabwe does send a strong message to the Zimbabwe regime that lack of progress on restoring democratic principles and the rule of law will not be accepted. The government demands that the Mugabe regime ceases this campaign of repression and brings to justice those people who are responsible for it.</DOC>

 - I do not think the British government said it was a military target; I think the British government said it was a military objective. I understand what they are saying. In the case of Basra - and I have said a little bit about Basra during question time already - there is very substantial concern about the behaviour in particular of the Fedayeen Saddam militias. These are people who are using innocent civilians as human shields. We have stories now - and I said in response to an interjection from the Leader of the Opposition that we are waiting for final confirmation of this - that these are people who apparently, according to media reports, have been using mortars against civilians in Basra. If the British government were to turn around and say they will turn a blind eye to that, that would not be an act of humanity. - I would have to check the exact words they used. If the Leader of the Opposition is suggesting that the administration of Tony Blair is a flagrant human rights abuser and is determined to level civilian targets in Basra, let me say that that is utterly untrue. I will defend very strongly Tony Blair's absolute determination - Tony Blair has been very strong on this - to make sure that, as best as is humanly possible, civilians will be protected in Iraq. It is not fair to suggest, as the honourable member did in her question, that the Blair government is somehow turning Basra into a military target. - The implication of the way the question was put was that the Blair government would have no concern for civilian casualties. That is absolutely wrong. The Leader of the Opposition is right when he says, `That's not right.' It is not right; it is completely wrong. The Blair government has no intention of doing that at all. As for what I said last night on the Lateline program, yes, I absolutely stand by it 100 per cent. It is an important point, and I know all members of this House support that. We appreciate very much the enormous importance of doing our utmost to avoid civilian casualties. We know, the Americans know and the British know that that does make warfare a little more difficult than if you were to ignore the humanitarian requirements to protect civilian casualties. We also know that Saddam Hussein's regime has no interest in protecting civilians or avoiding civilian casualties. On the contrary, reports coming out of Iraq suggest that Saddam Hussein wants to maximise civilian casualties in order to win propaganda rounds, particularly in Western countries.There is no question of that, and I take a moment to say this: the Special Republican Guard, the Republican Guard and the Fedayeen Saddam ensure as best they possibly can that they are stationed next to civilian institutions such as schools and hospitals. They deliberately do that because they know two things: firstly, that the coalition takes a humanitarian approach to the way it conducts this military conflict and tries its best to avoid civilian casualties; and, secondly, that, if there are civilian casualties caused by the deliberate placement of their military assets, they will try to get a propaganda victory out of that. They will do their best to milk from anywhere they can a propaganda triumph for the world's most brutal regime. We will have no truck with that. In conclusion, I have no hesitation in defending the Blair government on this issue.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Page for his question. I recognise his support of the government's policies with regard to expanding our trade opportunities across the world. Everybody is well aware of the government's very ambitious trade agenda of competitive liberalisation in our pursuits of the multilateral agenda as far as the Doha round is concerned. Australia leads the way in that regard, as the chair of the Cairns Group. The Cairns Group has become the third force in WTO negotiations, along with the United States and the European Union. In parallel to that, in our agenda on bilateral trade negotiations, we have recently concluded our free trade agreement with Singapore. We had a very successful week in the first round of negotiations last week with the United States. I know the member for Page, who has sugar interests in his seat, would be keen to hear that that first round of negotiations went very well. Our negotiations with Thailand are proceeding better than expected, and we are in dialogue with Japan and China on trade and economic agreements with those major trading partners. - Since 1996, exports from Australia have risen from $99 billion to $151 billion last year. The Australian economy continues to grow strongly by comparison with the rest of the OECD. In 2002, we had growth of 3.5 per cent; in 2003, we had growth of 3.25 per cent; and, in 2004, there is a forecast for 3.75 per cent. Exports have been adding to that growth. The number of exporters in Australia is also increasing. In the 2001-02 year, 6,500 new exporters have joined the effort in delivering more benefits to the Australian economy from exporting out of Australia. In delivering today's trade statement - and I will table that shortly - we have outlined that the challenge for Australia as a nation for the future is to continue the domestic reform agenda -  - which has been so important to remain efficient and competitive in the international marketplace and which has delivered those statistics. The challenge also is to continue the momentum of our policy of competitive liberalisation to maintain pressure on the multilateral system and also achieve the benefits we are pursuing in the bilateral negotiations. We are proud of what Australian exporters have done in maintaining, in the face of softness in the global economy and global uncertainty, a much stronger Australian economy than most other countries in the OECD. I outlined that in today's trade statement, and I table that statement.</DOC>

 - I am generally aware, but I am not aware that Australia has been, as I understand happens with these appeals, approached as a member of the UN. Obviously, that approach will be considered when it is received. But I can remind the honourable member that Australia has already provided $17.5 million to the United Nations humanitarian appeal and the government, through its purchase of 100,000 tonnes of Australian wheat to support the provision of urgent food aid for the Iraqi people, will, I understand, be contributing a further $40 million to $60 million. I am not sure of the exact figure. I think it is impossible to know exactly what it is at the moment, because it depends a bit on what price is ultimately paid to the growers for the wheat. When you add those two amounts together, you are looking at Australia having already made a significant contribution. I would expect Australia to respond generously, as we always have in the past to these sorts of appeals. I hope that others will also respond generously. I would hope countries such as France and Germany, for example, that have paraded themselves as having a greater concern about the humanitarian aspects than others -  - although that is an assumption of moral superiority that I do not accept - would also give generously. I can assure the honourable gentleman that, as always, Australia will be very generous in the provision of its humanitarian assistance, in accordance with the humanitarian instincts of the Australian people.</DOC>

 - The response that one takes in relation to this issue is an evolving one. If you look at what happened in relation to Iraq at the time of the Gulf War, you will find that there was very little demand for humanitarian aid for refugees, because the number of people who left Iraq at that time was very low. The major movement out of Iraq of people who were later found to be refugees occurred in the context of the continued presence of Saddam Hussein and his regime. Large numbers of people left as a result of the reimposition of their horrific practices in both the north, in relation to the Kurds, and the south, in relation to the Shia. Shortly after Saddam was able to reassert that control, something in the order of two million people left Iraq. Many of them were able to return and resume their lives after the coalition enforced the no-fly zones in both the north and the south.Australia played a very positive role. Let me say I think the member for Lalor needs to better inform herself in relation to these matters. We have played an honourable role in resettling Iraqis over some 10 or so years, as initiated by governments of her persuasion and followed on by governments of this persuasion. Some 18,000 people were resettled under orderly refugee resettlement and humanitarian programs over that time. If you look at the way in which we dealt with people - and I actually have the statistics and am happy to make them available to the honourable member for Lalor - and at the assessment of Iraqi asylum seekers in Australia over a period of four or five years, you will find that 97 per cent were accepted and 80 per cent or more were accepted at the time of primary decision making. If you look at it in comparison with most other Western countries and their processing of Iraqi asylum seekers, you will see that that was at the end of the range. In relation to the present situation, there is no evidence at this time of a substantial need to assist people who have left Iraq to claim refugee status, but it is an evolving situation - as I said in the beginning - and a matter which we will keep under review.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Werriwa for his question. I know that he is very keen on a United States Coast Guard type of operation for Australia. However, the government has no intention of forming a United States Coast Guard facility. - Our focus has been on very practical measures, and we do believe that those practical measures are working. We are not forming any more new bureaucracies. Our Coastwatch works very closely with Defence and with Customs. We have provided in our white paper for spending of over $1 billion for the support of our national security. We believe that the spending measures we are putting in place are very much committed to the security of our nation. I might also remind the member for Werriwa that the second Tactical Assault Group and the Incident Response Regiment - and spending on these very important measures for the security of our nation was put in place by this government - are based very closely indeed on the member for Werriwa's -  - These are measures that the government have put in place because of our commitment to the security of this nation. We do not resile from that commitment, but we do not agree with the member for Werriwa that we need a United States type coast guard.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Gilmore for her question. I know she shares my view that the British government, led by Tony Blair, has been exceptional in the leadership that it has shown in the endeavour to disarm Iraq. I also would draw her and the House's attention to the fact that the British government is a government that is committed to humanitarian objectives. Earlier today, I was asked a question by the member for Throsby which suggested that the British had declared Basra as a military target and that, somehow, this had contradicted the otherwise stated objectives of the British government to demonstrate a humanitarian approach in trying to avoid civilian casualties. I said in my answer that I understood that the British government had talked of Basra being a military objective, and I have endeavoured to collect some quotes to see what the British had actually said. I note that Flight Lieutenant Peter Darling at CENTCOM had said - and I will give the whole quote because it is very important to this debate:We are now considering Basra as a military objective because of the humanitarian situation there and we need to go in as soon as possible to relieve that.I do not think this is an inhumane comment. He went on to say:We are very aware of our humanitarian considerations - and that he does not want to see any more mayhem there, and so on. I also quote Group Captain Al Lockwood, who is the main British spokesman. I quote him from the Washington Post article and the Sydney Morning Herald article that the Leader of the Opposition tabled. Both articles are taken from an identical source. I suppose he did not read them. They are both taken from a Reuters report. It is true: one of them is headed `British declare Basra military target', and the other is entitled `Battle may enter the streets of Basra: report'. But what does Group Captain Al Lockwood, the main British spokesman, actually say to Reuters? I would draw it to the attention of the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Throsby, whom he got to ask a question about this. I regard it, by the way, as quite a serious attack on the Blair government. Group Captain Lockwood said:This is not just a shift in strategy but a difficult high-risk operation.He went on to say:Basra we have surrounded. We are carefully assessing the level of resistance.Then he went on to say:When we have a clear plan - and this is in the article that was tabled - that will minimise risks to civilian infrastructure, the civilians themselves and of course our own troops, then we will execute it.Why would the honourable member for Throsby, on the instructions of the tactics committee, have asked a question juxtaposed with my comments last night? There can be only one explanation. I will defend the Blair government. I think Tony Blair and his ministers Geoff Hoon and Jack Straw and their commanders will do all they can - </DOC>

 - I do not think the Blair government is contradicting itself, and I quote from an AAP report of 26 March that might give a bit more information to the House, which might help the House in its consideration of the question of whether the Blair government is trying to avoid civilian casualties or not. The AAP report says that a British military spokesman had said that, in relation to the question of Basra being a military target - so this gets to the very heart of the honourable member's question:... only parts of the city, regime and military infrastructure were so designated.I think that is the answer to the question, from the British themselves: their targets are the regime and military infrastructure, not civilians.</DOC>

 - I have been aware of the remarks made by the Secretary-General of the United Nations - and they are understandable. The concern that he has for the safety of civilians in this conflict is understood and is very much in the minds of the governments of the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia. Of course, it is not in the mind of the government of Iraq. I have no doubt that the Secretary-General's comments were in part the consequence of the reported deaths of some 15 civilians in Baghdad - and I will have something to say about that and about the issue generally. On the information in my possession, I am satisfied that the incident was not the result of deliberate targeting of civilians by the United States or of an indiscriminate bombing policy. At this stage it is unclear as to whether it was caused by accidental United States action or action of the Iraqis. Any civilian casualty in war is tragic. I have to say that in this particular conflict unprecedented steps have been taken by the coalition to avoid civilian casualties.I say very directly through this parliament to the Secretary-General and to others who are legitimately concerned about civilian casualties: I contrast the policy of the United States government, the British government and the Australian government to the behaviour of the Iraqi regime. For example, Iraq is deliberately placing air defence and other military assets in close proximity to civilian sites in Baghdad. Saddam Hussein's forces have also used a hospital at An Nasiriyah as a headquarters for the storage of arms. There are other examples where deliberate action has been taken as an instrument of war and as an instrument of political propaganda to use civilians as shields and to deliberately play upon the very legitimate and genuine humanitarian concerns of civilian populations in democracies such as Australia. Given the intensity of the attacks that have taken place, civilian casualties so far, on our advice, have been remarkably low. I cannot give the Leader of the Opposition a precise figure, but all the advice available to us indicates that, because of the policy being followed by the United States and by the British, it is remarkably low.Some commentators have even suggested that the targeting policies of the allies in this conflict have been such as to put at greater risk the lives of defence personnel serving on behalf of the United States and the United Kingdom. That is not an assessment that I make and it is not an assessment that the government makes - it is an assessment made by many commentators.It is always unrealistic to imagine that you could have a conflict of this kind without some civilian casualties. But I repeat again that unprecedented steps have been taken by the Americans, the British and by us to keep those casualties to an absolute minimum - and that is in stark contrast to the deliberate policy of the Iraqi regime to put the lives of their own civilians at risk as a political instrument and as a psychological instrument against the forces that are aligned against them.Let me also say that it ought to be remembered by this House that if Iraq had complied with multiple Security Council resolutions, military action would not have been necessary. I think it is important to remind ourselves every day, as we respond in an episodic fashion to individual incidents, that the reason why the action has been taken is that Iraq failed to comply with multiple resolutions of the Security Council of the United Nations. That is something that I say not only to the Leader of the Opposition but to others who have been critical.It remains the case that the Australian government is adhering to all of its international legal obligations in relation to targeting policy and to the activities of our armed forces. It is a primary concern in all Australian Defence Force operations to protect civilians. The Australian Defence Force follows a rigorous process to minimise the risk to civilians and to buildings and infrastructure used for civilian purposes. Targets selected by Australian forces are analysed and approved through a comprehensive Australian approval process that includes ministerial oversight. Access to legal advice is an integral part of that process; legal officers have been placed in the theatre to advise our commanders and our troops of their legal obligations and to assist in determining the validity of targets.Those are some of the steps we are taking. Similar steps are being taken by the British and the Americans. Of course, no such steps are being taken by Saddam Hussein - no such steps are being taken by the Iraqis. I simply ask the Leader of the Opposition and, indeed, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, whose concern I share, to please examine the relative behaviour of the British and the Americans and the Iraqis. Any suggestion of moral equivalence between the coalition and the Iraqis on this occasion I totally reject.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Macquarie for his question and for his interest. As members of the House know from the answers I have given to previous questions on this matter, we are very focused, as a government, on the humanitarian situation of the Iraqi people. We welcome the call yesterday by the United Nations Secretary-General for unity in the Security Council and, in particular, for the quick resumption of the oil for food program. Our permanent representative to the United Nations, John Dauth, underlined this in a statement that he made to the Security Council during the course of this morning in what still is the open debate in the Security Council on the Iraq issue:We very much hoped that the members of the Security Council focus on what is at stake and provide the guidance the international community is waiting for on humanitarian needs and long-term reconstruction.On the specifics, members will be aware that our Navy divers are making Umm Qsar port safe to enable aid deliveries. Umm Qsar is the only deepwater port in Iraq. It is crucially important that this port remains open, and it is a great tribute to our Navy divers that they are making the port safe. We expect two ships carrying Australian wheat to berth at Umm Qsar possibly this weekend. We have sent an Australian aid expert to Kuwait to work with the World Food Program and the United States on the logistics for the distribution of the wheat. Some humanitarian supplies from Kuwait have now arrived in Iraq, and they will be distributed shortly. I also note that a British ship carrying food, medicine, blankets and water is expected to arrive in the next couple of days.We also remain more broadly concerned about the situation in Basra, although conditions there are improving compared with the report that I gave yesterday in answer to a question. The International Committee of the Red Cross has partially restarted Basra's main water pumping facility, and about 50 per cent of the population now have access to drinking water. Coalition forces have started to repair the water treatment plant near Basra. That plant provides water to Umm Qsar and will be operational from 30 March. The International Committee of the Red Cross is pre-positioning cholera kits in both Kuwait and Amman, and emergency kits are in place to serve 1½ million people in Iraq and 380,000 people in surrounding countries for a three-month period. Australian funding for immediate humanitarian relief will assist with these particular preparations.Displacement of people in Iraq, including refugees, has been very much less than was anticipated - at least up until this point. But, nevertheless, our contribution of $2 million to the International Committee of the Red Cross and $2 million to UNICEF and our contribution to the United Nations High Commission for Refugees will help assist refugees and those displaced should the need arise. Additional contributions to support planning, pre-positioning and delivery of urgent food, water and health care have been made by Australia - $6 million to the United Nations Central Emergency Revolving Fund; $2 million to the United Nations Office of the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs; $2 million, in total, to Australian non-government organisations such as the Red Cross; and $2 million towards the mobilisation of relevant and necessary Australian personnel. We will of course watch the situation closely. Nobody wants a humanitarian catastrophe in Iraq, and our efforts - and, of course, the efforts of others - to date are directed very much at ensuring that that does not happen.</DOC>

 - I have not seen those remarks. But, accepting the Leader of the Opposition's reporting of them on face value, they do not in any event represent a proposal; they represent a comment by the Secretary of State. Let me just again explain to the Leader of the Opposition what our position is, because this parliament is interested in the policy of the Australian government on this issue. Australia supports the earliest possible transfer of authority to the Iraqi people in the postwar period - that is point No. 1. As I made clear to the House yesterday, it is a matter of practical reality that there will be an interim period immediately following the conflict in which the US will play a leadership role in the administration of Iraq - and that is proper and natural.However, we see an effective and value adding role for the United Nations in post Saddam Iraq in order to support the early transfer of authority to a new, representative Iraqi government. The United Nations will also have an important role to play in the humanitarian field, but the United Nations will need to display a greater degree of unity and resolve than the Security Council did in relation to the enforcement of resolution 1441. Members of the coalition already acknowledged in the Azores statement of 16 March the need for an important UN role in whatever transitional arrangements are put in place. We welcome this statement.The foreign minister's visit to Washington and New York next week will provide a timely and valuable opportunity to make a number of practical proposals in relation to specific areas where the UN can add value and expertise. These will include the appointment of a UN special representative whose roles could include: liaising between UN agencies and the temporary coalition authority; assisting in the development of an interim Iraqi consultative forum and helping to coordinate subsequent political arrangements in Iraq; coordinating what will be a significant UN presence in Iraq; assisting the coalition with relief and reconstruction efforts, including fundraising and donor coordination; and assisting with the disarmament of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction capability. Australia will contribute in a practical way to assisting the Iraqis to build the capacity to govern themselves and to develop the sound policies, stable institutions and accountable systems that are a prerequisite for a viable and responsible Iraqi state.</DOC>

 - Can I thank the member for Herbert. I know how vigorously he represents his constituents up there in Townsville and, it being such an important defence base, they are very focused on the action now taking place in Iraq. The member for Herbert looks after them very well.There is a pattern of reports indicating that Iraqi soldiers and irregulars have been deliberately using civilians as cover in their fighting, and the Prime Minister alluded to that in answer to an earlier question. Coalition troops have seen Iraqi civilians being marched out in front of irregular formations while those formations are firing at coalition forces. There are reports that United States forces have treated several wounded Iraqi civilians, including a child, at a captured air base in southern Iraq. The civilians said they had been used as human shields by Iraqi forces.Iraqi soldiers have also been breaching the international laws of war. There are reports of Iraqi soldiers feigning surrender and then opening fire on coalition troops. Iraqi fighters are disguising themselves in civilian clothes. United States forces yesterday - and I thought this was particularly relevant - took control of the hospital at Nasiriya and found that it had been converted into a paramilitary headquarters and weapons storage area. This is a hospital. The marines in the hospital found 200 weapons and Iraqi military uniforms, and it was at this location that they also found 3,000 chemical protective suits and nerve agent antidote injectors. This is a frightening demonstration of the fact that Iraqi forces have been preparing for the use of chemical weapons, and it is something we are obviously deeply concerned about. - As the Prime Minister has pointed out, coalition forces are doing their very best to avoid civilian casualties. - In Basra, aircraft are using precision, satellite-guided bombs to target Baath Party headquarters and military formations. British artillery are confining their attacks to the city's outskirts, targeting tanks and clear military formations. British commandos are conducting raids into the city to capture Baath Party leaders, but the Iraqis are deliberately placing their forces close to hospitals and civilian, built-up areas. A British gunner said he had seen tanks refuelling near a hospital to avoid being fired on by coalition forces and people being used as unwilling human shields. I can state quite categorically that the coalition has a very deliberate process of targeting only military objectives and that civilians are never targeted. That is in stark contrast to the Iraqi regime, whose record of recklessness and wilful disregard for the safety of people remains as undiminished as ever. In conclusion, let me say I was quite struck by a report I saw from the United Press International news agency, which quoted an American pastor with the Assyrian Church of the East who went to Iraq as a human shield. He told UPI that his trip:... had shocked me back to reality.Mr Joseph went on to say that some of the Iraqis he interviewed said:... they would commit suicide if American bombing didn't start. They were willing to see their homes demolished to gain their freedom from Saddam's bloody tyranny. They convinced me that Saddam was a monster the likes of which the world had not seen since Stalin and Hitler.That is the view of one person, and obviously many members would disagree with him. But I do think that is quite a striking testimony coming from a man who went to Iraq with the intention of acting as a human shield.</DOC>

 - The full detail of the arrangements post conflict in Iraq have yet to be settled. They have been the subject of some discussion already between me and President Bush and the foreign minister and the Secretary of State. They will be the subject of discussion between the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the US administration when he is in the United States early next week. That is one of the major reasons, if not the major reason, for the foreign minister's visit to the United States, and I also expect that they will be the subject of other discussions that will take place in the not too distant future.</DOC>

 - First, can I thank the honourable member for her question and for the interest she clearly demonstrates in these issues, which reflects very much the concerns of her own constituents in the electorate of Farrer.An opposition member - How would you know? - How would I know? Because I have often visited that beautiful part of Australia, though I have not since the honourable member has held the seat. I look forward to coming there at some stage. - She has only been there for a year or so. Let me say that my visit to Washington and New York will obviously first and foremost be an opportunity to discuss the progress of the military attempt to disarm the regime of Saddam Hussein. Of course, I cannot anticipate what stage the disarmament process will be at by the time I arrive in Washington, which will be on Monday night, but there will be, naturally enough, discussions during my visit there about those military matters. But also, as the Prime Minister has explained in answer to two questions from the opposition, there will be a particular focus on the post-conflict reconstruction, rehabilitation and humanitarian assistance for Iraq. There are a number of different issues that we will be addressing there.First and foremost - and I think the House would hope that I would put this first and foremost - there will be humanitarian concerns. It has to be remembered that not only will Iraq have endured the conflict which is now taking place but it has endured many conflicts over the last 30 years, including the completely debilitating Iran-Iraq war in which approximately half a million Iraqis and approximately the same number of Iranians were killed. There has been interethnic conflict of the most brutal kind in Iraq -  - and this is also a regime which, in refusing to comply with Security Council resolutions, has had sanctions imposed on it. There is no doubt that those sanctions -  - have restricted economic growth in Iraq. With the lifting of those sanctions, it will be a real opportunity for the economy to move ahead. There will be two aspects to this. The first is the distribution of aid. We have made some early announcements on the humanitarian assistance we will provide for Iraq. We will have to look and see whether there is more that we can do or need to do and how other countries are coordinating. One of the principal points to make here, which the Prime Minister has alluded to, is that inevitably, on the humanitarian side, there will be a central role inter alia for United Nations institutions. I particularly refer to organisations like UNICEF and the support it provides to children and mothers, and I also refer to organisations like UNDP and the like, which have such a strong commitment to the development process.The second thing that will be a very important part of the discussions - and the Prime Minister has said a fair bit about this, so I will not repeat it all, because the honourable member will have heard his answer - is that there will certainly be detailed discussions about the administrative arrangements in post-conflict Iraq. One of the key points to make here is: let us think about the administrative arrangements that currently exist in Iraq. This is a country which has been subjected to a barbarous tyranny for many years, and that will have been overthrown. In its place will, no doubt, be a period at -  - the immediate conclusion of the conflict when the American military will be in control. One of the points the Americans have made - and I must say, I do very strongly subscribe to this view myself -  - is that the sooner that the Iraqi people themselves can take control of their own country, the better. I know on this side of the House -  - I would not have thought I was making a terribly controversial point. The point I was making was that we in this government - and it is obviously a view shared by the government of the United States of America - believe that the Iraqi people need to take control of their own country as quickly as possible and to do so in a democratic way. These are people who have been denied democracy for decades, who have been subjected to tyranny and who have been subjected to brutal human rights abuses. For many Iraqis, it comes back to that quote that I used earlier from the human shield. - This is actually a pretty important issue - what happens to Iraq after the war finishes. - All I can say in conclusion is that, at least on this side of the House, my colleagues in the coalition parties and, of course, in the government are very committed to ensuring that the people of Iraq have a free and prosperous future.</DOC>

 - I answered a question on this yesterday, and nothing has happened to in any way alter the answer that I gave yesterday. If anything did then I would inform the Australian people. In relation to the deployment which the Leader of the Opposition referred to and to his reference to the period of time that they have been deployed, I take the opportunity to point out that I am so very pleased, for their sake, that they were deployed so early, because it has enabled them to get ready and it has enabled them to make a more effective contribution. I believe it has contributed to their relative safety. So far from it being a mistake to have predeployed them, it was a positive contribution to their ultimate commitment and a positive contribution to their own safety.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Cook for the question. Protecting Australians from the threat posed by terrorism has been one of the government's highest priorities since 11 September 2001. The government have consistently taken a strong, decisive and balanced approach to strengthening Australia's counterterrorism capabilities. Our package of counterterrorism legislation, the bulk of which was passed last July, aims to ensure that Australia is in the best possible position to protect Australians against the threat of terrorism. These laws contain tough powers to deal with terrorists and those that support terrorist organisations. These powers include the ability to list organisations as terrorist organisations.Today I have gazetted a regulation listing Ansar al-Islam as a terrorist organisation under those counterterrorism laws. The regulation follows a decision by the United Nations Security Council on 24 February 2003 to identify Ansar al-Islam as a terrorist group and recommendations by the Attorney-General's Department and the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, which I received yesterday, that the organisation be listed under our counterterrorism laws. The regulation will take effect immediately.Ansar al-Islam is a Kurdish Sunni Islamic extremist group which follows the same fundamentalist interpretation of Islam as al-Qaeda, and it in fact forms part of the al-Qaeda network. Al-Qaeda has already been listed as a terrorist organisation by the United Nations Security Council and under Australia's counterterrorism legislation. Ansar al-Islam's members have trained in al-Qaeda facilities in Afghanistan, and al-Qaeda has provided financial assistance to Ansar al-Islam. Ansar al-Islam is based in north-eastern Iraq and is dedicated to assisting al-Qaeda in establishing an Islamic caliphate throughout the Islamic world. The organisation came to public attention in Australia last week when it was implicated in the tragic suicide bombing which killed Australian cameraman Paul Moran and injured another Australian journalist. Our intelligence agencies' assessment is that it is almost certain that Ansar al-Islam is responsible for Mr Moran's death. I extend my sympathy to Mr Moran's wife and family.Ansar al-Islam has been involved in a number of terrorist activities in Iraq, including the attempted murder of the Prime Minister of the Kurdistan regional government, Prime Minister Barham Salih, in April 2002 and a suicide bombing at a military checkpoint in northern Iraq in February 2003. Ansar al-Islam was involved in the assassination of General Shawkat Haji Mushir, a prominent Kurdish politician, in February this year, and has claimed involvement in killing dozens of Kurdish officials and soldiers since it became active. Innocent civilians have died or been injured in Ansar al-Islam's suicide bombings, ambushes and assassinations. Listing Ansar al-Islam as a terrorist organisation will serve to deter Australians from becoming involved in its activities. It will also strengthen Australia's ability to prosecute related offences under our counter-terrorism laws.Under Australian law, in order to list Ansar al-Islam as a terrorist organisation, the Attorney-General must first be satisfied that the organisation has been identified by the UN Security Council in a decision relating wholly or partly to terrorism or a mechanism under such a decision. The requirement to wait for a UN Security Council listing, which unfortunately prevents Australia from acting independently to list a terrorist organisation, was the result of opposition amendments to the government's counter-terrorism legislation. In addition to the requirement that the United Nations must first agree to list an organisation, the Attorney-General must also be satisfied that the organisation is engaged in, preparing, planning, assisting in or fostering the doing of a terrorist act. I am satisfied, on the advice I have received, that the conditions for listing Ansar al-Islam under Australian law have been met. This is another example of the strong and decisive action that government has taken to prevent further Australians and Australian interests from being injured by the evils of terrorism.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and note his understandable concern about this very important matter affecting a lot of Australians. As we get up for some weeks, we are entering a critical phase in terms of sowing rains for winter crops, pasture for winter and also water storage systems - particularly in the Murray-Darling Basin, which is where more than 50 per cent of Australia's food and fibre is produced. There has been some widespread and very welcome rain over the last month, but it cannot be said that the drought has broken; there are some worrying factors out there. In central Victoria, towns in the Goulburn Valley have gone onto the highest level of water restrictions, with all outdoor water use banned. The catchments there are certainly in desperate need of rain. In south-east Queensland, some centres, like Dalby, have had good rain - around 20 inches, I understand - but the heavy rains missed most of the sowing country, and through the south-western Darling Downs crops and pastures are barely holding on. Yesterday, the New South Wales state drought coordinator described the situation west of the divide as desperate, and pointed out that it is now a month since rain fell and that pastures have browned off or disappeared again. As he pointed out, if there is not more rain soon it will be too late for pasture growth and for sowing rain.In terms of the forecasts, they are mixed. The good news is - I make the comment, since there is little interest on the other side - that there are a large number of Australians who are very concerned indeed about the weather. It is a very real issue for them. The met office is indicating that El Nino appears to be moving to a neutral phase, and that is encouraging. While the regeneration cannot be ruled out, it is very unlikely. The seasonal rainfall outlook from the bureau's National Climate Centre shows that there is a 60 to 75 per cent chance of above median rainfall in the south-east corner of Queensland and much of the eastern part of New South Wales. The chances of good rain fall away quickly, however, as you look north and west in Queensland and south and west in New South Wales, while the outlook is, at this stage, very much hanging in the balance for the southern part of New South Wales and into Victoria.The level of Commonwealth drought assistance continues to increase - something like 75 per cent of the Australian agricultural land mass is now covered under the drought measures, including the December declaration, interim EC assistance and full EC declaration. There are 18 areas across Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia covered by either a prima facie or full EC declaration. Some 7,300 farmers have received help or are continuing to receive help on an ongoing basis. It is anticipated that current applications will provide some $900 million worth of assistance, but of course there is no substitute for good drought-breaking rain. We sincerely hope that happens over the next month.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Lalor for her question. Can I just say that the figures that I gave before to the House in relation to Iraqis suggest that some 86 people were assessed, amongst the some 5,000 or so who came to Australia without lawful authority, and were found not to be refugees. The reason that they were found not to be refugees was because they had other available protection. That was the reason in the main; I think there may have one or two that were rejected on character grounds. I looked at the figures for other countries in relation to assessing Iraqis and the interesting aspect was that many countries in Europe had rejected in excess of 50 per cent of Iraqi asylum seekers over a period of time. Of the 86, there remain, I think, 39 in detention in Australia. There have been a number of people, over a period of time, who have obtained travel documents voluntarily and left Australia to avail themselves of other protection available to them. - There are a number of countries: Iran, Syria and Jordan. Those people have gone to a number of those countries over a period of time. - I am aware of a family of six people, who applied for and obtained travel documents to leave Australia and to travel to New Zealand - I am sorry; Syria. -  - The documents that they obtained, which included a visa to enter Syria, enabled them to be removed from Australia. The fact is - excusing the mirth - that, while they travelled to Syria, I understand all six are now in New Zealand.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Kooyong for his question. I can inform him that, over the last seven budgets since the government was elected in 1996, Australia's net debt has been reduced by $60.7 billion. As a consequence of that, the Commonwealth debt to GDP stands at five per cent. That compares with an OECD average of 47.3 per cent. So Australia's Commonwealth debt to GDP is around one-tenth of the OECD average. The importance of sound budget management is to deal with the big structural questions that are confronting all advanced industrial societies, such as the ageing of the population.This government remains committed to addressing those areas that will challenge our finances with the ageing of the population - in particular, pharmaceuticals, health care, disability and welfare reform. In addition to that, Western countries, including Australia, are facing increased security challenges. One of the advantages of having Australia in a strong budget position is that we can meet the security challenges both for domestic security and for defence purposes, including for the brave men and women of Australia who are serving overseas in Iraq at the moment.Further, sound budget management allows the government to identify those areas of key national investment. We have made it clear that, in this coming budget, the first priority for the Australian government will be our servicemen and servicewomen in Iraq. The government will ensure that the troops are properly and adequately funded. We will make sure that Australia's financial resources, as well as other resources, are put behind those troops and that they enjoy the full support of the Australian government.There are a number of countries in the OECD that are currently running very large deficits. The average fiscal deficit for the OECD at the moment is 2.9 per cent of GDP. In the United States, with the president's latest financial plan, the Office of Management and Budget is forecasting a budget deficit of 3.5 per cent of GDP. In Australian terms, that would be equivalent to a budget deficit of $A25 billion. The fact that the Australian government is forecasting a slight surplus - the fact that we have been able to maintain that position whilst investing in security - indicates some of the strengths of budget management in Australia of recent years, which is something that this government has made a priority and will continue to make a priority in the forthcoming budget in May.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Kalgoorlie. Let me say how pleased I am that he has expressed concern about the Australians still in Iraq. Every time I am asked this question, I have to confess to coming back here with a slightly different figure as we get further information on Australians in Iraq. Apparently now, to the best of my department's knowledge, there are 31 Australians in Iraq. Sixteen of them are in Baghdad, nine in northern Iraq and six in southern Iraq. This obviously excludes the military personnel.Of the 31, there are 21 media representatives - six in Baghdad, nine in the north and six in the south - and there are, we believe, now six human shields and four long-term residents. We are also endeavouring to stay in contact with the Australian human shields. Interestingly enough, representatives from my department were able, late yesterday, to speak directly by telephone to one of the human shields in Baghdad, who confirmed she was well and that she had been in regular contact with her family. As far as we are aware, all the other Australian human shields are safe and well.Let me remind the House that since October 2001 my department has advised Australians not to travel to Iraq and, if in Iraq, to leave. Last night - that is, 26 March - the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade further reviewed its travel advice for Iraq to include new and credible information that pro-Saddam groups may be preparing to engage in direct violence targeting Westerners in northern Iraq, including media representatives. This warning is particularly directed towards media representatives in northern Iraq. The department has relayed this information to as many Australians or Australian employers as they have been able to contact and who we know about in northern Iraq. Let me repeat what we have said on so many occasions: we urge all Australians to leave Iraq immediately if they are able to do so. Given that Baghdad airport is obviously closed and commercial air services have clearly ceased, our advice to Australians remaining in Iraq is to depart overland or, if they are unable to do that, to stay well away from any strategic locations.Finally, I emphasise that our ability to provide consular assistance to Australians in trouble in Iraq is, rather obviously, extremely limited. The tragic death of Paul Moran, of whom the Attorney spoke a little earlier, simply underlines the extraordinary dangers that Australians face. In that particular case, I can inform the House that, in spite of the extremely difficult circumstances, through the concerted efforts of our embassies in Tehran, Ankara and Amman, Mr Moran's remains are expected to be returned to Australia in the next few days.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. Yes, there has been an announcement by the United States, but I think you will find that it is 200,000 tonnes that have actually been committed; it will be 600,000 tonnes if required. We have also made a commitment on behalf of Australia as far as humanitarian aid is concerned, as have a number of other developed countries across the world who are prepared to shoulder their responsibilities as far as the humanitarian issues and getting much-needed food into Iraq are concerned. Of course, I always agree with my ministerial colleagues, because what we say is that Australia, as an exporter of quality product, has always maintained the dominant presence in the marketplace as far as our export of wheat is concerned. As far as Iraq is concerned, we have for the last 10 or 11 years participated in the oil for food program through the United Nations. An outstanding contract of about 1.2 million tonnes still exists in that program even though the program has currently been suspended, but certainly we will continue to represent the interests of Australian exporters and Australian producers. As far as that is concerned, we have maintained a close dialogue with the United States, the United Kingdom and the United Nations on this issue. The foreign minister, as was indicated earlier in question time, will be in Washington and New York next week to talk about these issues amongst other things. I can assure the House that we will be actively representing the interests of Australian exporters in this regard. We have been a supplier of commodities to Iraq for over 50 years and certainly for the last 10 years while sanctions have been applied in Iraq through the UN oil for food program. As soon as that is resumed, we would expect those contracts to be honoured.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Fadden for his question. I notice that there have been some questions to me that have endeavoured to diminish the view of Australia in terms of its humanitarian response, particularly the situation in relation to Iraq. There was a question to me yesterday that asked about the level of support to the UNHCR, and I took the opportunity of outlining then the nature of Australia's contribution. Let me just say that, in relation to our financial contribution, Australia has contributed something of the order of $15.3 million to the UNHCR for the year 2003, and that is not a reduction. - If the member for Lalor had wanted answers to those questions she would have addressed them to the minister responsible, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, yesterday. She did not even know which minister they should be addressed to. I am familiar with the issue. The decision that was announced in the budget was that the core funding would be halved -  - and the money that was taken from the core contribution would be doubled by way of a contribution that the UNHCR and other organisations could bid for. As a result of that bidding, the UNHCR has more money than it would have received if we had provided its core funding on the same basis as last year. So it did better. But that is not a question that should have come to me; it is a question that, if you had any knowledge about where the responsibilities lie, should have gone to the Minister for Foreign Affairs.I did wish to speak about Australia's response to a humanitarian need, because something of the order of 600,000 people have been resettled by Australia as refugees and humanitarian entrants over the last 50 years. The UNHCR estimates that, since the Gulf War in 1991, some 70,000 Iraqi refugees have been resettled from countries of first asylum. Only nine countries have contributed significantly to that resettlement: Australia, the United States, Canada, Sweden, the Netherlands, Denmark, New Zealand, Norway and Finland. Of course, those are people who are judged to be refugees, who cannot go back and who are unsafe or unable to stay where they are. We have been consistently a major contributor to that resettlement effort. As a measure of that, I thought members ought to be aware that over that time frame, when other countries, along with us, have taken 70,000 refugees, Australia's contribution was 18,000 of the 70,000 resettled through the refugee and special humanitarian programs. We have continued to do that. This year we are taking something in the order of 1,600 people who already have visas. That is a measure of our continuing willingness to address that issue. Of course, we do recognise that other countries have shouldered a burden, particularly those in the region. It is for that reason that we have contributed not only to the core budget and the special programs of the UNHCR but also through my own department with an extra $20.8 million over four years to assist displaced Afghans and Iraqis. It was in that context that we have released some $10 million from that fund already, and we have $11 million available over the next two years to continue to support programs in relation to Afghan and Iraqi refugees.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. Today I had great pleasure in announcing the second tranche of our tendering process for Job Network 3 which will commence from 1 July this year as part of the government's active participation model. This is an improved Job Network, which builds on the success that has been gained over the first two contract periods. Over the last two years there has been a 20 per cent year-on-year improvement in the outcomes for long-term unemployed - those people unemployed longer than 12 months. This is a great reflection on the many quality organisations that have been delivering the government's employment services. These are companies like the Salvation Army Employment Plus, Mission Australia, Centacare, Work Directions and Sarina Russo Job Access to name but a few.This new system will inject $900 million a year into the Job Network. It will mean that we will be delivering a very personalised, individualised service which will meet the needs of Australia's unemployed and also the business community. It builds on the success of Job Network by having a service guarantee to the unemployed and by having a job seeker account to buy individual interventions that will work. It means that, for those people who wish to work, this system will have a lot more activity and participation. Can I say to those few unemployed people in the nation who think it is their right to do the wrong thing and not to actively seek work that this system will also address their needs by making sure that they are actively participating in employment services and doing everything in their capacity to gain work. It is a system that everybody in this chamber should be proud of. It is a system that has been recognised around the world as a world leader. I commend all members of the Job Network who have been successful in delivering a quality service to the Australian unemployed and the Australian business community.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Solomon for his question. Can I say, on behalf of all Australians, how incredibly proud we are of the performance of our defence forces in Iraq. The decision of the government to commit our forces to Iraq was just, it was legal, it was right and it led to the liberation of the people of Iraq. I will have the opportunity tomorrow to expand, at somewhat greater length, on the operation in Iraq, the circumstances that led up to it and the contribution so magnificently made by the men and women of the Australian Defence Force.I am sure that all Australians derive the greatest sense of relief and satisfaction, above all other considerations, from the fact that our forces thankfully to date have not sustained any casualties. I might add in relation to that that on many occasions, and not least during my recent visit to Doha, I have been told by senior members of the military that one of the major reasons why we did not sustain any casualties was that we predeployed our forces. I said at the time we predeployed our forces that they were being predeployed in order to acclimatise themselves and to be ready in the event of a commitment - to be more prepared and more acclimatised. -  - I shall ignore the gibbering interjections of those opposite, whose dire predictions of a humanitarian disaster in Iraq have been proved wrong - whose dire predictions on just about every count have been proved wrong in relation to this. The role that Australia has played has brought great credit to, and an enhanced reputation for, this nation around the world. The member for Solomon asked me a question about the force elements. I thought those opposite might be interested to know when our forces are coming home. I know they did not want them to go but I thought they might be interested to know when they are coming home. Apparently they are not. But I know the member for Solomon is interested, I know the member for Lindsay is interested, I know my colleague the Minister for Veterans' Affairs is interested, I know the member for Riverina is interested and I know members representing electorates in Western Australia are interested. Indeed, all Australians are interested. They are not only interested; they are going to join, and they are going to have the opportunity of joining, in welcoming our forces home.To start with, let me inform the House that the following elements of our coalition contribution will be returning before the end of May: the Special Forces Task Group, including SAS personnel; the Navy clearance diving team; the FA18 crews and support personnel; HMAS Anzac; and HMAS Darwin. These forces will be followed by HMAS Kanimbla, which should arrive back in Australia in July. I will have the pleasure, with other colleagues, of welcoming some of the troops home in the next week, commencing with the RAAF personnel at Tindal on Thursday as well as troops aboard the HMAS Darwin and the HMAS Anzac and the SAS personnel in Western Australia. I will ensure that the member for Brand is also invited to the welcome home in Western Australia. I say that because the member for Brand has a longstanding interest in these matters. I acknowledge that, and I am very happy to ensure that he is included because he has an interest in the matter.  - No, I am not suggesting that nobody else does. I think a lot of people in this parliament have an interest in defence matters but I know that the member for Brand has a greater interest in, and knowledge of, those matters than some other people on the other side who I can think of. I will have the pleasure of welcoming the defence personnel home, and I repeat that all of those deployed to the Middle East deserve our praise and thanks for their professionalism, their superb representation of Australia and its values, and a job extremely well done.We have no plans to provide a substantial peacekeeping force in Iraq. That was made clear by me to President Bush and to the Prime Minister of Great Britain at the very beginning and it was reiterated during my discussions with the United States President and members of his administration recently in the United States. Our position was well understood. From the very beginning, if we were going to make a contribution it was going to be at the sharp end of the conflict - which we did. We did that to very great effect and to the great regard and admiration of people around the world. Admiral Kelly of the United States Navy said to President Bush that our troops are the best in the world, and I respectfully concur with American Admiral Kelly.I can say to the House that there will be great opportunities for Australians to welcome them home. I could report to the House also that some ADF elements, including HMAS Sydney, two C130 Hercules transport aircraft and some headquarters and support personnel, are already contributing to important transitional and humanitarian operations. Two P3C Orion aircraft are also engaged in maritime patrols in support of ongoing coalition operations, as well as remaining engaged in the war against terrorism. ADF and other defence personnel already contributing to Iraq's rehabilitation include liaison officers in the Office of Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance, a small group of specialists - about 16 - contributing to the hunt for weapons of mass destruction, a military air traffic control group of about 60 personnel helping to run Baghdad International Airport, and a liaison officer and security detachment of around 75 personnel supporting the re-establishment of our diplomatic mission in Iraq. It is not possible at this time to say how long these defence elements, which comprise about 1,200 personnel, will remain in Iraq, as this will largely be determined by the situation on the ground.Let me conclude the answer by saying again that the government's decision to commit our forces to Iraq to be part of the coalition was the right decision. It was a decision in the long-term national interests of Australia, it was properly based in international law and it led to the liberation of an oppressed people. It has made, in my view, a very significant contribution to the long-term stability of the Middle East. It has in part, I believe, brought about a renewed effort by the United States administration to achieve a lasting peace settlement between Israel and the Palestinians.I say to those who sit opposite and remain critical of the decision the government took: just as many of you disbelieved the determination of the United States President to lead a coalition against Saddam Hussein and were proved wrong, you will be proved wrong if you disbelieve the determination of the world community, led by the United States, to try and achieve a lasting settlement between Israel and the Palestinians. It is something to which this government is strongly committed, it is something to which I referred in the address I made in this House on 4 February regarding Iraq and it is something that I know, on the basis of the discussions I have had with him, that the United States President is determined to bend all of his energies over the years ahead to achieving. I think one of the reasons why that has arisen is the successful commitment of the coalition in Iraq - a commitment of which this government is proud and a commitment of which this entire nation should also be proud. </DOC>

 - The only thing that I would add in answer to the Leader of the Opposition to what I have said earlier is that, if he is going to quote from the board of inquiry - which he has done - he should also quote the paragraphs of the finding. Let me say that this is a private inquiry. It is up to Dr Hollingworth to deal in his own defence with the way in which he was treated by the inquiry but there are different views on this matter. I have been provided with a legal opinion - it was not one I sought but one that has been provided to the Governor-General - which expresses the view in a fairly cogent manner that he was denied natural justice by the inquiry.We have to keep a sense of perspective about this. We are dealing with people's reputations, and the person whose reputation is being dealt with today is not here. He is not in a position to defend himself. It is all very well for the letter of the law in relation to the standing orders to be observed but when you have people interjecting remarks which impute behaviour and relate it to child sex abuse it would be easy to come to an unfair conclusion if you were a passive listener to the debate.I remind the Leader of the Opposition that in relation to the statutory declaration, this is what the report said:Dr Hollingworth has made a statutory declaration that he believed at the relevant time the abuse was an isolated occurrence, and whilst the Board does not doubt he genuinely believes this to be so ...It would have been a good idea for you to read that out too. - No, I do not think you did read that out. Mr Speaker, I do not think the Leader of the Opposition did read that out.  - He now agrees that he did not read that out. You are talking about others selectively quoting things. If you are going to the veracity of the statutory declaration, this is a relevant paragraph. It goes on to say:Dr Hollingworth's decision, whilst made in good faith, and in consultation, and without demur of the bishops whom he consulted, and in the belief that precautionary conditions imposed minimised the risk of recurrence, was untenable. Thus the Board finds that this complaint was not handled fairly, reasonably and appropriately.I have read out the whole paragraph and not just part of it. I simply make the point that, as to the substance of these matters, I am not in a position to make a judgment without having had the benefit of interviewing all the people concerned and I am not going to set myself up as an independent arbiter. I just make the point that a suggestion that in some way the board found that he had falsely declared is not justified by the board's findings. It is, therefore, untrue and should not be the subject of the Leader of the Opposition's questions.</DOC>

 - First, I thank the honourable member for Flinders for his question and recognise the very great interest he shows in these issues. I recognise his support and indeed the support that all members on this side of the House gave to the coalition of the willing in its endeavour to disarm the Iraqi regime and to liberate the people of Iraq. It is early days but I think it is possible to draw some conclusions about the likely impact of the extraordinarily successful campaign in Iraq. The military campaign, first and foremost, has removed a deadly threat, a key supporter of terrorism and a proliferator of weapons of mass destruction. The conflict underlined how seriously the United States and its allies treat the twin threats to international security posed by the spread of weapons of mass destruction and terrorism. This is a fundamentally important question. Countries pursuing weapons of mass destruction or lending support to terrorists now have a much clearer illustration of the United States and its allies' determination to act and the possible consequences of dangerous pursuits. The United States has rightly shown a determination to press for outcomes which will, in the end, preserve our common peace and security. That is not to say that the United States will deal with the different manifestations of these threats in the same manner as it has dealt with them in the case of Iraq - and it is important to understand that and not to draw false conclusions - but the United States is determined to use its weight to achieve a positive outcome in difficult circumstances.As the Prime Minister mentioned earlier, and as the member for Flinders also suggested in his question, the United States is now putting a great deal of emphasis and weight into endeavouring to resolve the longstanding Israeli-Palestinian conflict. It is doing this through a sustained diplomatic effort. The United States does that with the full support, I know, of so many people around the world, including in this country, and with the support of our government.The United States is capitalising on the new realities created by the successful military campaign in Iraq to address threats to security. For example - and these are very important points - in the aftermath of the campaign in Iraq, Syria has shown a new responsiveness to the concerns of countries like ours, the United States, of course, and others regarding terrorism and weapons of mass destruction. It is interesting that Syria also, after a certain degree of hesitation, has decided not to give sanctuary to Iraqi regime figures trying to flee from the coalition in Iraq. Iran has also assured us of its determination to play a constructive role in post-conflict Iraq, and there are indications of renewed discussions within Iran of finding common ground with the United States.With the removal of the threat of Saddam Hussein, the United States has also been able dramatically to wind back its military presence in Saudi Arabia. I think the tragic bombings that took place this morning - possibly carried out by al-Qaeda or a related organisation - illustrate the importance of the United States and Saudi Arabia working together to defeat terrorism, because in that area there is still a good deal of work to be done. I note with great interest the recent comments of the foreign minister of Qatar, indicating that his country is considering a peace treaty with Israel.So the campaign in Iraq has begun a process of dramatic change in the Middle East. Recent actions by regional states and key powers have demonstrated a renewed willingness to work towards positive outcomes in the region. I will be visiting Iraq and a number of other countries in the region between 21 and 26 May, and it will be an opportunity for us to very directly have an input into what we think are desirable outcomes in the Middle East. But I do not think you can dismiss lightly the very substantial argument that what has happened in Iraq has sent a resounding message, not just through the Middle East but around the world, and has generated a much more positive atmosphere in the Middle East, which I think can help lead to the resolution of that terrible and long-running Israeli-Palestinian conflict. </DOC>

 - It is true that the board of inquiry contained those findings. It is also true that that finding did not have the status of a judicial finding. It is also true that other lawyers have a view that the process that led up to the finding denied the Governor-General natural justice. That is a statement of fact. I cannot disagree with the Leader of the Opposition that the board had that finding. But, in the absence of it being a tribunal of law, which it is not, it does not automatically follow that that finding is good for all purposes. It is the view of the people who constituted that board. The question of whether other views will be adduced in relation to that matter is something for Dr Hollingworth and not for me. So I cannot and will not dispute what is in the document. That is their finding. It is not a conclusion that is accepted by Dr Hollingworth. Legal advice he has obtained throws doubt over the procedural aspects of the inquiry and suggests he was denied natural justice. I am not saying that is true either. I am in no position to do so. I am not setting myself up as a court. I am simply pointing out that a private inquiry, having reached that conclusion, does not have the same force as some kind of process that would have a different and more definitive authority.</DOC>

 - First of all, I thank the honourable member for Curtin for her question. I appreciate the genuine interest, including the intellectual interest, that she shows in this particular issue. -  - Australia, as the interjectors know only too well, joined the coalition to rid Iraq once and for all of its weapons of mass destruction capabilities, which the last 12 years unfortunately have demonstrated could not be achieved through diplomacy alone. We regret that but, on the other hand, the alternative of doing nothing was a worse alternative. The government and its agencies remain as confident as we have ever been that evidence will be found of Saddam's programs. Of course it will take time, but good leads are coming forth. I thought the House -  - There are some very interesting interjections from the opposition. I only wish that people, particularly when they watch question time on television, could always hear the interjections because they are very revealing. Already we have seen evidence of what appear to be mobile biological laboratories, at two sites in Iraq, capable of producing biological materials for use in weapons of mass destruction. I know that it is disappointing to the opposition to hear this, but I am afraid this is true. In one case, technical experts from the United States and the United Kingdom have concluded that the unit does not appear to perform any function beyond what a defector said it was for, which was the production of biological agents. In this respect, this mobile equipment seems to bear out earlier claims by defectors - mentioned, by the way, by Secretary of State Colin Powell in his presentation to the Security Council on 5 February. Honourable members may recall that occasion. The coalition has in place a major search and investigation effort to which Australia is contributing 17 specialists. The Pentagon is currently restructuring its arrangements for weapons of mass destruction searches. There has been a suggestion, I think, in a media report that for some reason the Americans are withdrawing altogether from the search. That is of course not true; the Americans are, on the contrary, putting a very major effort into investigating the evidence. They will continue the examination of over 1,000 sites, including some 600 that relate to weapons which were identified prior to the conflict; another 400 sites have been identified as a result of tips and other leads; and less than 150 sites so far have been inspected. Just that information gives the House a sense of the dimensions of the task.A very significant component of all of this is the interviews that are taking place, and will in future take place, with scientists and others who have been involved in weapons of mass destruction programs. There is also extensive examination of documents and checking of computers for information relating to these programs, and this sort of detail is fundamentally important. There is no doubt that, in particular, the capacity to interview key scientists - such as Dr Taha, who was nicknamed Dr Germ, and Dr Ammash, who was known as Mrs Anthrax - recently detained by the coalition will be potentially very important.Let me also say, in answer to the honourable member's question, that we know only too well that Saddam Hussein's regime endeavoured to obfuscate and to hide from the United Nations weapons inspectors; and they worked very hard at hiding these materials from the United Nations weapons inspectors. Therefore, in order to continue the process of unravelling Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction, obviously it will take a good deal of time. It will require continued and extensive interviews with scientists and other officials who will be able to provide more information in relation to those materials that have been hidden.Let us make no mistake about this. The revelation already of the mobile biological laboratories is an enormously important development. I do not think, if I recall the debates on this issue some weeks ago, there are many people on the other side of the House who have ever doubted Saddam Hussein's possession of weapons of mass destruction. As time goes on, that possession of weapons of mass destruction becomes increasingly apparent.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition and I would refer him to the very detailed statement I made on Sunday. I met the Governor-General in Sydney on Sunday. I made a very detailed statement and perhaps I should remind the Leader of the Opposition of three things that came out of it. Firstly, I said that the Governor-General would stand aside pending resolution of certain proceedings of which he is aware. Secondly and importantly, I said that, until that matter had been resolved, the Governor-General could not properly direct himself to the question of his longer-term tenure of the office. I also said that, in considering his longer-term position, he had indicated to me that the protection and the dignity of the office would be his prime consideration. Against that background I do not intend to add anything, except to pick up the point that has been made about child sex abuse, which is something that ought to be of concern to all of us, and take the opportunity - I hope it is not out of order, Mr Speaker - to comment upon calls that have been made in relation to having inquiries into child sex abuse throughout the Australian community. Of all the things I have read about this in recent days, none has caught my eye more than some comments from Liz Mullinar, who is the founder of the group Advocates for Survivors of Child Abuse. This is what she had to say:We are not calling for a royal commission because a royal commission is just more money spent. We know the problem. We want more money spent now on solutions, we want more money spent on healing the victims of abuse, we want more money spent on setting up services and we want more money spent so that any child or adult who reveals their abuse in the future gets appropriate counselling.The most successful Labor leader in Australia - I think successful Labor leaders should from time to time be taken notice of - is the New South Wales Premier. The New South Wales Premier has expressed his very strong opposition to the holding of a royal commission. Some people suggest it is because he might be embarrassed at its findings in relation to his department.  -  - Apparently it is all right for the Labor Party to traduce other people's reputations but, as soon as you say anything critical about the child protection practices of state governments, you are apparently playing dirty pool. That is apparently the double standard of the Labor Party on this issue.  - I think there has been a bit of latitude given to everybody -  - In our view, calls for a royal commission on child abuse are more about political posturing than about efforts to increase our understanding of the problem and deal with it effectively. There have been a number of inquiries and reports in recent years on this issue, and they have developed a widespread understanding in the community of the causes of this problem and the challenges it poses for governments. For example, there was the recent Gordon inquiry in Western Australia, which looked at allegations of endemic abuse of Aboriginal children in Perth; the Fitzgerald report on communities in Cape York; the Wood royal commission in New South Wales; and also the Forde inquiry in Queensland. The unpalatable truth is that the majority of perpetrators of child abuse are people who are found within the domestic or family environment - be they family members, friends or neighbours. According to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, natural parents are, sadly, the main perpetrators of child abuse in 56 per cent of cases in New South Wales, 84 per cent of cases in Queensland, 69 per cent in Western Australia, 81 per cent in South Australia, 49 per cent in Tasmania and 80 per cent in the ACT.  Unfortunately, some commentators choose to use proposals for further child abuse inquiries as a vehicle for making some kind of political point against an individual or an institution. The challenge for governments is to identify children at risk of abuse in their families or communities and to deal with this risk through policies of early intervention and prevention in the early childhood years. - Could I say to those in the opposition who interject on this point that the advantages of early intervention policies, particularly but not only in relation to child abuse, have been identified by this government. Some three years ago we announced the Stronger Families and Communities policy, which is in the process now of providing resources which are in part directed towards curing that problem. Could I say to those, including the Premier of Queensland, who are calling for a royal commission: I would rather spend the $60 million to $100 million that would be involved in a royal commission on further early intervention policies than on lining the pockets of the lawyers who would be called before the inquiry. We have already made a major investment in early intervention and prevention through the Stronger Families and Communities Strategy that I announced just over three years ago. Under this strategy, funds have already been provided to help many community groups right around Australia in their important work to build better family relationships, to develop better parenting skills and to prevent domestic violence.I conclude my answer by quoting from the maiden speech of the member for Sydney, who I understand has some professional experience in this field. This is what she had to say:We need to ensure that every Australian child is safe in his or her home. We need to teach protective behaviours to children as part of a whole program of self-esteem and confidence building that makes children aware that behaviour that makes them feel uncomfortable need not be tolerated. We need to strengthen families before abuse starts.I think that is quite an eloquent plea for more effective early intervention policies, and I think there is a responsibility on the part of all governments. I make the point that the principal government institutions that have the care of children as their charge are state institutions. I do not say that to in any way exculpate the Commonwealth government from responsibility; but, in the end, it is state welfare organisations - state family and welfare departments - that have the responsibility. Whilst I understand fully the interest and the desire of the opposition to pursue certain aspects of this matter, in the end, if governments - be they Commonwealth or state - have additional resources to put in the direction of matters relating to child abuse, I think it is a far better disposition of that money to accept that we know a lot of the problem already; it is a question of devising better solutions, it is a question of providing resources to implement those solutions rather than spending a whole lot of extra money - I say with no disrespect to my former profession - lining the pockets of lawyers at an expensive royal commission that would essentially go over ground that has already been heavily ploughed. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Wentworth for his question. I am pleased to inform the House that the Australian Federal Police are continuing their strong and successful cooperative relationship with the Indonesian National Police in investigating the Bali bombings. Indeed, the commitment of both countries to tracking down and prosecuting those responsible for the devastating bomb attacks in Bali last October has already delivered significant and tangible results. There are currently 29 people in custody in Indonesia awaiting prosecution relating to the Bali bombings. Four other people are also in custody, with inquiries being undertaken to determine their involvement.The first trial, that of Amrozi, commenced on Monday this week. The trial has been adjourned to next Monday, 19 May, to allow the defence further time to consider the brief of evidence. The Bali trials will be heard in two venues - the Wanita Nari Graha building in Denpasar and the Denpasar District Court. The Nari Graha building will be used as the venue for the principal suspects' trials, those of Amrozi, Ali Imron, Muklas and Samudra. The trials for the remaining suspects will be held at the Denpasar District Court. Continuing the close cooperation between Indonesian and Australian authorities, which has been the hallmark of these investigations, the AFP has a team supporting the Indonesian prosecution and providing assistance as required. The team has, to date, collected 49 witness and victim impact statements in Australia, along with 32 forensic statements and reports for use in support of the prosecution. It is not yet known whether there will be a requirement for any of these witnesses to attend and give evidence in the trials in Indonesia.In support of the process, the AFP has also established a dedicated family liaison team with offices throughout Australia. These officers have the responsibility for the important task of liaising with the families of Bali victims and ensuring they are provided with accurate and timely information regarding the investigation and possible prosecution. Members of the AFP team will be in Bali during the trial periods and will provide briefings and assistance to Australian family members in relation to the trial proceedings. The AFP will also provide up-to-date information about the Bali trials on their web site at www.afp.gov.au. For those families that do not have Internet access, other arrangements have been made to ensure that they are regularly updated. In addition, the government has provided financial assistance for close family members of the Bali victims and for those seriously injured in the bombings who wish to attend part of the trials. Centrelink family liaison officers have contacted families and the seriously injured in relation to the offer. Interested families can also contact the Centrelink Bali Disaster Hotline on 136 125 for more information. Investigations by the Indonesian National Police are continuing with a view to apprehending other suspects regarding the bombings. One vital outcome of the investigations to date has been a substantial knowledge gained by our law enforcement and intelligence authorities about the activities of Jemaah Islamiah and the extent of terrorist activities throughout the region. As part of the overall investigation into the Bali bombings, the AFP is working closely with Indonesian authorities to trace the flow of funds used to finance the attacks. This important aspect of the investigation is ongoing. There are currently about 36 AFP personnel deployed in Indonesia for Operation Alliance - the Bali bombing assistance operation. This includes members of the AFP and five members of the Australian Protective Service. Approximately 12 AFP officers are dedicated to Operation Alliance in Australia. This reflects the ongoing commitment of Australian authorities to tracking down and bringing to justice those responsible for the Bali bombings and to supporting the Australian families of the victims through what continues to be a difficult and painful process. More officers are allocated to investigations on a needs basis. As at 30 April, Operation Alliance had resulted in the expenditure of $12 million, with more than 170,000 hours being attributed to Operation Alliance throughout the AFP. Australian authorities will continue to play a strong role in the investigation of the Bali bombings. The ongoing vigour of this investigation sends a strong message to terrorists and those considering terrorist acts around the world that we will not stand for such cowardly attacks on Australians or Australian interests. </DOC>

I accept that what you said was there and I accept that that conclusion is correct. Did you say `legitimacy' of the report? - I am sorry. Through you, Mr Speaker, I inquire of the member for Barton: did he use the word `legitimacy'? - I am not challenging its legitimacy. I am not challenging the bona fides of the people who wrote the report. I am just pointing out what its status is. I am also pointing out that there is another view of the way in which the inquiry was conducted, which puts it in a different light than it has been put in by the Leader of the Opposition. That is what I am saying.  - The Leader of Opposition interjects `How do I resolve?' I have already answered a question in relation to the position of the Governor-General, and I have got nothing to add to it. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Mitchell for his question and his ongoing and continuing interest in the health and welfare of all Australians. The reasons behind the Pan Pharmaceuticals recall of more than 1,500 products - mostly complementary medicines - and the licence suspension of that company have been well canvassed in the media. The recall has highlighted the importance of preventing or deterring deliberate or reckless breaches of standards and conditions applicable to the manufacture of medicines in order to protect the health and safety of the Australian public. In this context, the Therapeutic Goods Administration is to be commended for finding these serious deficiencies in the manufacturing process as well as a culture of concealment in that particular company. Its vigilance and competence are a vital part of ensuring that Australians can have confidence now and into the future in the medicines that they take and that the pharmaceutical industry can continue to make world-class products for Australian consumers and for export.The government, nonetheless, has announced a series of measures to further strengthen the sector's future. First, as was announced by my colleague the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Ageing, the member for Adelaide, yesterday, an expert committee will be set up by the Commonwealth government to examine the role of complementary medicines in the health care system. This expert committee will focus on issues around the supply of safe, high-quality complementary medicines, quality use of and timely access to these medicines and the maintenance of a responsible and viable complementary medicines industry. The expert committee will be chaired by Dr Michael Bollen, a member of the National Health and Medical Research Council, who has been involved with the Australian Pharmaceutical Advisory Council and consumer medicines information. Further announcements on the committee and its terms of reference will be made later this week, and it is expected that it will report back to the government by mid-August.Second, the government has foreshadowed proposed amendments to the therapeutic goods legislation to tighten the existing requirements placed on manufacturers and sponsors of therapeutic goods. The foreshadowed amendments include: firstly, increasing the maximum penalties for a range of existing offences under the Therapeutic Goods Act; secondly, creating new offences for the falsification of any document that has been created, retained or issued; thirdly, inserting a fit and proper person test into the licence or conformity assessment certificate; and, fourthly, providing better identification of therapeutic goods in the event of a recall. The establishment of this committee and the legislative changes that I have made mention of will go a long way towards giving the community and all health care practitioners further confidence that the government is taking the necessary steps to examine the role of complementary medicines in the health care system while encouraging the continuation of Australia's reputation as a supplier of high-quality and safe medicines.</DOC>

 - I do not have the precise details of the program to which you refer in my mind, and I am not going to comment on the precise circumstances of that until I check exactly what the circumstances were, but I would make the very obvious point that a program that carries a particular name is not the one and only way of tackling a problem.  - I have just outlined to the member for Gellibrand and her colleagues that, three years ago, we announced a program of several hundred million dollars designed specifically to build stronger families and communities and, in the past few weeks, I have written to the Minister for Family and Community Services requesting that there be an even greater focus on strategies of early childhood intervention.  - Even if what the member for Gellibrand says is literally correct, it does not prove anything other than that a particular program was not thought to be appropriate. The important thing is that we have introduced programs which are designed to address this issue. The other important thing - and the point has to be made again and again - is that institutions and organisations dealing with the problem of child abuse are, principally, to be found at a state level. - The states want a place in the sun. State governments appropriate to themselves the right to give the Commonwealth government advice on all sorts of things, so I am going to occasionally give them some advice on their own core responsibilities, and one of their core responsibilities is child welfare. There is no federal department of child welfare; there are state departments of child welfare. Somebody is a ward of the state, not a ward of the Commonwealth - that is where the principal responsibility lies. The administration of government schools is a state responsibility and the curriculum control and overall surveillance of all schools is a state responsibility. I am simply making the point that this desire on the part of states to federalise every problem but to appropriate to themselves the right to give advice on any issue they choose - that those days, as far as this government are concerned, are well and truly over. We expect states, particularly as they are going to be given more and more money under the GST - and the extent of how the states benefit from the GST will be apparent on any examination of federal-state relationships - to meet their responsibilities. I repeat what I said earlier: if people are really interested in the issue of child sex abuse as distinct from trying to score a few points in relation to an extraordinarily difficult and traumatic issue, then I think they should focus on greater early childhood intervention in relation to families at risk. That is where you are going to find a solution to the problem. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Hinkler for his question and the interest he shows in this issue. We make no apology for the tough approach we have taken to stop criminals smuggling and trafficking innocent - sometimes less than but typically innocent - people and targeting Australia. Globally, this is a $15 billion a year criminal activity and it undermines the integrity of the international refugee system. It is an issue that absolutely must be addressed.As the House will know, our comprehensive approach to this problem has been working very successfully, with no unauthorised arrivals landing on the Australian mainland since August 2001. A critical element of our strategy is to strengthen regional cooperation against people-smuggling and to do that by improving the technical capacity of source, transit and destination countries to deal with these problems.With my Indonesian counterpart, Hassan Wirajuda, I co-hosted the second regional ministerial conference on people-smuggling in Bali early last week. It was attended by 28 ministers from 32 regional countries, including of course our own distinguished ministers, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs and also the Minister for Justice and Customs. These ministers have proved extraordinarily effective in their participation at these meetings, as of course has the overall strategy proved effective. - If we had taken the advice of the opposition, obviously the strategy would not have worked. It was also noteworthy that the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Ruud Lubbers, was at the meeting, as were representatives from the International Organisation of Migration, a number of observer countries and other international organisations.This meeting was not only extraordinarily successful in terms of meeting its objectives - ensuring much better cooperation on law enforcement, information exchange and so the list goes on - and building on the first Bali conference but also a very important illustration of the strength of the bilateral cooperation between Australia and Indonesia. I think this is a significant issue. In Australia, people should reflect on it a little bit. Commentators, in particular, should reflect on it a little more than they do.I noted, for example, the spokesman for the Indonesian foreign ministry being reported in the Financial Review last week, making it very clear that Indonesia is satisfied and impressed with the level of cooperation between our two countries and the work we are doing together. This is one of those issues.  - The honourable member interjects, `Have the Indonesians made people-smuggling an offence?' The Indonesian government, true to its word, has drafted the legislation and is discussing the legislation with its parliament. I do not think it would be wise for people on the other side to go to the Indonesians and, in a patronising and high-handed way, tell them when they should pass legislation through their parliament. After all, you are not even capable of running your own affairs on the other side of the House, let alone telling the Indonesians how to run theirs. - They are allowed to interject. I will respond to their interjections.</DOC>

 - Actually, I can read the table on page 5-38 of the budget papers. It says that tax on individuals as a percentage of GDP in 2003-04 will be 11.9 per cent. This government came to office in 1996-97. In the year before we came to office, in 1995-96, it was 12.3 per cent. As a percentage of the economy, it is lower than when the government came to office. - I was asked about table F2 on pages 5-37 and 5-38. Income tax as a percentage of GDP in 2003-04 will be 11.9 per cent. In the year before the government came to office, in 1995-96, the comparable figure was 12.3 per cent. - I was asked a question about the table on page 5-38 of the budget showing major categories of receipts as a proportion of gross domestic product. The table quite clearly shows that, in relation to income tax, in 2003-04 the proportion of the economy is 11.9 per cent as opposed to 1995-96 when it was 12.3 per cent. If you want to find out when it was substantially higher, the highest in the last 25 years was in 1986-87, when the income tax to GDP ratio was 14.2 per cent.</DOC>

 - The last year has been a difficult year in relation to the world economy. The United States economy has been subdued; growth in Europe has been disappointing; Japan continues to disappoint, on the downside; and growth in the UK has been around one or two per cent, which is less than we would otherwise expect. Notwithstanding those other comparable economies and the difficulties of the international economy with war and the threat of SARS, and notwithstanding the domestic drought, the Australian economy is forecast to grow in 2003-04 by 3 per cent. Australia continues to lead the advanced industrialised world as one of the strongest-growing economies of the developed countries, notwithstanding the weak international situation and the domestic drought.In addition to that, the government's fiscal position is strong. We are forecasting a surplus both this financial year, 2002-03, and next financial year, 2003-04. There are very few developed economies that will have budgets in surplus. Europe will not, Britain will not, the United States will not, Japan will not - the comparable economies of the developed world will not. In fact, the United States is forecasting a budget deficit of about four per cent of GDP. In Australian terms, if we were to have a budget deficit of four per cent of GDP it would mean a $30 billion deficit. So the Australian budget is in a substantially stronger position than those of the US, the UK, Europe and Japan. This government, of course, inherited a very large budget deficit when it came to office. We have driven the budget into surplus and we have kept it there. It is one of the reasons why Australia was able to withstand the Asian economic crisis and one of the reasons why Australia was able to withstand the downturn in the United States. So the prospects for Australia, although affected by international developments, are much better than those of comparable countries. The economic reform that we have put in place has strengthened the Australian economy and, as a result, given better job opportunities to all Australians.</DOC>

 - The answer to the first part of the question is no. In relation to the middle part of the question, I did hear the allegation made that this was the smallest tax cut in Australian history. I regret to say that that is not the truth. There was one tax cut which did not pay $1 to one person for one day. Did I say tax cut? No, it was l-a-w - it was law! I remember a tax cut which was put into l-a-w which did not pay $1 to one person for one day. Let me guess which party introduced the l-a-w. I will return to my seat and think about which party it was that introduced the lowest tax cut in Australian history.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Robertson for his question. As the government was preparing last night's budget, its priorities in relation to expenditure were obviously Australian troops in Iraq and the magnificent contribution they made. The government also had as a priority the drought assistance measures to those Australians who have suffered the most extensive drought in Australian history, and the budget last night provided around $740 million worth of relief to them. In addition to that, the government wanted to tighten Australia's security in the wake of the Bali bombing and other outrages.I have indicated before to the House that most of the developed economies of the world now have budgets in deep deficit. But our view was that, if we could meet those expenditures and expenditures in relation to health and education and if we could keep our budget in surplus, there would be the opportunity to return some money to taxpayers. Returning $2.4 billion in the next year is a responsible return to taxpayers. The parameters which we set ourselves were returned after the budget had been kept in balance. Of course taxpayers would say that they would prefer larger tax cuts to smaller tax cuts - I think most taxpayers would say that - but they would also say that they would support smaller tax cuts compared to no tax cuts, or smaller tax cuts compared to tax increases. I ask the House to do one thing. I ask the House not to listen to what Labor says but to look at what Labor does. We have already had three state Labor governments bring down their budgets: the Victorian, the ACT and the Western Australian governments. The Victorian government raised 300 taxes in its budget and the Victorian government reneged on a solemn promise made to the people of Victoria at an election for the Scoresby Freeway. If the Leader of the Opposition had any decency, he would instruct them to keep that promise. - It might be 60 years since they have raised income taxes but it has not been very long since they raised their other taxes. They all did it in their last budgets. In Victoria they raised 300 taxes, from recollection. The only point I am making is this: I think if you spoke to most people they would say that they would prefer income tax cuts to no income tax cut at all and they would certainly prefer income tax cuts to income tax rises, which is the Labor alternative. In relation to keeping the budget in balance in funding Australia's legitimate defence needs, in funding Australia's security, we believe that this is a responsible return to taxpayers of $2.4 billion.I will make one last point. If the opposition says the income tax cuts are not large enough, we will wait to see the income tax cuts that the Leader of the Opposition will be promising on Thursday night and we will cost them.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. At the outset I congratulate the Treasurer on his eighth budget and say to him that country Australia welcomes the continuation of the solid foundations that we have put down over the last seven years, which have certainly addressed some of the fundamental problems that regional Australia faced as a result of Labor's legacy. Farmers, rural communities and exporters are price takers, by and large, and the estimated inflation of 2.25 per cent is very welcome - so, too, are the policies which ensure continuing low interest rates.The Treasurer might be interested to note that I was in Brisbane this morning and I met with a large number of people. Universally they thought it was what you could describe as a sound budget. They thought it was responsible and they noted that - in the context of the difficult circumstances globally and domestically with the drought - to have been able to achieve all of the things that we have and to offer tax cuts is indicative of a very sound approach. But there are some specifics in this budget that have been very widely welcomed. Dr Brendan Nelson has put work into higher education, particularly reflecting the disadvantage - to single out just one group - of regional and remote Indigenous communities and their needs, with the loadings for regional universities. That has been very widely welcomed and is a big step forward. Likewise, our commitment to Medicare is being widely welcomed. The commitment to training more doctors who will ultimately end up working in the outer metropolitan areas and regional areas is to be widely welcomed and has been. I note that the National Farmers Federation, amongst others, have welcomed the new regional partnerships program in my own area. And there is the Roads to Recovery - restoring those broken down regional roads that carry all of our exports, the products that our jobs depend upon, value adding and so forth - across the nation. It is all there. We said to local government that the full $1.2 billion would be delivered. It is there: over $300 million this year. In relation to the biofuels industry there will be a five-year excise free period so that the ethanol and biodiesel sectors can get going. It is part of a nine-year support program which will give potential ethanol producers the investment security that they have been seeking.I heard an interjection from over there a moment ago that we were increasing fuel costs to rural people. I find that astonishing. They were the kings of indexation. When they were in government fuel excise went from around 7c to 32c. It was an increase in the order of 500 per cent. Who was it that opposed the very reductions in excise on diesel for transport vehemently in this place but ensured we had to negotiate an outcome with the Democrats, who could at least see the benefit and importance of lower transport costs for the nation and in particular its exporters?Finally, on the subject of the drought, I have thanked the NFF for their sound recognition of the good things we have done, but I did see a rather silly comment from them suggesting that drought funding had been reduced. That is not right. I am sure the President of the NFF knows only too well that our commitment to drought assistance has no budgetary limit; it is an open commitment. While the need is there we will meet it. Fortunately in some areas there are some encouraging signs that the drought may be breaking up. That is very good news, not bad news. If, unfortunately, that does not eventuate and the need builds again, we will be there. The commitment is open.</DOC>

 - The simple answer to the question is no - but there are many issues that are raised in it. What the government has announced is a transformational package of change for Australian universities: $1.5 billion extra public investment over four years; $10.6 billion over a decade. Amongst many other things, apart from putting increasing and significant public resources into Australian higher education, it will create over five years 31,500 fully funded places in Australian universities. Of those, 25,000 will be converted from marginally funded - or underfunded, if you like - over enrolled places and 6,500 of them will be fully funded brand-new places which represent more opportunities for Australians and for Australian children. Most importantly, it makes sure that Australian children of Australian families understand that there will be a university available to them. It will be of a very high quality. They will have choices available to them and there will continue to be a HECS loan available to them to support their publicly funded place. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Makin for her question. She is a salt of the earth Australian, a nurse herself by training and is very committed to the University of South Australia - a tremendous advocate for the University of South Australia especially. Amongst the $1.5 billion package delivered by the Treasurer last night for Australian universities is a significant focus on nursing and teaching. There will be 2,000 extra places in nursing and teaching created over four years by this package. It includes specifically 574 extra places in regional Australia for nursing at a cost of $17.1 million and, in addition to that, 744 new places in nursing and teaching at private institutions that are eligible - for example, Avondale College and the University of Notre Dame. In addition, the government will be locking in, in the long term, a commitment to the 655 nursing and teaching places already existing at those institutions. Also there will be another 1,400 growth places fully funded commencing in 2007, many of which will be in nursing and teaching. And over the four years from 2005 those overenrolled - what we call `marginally funded' - places that attract only a quarter of the money of the students up to the enrolment target will be fully converted at a cost of $347 million to support fully funded places in Australian universities. It is not enough just to create more places in nursing and teaching; we also need to give more money to the nursing and education faculties to train our teachers and nurses. So there is $40.4 million in this package over four years that represents a 7.1 per cent increase in the money to actually train each and every nurse that goes through university to help them to go to the hospitals to get their training. Further to that there is another $81 million to similarly support the training of our teachers so that they can spend more time in classrooms learning to be the teachers that we need for our children.The other important point is that, whilst the vice-chancellors of Australia's universities - every one of the 38 - argued to the government that it was critically important for Australia's future to have flexibility in their fees within reason, we as a government said, `We will accept that recommendation, but we will set the upper limit of the band for nursing and teaching at the current level for 2003 indexed to 2005.' In other words, whilst we accept that argument, we believe that for national priorities like nursing and teaching we should put a ceiling on any flexibility there so at least the upper limit is not above what it is at the moment. In the end this is about our future. It is not about Australian universities today or next year; it is about what kind of country we will be living in 20 years from now and the opportunities that our children will enjoy and the standard of living and the services they will receive from Australia's nurses, teachers and professionals trained in universities.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Jagajaga for the question. The first thing that ought to be said is that, in April last year, this government and I as its education minister initiated a process of canvassing the views of all Australians in relation to the future of Australia's universities. The National Tertiary Education Union, the vice-chancellors, the Union of Students, academics, people the length and breadth of Australia, state governments, representatives from industry - a whole variety of Australians - contributed to quite significant deliberations through a sixmonth period, the culmination of which is now this package of reforms that was announced last night.The Australian Labor Party deliberately chose to not participate in the process of reviewing universities in relation to our future. The member for Jagajaga has obviously neither read nor understood the policy package. It is entitled Our universities: backing Australia's future. I would be very happy to provide a copy to the member for Jagajaga. I suggest to all members of the Australian Labor Party that they very carefully read the detail in the package before they come in here and ask quite facile questions. - Mr Speaker, 98 per cent of the students in Australian universities are funded and supported by the Australian taxpayer. Every day Australian men and women feeding their kids, their car loans and their mortgages pay for three-quarters of the cost of university education. The other 25 per cent is funded by students through the Higher Education Contributions Scheme. HECS, which was introduced by the Labor Party, to its credit, and supported by this side of politics, has enabled a significant growth in participation in higher education. The only changes to HECS being made are to increase the repayment threshold to $30,000 before graduates start to pay back their loans and the value of the loan is -   - I thank the member for Jagajaga for pointing out to me that her question is about the less than two per cent of students in university who are offered fee paying places - provided opportunities when the university decides that they should be offered a fee paying place in the same way as any student from Jakarta or Beijing or anyone who is welcome from overseas. For the first time, this government has announced that those students - the 9,400 currently in Australian universities as Australian students of Australian taxpayers - will have available to them a loan from the Commonwealth government. That loan will lend them up to $50,000 at a 3½ per cent interest rate with, for the first time, income contingent payback. They do not have to pay back the loan until they are earning $30,000 or more a year. I say, particularly to those who think they are driving the social justice truck: just reflect on the fact that, if you come from a low-income family, and you have been educated in difficult circumstances -  - and you then find yourself with a tertiary entrance score of -  - If you then find yourself with a tertiary entrance score of 99.3 and miss out on law at Melbourne University and you are offered a fee paying place, you currently cannot take the place. But under this policy you do not have to go along to Westpac, the National Australia Bank or the Commonwealth Bank, who will lend you no more than $20,000 at 11 per cent, which you have to start paying back within three months of graduation. Now you will be lent the money by the Commonwealth at a 3½ per cent interest rate plus CPI indexation. I would remind the Labor Party in concluding the answer to this that, in the HECS arrangements in 1990, under the Labor Party's economic management, the CPI was running at eight per cent. In 1991, the CPI was running at six per cent. In other words, HECS students were paying more on their HECS loans than will happen under this government for the two per cent of students who take up the 3½ per cent loan for their fee paying places. This is rank hypocrisy - not to mention the families who lost their houses in the recession we had to have.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Fairfax for his question. Members would be aware that there was another tragic terrorist attack in Saudi Arabia on 12 May, which killed more than 20 people. This is another tragic demonstration of the determination of terrorists to commit murderous acts against innocent civilians. Regrettably, one Australian man is dead as a result of the attacks and another injured. Both men were from Sydney, and consular assistance is being provided to their families in Riyadh. I would like to express the government's condolences to the victims' families here in Australia, in Saudi Arabia and elsewhere in the world. This bombing is yet another demonstration of the evil of terrorism at work. The attacks had all the hallmarks of an Al-Qaeda operation. Those responsible have again shown that they are nothing more than barbaric murderers who kill Muslims, Christians and anyone else without regard or remorse. But they will be brought to justice.The attack reminds us that the war against terrorism must continue. Through the united efforts of our friends and allies, the Al-Qaeda network has been disrupted and senior people have been captured. But, as we have communicated through our travel advisories, terrorists still retain their capacity to carry out such acts. We have always said that the fight against terrorism will be a long and difficult one, but it is a fight we must be determined to win. The Australian Embassy in Riyadh is urgently investigating whether other Australians have been caught up in the attack so as to provide consular assistance to them if necessary.Yesterday, 13 May, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade again revised the travel advice for Saudi Arabia to warn that there is information suggesting that further terrorist attacks may be possible and that any Australians in Saudi Arabia who are concerned for their security should consider leaving. Travel advice had earlier been strengthened on 1 May and again on 9 May to warn of possible imminent terrorist attacks and recommended against nonessential travel to Saudi Arabia. The embassy in Riyadh ensured this advice was communicated to all registered Australians in Saudi Arabia via our ward network, in keeping with the government's commitment to keep Australians informed of threats abroad.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Grayndler for his question - his first and, in fact, the Labor Party's first question of me in question time that is related to anything to do with training or apprenticeships. In relation to Paris, the simple answer to that is no; but I understand indirectly that these facilities are more than 25 years old and are in need of refurbishment.As for the New Apprenticeship Skills Development program - again, I can give you the full budget pack - once the member for Grayndler has had a look at the detail, he will appreciate that the funding for this particular program has actually increased from last year. In other words, we are spending more this year than we were last year. Given that I have had a question about apprenticeships and training from the Australian Labor Party - which is refreshing - it gives me the opportunity to say that what we are doing this year is budgeting for a 16 per cent increase, to $689 million, for new apprenticeships and new apprenticeship centres in support of them. Last night I wrote to all of the premiers and I have put our offer on the table for the Australian National Training Authority agreement for the next three years. We are committing a total of $3.6 billion, which will mean that there will be $325 million extra from the Commonwealth which is available for growth funding for training throughout Australia. We expect the states to match that. We have also got $220 million extra in the training agreement. In particular, we want to see a focus on user choice. We want to see innovation in training and much more emphasis on school based training. We also want to see a much greater emphasis on mature-age students who want to go into training. Anything that the Australian Labor Party can do to support the Commonwealth government's initiatives to have an ANTA agreement signed up with the states will be appreciated. I am still waiting to hear from the Australian Labor Party about the alleged problems in apprenticeships and training from their national phone-in. I understand that 81 people rang in; I am still waiting to hear a word from them.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Fadden for his question. I recognise his continuing interest in national security issues, as the chairman of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD. The Howard government is again demonstrating its resolve to protect Australians against terrorist threats. The budget measures announced yesterday deliver further on our strong response to the terrorist threat and the changed security environment since 11 September 2001. The safety and security of the Australian community and Australian interests is a top priority of the government, and we will not sit and be idle in the face of terrorism.The government's commitment is demonstrated by the $1.4 billion we committed to national security and border protection after the September 11 attacks and the Bali bombings in October last year. This money is being used to strengthen the ability of Australia's law enforcement, security and intelligence agencies and to bolster our emergency management capabilities. We built stronger relationships with the states and territories and their agencies, with business and with the wider community. We have strengthened our cooperative relationships with Australia's regional neighbours and like-minded countries, and we have passed a comprehensive suite of tough legislation. The bulk of that legislation was passed in July last year; the ASIO bill awaits passage and we look forward to the opposition's support for that bill. Keeping our nation secure requires an ongoing commitment from the government. Indeed, the recent tragic death of another Australian at the hands of terrorists in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia - just mentioned by the Minister for Trade - reminds us that we must remain vigilant and not become complacent. Recognising this need for ongoing commitment, the 2003-04 federal budget brought down by the Treasurer last night includes an additional $411 million for national security initiatives to protect the Australian community. Within the Attorney-General's portfolio this includes $19.9 million to strengthen the counter-terrorism, analytical and liaison capabilities of ASIO and a further $3.6 million over four years to ASIO to assist in the improvement of security at airports. ASIO's budget has now increased by over 50 per cent since 11 September 2001.  Another $15.7 million has been allocated to increase the number and scope of national counter-terrorism training exercises to test the capabilities and coordination of relevant agencies. $25.3 million will be used to upgrade the Australian Secure Network - ASNET - a secure communications network linking Commonwealth, state and territory security, law enforcement and intelligence agencies. The government is also committing $11.2 million to support the operation of the National Security Hotline, $5.2 million to maintain the ongoing operation of the PSCC Watch Office 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and $20.7 million to enhance guarding services to dignitaries and diplomatic and consular missions in Australia. $4.8 million will be used to strengthen the important work of AUSTRAC, the financial transactions tracking authority. Reflecting a whole of government approach, these measures complement allocations in other portfolios, including defence, immigration and foreign affairs. We will continue to work responsibly to maintain and to build Australia's counter-terrorism capabilities. These budget measures show there can be no doubt about the Howard government's commitment to protecting the Australian community against the threat of terrorism.</DOC>

 - In reply to the honourable member for Jagajaga, the Minister for Education, Science and Training has already pointed out that support of the funded HECS places remains and that the loan scheme of which the member for Jagajaga speaks is in relation to two per cent of the whole number of students at universities. Can I just say to the Labor Party that it is very interesting that the Labor Party are doing, in relation to these educational reforms, exactly what they did in relation to tax reform and exactly what they appear to be doing in relation to improvements to the health system. The Australian people over the last seven years have shown the Australian Labor Party what they think of a party that takes a wholly negative approach to necessary reforms.  - I would remind the House and also the Australian people that, when it became necessary in the 1980s for the then minister for education, Mr Dawkins, to abandon the fantasy that this country could have completely free tertiary education - a fantasy visited upon the Australian people by the Whitlam government in 1972 and something that became absolutely unsustainable - and to propose those reforms, instead of obstructing and opposing we supported them, just as we supported tariff reform, just as we supported financial deregulation and just as we supported -   - Continuing the narrative that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition enables me to do, I am simply saying to the House and to the Australian people that, in the past when we were in opposition and the government of the day put up a decent idea, we supported it. But our experience has been utterly different. One of the characteristics of the Australian Labor Party in the past few years has been a blind opportunism.  - The reason the Australian people rejected the Labor Party in 2001 was the opportunism of the former Leader of the Opposition over tax reform. I say again that the Australian people will always reject an opportunistic party whose only interest is opposing, obstructing, delaying and criticising rather than building, cooperating and facilitating. The Australian people want their political party to address the problems of the 21st century. They do not want mindless and dishonest political point scoring. They want a little bit of constructive political debate and not the sort of opposition that you are now engaging in. You have smug smiles on your faces, just as the members of your caucus had smug smiles on their faces when in December 2000 the former Leader of the Opposition said that you were going to surf to victory off the back of the GST. You were wrong then, you treated the Australian people with contempt then, and you are setting up to make exactly the same mistake in relation to these education reforms. </DOC>

 - I acknowledge the member for McPherson's interest in this matter. As honourable members may know, on 14 March the World Health Organisation issued a global alert, warning health authorities about a highly contagious form of pneumonia known as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome or SARS. As of 13 May, 7,548 probable cases and 573 deaths have been reported to the World Health Organisation. It is pleasing to note that there have been no confirmed cases of SARS in Australia. Through a process of national surveillance, Australia has reported six probable cases of SARS to the World Health Organisation but there has been no spread of SARS from these cases. Currently there are three people under investigation, two from Queensland and one from New South Wales, and over 120 people have been investigated for possible SARS infection in Australia. On 28 March, the government established an inquiry line, which has answered some 29,500 calls about SARS from concerned members of the Australian public. We have also strengthened border protection activities. On 2 April, the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service commenced distribution of traveller information cards, including in Vietnamese and traditional and simplified Chinese. We have also since instituted health personnel at each international airport to review passengers who are identified by airline or border staff as unwell. Health personnel at borders have assessed and cleared some 403 passengers. On 7 April, SARS was made a quarantinable disease for Australia. I am also pleased to indicate that in the budget an amount of up to $2.2 million over two years has been allocated for placement of health personnel at international airports to safeguard Australians from SARS. Evidence about the spread of SARS and the risk to Australian travellers is reviewed by officers of the Commonwealth Department of Health and Ageing each day. The department and the Chief Medical Officer are liaising with other Commonwealth agencies, state and territory health authorities and the World Health Organisation. I repeat that there have been no confirmed cases of SARS in Australia, that we have made this additional allocation of up to $2.2 million for ongoing surveillance and that the government will continue to closely monitor the situation to protect the health of all Australians. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Dunkley for his question and I acknowledge his very long and continuing interest in Australia's historic heritage. The budget, in showing the extraordinary resilience of the Australian economy and Australian enterprise and the fact that we perform above our weight in the international community, reminds us of what a remarkable country it is that we live in. Our national story is embodied in many historic sites and places both here and overseas. In last night's budget the government announced its commitment of $52 million, including $13 million of new money, to a program to identify and protect Australia's most important historic heritage and to tell the story of the contribution that heritage makes to our national identity.The member for Werriwa will be very pleased to know that this will be a program in which all Australians can take part. We will go to the Australian people and ask them to nominate the places that they believe have played an important part in building this nation and its identity, and which deserve the protections which will be offered by the government's heritage legislation. Up till now, we have had World Heritage, we have had local heritage and now we will have, for the first time, a national list that includes the most important places of all that represent the people and events that have made this country what it is. We will be asking Australians to be part of a national effort to make sure that these places are preserved for our children and for their children and that the story about them is properly told. The convicts who came to this country `bound down by iron chains' and the free settlers who believed in freedom and a better life for their children will be remembered through this program; the Indigenous cultural legacy is important not only in our national story but in the story of the human race; the pioneers who built the industries that have made this country one of the most prosperous countries in the world will be remembered; those who founded our institutions, who established in this country the democratic institutions that have made this country one of the great democracies of the world, will be remembered; the soldiers who fought at Anzac Cove and Kokoda can be remembered through this program; and our great scientists, our builders and our artists, who make this one of the most imaginative and innovative countries of the world, will be remembered - all of these people can be remembered as part of this program which will identify what is distinctively Australian and ensure that it is protected for the future.This program is also complemented in the budget by the further significant commitment made last night to the heritage sites of Sydney Harbour. I noted the DailyTelegraph this morning said about this program, `All Australians should contribute to this inspiring scheme.' That is what the Daily Telegraph said: `this inspiring scheme'. All Australians will have an opportunity to take part in it, and I ask the Labor Party and the Democrats to pass the heritage legislation through the Senate, which will make all this possible and give Australians the chance to further build the identity which makes this country the extraordinary place that it is.</DOC>

 - It is more than my life is worth, by the sound of it, to repeat the story so I will not do that. - There is a very serious point here: what does the Labor Party stand for? The Labor Party, as I understand it, is totally opposed to this loan scheme for the less than two per cent of students going to Australian universities.  - Now the Australian Labor Party, if I hear them correctly, are arguing that the loans scheme is not generous enough. All I can say to the member for Jagajaga, again, is: please read the detail. The fact is that this government is now proposing to offer students who take up a fee-paying place in a public or a qualifying private higher education institution a loan - which is currently not available to them at all - for up to $50,000 with a 3½ per cent interest rate capped for 10 years plus CPI indexation, which brings it to about six per cent, which is around the bond rate. I point out to the Australian Labor Party that in the early nineties Australians were paying 17½ per cent on their home mortgages and 23 per cent on their business overdrafts. What we are doing now as a government is saying to Australians, including the daughter from that sole parent family: we are now giving you 50,000 opportunities which did not exist prior to this to assist you to take up the place. - It is a kind of reverse elitism, all this. The Labor Party want to ignore the fact that this government is fully funding, over five years, 31,500 places in Australian universities. The Labor Party are then saying, `Having filled all those places, we don't think that these other kids should have a chance if the university thinks they're good enough to get in.' Worse still, they do not think the Australian government ought to help them get in. I am sorry, but we take a different point of view. On this side of the House we believe that all Australians are entitled to a fair go. We will be requiring universities to publish what their minimum entry score is to get into a course, and if a university says, `We think you are good enough to do law' - or veterinary science or dentistry - `and we will give you a place,' we are not going to allow the situation where a young person has to refuse the place simply because they cannot borrow or get the money. The Labor Party seem to want to represent the wealthy people in this country, and the battlers are represented over here.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Macquarie for his question. As one of the shapers and influencers of government policy relating to science and innovation, he will be as proud as I am about the record spending on science and innovation announced in last night's budget: $5½ billion on science and innovation and research more generally, which is $461 million up from last year. The Backing Australia's Ability programs, in this third year of its five-year life, are really kicking in.Backing Australia's Ability, the innovation strategy, has not just transformed the funding for research bodies and agencies in the private sector but brought about a cultural change about its importance. It has transformed the entire sector. There are many to thank and congratulate for Backing Australia's Ability. Its major architects are spread throughout the cabinet - led by the Prime Minister - and include Senator Nick Minchin, the industry minister at the time. It had the support of the Treasurer. I will not list them all. The Cabinet Secretary at the time, Paul McClintock, also was a major influence. Paul McClintock just happens to be in the gallery this afternoon and we thank the Cabinet Secretary for his legacy, along with many others.The budget also provided $20 million in new funding for the CSIRO to support its flagships. That is a great endorsement of the work of the CSIRO and its chief executive officer, Dr Geoff Garrett. That $20 million in new funding is a seven per cent increase in the CSIRO budget. Consideration for future funding for CSIRO, now that we have extended its triennium funding by one year, will take place in the 2004-05 budget process and be reflected in the next triennium funding agreement. Decisions on future funding for the CSIRO will be informed by the findings of a review of models for closer collaboration between major public research agencies and universities, as well as the outcome of the science and innovation mapping exercise, which is to be completed in 2003. Honourable members - on this side at least - will also be interested to know about another major injection of new funding. The member for Herbert will be particularly interested in it. Five million dollars will go to the Australian Institute of Marine Science at Townsville so that it can develop a formal affiliation with James Cook University to develop a joint venture: a world-class centre of research on marine science.I should stress that, contrary to press reports, this is not an amalgamation or merger of the Australian Institute of Marine Science with James Cook University. The affiliation will boost Townsville as a centre of excellence by bringing together a critical mass of researchers and teachers, thereby increasing the flexibility and capability of both institutions to share skills and infrastructure. I wish to pay tribute to the minister for education for his support of the proposal and to the member for Herbert for his tireless, unhesitating championing of all things North Queensland and, in particular, the affiliation between those two great research bodies.</DOC>

 - It was about the sugar industry, which is facing - mainly as a result of international circumstances and some trading practices that Australia does not endorse - some very real difficulties. I should say at the outset that there are a number of sugar representatives in this place who are extremely concerned about the plight of the industry and whose representations have been very vigorous. That would include the member for Dawson, the member for Leichhardt and the member for Hinkler, and there are others.We as a government want to find a genuine way forward for the sugar industry, inasmuch as domestic policies can help an industry confronted by some of the challenges imposed by what is happening globally. To that end we have considerable assistance available on the table to help that industry, but we want to be satisfied that the programs in place will genuinely take this troubled industry forward. We want - and I believe it is only reasonable - to be able to carefully examine the proposed legislation, which came into the House before the Commonwealth had the chance to see it. I do not believe that is quite reasonable, given that we are, after all, the providers of the bulk of the assistance. The minister for agriculture has worked very long and hard on this. He has had a lot of interaction with the sugar industry leadership. I myself met with the sugar industry leadership again this morning. They have come a long way in recognising the very real difficulties that that industry faces. I just emphasise the point that I believe a way through can be found here. It is important that we do so for this major industry. It is simply a matter, at this point in time, of us saying - quite calmly and, I think, perfectly reasonably - that we want to look very closely at what is proposed to make certain that the outcome of this is a way forward for the sugar industry. I think that is entirely defensible. Indeed, I think the taxpayers who are providing the assistance would deem it extremely important that we do know exactly what we are going to get.</DOC>

 - I have not seen the detail of the NATSEM analysis, although I did see something in the paper which I thought indicated that NATSEM was positive about the government's changes. I will certainly go back and look at the clip. But I can inform the House that, with the income tax cuts which were delivered to every Australian as a result of the budget on Tuesday night, all income taxpayers receive an income tax cut. Those cuts are greatest for the lowest income earners. Those under $20,000 receive $85 per annum; those between $20,000 and $27,000 can receive up to $329 per annum; those between $30,000 and $50,000 can receive $208 per annum; those up to $62,500 can receive $448 per annum; and those over that amount can receive $573 per annum. I am asked why people at the upper levels receive higher income tax cuts than those at the lower levels, and that is of course because they pay more income tax. But in proportionate terms - that is, the income tax cut to the income tax you are currently paying - it is those at the lower end of the income scale that proportionally get the largest cut in their income tax. Mr Speaker, it is an obvious point but, if you are not paying income tax, you cannot have an income tax cut. If you are paying a small amount, then the small amount of the cut in percentage terms is a large percentage reduction. As you can see from the distributional table in budget statement No. 1, the black line indicates that proportionally the greatest benefits - this is a document tabled in the House, a budget paper -  - I am referring to it, Mr Speaker. Proportionally the greatest cuts go to the lower income earners. In fact, on $10,000 the income tax cut is 16 per cent. I think people on this side of the House would say that, if you are on $10,000, 16 per cent would be welcome. If you are on $22,000, your income tax cut - that is the cut compared to the amount of income tax you pay - is 10 per cent; that is a 10 per cent reduction for those who are a little over $20,000. As the chart also shows, for those who are on $70,000, the income tax cut as a percentage of the tax they pay is two per cent. It is progressive but fair and responsible in the budget context. This is the side of politics that has delivered an income tax cut to all income taxpayers in Australia.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Sturt for his question. As he pointed out, as a result of this government's budget, not only is the budget in surplus but nine million Australians received an income tax cut in Tuesday night's budget. As I pointed out in Tuesday night's budget, there are not many comparable countries in the world that have a budget surplus - not the European Union, not Japan, not the United States and not the United Kingdom. So I was rather intrigued to read the phantom like shadow Treasurer in a statement on 14 April, before the budget, say:In the United Kingdom last week, the Chancellor of the Exchequer ... was able to fund the ... British military commitment and deliver tax cuts and deliver a surplus ...If a well-run budget can pay for war, deliver tax cuts and deliver a surplus ... Peter Costello should be able to do the same.Of course, we met those tests. But was the member for Fraser right in saying that the United Kingdom had cut taxes and delivered a surplus? I refer the House to the OECD report in relation to the United Kingdom, which, far from reporting that the United Kingdom budget is in surplus, reports that the UK budget is now in deficit to 2.2 per cent of GDP - a $15 billion deficit in Australian terms. - By Labor's standards, a surplus. A Labor surplus is a negative $15 billion surplus. Far from running a surplus budget and cutting taxes, the United Kingdom runs a deficit budget and, on 6 April 2003, increased employees' contribution to national insurance by one per cent and employers' contribution by one per cent - a total tax increase on 6 April of 8,600 or $21½ thousand million. So it is a tax rise of $21½ billion on a budget deficit of $15 billion. This is the model that the Australian Labor Party holds up, and no doubt the Leader of the Opposition will not disappoint tonight when he announces his increased tax cuts and increased spending. But we do not have to go to the United Kingdom to see what Australian Labor is really about, because it is budget time here in Australia and we have six Labor states and two Labor territories. Don't listen -  An opposition member - A beautiful thing. - A beautiful thing, says the member for Wills. Let us look at the beautiful thing the Victorian Labor government did in its budget. The Victorian government, in a beautiful thing, increased 300 taxes in its budget - 300 taxes. A beautiful thing, the member for Wills said. They increased fees on motor vehicle registration. They increased fees on motor vehicle licences. They took away payroll tax exemptions and, most heinous of all, in one of the most brazen breaches of an election program, they abolished their commitment to fund the Scoresby Freeway. What about the Western Australian Labor government? Another beautiful thing? - Another winner, says the member for Corio. Let's have a look at a Labor winner. - Let us have a look at a Labor winner. Stamp duty on conveyances is up 15 per cent. - There are increases in fees and charges. Stamp duty on general insurance policies is up eight per cent - another Labor winner. Water charges are up 3.3 per cent - another Labor winner. Public transport fares are up three per cent - another Labor winner.Let us go to the Australian Capital Territory - another Labor winner? They are getting a little bit shy about claiming the ACT as a Labor winner, with increases in the conveyance duty rates on business assets, an increase in the marginal tax rate for gaming machines and the introduction of a loan security duty on commercial loans. These are the Labor winners that federal Labor admires. What do they have in common? Tax rises. We will be very interested tonight, because the Leader of the Opposition will be announcing income tax cuts over and above those that the government brought down. He thinks the ones we brought down are too low, so no doubt he will be announcing larger income tax cuts tonight. We will be interested to see how he funds those. We will be interested to see what he says. But, if you really want to know what Labor are like, look at what they do, do not listen to what they say.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker -  - That would be one of the most confused questions that I have ever heard in this House - notwithstanding the time it took to read it out.  - What I have said is on the record, and it is not changed by you misrepresenting it. What I have said is this -  - What I have said - and it will not be misrepresented by the honourable member - is that the Commonwealth debt position is strong. It is strong because we have repaid $63 billion of Labor's net debts. We now have a position which is stronger than most of the developed countries of the world. If the Australian budget is in surplus - and it is one of the few budgets in surplus around the world; the UK is not, the US is not, France is not, Germany is not, Japan is not - then I believe that taxpayers should be able to share in some of the benefits with reduced taxes. That is what we have done in relation to this budget. If we have the opportunity, in relation to future budgets, to balance our budget to meet our genuine expenses, then we may well have the opportunity to give further reductions in taxes to Australians. That will be our priority. But we know that this is completely different from the Labor way. The Labor state governments are not capping taxes, they are not holding them. The Labor states are increasing taxes. A big difference is now opening up in Australia between a coalition Liberal-National Party - which believes in efficiency with public money and low tax where possible - and the Australian Labor Party, which are not efficient with expenses and believe in higher taxes. I say again: it is very easy for an opposition to say tax cuts should be larger. An opposition who believe that tax cuts should be larger will tonight announce the tax scales which will produce them. If the opposition think that $4 per week or $200 per annum is not sufficient, then for an additional $2½ billion they can double that tonight to $400 per annum. - But for that $2½ billion they will have to point to those areas of the Commonwealth account they will cut. So tonight - going through all of the smoke and going through the confected outrage - we have an opportunity for the Labor Party to lay down their tax cuts and to lay down where they will cut the Commonwealth expenses to make those tax cuts. I will be watching very interestedly to the Leader of the Opposition's speech. If he would like to send around his proposed scales, we will have them costed this afternoon for him to make sure that there is agreement in relation to those tax scales. But I cannot believe for a moment that he would be critical of a government which is balancing its budget and cutting taxes without putting larger tax cuts on the table tonight. I cannot believe that he would be opportunistic to that extent. We will be watching very carefully to see how large his tax cuts are tonight - but, more importantly, how he will fund them.</DOC>

 - As it happens, yes I am aware of what the Victorian government has been saying about road funding - charging us with not meeting our commitments. - But I am also aware that you and others have a great interest in some of the commitments that they have made in the past that they are not meeting. So I thank the honourable member for his question and note his - and other Victorian members' - real interest in this question. We are delivering in full on the things that we have said that we will do in that state. - For example, there is a $100 million contribution towards the Pakenham bypass, which I know is of great significance to members of this House, thereby enabling Victoria to construct this important road much earlier than would otherwise have been the case. Federal funds will start flowing in the coming financial year and construction will begin very shortly. We are continuing to fully fund the $300 million Craigieburn bypass, thus opening up the northern entrance to Melbourne.We have also committed to spending a total of $445 million, as promised, on a toll-free Scoresby Freeway. All of that money is in the forward estimates; it is all there as promised, because the people of Victoria were promised not a tollway but a freeway. That is what they were promised. It seems that it is only the federal government that is intent upon keeping its word in this instance. In the last election, the Premier of Victoria won seats, and the election - An opposition member - Hear, hear!  - `Hear, hear!' we hear from over there. In the last election, the Premier of Victoria won on the basis of a lie - a false promise. He committed himself to building a toll-free freeway for the residents of eastern Melbourne. It is worth recalling that he even sought to rename the freeway after two marginal seats in the area. In October 2001, the Victorian Minister for Transport, Mr Batchelor, and I signed a memorandum of understanding which stated explicitly that Victoria undertakes to ensure that users of the Scoresby Freeway will not be required to pay a direct toll. In fact, I have a copy of the MOU right here. Here is section 3(d), which states:Victoria undertakes to ensure that users of the Scoresby Freeway will not be required to pay a direct toll. - That was signed. Yes, I signed it in October of 2001; so did the Victorian transport minister on behalf of the Victorian government. I table the memorandum of understanding. The Premier of Victoria has the audacity to say that he's glad that we put $420 million in our budget for the Scoresby Freeway, because he can now seek to persuade us to spend it elsewhere. That is what he said. I can only emphasise that we are committed to building that freeway. We have fully funded it in our forward works program.I was very interested in Victoria's claim - and I think this is an important point that should be pursued - that the toll was needed to urgently fix Victoria's bottom line. When I went back to look at our understanding with Victoria, I found that their first commitment to a down payment on this freeway was to have been 2008. So they now have to have a toll to urgently fix their broken bottom line by charging for a freeway - which we will not agree to; I want to stress that - but they were not to pay anything until 2008 anyway. The Premier of Victoria has accused us of turning this into a political football.Despite that memorandum of understanding, despite breaking their own promise, I just want to say that tonight there is a challenge for the Leader of the Opposition with this sort of budget integrity. He has to clearly set out: does he support tolls being put on Scoresby; does he think it is okay to break a commitment, a MOU, signed in this way; whose side is he on - his mate Steve Bracks or the people of Melbourne? Tonight in his budget reply the Leader of the Opposition must declare that the federal Labor Party joins with the government in insisting that Victoria revert to its promise, to its signed, sealed but not delivered commitment to the people of Melbourne to fund that freeway. </DOC>

 - I cannot confirm that because, as the transcript of the National Press Club shows, I said some will argue that they are not generous enough and some too generous. It is in the National Press Club transcript. - If the Leader of the Opposition would listen: `not generous enough' or `too generous'. That is what we said at the National Press Club. The transcript was put out yesterday, and I have already alerted the Daily Telegraph to the transcript. Some people have said that we should not have cut taxes, some people have. The Australian Council of Social Services said that we should not have cut taxes.   - The member for Hasluck just agreed with the Australian Council of Social Services that we should not have cut taxes. Some people have argued that we should not have cut taxes. Our view, as we said - after funding our expenses, after making sure that the budget was in surplus and after reducing Labor's net debt by $63 billion - is that the taxpayers deserved a return. Would taxpayers prefer a tax cut to no tax cut at all? Yes, they would. Would they prefer a larger tax cut to a smaller tax cut? Yes, of course they would.Why did we fix on $2.4 billion as the amount of the tax cut? We fixed on that because that was consistent with meeting the government's obligations in relation to Iraq and to security, with bringing in a balanced budget and having a return to all taxpayers. That $2.4 billion could have been distributed in different ways. It could have been distributed as a tax cut to a particular class - a larger cut for a smaller class - but we chose to give every Australian income taxpayer an income tax cut and, as I have already indicated to the House, that works out in percentage terms better for those earners in the lower income brackets than for those in the higher income brackets. All of this can be resolved quite easily. If the Australian Labor Party believe tax cuts in this budget should have been larger, they will announce their tax cuts tonight and then we will cost them.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Herbert not only for his question but also for his very strong advocacy for James Cook University, supported equally by the member for Leichhardt. In the budget on Tuesday night, the government announced a significant reform which will build Australia's future in higher education. There will be a $1.5 billion investment in higher education over four years - $10.6 billion over 10 years - and one of the significant features of that will be the focus on Australia's regional universities. Those who live in Townsville or Cairns or any one of the regional centres in this country know just how important universities are to regional economic and social development. This package for regional universities, including the James Cook University, includes many things. It includes a 7½ per cent increase in Commonwealth grants scheme money over the first three years and $122.6 million of regional loading. The James Cook University, for example, at its Townsville, Mount Isa and Cairns campuses, will receive a 7½ per cent loading. There are some 7,550 scholarships for students from regional and rural areas, worth $16,000 each, to support them in accommodation. Regional universities will also have access to 7.1 per cent more money to train nurses and send them to hospitals for their training.  In addition, there is a 9.7 per cent increase in funding, worth some $81 million over four years, for teacher education to send young people from regional universities into classrooms. There will also be a $20 million structural reform package which will assist, in particular, regional universities. I will be adding to that $16 million from the Higher Education Innovation Program pool. That will be $36 million in total to assist regional universities to work much more closely with local industries and businesses. We want much more co-location with TAFEs and senior secondary colleges. Also included in the package are 936 medical places specifically targeted at students who will be required to go out and work in regional and rural Australia -  - and in outer metropolitan areas, as the member for Dunkley and the Deputy Prime Minister remind me. For James Cook University the critical initiative in this budget includes a formal affiliation between the Australian Institute of Marine Science and James Cook University. The government is committing $5 million to assist this process, because the future in regional Australia, as traditional industries and commodities change so much, lies in education and new ideas. The aquaculture industry, which is now worth $750 million to Australia, will significantly benefit from the sharing of resources - of equipment, personnel, teaching and research expertise - between what will be the Australian Institute of Marine Science at James Cook University and the Cooperative Research Centre for the Great Barrier Reef, ToxiTech, the spin-off companies and the multiple industries that will now thrive and grow around this new collaboration.In conclusion, many things have been said by members of the opposition over the years in relation to higher education. A number of opposition members I know - at least from things that they have said publicly, if not privately - would be very supportive of these initiatives. This is about Australia's future. I ask members of the opposition to seriously consider the full depth and breadth of what the government is proposing for Australian higher education. If they require more information, I would be more than happy to make my officials available to them. This is in the interests of the future of our country and our regional universities, in particular. I will be very interested to hear this evening what plans the Australian Labor Party has for the future of Australian higher education.</DOC>

 - I have to confirm that I was not particularly aware of the situation in your electorate. I will take your word for it - I assume it is right. - There are a couple points I would make. Firstly, there is in that the implicit assumption that somehow the reforms we are undertaking will push up the cost of visiting a doctor. I do not accept that, the government does not accept that and I note that quite a few medical practitioners are now saying there is no justification for that position or that argument. Amidst all these cries about what the Commonwealth government commits to health, it ought to be remembered that total outlays on health have increased since we got into government. The Treasurer will correct me if I am wrong, but I think they are up by around 65 per cent. That is a significant rise indeed. In relation to the Medicare reforms, I can only repeat what I said on the Sunday program a little while ago: they are very sound structural reforms which will help secure the assistance that the less fortunate in our community will need in the future and at the same time keep the whole thing sustainable - which obviously is the objective - in terms of health costs and accessibility in the future. I simply do not accept the proposition put by the honourable member. In regard to the value of the tax cuts, I would just take a bird's eye view of it for a moment and make the observation that it is pretty remarkable to have got to the point where the Treasurer has been able to confirm another surplus, with tax cuts, at a time of international economic slowdown and serious drought, with attendant costs for the government both in terms of lost income and direct outlays, having been able to cover the cost of the recent international action and the increased costs of security and defence that have arisen out of our experiences there.The other point that has not been drawn out clearly enough is the direct relief to taxpayers of the reduction in the debt of $4½ billion that was left behind by the previous government. Calculate that into all of your figures and see what sort of parameters the Labor Party would have been operating in if they were still in power when it comes to room to move on tax cuts. They would have been even more illusory than the old l-a-w law tax cuts.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question and note her very real interest in this, and the interest of many of the people in her electorate. I also acknowledge that there are many other members in this place who have a very real interest in this industry - the member for Dawson, the member for Leichhardt and others. - I hear the Leader of the Opposition guffawing and saying that all we have done is put in place the measures that they have been calling for to restore confidence in the industry. I ask a rhetorical question, and I might come back to this in a moment: who was it who undermined confidence in the first place? Coming to this morning's meeting, it had a very successful outcome. We had all major stakeholders present: the ministers for the environment, trade, agriculture and industry; the four oil majors; Woolworths and Trafigura, as the main independent distributors of fuel; the automotive industry; the motoring organisations; the service station associations; and the existing producers, CSR and Manildra, as well as several potential producers. All parties readily and firmly agreed that ethanol has a part to play in the Australian fuel equation in the future. There was unanimous agreement that the government's measures, including labelling and a 10 per cent cap on ethanol blends and the nine-year program of industry assistance announced in the budget, have provided a secure legislative platform upon which the industry could build. All parties also indicated their willingness to work together and to work with the government on a program to restore public confidence in ethanol as an automotive fuel, and a task force has been set up representing all of the stakeholders to plan specific measures to restore confidence in ethanol. That task force will report back to me in a matter of weeks. That restoration of confidence was acknowledged as important by all stakeholders because of the damage that was done to ethanol's reputation in the Sydney market in particular over the Christmas period. That damage was caused by sensational but, as it turns out, totally inaccurate reporting about ethanol damaging car engines. We now know that those stories had no basis in fact. We also know how they came about. They came about because of a grubby political campaign mounted by the Labor Party. - It has a little bit to do with the Treasurer's opposite number. We are indebted to Paul Sheehan of the Sydney Morning Herald for exposing Labor's grubbiness and its real motives. His story of 28 April exposes what really happened. - It is a very interesting story. If it is such an unreliable source that you want to cast doubts on it, you show us it is wrong. - Paul Sheehan interviewed Mr Neil Streeting. He was the auto repairer at the centre of a story which supposedly was about a car that had suffered thousands of dollars worth of damage from using ethanol. In fact, the car suffered the damage because there had been kerosene in the fuel, not ethanol at all. Mr Streeting never claimed that it was damage caused by ethanol. So how did this happen? Mr Streeting told Paul Sheehan the story - and this is a pattern we have heard of before in this place. The article says:... he got a call from the office of a federal Labor MP in Sydney asking if he'd encountered problems caused by contaminated fuel.Mr Streeting said:I told her, `Yes, I'm working on a car right now that has been damaged by contaminated fuel.' I never mentioned the word `ethanol'.He went on:She asked if I would talk to the media. Like a ...I will not repeat the word but it is an eight-letter word referring to somebody with an unattractive head - ... I said yes. I got a call from the Herald within an hour.So it was not the newspaper who found the story; it was not Mr Streeting who raised public concerns; it was the Labor Party trawling around trying to make a story out of nothing to damage an industry and to pursue a grubby political campaign. It is interesting to note that this automotive expert, who was widely quoted and acknowledged to be an expert in this place, was also asked what he really felt about ethanol. He told Paul Sheehan:I've got nothing against ethanol. It's a good fuel. It's good for the country.And how does he feel about his involvement in this story? He says:It was all a political set-up. It took me a while to work it out, but I realised this was all about Labor bashing the Liberals.Indeed it was, and well might the shadow Treasurer, frankly, hang his head in a bit of shame over this. - He does not? I understand that he might have since apologised to the chairman of the Manildra Group, who employs a lot of people in the electorate of the honourable member who asked the question. But I tell you what: he has not apologised to this House and nor has he apologised to the thousands of consumers to whom he caused a great deal of unnecessary concern. He ought to apologise. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Isaacs for her question. I indicate to her and assure her constituents that what this government is doing is about strengthening the Medicare system and strengthening the health system in Australia. The announcement made by the Prime Minister and the health minister recently that we were putting an extra $917 million into Medicare and the health system in Australia shows that we are, in fact, strengthening the system for all constituents of all electorates right throughout this country.We have increased expenditure on Medicare by $2 billion - from $6 billion to $8 billion - we have put $560 million into providing more doctors in rural areas of Australia and, in areas like hers and beyond in the south-eastern suburbs of Melbourne, we have put in an extra $80 million to encourage more GPs into those areas. There are measures in which there are incentive payments of up to $22,000 for doctors to provide bulk-billing for the seven million Australians who have concession cards. That is an absolute strengthening of the Medicare system in Australia. For those who live in her electorate, under these measures - if the Labor Party will get behind and pass them - it will mean that, when they go to a doctor, they will have their rebate refunded to the doctor at that stage. That will be the last time they will need to worry about that -  - rather than having to fund the rebate and queue up at a Medicare office - in the future. I would say that the electors of Isaacs and those right around Australia will certainly welcome this measure to ensure that, when they go to the doctor, their rebate is paid to the doctor there and then. They will not have to waste their lunchtime or the time in which they would otherwise be picking up their kids. In that way, they will get that repayment made at that time. In addition to that, we are making more doctors available through the measures that were announced and repeated today by the minister for education, and also by the additional places in terms of training for GPs.Overall, this is a AAA approach to Medicare and the health system in Australia. It is about making Medicare more affordable for those seven million concession card holders. It is about making Medicare more accessible for those people who will only have to go to the doctor and not then queue up at the Medicare office. It will be more available for people because there will be more doctors and more nurses in Australia.</DOC>

 - As the member for Maranoa says, this government is taking an approach to Medicare which will make it more affordable, more accessible and more available. It will be more affordable because of those payments of up to $22,000 for GPs in areas like those in the electorate of Maranoa, which will be an encouragement for them to provide bulk-billing to some seven million concession card holders throughout Australia. So Medicare will be more affordable under this government and these measures.Secondly, it will be - as the member for Maranoa says - more accessible. As I said before, in my answer to the previous question, when ordinary Australians go to their doctor under this system they will be able to leave the surgery with no more to do and no more to pay. They will not have to go and line up at a Medicare office, as they do at the present time, under these new proposals.Thirdly, Medicare and health care will be more available because of the $295 million in the long-term development of our health care work force - the funding of another 234 public medical school places, the increase in the annual intake of 150 GP training places for GP registrars and the funding of more practice nurses right throughout Australia.So, in the context of this budget, this is a substantial increase in Medicare and health funds from the Commonwealth government - an increase, as I said, of some $917 million. In 2003-04 the Howard government will have increased health expenditure by some 65 per cent. It has done that - as the Treasurer and the Deputy Prime Minister have pointed out - against a backdrop of low debt levels, paying off Labor's debt, military commitments, the drought that has afflicted so much of this country, and also the tax cuts that are being delivered by the Treasurer. I am asked by the honourable member for Maranoa: are there any alternative policy approaches? There is an alternative policy approach that has been floated by the Australian Labor Party. - On 4 February this year the state Labor health ministers were floating their alternative health policy. They said that 60 per cent of private health insurance cover payouts were wasted on ancillary benefits, not mainstream health care services. So what we have is the state Labor health ministers saying that ancillary cover benefits and the rebate related to those is wasted payment. They said 60 per cent; in fact, the private health breakdown is about 30 per cent of payments for ancillary benefits - about $660 million. But what are these ancillary benefits paid for? The majority of them - 50 per cent - are paid for dental services; for optical services, about 17 per cent; and, for physiotherapy services, about seven per cent.So what we have state Labor health ministers saying to the people of Australia who have taken out private health insurance with ancillary cover is that, if you have that ancillary cover so that you can take your kids to the dentist when you need to, that is a waste. That is what the Labor Party is saying: `That's a waste.' If you have private health insurance cover with ancillary benefits so that you can take your child to a physiotherapist when he or she falls over playing sport - playing netball or Auskick on Sunday or Saturday morning - the Labor Party is saying, `That's a waste.' Also, the Labor Party is saying that, if you have ancillary cover that enables an elderly person to go to the optometrist because they want to be able to maintain their sight and continue to drive, that is a waste. That is what the Labor Party is saying: `That's a waste.' If you need to take your child to optical services so that that child can better read and write and improve their education, the Labor Party is saying, `That's a waste.' That's what you want to cut out. We are waiting to see tonight if this $660 million worth of ancillary services, and the private health insurance rebate which relates to it, will be chopped under these proposals from the Leader of the Opposition. That is effectively a tax slug of $230 on Australian families for the ancillary component alone. But we know that many members of the Labor Party want to go further than that. We heard on the radio this morning the member for Fremantle, the member for Denison and Senator George Campbell agitating for the abolition of the entire rebate. They do not want a tax hike of just $230 for Australian families who have private insurance with ancillary coverage; those members of the Labor Party are agitating for a $750 tax hike for ordinary Australian families.So it will be interesting to see what is announced tonight. We will wait and see. Earlier this year we had the member for Perth speculating on an increase in the Medicare levy - a tax hike. We have now had this speculation about abolishing the private health insurance rebate - another tax hike. What we will see tonight will provide a clear choice for the people of Australia: the $2.4 billion worth of tax cuts which were announced by the Treasurer on Tuesday night or the tax hikes which are going to come from the Leader of the Opposition this evening.</DOC>

 - Again, the government and I do not accept the proposition that the changes we have introduced will push up the cost of visiting a doctor - as is being, I believe, wrongly claimed. But whilst I think the question has been appropriately answered, and I think it would be incumbent upon the opposition to try to draw out something of greater interest and greater relevance -  - Because the question has been answered, I think it is worth while making a few general remarks about the wellbeing of Australian families to put this into context. By linking the costs of medical attention with tax cuts, the opposition is implying that we need to look at the totality of the picture - that is, what it is that adds up to the wellbeing of Australian families. So it is worth recapping a few points. In the seven and a bit years that we have been in government the number of unemployed has been halved. Wages are up 12 per cent in real terms. Disposable income - money available to Australians - is up 12 per cent. In contrast, I remember a time when those opposite were advocating a reduction in real wages. Interest rates are way down, and if that does not help families, I do not know what does. The burden of Commonwealth debt - a millstone around taxpayers' necks - is down as well. That is $4.4 billion of debt that taxpayers will not have to support in Commonwealth interest bills in this year alone. When you add all of that together it clearly establishes that the Labor Party could not have responsibly afforded tax cuts. They would have been as illusory as the l-a-w tax cuts. Furthermore, I cannot see for the life of me - and I do not believe the Australian public would be able to, either - how Labor would have continued paying for Medicare, with the sort of debt millstone it was building. There would have been big tax increases - which the Minister for Ageing, who spoke previously, referred to - in the form of the Medicare levy going up or there would have been slashing and burning -  - Yes.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Forrest for his question and for his strong interest in the area of industry and resources. He does an excellent job in chairing the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry and Resources.Tuesday night's budget provided over $¼ billion in new funding for industry initiatives to further promote growth in this very important sector. The budget package was strongly welcomed by the Australian Industry Group, which summed it up by saying, `A big thumbs up for the budget.' In that package, the government has doubled its investment in R&amp;D for the pharmaceutical industry with a new $150 million package -  - You don't even know your lobby groups. - Sorry, Mr Speaker. - Mr Speaker, a $150 million package was made available to the pharmaceutical industry under the Pharmaceuticals Partnerships Program, P3. The program will drive about $½ billion of new investment in the pharmaceutical R&amp;D industry and will obviously assist in keeping the industry internationally competitive. The pharmaceutical industry group, Medicines Australia, responded to this initiative by saying that the P3 project is integral to `positioning the industry to deliver on job creation, exports and Australian research' - again, more jobs for Australia.In the resources sector - and I know the member for Forrest will be particularly interested in this - the government announced some $61 million in extra funding for Geoscience Australia to increase the amount of scientific research and exploration conducted in this country. This is to particularly target new, frontier areas where seismic data is scarce. This will encourage greater economic activity in one of our major resource industries and has been praised by the industry group APIA as being `a vital step to enhancing the attraction of Australia as a place to invest'. An additional $41 million was also allocated to the R&amp;D Start program to ensure the completion of R&amp;D projects awarded grants under this current Start program. This budget is a good budget for industry; it is a good budget for the economy; and it is a good budget for Australia. </DOC>

 - The answer to the first part of the question is, of course, no. The budget confirms and funds the Commonwealth's offer to the states of a new five-year Australian health care agreement. It does not cut funds but proposes an additional $10 billion over the current agreement - an increase of 17 per cent. Further, in relation to its offer to the states, the government has asked the states to match that increase, and the full amount is conditional on the states doing so. Let me also make a point in relation to the second part of the question. The public hospitals are managed by the states and not by the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth offers financial assistance to the states in respect of the running of them, and it is offering $42 billion over the next five years.In relation to the last point, it is true that the government is taking additional measures to increase funding to Medicare. And here lies the nub of the issue. The government is putting an additional $917 million into this scheme. Somehow, in the logic of the Labor Party, if the taxpayer pays more, that will lead to increased fees. If the taxpayer pays more than whatever the fees were going to be previously, the fact that the taxpayer has added to it provides no additional incentive - in fact, one would say it provides less incentive - for fees to be either introduced or increased. This is a decent offer to the states, and we call on the states to match it. It is a decent health funding system that the government is putting in place.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Hume for his question. I know the honourable member for Hume would have noticed in the recent budget announcements that, as a result of the handling and the stemming of the flow of unauthorised boat arrivals, there has been a very significant saving to the budget. In fact, the Treasurer now counts me among his friends, because my department contributed in the order of half a billion dollars worth of savings to the budget. That is a very substantial commitment over the period of the forward estimates, and I am told by my colleagues that it is very welcome. Clearly, we have pursued a strategy that was good for the budget, but it was also good for the nation and, I might say, for refugees in the most vulnerable of situations around the world. I am aware of alternative policies in this area. Indeed, two days ago the shadow minister, the member for Lalor, reaffirmed in this place her commitment - and I am not surprised that she did so - to Labor's policy document on asylum issues and immigration generally. I am sure honourable members will remember that on 12 December 2002 I spoke on these matters in the House, and I went through the nature of the commitments that were being made in that document. They included: very significant changes to the overall migration and humanitarian intake; costs for alternative detention arrangements; monitoring failed asylum seekers; a refugee status determination tribunal; TPV access to settlement services; an increase in core funding to the UNHCR; an inspector-general of detention; a children's commissioner; changes to tax file number systems; green cards; additional staff, particularly for the AFP; an extension of the role of the ambassador for people-smuggling; community hostels; immunisations; expert advisory councils; and a coastguard costing in the order of $600 million. - I am glad that the Leader of the Opposition endorses that policy, because what I want to see from the Leader of the Opposition tonight is whether or not in his statement he is going to take into account the $2 billion worth of expenditure that I outlined in my statement in question time on 12 December. We put it down clearly; we costed for you the figures that were there. The challenge for the Leader of the Opposition, if he is going to be serious about putting forward alternative policies and reaffirming them in this parliament, is to reaffirm them in costed terms and to make a commitment in any alternative budget statement that he puts down before this House tonight. We will watch very closely, because any document that is going to be creditable has to take into account the $2 billion worth of expenditure commitments that you allowed the shadow minister to make.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Moncrieff for his question. This week the government brought down the eighth budget since it was elected in 1996. It is a budget which is in surplus. The other major economies of the developed world are all in deep deficit. The OECD records that countries like Austria, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and the United States are all in deficit. Of the developed countries of the world Australia has one of the strongest budget positions. It was not always like that, because when this government was elected in 1996 the budget was in deficit by $10 billion. The government did not create that problem, but one thing the coalition said when it came to office was that it would solve that problem. Now after putting the budget back into balance one of the things this government can say is that it has reduced Labor's net debt by $63 billion.After balancing the budget, funding Australia's commitment to Iraq, increasing security and providing for health and education, the government was also, in this budget, able to reduce personal income tax. The government believes that, having attended to those expense measures and balanced the budget, taxpayers should have a return in relation to those taxes. The opposition would have you believe that they think these tax cuts are too small; they have their opportunity tonight to announce larger ones. The opposition would have you believe that they think there should be more expenditure; they have their opportunity tonight to talk about more expenditure. They do not have an opportunity tonight to do both: indicate (1) they want to reduce taxes and (2) they want to increase expenses. The Leader of the Opposition has two trucks out there. One truck claims that taxes are too high -  - As I said, this is a government which has managed its expenses and been able to reduce taxes. If the frontbench of the Labor party believe taxes should be reduced more, they will be announcing that tonight. No-one will be watching the budget reply tonight closer than I. - This government has been able to manage its expenses whilst reducing taxes. If there is a proposal that taxes be reduced further, we will hear it tonight, and no-one will listen more carefully to the reply than I will. Well, perhaps the member for Brand will be listening as closely as I will tonight. But besides the member for Brand and me, no-one will be listening more carefully tonight. This government has now reduced unemployment through the creation of over one million new jobs since 1996. Interest rates are at 30-year lows. Inflation is down between two and three per cent, and $63 billion of Labor's net debt has now been reduced. Australia has a budget which is in surplus. Unlike the OECD, our economy continues to grow at plus three per cent. We have an economy which has put Australia in a position to ride out an Asian financial crisis; a US recession; the impact of SARS; the cost of the Iraqi war; the increased insecurity; and the longest, most extensive drought in Australian history. The benefit of strong economic management is that it gives job opportunities to young Australians and it gives low interest rates to those home buyers out there who want to get on with their lives and establish their families. If it had been up to Labor, that would have been opposed. Labor opposed every measure to balance the budget. Labor opposed the reform of the taxation system. Labor opposes industrial relations reform. Labor opposes those measures which are necessary to take Australia forward, and that is why it is a coalition government that will take Australia forward for the people who want the jobs, the people who want the mortgages and the homes, and the people who want a brighter future in Australia.</DOC>

I did not engage in any formal vetting procedure - to my knowledge, that has not been done in relation to any other appointments of Governors-General - for a number of apparent reasons: I was well acquainted with Dr Hollingworth, he was a person who had become a public figure and he had served governments of both political persuasions. I formed a view about his character, and I heard nothing adverse about his character. He was obviously very well known in the circles of the Anglican Church.

 - I thank the honourable member for Fadden for his question. Australia warmly welcomes the UN Security Council's adoption of resolution 1483, which brings to an end 13 years of sanctions against Iraq. This development should lend momentum to Iraq's economic recovery, although it will take time for the business environment to be normalised as the security situation improves and new governance arrangements are settled. The government is moving quickly to formally repeal measures under Australian law that implemented the old sanctions regime. While this process is being completed, companies can trade with Iraq under interim arrangements that have been put in place. We are pleased to see provisions that establish a transparent and internationally credible mechanism for the management of Iraq's oil revenues and enable the smooth phasing out of the UN oil for food program. This will enable a smooth transition to a market based economy and will ensure that this crucial pipeline for humanitarian goods is not prematurely disrupted.Since the oil for food program resumed following suspension as a result of the conflict, Australia has continued to provide the vast majority of Iraq's wheat imports - so far, 400,000 tonnes through the World Food Program. It is good news for Australian wheat farmers that the UN oil for food program has been funded to run for another six months. We are pleased that the resolution unequivocally calls on the international community to assist in humanitarian relief and for the reconstruction and rehabilitation of Iraq's infrastructure. For its part, Australia has already committed $100 million to humanitarian and reconstruction activities in Iraq. Australia has also deployed a range of Australian experts to advise on Iraq's economic recovery, particularly in the field of agriculture.The House should also note that, as part of resolution 1483, new obligations were imposed on United Nations member states to establish a prohibition on trade in or transfer of Iraqi cultural property illegally removed from Iraq since 2 August 1990 and to facilitate the return to Iraqi institutions of such property. The lifting of sanctions is consistent with our longstanding support for a significant, practical and value-adding UN role in Iraq, including in transitional political arrangements.</DOC>

Under our system of government, in the end the appointment of the Governor-General is formally by the Queen but it is on the advice of the Australian Prime Minister. I do not run away from the fact that he was my recommendation to the Queen. I accept full responsibility for the appointment. I will not seek in any way to run away from that. Did I seek counsel?

 - I thank the honourable member for Forde for her question, and I can advise her that both consumer and business sentiment continue to be solid in Australia. The Westpac Melbourne Institute consumer sentiment index increased 1.9 per cent in May to a level about 10 per cent above its long-term average, which the authors of the survey said resulted in a string of positive developments since April, including a higher Australian dollar, share market gains, lower petrol prices and low interest rates. Business sentiment is also resilient, with the National Australia Bank monthly business survey released on 12 May showing that the index moved up one point to a measure of 0.6 - a level that the National Australia Bank says is consistent with ongoing growth in the non-farm sector of around four per cent. The National Australia Bank says that it shows resilience, notwithstanding a weak and deteriorating situation evident in surveys in countries such as the United States, Europe and New Zealand.One of the benefits of the government's economic management over the last seven years has been the reduction in Commonwealth debt from the $96 billion of net debt that the Labor Party left in 1996, which will have been reduced in net terms by $63 billion by the end of this financial year. Because of the reduction in Labor debt, the Commonwealth is now saving some $5 billion in interest payments. When this government was first elected, interest payments on debt were around $8.4 billion; today, they are $3.4 billion. It is an annual saving of $5 billion, which this government is able to direct to assistance for families, for children, for hospitals and for schools now that we are lifting the dead hand of that Labor debt from the community. The Australian economy continues to lead, with a balanced budget brought down two weeks ago and, in addition to that, income tax relief which was also announced in that particular budget, keeping Australia at the forefront of the developed economies of the world.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I know that all of us in this House will be concerned that we, as a nation, take seriously the issue of road deaths. We have made good progress since the 1970s in cutting the road toll, particularly in relation to the kilometres that we travel and the motor vehicles that are on our roads, but in recent times the numbers have plateaued out. In a serious attempt by all governments to try to lower the death rate, particularly amongst young people, I am delighted to inform the House that, at last Friday's Australian Transport Council meeting in Melbourne, state and territory ministers agreed to the general proposition that young drivers be required to undertake further intensive training after they have started driving. The meeting agreed to study experiences here and, more importantly, overseas of methods of improving driver attitude. The joint research and development organisation, Austroads, has been tasked to develop a more detailed program.The program envisaged would provide drivers with a better insight into the risks that they face and their own limitations. Vehicles have proved to be lethal weapons sometimes misunderstood, particularly in the hands of young people. The aim is, of course, to particularly address attitudinal and other problems of young drivers in their understanding of what they are controlling on the roads when they are at the wheel. In a set of figures that I have only recently been advised of, which I think will concern the House enormously, drivers in Australia aged between 17 and 20 are 11 times more likely to die on the roads than those aged between 40 and 49. Some one in three deaths amongst young Australians aged between 15 and 24 is as a result of a road fatality. While the focus on fatigue and the inappropriate use of speed is absolutely right and must be continued, we believe this proposal, properly developed, can help to equip young drivers to become more aware of just how dangerous and risky driving can be. It is proposed that drivers would have to complete their program within six months of first obtaining their licence.I am also delighted to be able to say that the Australian automotive industry, which has received a lot of praise recently for its export performance, amongst other things, can claim a lot of credit for this. It was in this very building that I sat down with some of the CEOs of the Australian automotive industry and this idea emerged. I particularly thank Geoff Polites of Ford for his initial enthusiasm and I thank the Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries and parts of the insurance industry too for getting behind it very strongly. If we can think laterally and do more to better educate our young people who drive on our roads, I believe it is beyond doubt that we can save further casualties, accidents and lives. Every life saved, all of us would agree, would be very worth while.</DOC>

 - I made the judgment then and - as the Leader of the Opposition has done and as others have done - it has been heavily criticised. Given what I knew at the time and what had been put to me not only by the Governor-General but also publicly and also having regard to the fact that on the evidence available to me - and I do not think that has been subsequently disputed - the person in question did not reoffend after his entry into the priesthood, I took the view that an error of judgment alone, serious though it was, in an earlier occupation, was not sufficient grounds to warrant his dismissal. That was the decision I took then. I believed it to be right then. I still believe that that decision was right. That formed the basis of the judgment I made, and repeated recently: that he had not behaved in a way, during his tenure of the office of Governor-General, to warrant his dismissal. That was a judgment and, like all of our judgments, we stand by them and we are accountable for them before the bar of public opinion. I repeat: that was my judgment. People criticised me for it, people will question me for it; they are entitled to do that - as the Leader of the Opposition is doing today, and that is his right - but that was my judgment. I stand by it and I also stand by the earlier statement about the price that he paid. That bears nothing at all upon the obvious price paid by the victims of child abuse. They are two quite separate issues. But it does not alter the fact that a judgment was made at the time and I stand by that judgment.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Mitchell for his question and his very strong commitment to the University of Western Sydney. His enthusiasm for higher education is matched, if not exceeded, only by his commitment to the 70 per cent of young people who do not go directly from schools to university, instead going to TAFE apprenticeships and work. The government announced in the budget a transformational package of reform for Australian higher education to drive the nation's economic and social development. It includes $1.5 billion of extra public funding in the first four years and $10.6 billion extra public funding in the first decade.The response to the package has been generally very supportive. For example, Professor Schreuder, President of the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee - and these are the men and women who live and breathe Australian universities, who have committed their entire lives to the very best that Australian higher education can offer - said that it was:... now critical that the Parliament legislate to adopt this comprehensive policy and funding transformation package to create an internationally competitive system of universities, diverse by missions but excellent in outcomes. On 15 May, the Australian, in editorialising, said:The idea of change might frighten some academics but Dr Nelson's reforms offer them a unique chance to help their institutions grow and prosper. It is a chance that all who believe Australia needs a world-class university system must embrace.The Australian Financial Review on the same day said in part:The reforms offer the universities the chance of a richer and more fertile future. They should grab it and the Senate and the states should not stand in their way.In the Age on 22 May, Professor Peter Doherty, a Nobel laureate with one of the finest academic and scientific minds this nation has produced, said:After a process of wide consultation, our democratically elected Government has spoken on the issue of funding higher education. The Brendan Nelson recommendations offer a way out of what was rapidly becoming a national disaster.The three critical messages that the government is delivering in Australian higher education are, firstly, that it is investing another $1½ billion of hard-earned Australian taxpayers' money in Australian universities; secondly, that it is increasing the number of places that are available for Australian students - the number of HECS places will increase by 31,500 in the first five years, including fully funding 25,000 marginally funded over-enrolled places; and, thirdly, that, for the first time, the government will make student union membership voluntary. The government will expand the HECS system so that no student will pay any kind of fee when they get to the university gate; instead, they will pay it only when they leave university as a graduate earning, on average, $622,000 more over a lifetime. For the first time, for the fewer than two per cent of students in Australian universities and for those who choose to go to the 84 private higher education institutions, the government is prepared to offer those students a loan that they will pay back only when they graduate. Absolutely no student - or, indeed, their parents or families - will be required to find the money when they get to the university door.</DOC>

 - In response to the member for Barker, let me say that this is a government which encourages employing people, not retrenching people. This is a government which wants people to earn more and to keep their jobs rather than to lose their jobs. I am aware that the ACTU has now launched a test case before the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to double the standard redundancy entitlements from eight to 16 weeks, to extend redundancy entitlements to casual workers for the first time and, worst of all, to extend redundancy entitlements to the employees of small business for the first time. There are more than half a million small businesses in Australia which employ people. That is half a million small businesses that face the spectre of significantly increased contingent liabilities if this claim goes through.Every small business with an employee of more than six years standing faces a contingent liability of more than $6,000 per person if this claim goes through. As everyone in small business knows, if you cannot afford to let people go, you cannot afford to take people on. How can the ACTU say that it supports the workers of Australia when it makes it so difficult for businesses to employ more workers? To their great credit, the Queensland and Western Australian Labor governments are refusing to support the ACTU's claim to extend automatic redundancy entitlements to the employees of small business. Successful Labor leaders understand the value of statesmanship. They understand the value of trying to look at the national interests. I commend their example to the gentlemen opposite.</DOC>

 - The answer is no, no, no. I will deal with each question. Firstly, with regard to the damage to the office of Governor-General, I prefer the judgment of the most successful Labor leader in Australia - namely, the New South Wales Premier - who on radio this morning poured scorn on the idea that the matters surrounding Dr Hollingworth had damaged the office of Governor-General. In fact, I would venture the view that the way in which things have transpired has indicated the resilience and flexibility attaching to the office. So, far from it being manna from heaven for those who would want to change the system, it demonstrates one of the great strengths of the existing system - whether it is a monarchical or republican model. I might interpolate there that the New South Wales Premier's post-November 1999 view is still a republican view, but it is a view that says, essentially, that the office should be filled in precisely the same way as it is now under a republican model. I think the views of Bob Carr, who is the most successful Labor leader in Australia, are worth a bit of examination by the Labor Party.The second question was whether I have stonewalled. You refer to a press conference in which, if you examine the press conference, I made clear my total distaste and repugnance for child abuse - absolutely, totally and without equivocation. I was merely, in answer to one question, observing what there had been under the old New South Wales Crimes Act. I had learnt the Crimes Act when I was at law school, as I was enjoined to do in order to pass the exam. I remember the provisions of the act and I was drawing attention to those. As to my views on child sex abuse, through you, Mr Speaker, it is one thing to attack, as you have done, the handling of this issue by the Governor-General politically, as you have of me - and you are entitled to do that; I am fair game politically - but I want to make it very clear to those who sit opposite that I reject totally, utterly and with a great deal of energy any suggestion that I am soft on child abuse. Any suggestion that the Australian Labor Party, who sits opposite, occupies some kind of moral high ground on the behaviour of people in public life when it comes to these matters is wrong. Let us be sensible on this issue. Let us understand that dealing with something as repugnant as child abuse ought to be something that transcends the political divide. Don't you try to grubbily drag -  - I apologise to you, Mr Speaker. I say to the opposition, through you: if you are really concerned about child abuse, do not try to divide it on political grounds. I do not question your repugnance at and detestation of it. I do not contest the repugnance of the opposition towards child abuse. I do not question the repugnance of the Leader of the Opposition towards it, and I would invite those who sit opposite not to question the motives of those who sit on this side of the House or they might be reminded of some failures in relation to former colleagues.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dawson for her question and recognise her very keen interest in the prospects of significant improvement, particularly for the export of sugar from her electorate, if we successfully negotiate a free trade agreement with the United States. To the first part of the member's question: members on both sides would be pleased to know that the second round of negotiations conducted in Hawaii last week have gone extremely well. Significant progress has been made, particularly right across all 17 working groups that have been established as part of this negotiating process. Those working groups have now mapped out a course of action for the rest of 2003, which hopefully will see us achieve our stated objective of concluding the negotiations by the end of this year. Negotiators now have a much clearer understanding of respective positions on both sides, and the next round of negotiations will take place in July, again in Hawaii, and will focus on the substantial market access negotiations.The member asked why the government is pursuing this free trade agreement with the United States. We are pursuing it because we want to see better opportunities for Australia's exporters in getting better access into the largest economy in the world. The United States is the largest economy in the world. This negotiation will not be easy, but we see significant benefits - benefits for not just the Australian beef industry, not just the Australian sugar industry and not just the Australian dairy industry but also for manufactured products. -  - The members interjecting will be pleased to hear that we are also going to try to get better access into the United States market for shipbuilders like Incat in Tasmania, who would very much like to see removed barriers such as the Jones Act that limit their access into the United States market.The objectives we are pursuing are as follows: we want to eliminate tariffs; we want to remove barriers to trade such as tariff rate quotas; we want to remove barriers to the export of Australian ships; we want to reduce impediments for Australian service suppliers; we want to see opportunities enhanced for the temporary entry of business people and their families into the US out of Australia. It is important to note that we will ensure as part of these negotiations that we do not impair Australia's ability to meet fundamental policy objectives. To that end -  - The member for Rankin and many other members opposite should note what has been stated on a number of occasions by the United States chief negotiator, Ralph Ives. He has said, `We are in no way going after the PBS.' Now the Labor Party still cannot get the message. They cannot understand simple English: they are not going after the PBS. He has also said on another furphy that the Labor Party are trotting out about local content rules -  - Ralph Ives said, `We are not seeking, as some in Australia have indicated, to abolish the broadcast quota or the subsidies that underpin that. Let's make that clear.' The American side have made that clear on two very important public policy issues - two public policy issues that have got the Labor Party all excited. The opposition, by not supporting our objective of negotiating a free trade agreement with the United States of America, are turning their back on Australia's exporters - and particularly Australia's farmers, including the farmers that the member for Dawson represents in North Queensland.On this issue, I will leave the last words to two very successful Labor politicians in Australia who do support the government's position on this. I invoke the words of the Premier of New South Wales first. I quote Bob Carr. He said:It is in Australia's interests to link ourselves with the world's most dynamic and creative economy. It's about more than trade, it is about more than investment, and it doesn't rule out Australia's growing economic relationship with East Asia.Secondly, and in conclusion to my answer to this question, I will quote Peter Beattie, the Queensland Premier. He said:A free trade agreement with the United States has my support because it has the potential to offer Queensland exporters unfettered access to a market of 280 million people.The question should be: why won't federal Labor follow Labor in Queensland and in New South Wales and support the government's position on this?</DOC>

 - I have not in the time available - but I will - retrieved a full transcript of that press conference, but to suggest for a moment that I was implying that the onus of proof should be suggested, when I was merely repeating my recollection of what the law said, is grossly unfair. It is quite wrong and really does go beyond the bounds of reasonable debate. Those who sit opposite have got a perfect right to attack me politically on this, but do not in the name of trying to advance your political advantage misrepresent what I said. I will go back to that transcript, and I will look over it very carefully, and I think I will find, as is my clear recollection, that I was merely stating what the law was.  - During that press conference, I think I would have used words to the effect that child abuse made my flesh creep. The member for Gellibrand does not quote that, because it does not suit her advantage to do that.This is the sort of base level to which the Australian Labor Party have sunk. Once again, this genius who sits opposite me as Leader of the Opposition has blown it. Instead of trying to construct an argument based on an error of judgment by the Prime Minister, you start dragging in questions, which he must have authorised, implying that in some way the Prime Minister is soft on child sex abuse. That is what he has done. He is responsible for this and nobody else. Let the Australian public make a judgment today, not on me, not on the Governor-General, but on the Leader of the Opposition.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Riverina for the question. It is especially appropriate that she should ask it because on Friday I announced that exceptional circumstances assistance would be provided to 2,700 dryland, livestock and crop producers in the south-west slopes and plains region, mostly in the electorate of the honourable member. She and many other members of the government have been very concerned about the impact of drought on primary producers and rural communities across the nation. The government has responded in an effective way to ensure that farmers have some assistance through these difficult times.Last week, assistance was extended to 1,800 livestock and broadacre crop producers in the Queensland central coast region, mainly in the electorate of the honourable member for Capricornia. Assistance was also extended to 700 beef, cattle and dairy producers in the state's southern south-east, mainly in the electorate of the honourable member for Blair. This brings to 32 the number of exceptional circumstances applications that the government has now considered. This demonstrates the enormity of the drought - how extensive it has been and how harsh it has been in much of Australia. We have sought to respond quickly. Indeed, these applications have been considered in one-third of the time that it has taken to deal with EC applications in the past. In addition, we have ensured that interim assistance has been available to farmers while their applications are under consideration.As we look to the prospects for the winter ahead, there is still a degree of anxiety about the future progress of the drought. While the Bureau of Meteorology has officially declared El Nino over, that is good news for northern Australia, but those areas are of course coming into their traditional dry season. The prospects for some parts of southern Australia, particularly the grain belts of Victoria and South Australia, have been less encouraging. Indeed, the plantings for the winter crop are way below average. Only in Western Australia has there been any significant planting of wheat, and most of the other crops that have been planted around Australia are now at a critical phase as we look to what the future might bring.Clearly, continued rainfall will be necessary in those areas where some planting has occurred to ensure that the crops are able to reach their potential, but in other areas they are still looking for the first rain to enable planting to occur. I think your own area, Mr Speaker, may be one of those that did rather well over the last couple of days and one in which some planting is starting to occur. That sort of thing is giving encouragement to people in regional Australia, but there are many others with a very tough time still ahead of them.Currently 13,350 Australian families are receiving income support under the federal government's drought assistance programs, and over 3,000 are receiving interest rate assistance to help them with their business costs through these difficult times. Over $133 million has already been paid out - a clear demonstration of this government's commitment to work with farmers to help them through this difficult time. We hope that the season will soon break across the nation and we can return to our traditional levels of profitability, but in the interim the government will stand by our friends in regional Australia and make sure that they have the opportunity to survive the tough times so that they can again prosper in better seasons.</DOC>

 - In answer to the Leader of the Opposition's question, I think it is fair to say that there is a different standard now than in 1993. - There is a different standard obtaining now in relation to how claims of this kind should be dealt with. - Whether it was 1993 or 1983 or 1973, I hold the view that the past practice was the wrong approach, and I made that plain in my statement. I think the contemporary approach is the right approach, but it does not alter the judgment that I made last year - which I continue to hold - that there were not grounds in relation to Dr Hollingworth's behaviour as Governor-General that would warrant my recommending to the Queen that he should have been dismissed. The reality stands. He made a very serious error of judgment. It was an error of judgment that was made by a lot of people in authority prior to then, not only in churches but also in government bodies and in government institutions. It was a different approach. I think that approach was flawed. I have made that very clear. I think the contemporary approach is far better. But, in forming a total view on something like this, you have to have regard to the practices and the circumstances of the time and you have to make a judgment, when you look at a person's conduct, having regard to a knowledge and understanding of that. I think if you do not do that you run the risk of making judgments that are not accurate.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Cook for his question. The Yellow Pages Business Index surveys 1,800 small and medium enterprises in all states and territories. It shows that business confidence remains strong, with 68 per cent of small and medium enterprises feeling fairly or extremely confident in their business prospects. The net confidence balance was plus 54 per cent, down slightly from the February result of plus 55 per cent, but very high by historical comparison. Confidence was highest in building and construction, reflecting the continuing strength in residential and engineering construction activity. Regional businesses continue to report higher confidence levels than metropolitan businesses. That is interesting. I will say that again: regional businesses continue to report higher confidence levels than metropolitan businesses at plus 57 per cent. When you consider the effect of the drought, which would have an effect on confidence for regional businesses, and when you consider the effect of the exchange rate, which many businesses in the exporting business would consider has moved against them in recent times, and the difficulty in the international environment, that is quite significant. Small businesses are always asked as part of this survey what their prime concerns are. Ten per cent said that their prime concern was lack of work, eight per cent said that it was consumer confidence and six per cent, interestingly, said that finding quality staff was their prime concern. The drought was the prime concern of four per cent. Two per cent said that their prime concern was the GST. - The member for Hunter interjects. To my knowledge, he has no plan to roll back the GST. That is a word you do not hear around here very much, do you - the R word? The GST was going to destroy small business as we know it. The interesting thing is that the member for Hunter interjects. I am aware of a small business in the Hunter that is worried about unfair dismissal laws. It is very close to the member for Hunter. It is a hairdressing business, from memory, and it is very worried about unfair dismissal laws but not so worried about the GST, apparently.We were told by the Labor Party that they would surf their way into office on the back of the GST. It was the prime concern of two per cent of those surveyed for the Yellow Pages Business Index. In fact, when asked what was their major concern, 35 per cent said, `No concern.' That was the major response in relation to that survey.As I said earlier, our country faces difficulties. We have a weak international environment, we have the worst drought in 100 years, we have come through a war in Iraq, we have the threat of terrorism, we have SARS in relation to regional tourism and we have an appreciating dollar, which will be of concern to many exporters. But in the wake of all that, the fact that the Australian economy continues to outperform other advanced industrial economies of the world shows the results that can be got from good economic policy. Economic policy is important for small business, and that is why this government intends to continue with strong economic policy in this country.</DOC>

 - I seek indulgence to answer the question. - No, it is not. - The appointment of a governor-general is a personal appointment; it is not a cabinet appointment. That has been the constitutional practice, as I understand it, for a very long period of time. It has been reaffirmed recently by the Prime Minister. It was endorsed by Premier Bob Carr, from memory, during the week -  - and endorsed by Geoff Gallop. It was certainly the practice which was followed by Bob Hawke, Paul Keating and previous Labor prime ministers. The question asked about the statement I made on Channel 10. It was a correct statement about the constitutional provision, which has been reaffirmed recently. I can assure the House of this: the Prime Minister -  - As I said, I can assure the House that the Prime Minister has always abided by the proper constitutional practice. The discussions that I have had with the Prime Minister in relation to vice-regal appointments have covered the pros and cons of such appointments, but I can inform the House that at no stage during our conversation was there anything related to Dr Hollingworth's handling of sex abuse allegations during his time as Archbishop of Brisbane. I can inform the House that that was the case.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dickson for his question and commend him on his continuing interest in matters of national security. The government takes very seriously its responsibility to ensure the safety and security of the Australian community against terrorism. As part of its comprehensive approach to the new security environment, last year it developed a package of strong counter-terrorism legislation, the bulk of which was passed by the parliament in July last year. Included in that legislation were amendments to the Criminal Code allowing the listing of terrorist organisations, subject to strict conditions, including the condition that the terrorist organisation be identified as such by the United Nations Security Council. The requirement that Australia wait for the Security Council to agree with our own assessment of what constitutes a threat to Australians and Australian interests before we can act was an amendment insisted upon by the opposition. The government argued at that time that this potentially created problems where Australia identifies threats that do not interest members of the Security Council. It also pointed out that the UN lists are limited to organisations with links to al-Qaeda and the Taliban.Experience has proved us correct. While we acted quickly to list terrorist organisations under the current listing provisions - 13 have been listed, including al-Qaeda and Jemaah Islamiah - we have not been able to list other organisations which are of equal concern, because of that specific condition. A clear example of this is the Hezbollah external terrorist organisation. The government has been advised by ASIO that there is evidence that this organisation engages in terrorist activity. Indeed, it has been designated a foreign terrorist organisation by the United States and has been proscribed in the United Kingdom. But it has not been formally identified as a terrorist organisation by the Security Council. ASIO has advised that there is no link to al-Qaeda or the Taliban, which means that there is no means for seeking the listing of this organisation by the UN.To address this concern, the government is actively considering amendments to the process of listing terrorist organisations to remove the necessity of relying on the United Nations Security Council. The Prime Minister wrote to the Leader of the Opposition and state and territory premiers and chief ministers two months ago seeking their support for this process. The opposition leader made it clear yesterday that Labor would not support any amendment giving Australia the ability to list terrorist organisations independent of the UN Security Council. The opposition have put politics first by refusing to fix the problem they created in the first instance. - The opposition have indicated that they will support a specific amendment to list the terrorist wing of Hezbollah. The government is concerned that this ad hoc response will not fix the broader problem the opposition effectively created. Also of concern is the fact that, based on current advice, the opposition's proposal gives rise to significant constitutional uncertainty. It is clear that such uncertainty should be avoided, particularly in the area of national security.To be effective, the listing mechanism must enable the government to list terrorist organisations quickly and effectively. The opposition's proposal will not allow this. If other terrorist organisations of security concern to Australia are not on the UN list, separate legislative amendments would be required before these organisations could be listed, and there is no guarantee that this could be achieved quickly or even at all. Taking an ad hoc approach to listing terrorist organisations means that we would not be able to act quickly. - The House should not be fooled by the opposition's purely political suggestion that the government is seeking to put the Attorney-General as the sole arbiter of what constitutes a terrorist organisation in Australia. Those who seriously considered the listing legislation during last year's debate will be aware that under the government's proposal it is the parliament that has the final say - separately, both houses of parliament have the say. The regulations listing terrorist organisations are disallowable by the parliament. The decision to list must be made in accordance with strict legislative criteria and the decision is judicially reviewable. The government's proposal is a constitutionally sound system of identifying and listing terrorist organisations posing a threat to Australians and Australian interests, independent of the United Nations, with a final check in the form of the federal parliament and judicial review. The last thing we want is for terrorists to escape prosecution on the basis of constitutional uncertainty. The opposition should admit it got it wrong. This is no time to play games with the safety and security of the Australian community. I urge the opposition to work constructively with the government to fix the problem it created.</DOC>

 - I am invited to read out the previous answer. I think the question does not raise anything new. If we are both agreed on the need to list terrorist organisations, why don't we agree on the method of doing it? If we are going to do it, let us make it a workable system and not one that is going to be subject to the exigencies of the parliamentary process and when parliament is sitting.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Grey for his question because it is a very timely question. Last Thursday the Minister for Health and Ageing, Kay Patterson, and I, along with the member for Grey and the South Australian minister for Indigenous affairs, went to the centre of Australia. We were with the Anangu Pitjantjatjara Lands Communities, where we have agreed to work cooperatively under the Council of Australian Governments' initiative to improve outcomes for Indigenous communities. This is the third site and the third such agreement under the COAG arrangements. The first initiative was in Cape York in Queensland; the second was in the Wadeye region - I think that is better known around the community as Port Keats in the Northern Territory. Both of those initiatives were announced last year. Those initiatives are very important because they enable us to work in cooperation with state and territory governments to develop a new approach so that we can work with Indigenous people in removing the silos that often exist. Decisions are often made by particular departments of the state, the territory or the Commonwealth in relation to programs that might be appropriate but communities have no real say as to whether that is the priority that they wish to see pursued as an initiative that might be best able to assist them and meet their needs. In each case we have a commitment from the Commonwealth and the state or territory governments to work more flexibly. This approach will lead to agreements with communities on the priorities, responsibilities and outcomes.The Indigenous communities, I have to say, are responding well, as the member for Grey would know - he attended with us when this announcement was made. We spent two days in the Pitjantjatjara Lands, the AP Lands, and had the great opportunity of seeing a number of community situations. One of the communities I visited was the community at Ernabella. I had been there some 25 years ago as a young member chairing the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs. I reminded them that I still have in my office in Sydney a rather unique batik -  - Yes, rather unique. The batik that is produced by the Indigenous people at Ernabella is rather unique, reflecting their traditional designs. The important point I want to make, and it is one that I note is being made increasingly, is that there has been a substantial improvement in communities such as Ernabella, where they now have access to electricity, clean water, sewerage, improved housing and a range of other initiatives that are meeting some of their needs. But, while there has been significant improvement in each of these communities over a period, we see the distance that we still have to proceed in working together.I commend my colleagues who have been working on developing this partnership arrangement. It shows that we are listening very closely to what communities are seeking. I notice a lot of commentary coming forward now from people saying, in the context of what has been happening to ATSIC, that there ought to be greater emphasis on working at regional levels. This COAG initiative enables us to demonstrate exactly how that can be achieved. It is a new approach which moves away from the notion that one size fits all. It enables government agencies to deliver within the boundaries of their own programs but with greater flexibility.Secretaries of key government departments and agencies have been meeting, and a secretary of each government department has been nominated to oversight each of the areas in which this COAG initiative is proceeding. In the case of the Pit lands area, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Ageing is responsible. She attended with us while these announcements were made. They were extraordinarily well received in the community. There was a great deal of enthusiasm to work cooperatively with us. I think this is a good news story which people ought to focus on and to recognise will, over time, have a significant impact on advancing the wellbeing and interests of our first peoples.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Gellibrand for the question. It contains a number of inaccurate statements. The first of those is the suggestion that $10 million was diverted from the domestic violence program. It was not. That money will still be spent - that is the reality of it. You divert money when you take money and you do not put it back. That has not been the case. In relation to the other part of the question, you omitted to mention the $10 million program that I announced -  -  - I remind the member for Gellibrand of an announcement I made in Perth earmarking some $10 million of the Stronger Families and Communities program specifically for early intervention strategies to tackle the problem of child abuse. This government introduced the Stronger Families and Communities program, which represented the commitment of an additional $250-odd million over a period of years - additional resources which are going into strengthening families and all of which, in different ways, are designed to tackle the problem of child abuse.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dobell for his question and indicate to the House that earlier this year I announced an additional 8,624 new aged care places to be allocated throughout Australia this year, worth some $185 million in additional recurrent funding for aged care. This week, I was pleased to announce the approval of the regional distribution of these places - some 5,237 residential aged care places, an additional 861 community aged care places and also 550 extended aged care at home places, where nursing level care is taken to people in their own homes. Over the last five years, the Commonwealth has allocated 52,700 aged care places and is well on track to meeting its target of 200,000 places in Australia by 2006.In the planning region covered by the member for Dobell's electorate, there will be 100 new high- and low-care places, 20 additional community aged care packages and 20 of the new, expanded aged care in the home packages. This is part of a planning formula to ensure that there is an equitable distribution of aged care places right throughout Australia. The key priorities in allocating these places - and I should say that the regional distribution details are now available for aged care providers to apply for these places - will be: firstly, ensuring that places become operational within the two years provided by the legislation; secondly, addressing the complex care needs of people with dementia and people requiring respite care; and, thirdly, improving access to services for people with special needs.The allocation of 52,000 additional places over the last five years stands in marked contrast to what has happened in the states vis-a-vis public hospital beds. Indeed, between 1987 and 2000 there has been a reduction in public hospital beds by the states of some 14,000 beds. In New South Wales, where the honourable member for Dobell's electorate is, there has been a closure, a ripping out of the system, of more than 6,000 public hospital beds by the state government. So, in terms of what the Commonwealth is doing for aged care, there are now more than three times the number of aged care places as there are public hospital beds. This is reflected in the growth of aged care expenditure by the Commonwealth. When we came to government in 1996, total Commonwealth aged care expenditure was some $3 billion. In this year's budget, it is expected and projected that total Commonwealth aged care expenditure will have risen to $6 billion.</DOC>

This matter has arisen in discussions between the Attorney-General and a relevant legal officer in the United States department at, I think, the Pentagon. Discussions are under way regarding Mr Hicks. I think at this stage it is not appropriate for me to say anything further other than that, on the basis of what I have been told by the Attorney-General, he is well satisfied with the progress of those discussions, particularly in relation to the position of Mr Hicks in the event of him facing any kind of trial or arraignment in the United States.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Sturt for his question. I can inform the House that, in response to the first report of the Cole royal commission, the government established an interim task force with the job of securing zero tolerance of industrial lawlessness in the building sector. Since September last year, the task force has conducted over 300 site visits. It currently has 34 investigations under way. It has referred some 11 matters to state police and other prosecuting bodies. Thirteen briefs of evidence are in preparation and four prosecutions are currently before the courts, thanks to the work of the interim task force. I should point out to the House that the government is determined to ensure that the rule of law applies just as much behind construction site fences as it does in the streets outside.In response to the final report of the Cole royal commission, the government announced, first, that it will establish a permanent Australian building and construction commission to police the industry; second, that it will seek a separate act governing workplace relations in the building industry; third, that there will be a Commonwealth safety commissioner to ensure that federally funded building sites are models of occupational health and safety best practice; and fourth, and in some ways perhaps most importantly, that all future federally funded construction projects, both directly and indirectly federally funded, would go ahead under the national construction code and implementation guidelines.I should remind the House that the royal commission was set up, in part, in response to claims by the National Secretary of the Construction Division of the CFMEU that criminal elements were infiltrating his union and his industry. The construction industry is a great industry, but it does have a dark side and this government is determined to do whatever it can to deliver a clean and competitive industry that honest workers, honest unions and honest managers need and deserve.</DOC>

The government certainly supports the community standard. The community standard has been in place since 1984. It was supported by the Hawke government and it is supported by this government.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Farrer for her question - a pilot, a musterer, a shearer's cook, a farmer's wife, a mother of three, a university graduate and an example of the rich diversity of members on this side of the parliament. Last week in the electorate of Farrer, I visited a great example of the government's commitment to apprenticeships and training. In ION at Lavington, just outside Albury - a factory that employs 1,150 people, 300 of whom are apprentices and trainees - we have a great example of a manufacturing company producing and exporting automatic transmissions, particularly for Ford.One of the apprentices, who is fairly typical of the young Australians that are benefiting from this government's policies, is 19-year-old Jade Styler. Despite gaining an outstanding result in year 12, and being under an enormous amount of pressure to go to university, she said, `I would rather be an apprentice,' and took up an apprenticeship as an electrical fitter at ION. She is one of the happiest, most fulfilled young people that I have had the privilege to meet.In this budget the government has announced an $8.4 billion commitment over four years to vocational education and training - $2.8 billion specifically for new apprentices and trainees. On budget night I sent out to the state and territory ministers for education and training the government's three-year offer for the Australian National Training Authority agreement. It is $3.6 billion over three years, it represents a 12½ per cent increase in funding and it includes $325 million of growth funding built into the base, which we expect the state and territory governments to match. In addition to that the government is offering $220 million in extra new funding - again, $119 million of which we expect to be matched by the states. That alone will create up to 71,000 extra places in training for young people, Indigenous students, those with disabilities, mature age people and those living in remote parts of Australia.One of the key reforms of this government has been to significantly expand apprenticeships and training. We have also announced a 16 per cent increase in funding for new apprentices, for employers to take on apprentices over the next year and New Apprenticeship Centres in 300 sites to support them throughout the country. There are now 374,000 Australians in apprenticeships and training, almost half of whom are under the age of 25. In the last year, completions - which are very important - increased by 15 per cent to 110,000. One of the key things that drives this government's policies is that our vision of education and training is that every young person should find and achieve his or her own potential, whatever that is. We are determined that young people should know that their choices in apprenticeship, in TAFE and in employment do not in any way mean that their educational choices or their lives are any less valuable than those who take up a university education.</DOC>

 - I can certainly understand that the lady in question certainly is doing it tough. I can understand that. She is doing it tough, and I do not think anyone in this House would deny that someone earning that kind of wage is doing it tough. But I would point out to the member for Prospect that under this government basic award earnings have gone up by almost 10 per cent in real terms since 1996 and that under the former government basic award earnings actually fell. They fell five per cent in real terms during the life of the former Labor government.The other point I would make in response to the member for Prospect is that a lady on that wage with those family circumstances would be receiving a very large amount of money through the welfare system out of the social security budget. That is as it should be. This government has on a number of occasions - through the family tax package, through the new tax system - done more for families with children. - This government is doing everything it can to help the low-paid workers of Australia. It has delivered more jobs, it has delivered higher pay and in the most recent budget it delivered lower tax.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Barker for his question. Salinity is indeed one of Australia's greatest environmental problems. It destroys our agricultural land and it can make the water in our rivers undrinkable. It is this government, the Howard government, which has led the way in combating this scourge that affects hundreds of thousands of hectares throughout Australia. It is currently polluting our rivers and holding out the threat that the water to Adelaide in the Murray River will be undrinkable two days out of five by the year 2020.The National Action Plan for Salinity and Water Quality is a plan which recognises that neither the salinity issues nor the broader environmental issues of vegetation, land clearing or biodiversity will be solved unless the communities themselves take ownership of the problem. That is what this government has put in place through the national action plan. The national action plan is based on extensive consultation with rural communities around Australia - developing the priorities for those communities in land clearing, in the preservation of biodiversity and in water quality to make the investments actually do the job. - The essence of the national action plan is the $1.4 billion that government is investing - $700 million from the Commonwealth and $700 million from the states. - Alongside that is the $2.7 billion Natural Heritage Trust and the Living Murray program, which is being implemented through the Murray-Darling Basin Commission, which this government put in place two years ago - a long time ahead of any plans from the other side of the House.  - The government has put in place the most comprehensive environmental rescue package that this country has ever seen. Since 1995-96, through the Natural Heritage Trust, this government has invested some $365 million in the Murray-Darling Basin alone for environmental rescue. In the coming year, we will be spending almost twice as much as we spent last year through the National Action Plan for Salinity and Water Quality - some $114 million. I venture to say that no continental scale effort of this kind has ever been attempted before anywhere in the world, and it is the Howard government which has led the way. We would be spending even more than this on salinity this year if the state governments had not dragged their feet. Indeed, the Western Australian Labor government has still not signed up to the National Action Plan for Salinity and Water Quality even though it has one of the most serious salinity problems in this country. - Because of delays in the signing up to these agreements, the government has decided that the national action plan for salinity will be extended by one year to 2007-08 to ensure that the full expenditure of $1.4 billion is made - assuming that Western Australia becomes a member of the national action plan and signs up. All the other states have now signed up. South Australia signed in June 2001, Victoria in October 2001 - a year after the government put the money and the plan on the table - Tasmania in February 2002, Queensland in March 2002, New South Wales in May 2002 and the Northern Territory in February 2003.Despite Labor's claims to the contrary, there have been no cuts whatsoever to the national action plan on salinity. There has been an extension of the program because of the delays by the Labor Party in the states in making the commitments that will solve this problem. This government has galvanised the local communities. It is prepared to work in partnership with the states to get on top of the scourge that salinity brings to our agricultural land and to our rivers.</DOC>

 - Slandering an individual is the form of the Labor Party, and none more so than the member for Melbourne. I do not accept the premise of his question regarding Dr Switkowski's performance or that of Telstra.  - If he measures Telstra's performance against similarly sized telecommunications companies around the world, the honourable member will find that it has weathered the worst parts of the storm better than most other countries. - Of course I am aware of the discussions at Senate estimates yesterday which revealed that the Telstra CEO would receive a payout equivalent to up to 52 weeks of salary if his contract was terminated before it expired. Whilst Telstra is partially government owned, it is an independent corporation and its board is responsible for decisions relating to its commercial operations, including the terms, conditions and remuneration of its chief executive officer. It is the responsibility of the Telstra board to set the remuneration of the CEO on a performance basis, and obviously that is in the best interests of stakeholders. In deciding on a termination payment for the CEO, the board would have taken into account a number of factors, such as the need to secure the CEO, having judged him as the best person for the job.I stand to be corrected on this, but the Labor Party never exercised ministerial direction in its time in government and nor would it, I venture to suggest, exercise ministerial discretion if it ever came to government. If you wanted to wreck Telstra overnight, get the member for Melbourne, the member for Hotham or anyone else on the other side to run Telstra as a business: its market value would collapse instantly. This questioning is a bluff. It is an opportunity to slander an individual and demean a fine Australian institution.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for McPherson for her question and her ongoing interest in all things employment, particularly Work for the Dole. The federal government have committed an additional $375 million over the next three years to employment services to build on what has been a very successful transition from the old CES to the Job Network. We have some 2,500 locations around Australia delivering employment services. That replaces the old 350 CES offices, which were hardly existent in regional and rural Australia. We are giving a guarantee of service to all unemployed for the very first time. There will be some 2,000 electronic kiosks rolled out across the country, giving world's best IT to the unemployed and linking them with opportunities. Regional and rural Australia will have the harvest labour service. In the past, under a Labor government, we had fruit being left unpicked, rotting on the ground. Now we have a service providing opportunities in electorates such as the Riverina and of course in the Mallee. We will have more than 375 job placement agencies, and private organisations will supply employment opportunities through our AJS, providing some 650,000 opportunities to Australia's welfare recipients. We think about half of those will, in fact, be delivered to welfare recipients.The very good budget delivered by the Treasurer some two weeks ago was very well received, particularly in my electorate of Longman. - It is pleasing to hear that the good voters of Bennelong also received it very well. The young job seekers in Bennelong and, for that matter, in all seats will have access for the first time, from 1 July 2004, to job seeker training - three weeks of intensive assistance. Quite frankly, many young people do not have the basic skills they need to present well. In recognising that, this government is bringing that service forward. It is a comprehensive array of employment services, putting real resources in the hands of unemployed people and linking them back into employment.I know that the shadow minister has been going around the country of late saying to people that the long-term unemployment numbers have increased under this government. So, for the benefit of the House, I would like to cite the long-term unemployment figures delivered by the Australian Bureau of Statistics for April. It states that there was, in fact, a fall of 1.2 per cent in the last month; 11.8 per cent over the year; and 31.4 per cent since the Labor government was kicked out in 1996. That is 31.4 per cent or, significantly, 61,900 Australians less in the long-term unemployment figures since 1996. They are the facts.The member for McPherson asked whether there are any alternative policies. I am aware that the Labor Party has been developing a niche employment policy for a very targeted group. I know this for a fact. I know it is important to the shadow minister because he said in this place on 18 March:Unemployment is without question still one of the greatest policy challenges we face.Obviously he is talking about the Labor Party. I know there is a targeted policy because, in the Australian on 20 May 2003, there was a photograph of the Leader of the Opposition discussing, quite clearly, with the member for Grayndler an employment policy issue. They were discussing employment policy issues and the employment prospects of the member for Melbourne Ports, the member for Holt, the member for Calwell and, of course, Senator Collins. These are the only issues of employment that seem to be exercising the minds of those opposite. It is time that the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow minister thought about the unemployed of this country and started to develop real employment policies - as the people on this side of the House have - that will deliver real jobs for Australians.</DOC>

 - The short answer is no; I do not intend to change the Workplace Relations Act. Under the Workplace Relations Act, since 1997 some one million new jobs have been created, there has been more pay and there have been fewer strikes. This government should be judged on its record, and that is an industrial trifecta for ordinary workers: more jobs, higher pay and fewer strikes.Under the government's legislation, workers certainly have a right to seek a particular form of industrial agreement; equally, employers have a right to seek a particular form of industrial agreement. I would like to see more agreements in the workplace, but I will not force people who do not agree to agree. I certainly will not force any business to sit down and negotiate an agreement with the AMWU when the AMWU has organised a picket line that, fairly consistently, has turned violent over the last few days.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Indi for her question. The member for Indi worked in her parents' small business, a corner store, for 15 years. There are plenty of people on the coalition side who have worked in small business but not one current Labor senator has ever worked in a small business. We lament the departure of Barney Cooney. Barney was the last Labor senator to have worked in small business. - That is right, not one of them. The member for Indi knows what she is talking about when she talks about small business. It is no surprise. Small business is the engine room of the Australian economy. It employs 3.2 million people and represents about 25 per cent - a quarter - of GDP. Many of Australia's 1.1 million small businesses are hamstrung by state Labor governments. It is not just me that says that; it is also the Yellow Pages business index survey, which the Treasurer referred to a little earlier. - I am pleased to advise the House that small business support for federal government policies has surged strongly in the last quarter. They say we are generally more interested in small business. That is no surprise, because so many people on this side of the House have worked in small business. They say that we have created a stable economic environment. Ain't that the truth! Australian interest rates are now at their lowest and most stable in 30 years. Small business is challenged by volatile interest rate movement but at no time in 30 years has small business enjoyed such stable, low interest rates. That has a real impact on small business confidence. Small business also recognises that we have formulated good policies. That is damn right! We have formulated excellent policies that have delivered real economic growth for small business.When it comes to the state governments, they have got a different view. According to the survey, small business is very disappointed with the Queensland and Northern Territory governments, but it is no surprise that, when it comes to the Victorian government, there is a marked drop in support. It says that factors such as union influence and workers compensation regulations are hampering small business.An opposition member - Based on what? - The member asks what it is based on. In Victoria, the elimination of the payroll tax exemption for trainees and apprentices will deter small businesses from employing them. That alone amounts to an extra $160 million of costs to small business in Victoria over the next four years. And there is no doubt that the worst performing state government in Australia is the Western Australian government. If you wanted any proof of how detached the Western Australian Labor government is from small business, it is in the fact that one of the biggest complaints of small business is the cost of public liability insurance. The Western Australian government in its last budget increased the tax on public liability insurance -  - So, when every other state government in Australia is trying to -  - reduce the tax on insurance, the Western Australian government is actually -  - increasing the tax on insurance. It is not just that, of course. The industrial relations regime of the Western Australian government is the worst in Australia, and small business is constantly fighting it. It is no surprise at all that, in this small business survey, the Western Australian government is rating around minus 30 per cent in approval. The federal government is committed to working hard for small business. That is because we understand the aspirations of small business. We are creating an economic environment where small business can thrive and, importantly, we are helping to get out of the way of small business so that they can make money.</DOC>

 - I thank the shadow minister for, finally, a question on employment services. You were right on the first three occasions: yes, yes and yes. - Yes, there will be 2,500 sites operating as part of Job Network 3 from 1 July. In addition to that, there are areas of Australia which we identified at the start of this process for which the active participation model probably would not be best suited - areas such as the East Kimberley and the Pitlands, where we will be providing a fee-for-service. That is additional to the 2,500 sites. There were just under 350 sites in the old CES to service the whole of Australia. - That was the Labor Party's response to employment services. I recall your former shadow minister standing in this place, telling us that we had too many sites in too many towns. Can I tell you that what this government is doing is delivering -  - that there will in fact be more Job Network personnel working in the service delivering quality services to Australians in country towns and in suburbs where the service is needed. Furthermore, it will be backed up with the world's best IT. It will be backed up with an additional 650,000 job opportunities provided to unemployed people, which, to date, they have unfortunately been denied access to.This government is delivering, and you need look no further, Mr Speaker, than the unemployment figure of 6.1 per cent. The long-term unemployment figure is coming down: 31.4 per cent. We quote the figure at the height of unemployment, when the then member for Brand was the employment minister, and subsequently, the Leader of the Opposition was the employment minister. Today's figures are close to a 60 per cent reduction on those peaks, when many Australians' only chance of getting work was changing from Labor to Liberal.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. Last night, at a Reconciliation Week function, the documentary Message from Moree premiered in the parliamentary theatrette. Moree used to be a byword for racial tension but, thanks to the passion, commitment and idealism of two people in particular, that town has now become a byword for practical reconciliation. Five years ago most of the Aboriginal people of Moree had never had a real job. Now most of them have enjoyed a real job, thanks to the work of the Aboriginal Employment Service, led by Dick Estens, a Moree cotton farmer, and Cathy Duncan, a public servant turned activist. With the help of $1.2 million provided by my department, the Moree Aboriginal Employment Service has placed more than 400 Aboriginal people in jobs since 1997. This has had the strong support of the local member, the Deputy Prime Minister.My department has committed a further $1.3 million to the Aboriginal Employment Service to continue the work in Moree and, where possible, to extend this work to other towns. The success of the Moree employment service shows that individuals can make a difference - in this case, a determined business leader drumming up jobs and a determined Indigenous leader providing the mentoring necessary to keep Indigenous people in the jobs they have taken. Amidst all the gloom that so often envelops this whole issue of Indigenous advancement, the Moree miracle is a sunburst of hope and optimism, and it shows what can be achieved when government works with the grain of individuals and communities rather than against it.</DOC>

The St Regis hotel was recommended by the post in Rome due to security factors and the hotel's experience with similar delegations, and the Italian government has contributed to the cost of the accommodation for four nights. I would be very interested to see what the figures were in 1994 when Prime Minister Keating and a party of 18 stayed four nights at the Htel de Crillon in Paris, which was then the premier hotel in Paris. If this is the level of intellect and thrust in the opposition, I think Lindsay Tanner was absolutely right when he had lunch with Maxine McKew.</DOC>

I thank the member for Corio for -  - I thank Stewart McArthur for that question. It does give me an opportunity to say that for the first time in many years there is genuine hope of progress being made towards a peace settlement in the Middle East. On behalf - I hope - of every member in this House, I welcome the response of the leader of Israel, Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, and the newly appointed Prime Minister of the Palestinian council, Abu Mazen, and the contributions both of them have made through their in-principle acceptance of the road map for peace in the Middle East. The road map was developed jointly by the United States, the Russians, the United Nations and the European Union. The statements made recently by the Prime Minister of Israel represent a position that many people would not have thought possible a few short weeks ago, let alone a few months ago. He is to be congratulated on the stance that he has taken, and the commitment he has made to the peace process ought to be warmly applauded.Australia - a very long and faithful friend of the state of Israel over a long period of time - will never abandon its support for the right of Israel to exist secure behind internationally recognised and defensible boundaries, but for some years now the government has supported the emergence of an independent Palestinian state. The decision of the Israeli cabinet a few days ago in relation to the recognition of the possible emergence of an independent Palestinian state is also a major landmark upon the hard march to a peaceful settlement in the Middle East. Nobody in this House should underestimate the commitment of the President of the United States to securing a peace settlement in the Middle East. The most enduring message I received in my recent lengthy discussions with him was of his very strong commitment to a peace settlement in the Middle East. Equally, nobody should underestimate the contribution that has been made by the successful coalition operation in Iraq to the progress now being made towards a peace settlement. I said in my address to the House the week before last that the remark made by the British author William Shawcross that the road to a Middle East peace settlement lay through Baghdad could well prove to be one of the most prophetic remarks in relation to the current affairs of this time.The Palestinian-Israeli dispute has been bloody, protracted, tragic and bitter, and the world lives in hope that we can continue to make progress. We should not assume that that progress will be easy and we should not assume that a settlement will be easy to achieve, but we are entitled to be pleased that for the first time in a long time there is a serious attempt being made by both sides at progress. That is no doubt in response to the very admirable and effective pressure being applied by the United States; let us not underestimate the contribution being made by the leadership of President Bush in relation to this. I think we are beginning to see some light at the end of the tunnel. It is a very long tunnel, but I hope it is a journey that everybody will encourage the participants to continue to take in the interests of achieving a lasting settlement to this terrible, historical and disastrous dispute.</DOC>

 - Can I say in reply to the honourable member for Prospect that it is always, of course, possible to make those sorts of comparisons, no matter who the Prime Minister is and no matter what the circumstances are. But there is another comparison you can make, and that is the comparison between the movement in the real incomes of battlers under Labor and the movement in the real incomes of people under this government. No matter who the Prime Minister of Australia is, he or she will travel overseas, and properly so, to represent this country - no matter who the Prime Minister is. Let us face it, nothing is going to be dramatically different in relation to that, if we are all perfectly honest and do not engage in games.What can be different are the economic conditions that you create. I remind you, as the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations reminded you yesterday, that the sort of person you referred to has fared far better under our government than they did under your former administration. The former government used to boast about how they had reduced wages. I can remember the former Prime Minister standing up here and saying, `We have reduced wages during our term in office.' They used to boast about it. They did not boast about the fact that they increased interest rates. They did not boast about the fact that unemployment went to 11 per cent. I would say to the member for Prospect, and any others on the other side who are seeking to make comparisons, that I am happy to make comparisons - comparisons between the treatment of average workers in Australia under my government, which has been far superior, and their treatment under former Labor administrations. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Fairfax for the question and for his interest in the subject of it. As I advised the House yesterday, Australia is currently in the absurd situation that we cannot act independently of the United Nations to list a terrorist organisation posing a threat to Australia and Australian interests. Other countries can decide for themselves which terrorist organisations pose a threat to their citizens and to their interests and they can act accordingly. In fact, we know of no other country whose power to list terrorist organisations is linked to the United Nations. But, thanks to the opposition, Australia cannot act independently of the Security Council. We cannot list the terrorist wing of Hezbollah because it has not been formally identified as a terrorist organisation by the Security Council - this is despite advice from ASIO that there is evidence this organisation engages in terrorist activity and has the capacity to do so globally. This is also despite the fact that the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada have all proscribed the terrorist wing of Hezbollah. To address this plainly unsatisfactory situation, as I indicated yesterday, the government will introduce a bill to remove Australia's reliance on the Security Council.There have been claims that this is a bid to give sweeping powers to the Attorney-General. In fact, the Attorney-General already has power to list terrorist organisations that meet strict legislative criteria. These decisions are disallowable by the parliament and are also subject to judicial review. Under our bill there would be no difference to the scrutiny of the Attorney-General's decision. The only difference would be the removal of the reliance on the Security Council which, under current restrictions, cannot list Hezbollah. Australia will be able to make its own decisions about our national security.The opposition, by acknowledging the inability to list the terrorist wing of Hezbollah, has admitted that its United Nations listing process is flawed but it has still made it clear it will not support a move to make us independent of the United Nations Security Council. In an attempt to cover up its mistake, the Leader of the Opposition has announced his intention to introduce legislation specifically listing Hezbollah as a terrorist organisation directly in the legislation. This is despite knowing that the so-called solution is constitutionally uncertain, to say the least. Legal advice from the Chief General Counsel of the Australian Government Solicitor is that the opposition's proposal gives rise to constitutional uncertainty, which should clearly be avoided in this important legislation.Singling out organisations by name in legislation, without mechanisms to overcome constitutional concerns, could invite challenges to validity on potentially wider grounds than simply lack of power. This constitutional uncertainty could undermine future prosecutions of terrorists, and that is something that the government will simply not accept. We have made our concerns known to the opposition but they seem determined to press ahead with their bill. The opposition's so-called solution also ignores the longer term problem that we will not be able to act quickly or effectively if other terrorist organisations come to light that pose a potential threat to Australia but have not been listed by the United Nations Security Council. While the opposition does not have a solution to these problems, we do. The government will introduce a second bill that will allow the terrorist wing of Hezbollah to be listed in regulations with immediate effect, provided the statutory criteria for listing are met. We are introducing this second bill as we recognise the need to take swift action. That is why we proposed amendments to the opposition and the states and territories some two months ago. We are not prepared to wait for the opposition to wake up to the problems they created and support our first bill, and we are not prepared to risk the constitutional uncertainty of the opposition's proposal. - We are not prepared to wait for the opposition to wake up to the problems they created and support our first bill, and we are not prepared to risk the constitutional uncertainty of the opposition's proposal. Our legal advice is to the effect that our second bill will not give rise to the same constitutional uncertainties that plague the opposition's proposal. The second bill does not solve the longer term problem created by the opposition's UN-linked listing provisions. That is why we are forced to proceed with two bills. This is a serious matter of national security. The government will not allow the opposition's obstinacy and obstruction to paralyse us and prevent us from doing what must be done to ensure the safety and security of Australians. I call on the opposition to put politics aside and support both government bills in the interests of security.</DOC>

 - There is provision in the Migration Act for the minister to consider applications which have been rejected and have been the subject of an appeal to the Refugee Review Tribunal or the Immigration Review Tribunal. It is within his absolute discretion, in the public interest, to consider whether or not a visa should be granted. When that happens, I am required to table certain statements in the parliament, which are available for all to see. The discretion is non-compellable, but there is a requirement that it be exercised in the public interest. I have made it clear over a period of time to members of the parliament generally that, unlike the first minister who had the opportunity to consider these matters, where no exceptional circumstances were ever considered - and unlike his successor, who I think considered about 14 cases, and his successor, who I think considered in excess of 100 - over the seven or eight years that I have been minister I have been more interventionist. That occurs probably in the order of 1,000 -  - It could well be. I would have to say that I have probably intervened in more cases that have been raised by members of the opposition than have ever been raised by members on this side of the parliament. Let me just say that, on many occasions, I have been invited to look at matters by members of the opposition after I have refused intervention. The reason they come to me about those matters is that they believe that there are some other factors that may have changed or may have warranted reconsideration. I think that is a proper basis upon which those matters might be considered. I have no knowledge of the particular matter raised by the member.  - You have! - No, I have no knowledge. I do not remember every case that has been raised with me, and I think it would be unreasonable to expect that I would, in view of the fact that you are asserting that it is probably more than 1,000. I will look at the background to it and assess what the situation was. Finally, let me say that I attend many functions which people pay to enter and where people are involved in fundraising activities. I have no knowledge of the nature of those fundraising activities, I never seek to inquire, and I certainly have no knowledge of the sorts of claims that are being made by the honourable member.</DOC>

 - First, can I thank the honourable member for Pearce - and I thank the Prime Minister for his welcome back - and say that I was in Baghdad, as was the member for Pearce, on 23 and 24 May. This was a very good opportunity to make a first-hand assessment of the situation on the ground in Iraq and also to speak with American leaders and other coalition leaders, as well as Iraqi representatives, in Baghdad. It is clear that in Baghdad there is a continuing security problem, as well as a law and order problem, and I separate the two. The security problem is that there are still some Baathist and Fedayeen elements who are launching sporadic attacks against coalition forces. In addition to that there are, from time to time, attacks by Iraqis on Iraqis and more general law and order problems, such as robbery, looting and the like.I met with Ambassador Bremer, who is the Head of the Coalition Provisional Authority in Baghdad, and emphasised to him the priority that we place on these particular issues being successfully addressed. I can only tell the House that I was impressed with his response about how American military deployments are going to be improved and cooperation with former Iraqi police enhanced. There are now, I understand, some 17,000 or 18,000 former Iraqi police back at work as police and slightly less than half of those police are in Baghdad itself, so this at least is a start. But, of course, I have no illusions about how far there is still to go in terms of both dealing with the security problems and restoring law and orderThe second point I make is that I did take the opportunity of meeting with six of the seven leaders of the so-called Iraqi Supreme Leadership Council. Honourable members, particularly on this side of the House, will be pleased to know that the Iraqi members of the so-called Supreme Leadership Council went out of their way to thank Australia for its active support in the overthrow of the regime of Saddam Hussein and the liberation of Iraq. They underlined the importance they placed on coalition efforts to remove the Baath Party's influence in Iraq. Understandably, these Iraqi leaders are enthusiastic to see a transfer of power to Iraqis themselves, and I can entirely understand and identify with that aspiration. We hope that it will not take too long to identify appropriate senior Iraqis who can form an Iraqi interim administration to work alongside the coalition provisional administration and move towards what certainly the Iraqi leadership council want in the end: elections for a provisional assembly, which would elect in time a provisional government.Let me say in conclusion that I also took the opportunity of discussing the domestic situation in Iraq with leaders in Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Kuwait and also in Iran. In every single case in these countries - which all border Iraq, of course, as some honourable members will know - I made the point that we understood that those countries had a vested interest in stability in Iraq, and I made the point that we hoped they would use their influence to ensure that Iraq was able to develop an inclusive government; inclusive of the major groupings of the country - the Kurds, the Sunni Muslims, the Shiah Muslims and, indeed, other groups. I can tell the House that I was very pleased that in every case - including, by the way, in the case of Iran - the leaders of those countries made it clear that they did want to see an inclusive and stable administration, covering all significant points of view, emerge in Iraq. Honourable members, particularly those on this side of the House, will be interested to know that in each of these countries that I visited - Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Kuwait and Iran - they were delighted that the regime of Saddam Hussein had been overthrown. It is a major mistake for people to think that in the Middle East there is somehow a sense of regret about the passage of one of the world's most brutal dictatorships - the dictatorship of Saddam Hussein. Everywhere you go, people begin their conversations by telling you how pleased they are that Saddam Hussein is gone. I think in terms of the domestic debate about the situation in the Middle East it is very important to understand this point: that in the Middle East - it may not be true all over the world; it may not even be true all over Australia - people are delighted to see the end of Saddam Hussein and his Baathist regime. I was proud, as the foreign minister of Australia, to be standing and sitting with these people as a contributor to that laudable objective. As I said, I am very pleased that those governments, at least in discussions with me, have committed themselves to playing a positive role in helping Iraq into a more democratic, a more reasonable and a more balanced future.</DOC>

 - I made the point earlier that I will seek to refresh my memory in relation to the matters that have been raised, because the number of interventions that I am involved in are many and the circumstances in which people approach me are various. I remember being approached - although I do not remember the detail, I will refresh my memory on those as well - by the honourable member for Reid about matters from time to time. I have never asked the member for Reid as to whether those whose claims he was pursuing were members of the Labor Party, whether they had donated money to the Labor Party or whether they had been to fundraising functions for the Labor Party that he had attended. I have never asked those questions. I have assumed that, if the arguments on their merits warranted intervention by me -  - they would be put, properly considered and dealt with. That is the approach I take with any member.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Canning for his question. It was a great pleasure to see him recently at the 500 Club lunch in Perth. It was a very successful function. I can inform the House that the Australian Bureau of Statistics survey on construction work, which came out today, showed that building work for the quarter had increased by 2.1 per cent and was up by 16.6 per cent over the year. Although residential building work had moderated somewhat, non-residential was very strong, increasing by 6.3 per cent in the quarter. In addition to that, engineering work showed very strong increases of two per cent through the quarter or 12.7 per cent through the year. In the year to the March quarter of 2003, 58,800 new jobs were created in the construction sector. - As the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations reminds me, if the activity of the CFMEU were brought within the law, Australia's construction industry would be so much stronger and would be a great source of job growth and employment.Why is building and construction strong in this country? First of all, interest rates are low. Interest rates are now at 30-year lows, which are supporting and underpinning construction and engineering. Secondly, in relation to the residential sector, this government introduced the First Home Owners Scheme - and it is worth reminding people - which has given grants to 450,000 Australians to get into their first homes, which, of course, is something that is very welcome. Thirdly, one of the things that is now underpinning engineering work and commercial construction is that this government took all embedded taxes off business so that, in relation to investment, business can claim back as a refund or an input tax credit all taxes from GST.Obviously, if the Labor Party had had their way - if they had been successful in defeating the government's plan to balance the budget - interest rates would be higher. Interest rates were higher under the Labor Party, getting as high as 17 per cent back in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Obviously, if the Labor Party had had their way and they had defeated the new tax system, there would be no First Home Owners Scheme underpinning residential buying. Of course, if the Labor Party had had their way, business would not be getting input tax credits either, because the Labor Party devoted themselves in the last parliament - and no-one more than the member for Hotham - to defeating the modernisation of Australia's taxation system. I was thinking about this this morning. In this world, there are drivers and there are mechanics -  - Mr Speaker, I am talking about the policy changes which underpin strong construction and engineering work. - They, of course, are the interest rate environment, our tax system and our First Home Owners Scheme -  - One of the drivers interjects. According to the member for Melbourne, there are drivers and there are mechanics in this world. He is a driver; the member for Hotham is a mechanic. - If it had not been for this government driving change in this country, we would not have put in place any of the things which are now supporting construction. One might ponder what kind of mechanics the Leader of the Opposition engages in: he specialises in putting a spanner in the works. They are his mechanics, but he will never drive a policy change - </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Jagajaga for her question and new found interest in higher education policy. The government announced on budget night a range of reforms for Australian higher education, to put it on a sound footing for the 21st century. There are three principal platforms of the reforms. The first platform is that the Commonwealth will commit $1.5 billion extra over the next four years, $870 million per year recurrent extra funding from 2007 and $10.6 billion extra additional investment over the first 10 years. The second platform is to change the governance, administration and regulation of Australian higher education, at the same time as expanding the number of places in Australian universities, converting at a cost of $347 million the 325,000 marginally funded over-enrolled places in Australian universities and then adding to that yet another 6,500 fully funded HECS places in the first five years. One of the key priorities that was put to the government - to me as the minister - by the leadership of Australian universities through the process of reform and thinking about the future was that flexibility in terms of HECS charges for students who go into HECS places was one of the things that was critically important to make sure that Australian universities could meet the increasingly high international benchmarks against which they are being judged. It ought to be known by the parliament that there are 531,000 undergraduates in Australian universities. Of those, 98.3 per cent are in government subsidised HECS places where the Commonwealth taxpayer pays for three-quarters of the cost of university education and the student who achieves a HECS place on a merit basis, as it must be, then contributes about a quarter of the cost of their university education, not paying any of it back until - under these arrangements - they are earning $30,000 a year or more. There are 784 courses offered in Australian universities - by 23 of the 40 mainstream publicly funded institutions - and 13 of those courses have fees approximating $100,000 or more. These are full fee paying places which are offered to Australian students once all the expanded HECS places have been allocated. What the member for Jagajaga and the crippling ideologues of the Labor frontbench are arguing is that, if you go to Frankston High School in Victoria and you get 99.4 for your VCE, you will get into law at Melbourne University, but an Australian student - in the same suburb, sitting behind that student at school - who gets 99.3 will not get a HECS place. What the universities do for those students is offer them a full fee paying place that does not have a government subsidy attached to it. I challenge the Australian Labor Party to say that those students are less academically capable than those that get 99.4. For the first time, this government is proposing to offer those students a loan so that they do not have to refuse to take up that place simply because either they cannot access the resources or their families do not have them. It is unfair, it is a kind of reverse elitism, that the Labor Party and the member for Jagajaga are saying, `Oh, I am at Frankston High School, I get 99.4; don't let this kid behind me in, they only got 99.3.' Even though that student wants to subsidise his entire place, they won't let them.We love Wednesdays on this side of the house. We look forward to finding out who has been lining up for lunch with Maxine McKew at the Bulletin, and on this university issue I quote directly from Mr Tanner, the member for Melbourne. He:speaks to an ambitious agenda. As he says 'to drive forward on ideas ... However his:left-wing factional colleague, Jenny Macklin, whose policy responsibility it is, can hardly be put in the 'driver' category. Nelson's Crossroads paper has been discussed and argued over for close to a year but Macklin has produced nothing of her own.Where on Earth is Labor's blueprint for universities? 'I don't know,' says Tanner.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Page for his question. I know this is an issue that concerns him, his constituents and, indeed, most Australians. The government is very active in making a strong contribution to the war against terrorism, and this was a considerable focus of my recent visit to the Middle East. While I was in Saudi Arabia, I took the opportunity of focusing my visit very substantially on the need to take decisive action against al-Qaeda. I was, of course, in Riyadh just a few days after the al-Qaeda bombing had taken place in which quite a number of people were killed, including, I note, one Australian - and another Australian was injured. I was interested in the response of the Saudi government to this particular incident because not only is Saudi Arabia now taking more decisive and energetic action to counter al-Qaeda but the Saudi foreign minister made it clear to me that the al-Qaeda attack in Riyadh had had a decisive effect on public opinion in Saudi Arabia, turning that public opinion very strongly against al-Qaeda. It is not a secret that there has been quite a lot of sympathy for al-Qaeda in many parts of Saudi Arabia. Honourable members will recall that most of those involved in the September 11 attacks were Saudi citizens, and Osama bin Laden himself, although he is not any longer, has been a Saudi citizen. The fact that the bombing in Riyadh had such a decisive effect on public opinion, turning it against al-Qaeda, I think it has to be said was one positive outcome from a dreadful act. The Saudis are continuing to focus very much on issues that I think are very important such as the financing of terrorism more generally and, to be specific, the use of financing of Islamic charities and Islamic schools in different parts of the world as a front for funding terrorist training and al-Qaeda and al-Qaeda related organisations.There has been much speculation, including, of course, that coming from the United States, about the presence of al-Qaeda people in Iran. During my visit to Iran, in my conversations with all those I met there - with President Khatami, with the head of the Expediency Council, Rafsanjani, with the Foreign Minister and the Supreme National Security Council head, Rowhani, I made the point that the Iranians should never underestimate the strength of feeling and the strength of passion in the broader international community to destroy al-Qaeda. I reminded the Iranians that Australians had been killed on September 11, Australians had been killed in Bali and an Australian was killed in Riyadh, and that this was not just an American obsession, this campaign against terrorism, it was something shared in just about every corner of the earth. It would be a matter of enormous and profound concern to the Americans but also to us if the Iranians did not take decisive action against an al-Qaeda presence in Iran.The Iranians told me that it was their view that al-Qaeda people could get across the border, because Iran has a very large border. But they insisted that al-Qaeda was an enemy of the Iranian regime and the Iranian regime was al-Qaeda's enemy and that they were doing what they could to apprehend and to deport to their countries of origin al-Qaeda people within Iran. So I emphasised to the Iranian government also -  - that the Americans have concerns that al-Qaeda personnel in Iran had knowledge of the Riyadh bombing before it took place and that this was another illustration of the global concern about a possible al-Qaeda presence in Iran. In every case, the people I spoke to said that Iran was determined to take action against al-Qaeda. I am pleased to report to the House that very soon after I left Iran the Iranian government arrested a further, I think, nine - but several, anyway - al-Qaeda people in Iran, and, if I may say so, that is a good sign. But, of course, we will just have to wait and see over time how effective the Iranians are in dealing with al-Qaeda.I took the opportunity this morning on my return to Australia to telephone Secretary of State Colin Powell, to discuss with him this whole question of the efficacy of Iran's efforts to deal with al-Qaeda. I know that the United States, the United Kingdom and many other countries appreciate the very significant role Australia plays throughout the world in the war against terrorism and the influence Australia was able to bring to bear on a country like Iran, in encouraging Iran to be a good deal more decisive in the action it takes against al-Qaeda than has been the case in the past. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Jagajaga for her question. There are a number of issues which are entwined within the question. The first is the issue of who actually funds Australian university education, who goes there and why they go there. In answer to that question, firstly, about 30 per cent of our children go immediately from school to university and now the lifetime chance of participation in higher education in Australia is approaching 50 per cent. That is due in no small way to the introduction of HECS in 1988-89, which was opposed by the same sorts of people - like those in the Labor Party - who are now seeming to oppose what this government is doing for Australian higher education. - We have a seat here for Gary Johns, too. The second point which ought to be made is that 75 per cent of the cost of Australian higher education is funded by everyday men and women, many of whom have never seen the inside of a university. - They support and in no way resent the investment in higher education but strongly believe that it is fair that a student who goes to university - and then receives an income on average $622,000 more, as a male, than a person who has not been to university and has a lifetime unemployment rate that is a quarter that of a person who has not been to university and finds, in 91 per cent of cases, employment within four months of graduation - should pay their quarter. I think most Australians accept the fact that they should pay, only when they are working and earning in excess of $30,000 a year, about their quarter share.The second issue, which I think is embedded in both the things raised by the member for Jagajaga, is the question of who goes to university. I think one of the real challenges we face is that we are living in a society where many people - and I include many on the front bench of the other side - are basically saying to young people, `If you don't go to university, you're not as good as someone who does.' What is critically important to this government's vision of education is that we want young people to find and be their best. We want them to understand that university is an important part of their life horizon and so is doing the best that they can academically. But we are determined that young people will know that they have choices available to them that are valued - in apprenticeships and in training. For some young people just getting from school to the workplace emotionally intact is an enormous achievement.The third issue which is evident throughout the question is the decision as to where a parent sends his or her child to school. This government strongly believes that all Australians, through their Commonwealth and state taxes, should support well-resourced government schools. Having done that, if Australians then choose to send their children to Catholic, Anglican, Christian, Jewish, Islamic, Aboriginal community or any other independent schools - and the families of one million students, making up 32 per cent of those in the education system, do make that choice - they will be supported by this government in making that decision. What ought to be remembered in the criticisms - the so-called class war which is run by the Australian Labor Party - is that the average student in a government state primary school attracts $6,841 in public funding. The sons and daughters of the men and women who send their children to the schools to which you refer receive $775. In other words, every child from every family that attends a non-government school in this country receives less money than they would if they were educated in a government school. The kids from the poorest families get 30 per cent less and the kids from the wealthiest families get 87 per cent less. It does not matter to us on this side whether you send your child to King Abdul Aziz Islamic College in Rooty Hill or to The King's School in Parramatta. We do not take the view that some Australians and their children are less equal than others. They will receive support. The Labor Party view is that, if you send your child to some schools, you should not get any support. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question and acknowledge her very real interest in aviation. She is herself a pilot and has a great interest in this very important sector in Australia. As a government, we have moved to reform low-level airspace in Australia, because we believe real savings can be made at the same time as we move to improve safety. We believe those savings will encourage the development and growth of general aviation in Australia, the smaller end of the aviation industry in particular, at the same time as they will help us to build a bigger place in the sun for Australian educational exports - specifically in this case, the training of airline pilots and aviation pilots in general - and, if we can reform the environment in which they operate, to continue the growth of the manufacturing sector and the technical sector in this country.With the need for major reform of low-level airspace in Australia to harmonise with best practice internationally - and after considerable consultation, including with my good friend Dick Smith - we decided to move to the adaptation of a broadly based American national airspace system, or NAS, as it is known. Stage 1 of three stages has been completed. It is now locked in. After decades of trying to reform airspace in Australia stage 1 of the three stages is now locked in, which leaves two stages to go.In talking to the people who are progressing this and who believe in it, as I do and as the government does, we realised a while ago that there were still some who needed to be persuaded of the benefits. As we sought to take people with us, to consult widely and to train widely, we recognised that we needed to again remind people that real savings can be made at the same time as safety is improved. To that end, we took on Wes Willoughby and Associates to do a review of NAS and the competition for airport related services. They have issued a report which I would like to table here today. It emphasises the value of the reforms that the government is undertaking - in particular, the financial savings which will be of great interest to everyone who wants to build light aviation in Australia - and it also recognises the real value of reform, in that it will ensure that we achieve our destiny as a major supplier of aviation training around the world. That can only benefit Australia in economic terms and in terms of the future of aviation in this country. I table the report. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Fowler for her question. The Treasurer did a great job on budget night presenting the higher education package. I also present to the parliament a package of the policy changes and what they actually mean. I would be very happy to make officials from my office available to speak to the member for Fowler. What you need to do -  - The member for Fowler needs to look at the postgraduate arrangements for nursing and teaching. One of the things that is very important, which the member for Fowler has picked up on, is that we are expanding the number of places that are available in Australian universities - 31,600 in fact over the first five years including the 25,000 marginally funded over enrolled. Another point that she has picked up on, unlike the so-called drivers on the frontbench, is that the graduates - the students - do not pay a cent. They do not pay one cent until they have graduated and are working and earning more than $30,000 a year. The other message that the member for Fowler has picked up on is that for the first time the government is saying to those Australian students, in the same way as is said to young people who come from Beijing and Jakarta, that we will make a loan available to you. If you miss out on the expanded number of HECS funded public places we will make a loan available to you for which, again, you do not need a guarantor. - Mr Speaker, I would be saying to the member of Fowler if I were speaking to her directly that you can get a loan, that the member for Fowler or anyone she is concerned about will not have to go to any of the commercial ventures and that the Commonwealth taxpayers will make a loan available. It will be at 3½ per cent, capped at 10 years, plus the consumer price index. You do not have to pay a cent back until you are earning at least $30,000 a year. If the member for Fowler never earns that much, she would not have to pay it back.There is another thing that is very important. Do you know what these students are doing today? They are going along to commercial lenders, who are saying to them that, if they make the loan available, they will lend them between $2,000 and $20,000 at 11½ per cent. They will only lend for some courses and, in some cases, only in the final year of that course. In many cases you have to commence repayments within four months. Of course, if you are not making the repayments you are in serious trouble. This is a tremendous arrangement to expand opportunities.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Riverina for her question, particularly with regard to small business exporters that are growing in number, of which a number are from her electorate of Riverina. In 2001, the coalition set a target to double the number of exporters by 2006, particularly targeting the small business sector. As the minister for small business indicated yesterday, small business in the Australian economy is the driver of the Australian economy. Of course, they are also the drivers of export growth, delivering many extra jobs across the Australian economy, particularly in the regional Australian economy. As you would be well aware, in the regional economy in Victoria and South Australia, as well as in New South Wales and the other states, exports are delivering jobs at a rate of one in four. By targeting growth in the number of exporters, and particularly as far as small business exporters are concerned, that will deliver significant economic and social benefits across the Australian economy.Over our term of office, our government has continued to deliver a process of reform that has created an environment that not only is very conducive to the activities of small business domestically within the Australian economy but, most importantly, makes them more competitive in the international marketplace. These are reforms such as taxation reform, where we have removed all taxes from our exports going out of Australia, and labour market reforms, which have meant that our exports can get across the waterfront much more efficiently. The sound economic management that our government has delivered to the Australian economy has resulted in a circumstance of stability as far as the cost of capital and interest rates in the Australian economy are concerned. All this equals an opportunity to create more jobs to deliver more opportunities across Australia.  - With exports forecast to grow out of the budget in 2003-04, we are assisting in getting more small businesses prepared to export into the markets of the world with programs like the TradeStart program, with 49 offices across Australia, and the Export Market Development Grants Scheme - the EMDG program - with which we are finetuning the focus on small business. We are focusing the EMDG's $150 million a year on helping new exporters get into the international marketplace. The results are already there. - I am sure all members in the House will be pleased to note that those programs that were targeting the development of the export base in Australia last year were quite successful. We saw an increase from 25,000 to 31,450 exporting companies in Australia. There were 6,500 new exporters. Some of those new exporters are very small businesses that hitherto had probably not recognised the opportunities that presented themselves.These are businesses such as Green Bros, a business in the seat of Port Adelaide that I am sure the member for Port Adelaide would be aware of, which is now signing a joint venture that will enable it to export automotive components to China. And companies like Peplin Biotech in the seat of Brisbane - I am sure the member for Brisbane recognises that business - which has just secured a $42.5 million licensing deal to sell new skin cancer treatments to the United States. In the member for Riverina's electorate, there is business by the name of Green Grove Organics which, with the assistance of TradeStart, has recently begun exporting organic licorice to New York. Following in the great success of Yellowtail wine from Griffith exporting to New York, these are small businesses that have taken advantage of government programs to move from being just a domestic producer and seller to being a seller in the export marketplace.It is important to note that the policies that we have put in place are delivering for small exporters. The examples that I have given and other companies like them are going to be critical to the future growth of our economy and our exporters. We as a government will continue to provide a sound economic environment in Australia from which they can export and compete internationally. We will continue our reform program to ensure that they have opportunities to achieve their goals and we will certainly continue to pursue our aggressive trade strategy of competitive liberalisation across the world to provide better access into more markets across the world for Australian small businesses.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Casey for his question and in particular his very strong advocacy for Ruskin Park Primary School in Croydon and Wandin Yallock Primary School in Wandin. In Australia 68 per cent of all Australian students attend government state schools; that is 2.27 million students. The other 32 per cent attend non-government schools. Under section 96 of the Constitution, state governments are responsible for regulating, administering and primarily funding their state government schools. The Commonwealth's role, for some 30 years or more, has been to supplement the state and territory governments in funding their state government schools. This year, for example, in the Commonwealth budget the government announced that it would increase government school funding by 5½ per cent, taking it to $2.5 billion, which would be added to the $12.5 billion contributed by state and territory governments. In its budget delivered on 6 May, the Victorian state government increased funding to its state government schools by 2.3 per cent. The Commonwealth increase for Victorian state government schools was 6.1 per cent. This is in a year when we are forecasting enrolment growth to increase by 0.2 per cent in the state of Victoria. The Commonwealth government, over the last seven years, has increased its funding to Victorian state government schools by 59.1 per cent when enrolments in the government sector in the state of Victoria increased by 3.6 per cent. If the Victorian government in its budget on 6 May had increased funding to its Victorian state government schools by 6.1 per cent, there would have been another $178 million available for the students in Victorian state schools and their families. As the member for Canning would well know, in the state of Western Australia we had the same experience. The Commonwealth has increased funding by 5.1 per cent; the West Australian government by 2.3 per cent. There are 53 missing millions in the state of Western Australia.  What needs to be understood by Australians is that state and territory governments have underfunded schools. The Victorian government this year, with some $6.65 billion available to it in GST revenues - up 4½ per cent - has still seriously underfunded Victorian state government schools. For every parent that has their child in a state government school and who wants to send them to a well-funded state government school, the Commonwealth's challenge to state and territory governments is to index their funding to state government schools in line with the Commonwealth. </DOC>

 - The answer to the honourable member's question is that it has been fully explained by Senator Minchin in Senate estimates that in a statement of net worth under AAS31 Telstra can be valued at historical cost. - Less - absolutely. Platforms can be valued at cost. That put a value on platforms at $31.5 billion and showed a net worth under AAS31 of minus $49-odd billion in 2002-03. The government, in addition to doing net worth on a AAS31 basis, also does it on a GFS basis. On a GFS basis, the valuation of Telstra would be at market value, with Defence platforms valued at zero. That produces an estimate of net worth in 2002-03 of minus $47-odd billion. Both of these are huge estimations. For example, valuing the whole of Australia's Defence platforms at zero - that is, the Collins class submarines, frigates, F111s and Hornets at zero - is obviously very wide of their actual value. Indeed, much of the Commonwealth land-holding is not valued at true market rent. We do not attempt to value Defence lands, such as North Head or South Head, at full market value or, indeed, the buildings around Parliament House.These are very, very general estimations and they vary according to the particular values that one puts on them. Senator Minchin has this afternoon released a different valuation, a 90-day valuation in relation to GFS standard this afternoon, which does it on an additional basis. So it can be done on every single basis you like - AAS31, GFS, GFS on 90-day market average - but these are still estimations. The important point is that this does not affect the budget, it does not affect the cash position, it does not affect the fiscal position and it does not affect the operating position. This is a statement in relation to net worth, which the Commonwealth has been putting in budget papers only since 1999-2000. These are very general estimates. The government will be reporting on all of the different bases so that they are there for the historic record, but it makes no difference whatsoever to the underlying budget position as reported in the budget on last Tuesday night fortnight.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Blair for what is a very important question. It is clear that Australia has been an al-Qaeda target since at least November 2001. We know this because on 3 November 2001 Osama bin Laden first made specific reference to Australia when he criticised Australian troops in East Timor, who were there under UN auspices, as a `crusader force'. Bin Laden specifically mentioned Australia on two subsequent occasions, most recently following the Bali attacks. A recent statement on 21 May by bin Laden's spiritual mentor and deputy al-Zawahira confirmed that Australia remains a terrorist target. I can now inform the House that new information has come to light very recently indicating that al-Qaeda explored possible targets in Australia in 2000 or 2001. These reports indicate that al-Qaeda's interest in mounting attacks in Australia actually predated the 11 September 2001 attacks in New York and Washington.Al-Qaeda's targeting of Australia does not derive from our military involvement in Afghanistan or Iraq. Rather, al-Qaeda's interest in attacking Australia derives from the fact that we are a Western nation with Western values that are abhorrent to the militant theology which is at the heart of al-Qaeda. Al-Qaeda has a transparent self-interest in trying to attract support for its terrorist cause by seeking to present its inhumane attacks as a response to specific events such as East Timor, Afghanistan and Iraq. This new information of course relates to past planning and past events.I want to reassure the House that it has not resulted in a change to current threat levels either in Australia or for Australian interests abroad. No specific or other intelligence has been received indicating any current plan for an attack in Australia by al-Qaeda or any other group that might warrant a change in the assessed terrorist threat level within our country. The government remains committed to doing everything possible to protect the safety of Australians from terrorism. If any information were to come to light which caused the government to change the assessed terrorism threat to Australia, the public would be advised without delay.Finally, I inform the House that at my request the Leader of the Opposition was specifically briefed on this new information on 26 May by the Director-General of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation.</DOC>

 - No, it is not the case, because, as I have just explained, under AAS31 Telstra is valued at historic costs; so it is not the case at all. As I have previously indicated, the statement of net worth does not affect the budget year, the underlying cash surplus, the headline cash surplus, the operating statement, the fiscal surplus or any of those other matters. It is an attempt to try and get to the net worth of the Commonwealth, which the Commonwealth has variously estimated under different measures. It could be negative $46 billion or negative $50 billion, depending on the kind of price that you want to put on defence platforms. But I will say this: it is absolutely true that the value of the 6.5 billion shares that the Commonwealth holds in Telstra has declined - absolutely true. If the Senate had passed the government's legislation, and the government had sold those shares at the time of T2, the Commonwealth would have received around $29 billion more than they are worth today. I do not know what point the Australian Labor Party is trying to make here. This much is true: the Australian Labor Party, by its efforts in defeating the authorisation for the government to put equity of Telstra on the market -  - has presided over a $29 billion loss in net worth. I do not know whether the Australian Labor Party considers that a great success. The government has, in fact, marked down its valuation of Telstra shares. That is the effect of having those 6.5 billion shares at the kind of market prices that now prevail rather than the prices that prevailed at the time of T2.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Sturt for his question. I can inform the House that total new capital expenditure in the March quarter, whilst showing a 5.3 per cent decline, showed that over the course of the year capital expenditure had risen by 18.2 per cent. The reason for the decline in the March quarter is that it was coming off an artificially high December quarter, which had increased by 13.7 per cent, led particularly by the importation by Qantas of civil aircraft of around $1.7 billion. You had an abnormally high build-up in the December quarter and you had a correction in March; but once you take those lumpy figures out, over the course of the year capital expenditure rose by 18.2 per cent.In addition to that, we have released today the sixth estimate for capital spending in 2002-03, which was 16.7 per cent stronger than the equivalent estimate for 2001-02. Again, the intention for the whole of this year is a very large rise on the outcome for the previous year. This shows that there is very strong capital expenditure going on in the Australian economy. In part, this is reflected in today's trade figures, which show that imports were up, being much higher in April than previous months, whilst exports were down - and no doubt the trade minister will have something to say about that in a moment. But statistics on the international trade in goods and services for the month of April, which we have already released today, tell a story of a strong domestic Australian economy, notwithstanding a very weak international economy. In addition, of course, drought affects some of Australia's exports, particularly in the rural areas. Coming back to capital expenditure: as I was saying yesterday, confirming the `construction work done' figures, capital expenditure has been very strong in the course of this year, both in construction and in equipment. This is continuing to drive a strong underlying Australian economy. It is supported by low interest rates. In addition, it is supported by the fact that the government has taken taxes off inputs. As I said yesterday, in the residential sector it is supported by a strong First Home Owners Scheme, which has given young Australians a chance to get a home. I thank the honourable member for Sturt for his question, and I can inform him that today's figures confirm strong underlying capital expenditure going on in the Australian economy.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. At the outset, I should indicate to the House that, when we came to office in 1996, there was $99 billion worth of exports of goods and services. That has increased by 50 per cent, to $151 billion worth of goods and services out of Australia, since we came to office. If the Australian Labor Party had its way, we would not have achieved those targets, because we would not have been able to reform the economy and make it efficient and competitive in the way we have done.Today the Australian Bureau of Statistics released the trade figures for April. Those trade figures are, as the Treasurer has indicated, the result of a very strong domestic economy and a very weak global economy. Although the increase in imports reflects the strength of the Australian economy - and I do not think that is disputed at all - our exports have been hit by a triple whammy of SARS, the drought and a sluggish world economy. There is no question about that. - We can add the Labor Party and make it a quadruple whammy. These factors have combined to deliver a trade deficit of $3.1 billion. Nobody is saying it is good news, but there are good reasons for it. We need to be realistic about these reasons. I have outlined the impacts on exports. We are just starting to realise the dramatic impact that SARS has had on exports throughout the region and on the tourism industry and visitation to Australia. Seasonally adjusted, short-term visitation arrivals for April are the lowest for five years. Remember that tourism is our largest export earner. Some merchandise exports into the East-Asian region have also declined as a result of SARS and lowering economic activity in the region. Of course, the Labor Party will not recognise the impact of the drought. The drought is still with us in Australia. It has rained in some parts of Australia, but the drought is still affecting our export effort as far as the rural economy is concerned. The sluggish global economy is having a dramatic impact on our markets. The continuing poor performance of our major trading partners has contributed to a fall in our exports of non-rural and other goods. Australia is not alone in facing a difficult export environment. Exports from other regional economies - for example, New Zealand, Singapore and Thailand - have also been negatively affected.Despite the tough times that we are facing, Australia's robust economic fundamentals mean that we are well placed to meet these challenges. We have to be prepared to meet these challenges. I have been saying for the last couple of months that the international exporting environment this year will be competitive and tough, and we need to meet those challenges. We are able to do that because we have a budget that is in surplus, and we have an economy that has delivered low unemployment, low interest rates, low inflation and low public sector debt. That means our economy is performing strongly, and that is reflected in these statistics today. While our strong economy obviously impacts on our trade performance, the government are not about to pursue the types of policies that we have seen from previous Labor governments in similar circumstances, policies which killed off both import and export growth and led to unemployment of over 10 per cent and the highest interest rates that this country has ever suffered. - Yes. - Yes.</DOC>

 - I regret very much the nature of the questioning from the member for Reid, which has impugned my integrity and which has, I might say, served its purpose -  -  - It has served its purpose. The nature of that story - which was quite wrong in suggesting that there was any link between donations and the grant of a visa - was totally and absolutely untrue. I have never exercised my personal discretion in return for a donation. - That was the insinuation. That was the smear and, let me say, it has served its purpose, because some people saw fit to report it as if it might have some credibility -  - Yes, I do not like these sorts of points being raised, I must say.  -  - If it were a genuine question seeking information, I might well have wanted to respond in a way which would be cooperative and generous, as I usually am to you. But let me make it abundantly clear the way in which this issue was dealt with, because it ought to be put beyond absolute doubt. Yesterday I made clear what the new information was -  - Yes, I did. - Yes, I did. - Yes, I did, and you saw fit to ignore it -  - and you have been on radio today suggesting that there was no new information. - Let me just take you through the issue as I understand it. There was a request, initially by some lawyers in Parramatta by the name of Harrisons, involving this matter. I have seen the initial request again, and it made clear to me that the only issue that was being raised by the lawyer on behalf of this gentleman was the handling of the matter before the RRT. That was the only issue raised.I received further correspondence from the member for Parramatta. That correspondence was referred to my department, and the member for Parramatta raised the same issues. He did not raise the issue that ultimately influenced me in relation to this matter. My department referred to me a standard form letter that many of you may have seen from time to time which said that, having already entertained an intervention request and as there was no further new information provided, I would not be considering it. That is the letter he received. It was not a fresh consideration of the matter; it was not a second intervention or consideration by me.It is the case that after, and not before, the relevant function, I saw - and I would not mention his name normally, because I do not put information I receive about individual cases into the public arena - the Melchite bishop Issam Darwish. The bishop then wrote some correspondence in relation to this matter, as requested by me, to enable me to have a fresh look at the matter. I have made it clear over a period of time that one of the factors that I do look at when considering interventions where I might not otherwise intervene is the presence of substantial Australian connections. - You might see in a few months whether you want to comment further about the East Timorese. - Let me just say that I have made things clear to members who are looking for the way in which I deal with these issues. It is not intended to cover the field, but I have indicated that, where people may have an application that is marginal but where in another area there are issues which could also have a marginal impact -  - I will look at those issues cumulatively -  - The substantial issue that is always considered in relation to intervention requests and is most prominent in relation to when I do intervene is substantial Australian connections. I am referring to the cases of spouses of Australians, particularly where they have children. One of the reasons why we have so many interventions today in that particular area is the provisions in the act that put in place a bar to further applications. They have been seen as appropriate provisions to remain in the system to discourage people from coming to Australia in expectation that they will have a hunting licence to go out and find a spouse, enter into a relationship and expect to be accommodated onshore. That is the reason for the bar, which was put in by a former government. We have not taken it out but where there are other issues, such as substantial family linkages, those matters are considered.After the approach, which included community representations from people known to both the member for Parramatta and myself - including the bishop, a prominent doctor and community representatives -  - You know that it was Mr Kisrwani; you know that. - The advice from the bishop was on 27 September 2001. The member for Reid was out there suggesting that he knew when I was approached. He was suggesting that it was before the member for Parramatta wrote to me. In fact, it was afterwards, and it was after the function that was adverted to. The fact is that I asked for a brief to be prepared for me, and I dealt with it in January 2002. The interesting aspect about this matter is that there has been a lot of interest in it. I was first approached on this matter by the member for Kingsford-Smith. He supported the first intervention. -  - I outlined the information that I initially considered fully yesterday, but I will take you through it again. The issue was in relation to the claims, which were accepted by the Refugee Review Tribunal, that the young man had rescued a Christian girl who had been sexually assaulted by two Syrian workers in Lebanon. He claims that he was accused of causing civil unrest and conducting anti-Syrian activities. He claims that following the incident he was arrested, his house was damaged and his car was burnt by Syrian forces. He claims that he was held in captivity for 45 days without trial, interrogated and badly mistreated. The RRT accepted that he had been detained and mistreated by the Syrians in 1993 but further found that that was not a convention reason. - The substantial difference when this matter came forward again, which had never been raised before, was that this man had three Australian citizen sisters. -  - He did. It was a substantial Australian link which I thought warranted me looking at this issue again -  - Mr Speaker, I do not wish to add a great deal more. It was clear that there was new material that was put before me. Let me just say that I have asked for some advice to be prepared for me on a number of occasions on which, in the last while, the issues in relation to my intervention have been addressed. This program year I have had something of the order of 4,000 fresh requests and something of the order of 900 repeat requests. I have intervened on a number of occasions - approximately 80, I think - where repeat requests have been made and additional information has been provided. I have done so for the Leader of the Opposition. - It was the second time. But the Leader of the Opposition would be aware that he has approached me on some 30 occasions - I have intervened on two - and one of those involved a repeat request. The member for Reid has written to me seeking intervention on 62 occasions - I do not complain about that. I have considered intervening on 25 occasions. I might say that that is an exceptional record. -  - There was no reflection in the remarks I made; there have been in others. Let me just say that, of the 25 cases, five of those cases involved matters where Mr Ferguson subsequently approached me where initial consideration had been declined. So what has happened is not unusual, not different, and the intervention power that I use I use sparingly and with a great deal of care, and I will continue to do that. I will not allow the approach that you have taken to influence me in relation to the way in which I consider these matters. - I do not know that there was a Federal Court case; it may be the RRT's. - Mr Speaker, I have no intention of tabling documents that are private documents relating to people's personal affairs. - Selectively. - They are confidential.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Parkes for his question and his ongoing interest in the drought which affects virtually all of his electorate, where many farmers are obviously facing particular difficulties. The Commonwealth has moved to provide significant and comprehensive financial support for farmers during these difficult times. We have moved where states have failed to act. We are providing a range of assistance measures, many of which have never been offered in a drought situation before. We are also processing applications much faster than ever before. Indeed, as soon as a prima facie case has been established, farmers are eligible to receive interim assistance while their case is under consideration. We are taking about one-third as long as occurred in the past to consider the detailed applications. This has already meant that significant assistance is flowing to Australian farm communities.In relation to the applications already before and agreed to by the federal government, we have committed expenditure of around $950 million over three years. Indeed, no federal government in any drought in our history has made a contribution anything like that amount. We have recognised the severity of the situation and, whilst those numbers sound big when they are all added together - and they are indeed a very significant contribution from the Commonwealth - we know that each application is dealing with a personal tragedy and that a personal situation of great difficulty is confronting an Australian farm family. We have been prepared to stand by them and to offer as much assistance as we possibly can.In addition, there has been substantial revenue forgone under the Farm Management Deposits scheme. Since 1997, we have provided around $800 million under the AAA Farm Innovation Program - which provides support for farm training - for the Farm Family Restart Scheme and for rural financial counsellors, who have been especially in demand over recent times. If you compare that commitment with what has been offered by the states during this arguably worst drought in our nation's history, the comparisons are light and dark. Compared with our almost $1 billion already committed to relief assistance in this drought, the states between them have managed something less than $60 million. It is really a pathetic effort.In states like Victoria and Western Australia, the assistance is actually cut off as soon as Commonwealth assistance is available under the exceptional circumstances program. Around 50 EC applications have either been lodged or are projected, and some of those applications are being lodged by states that have made absolutely no financial assistance available to farmers in the region. They demand Commonwealth help while they are prepared to do nothing themselves. Many of these applications have covered huge areas, areas that have meant that it has been very difficult for the independent arbiter, the National Rural Advisory Council, to make a decision about whether or not the area qualifies. They cover such a range of industry areas and geographical circumstances that some areas may qualify and others may not.When an application is declined because the state case has not been strong enough, we have state ministers actually going out and criticising the Commonwealth government because their application has failed. They would be far better off putting their time and energy into providing meaningful practical assistance at the local level and developing applications that are likely to meet the criteria - criteria which they signed off on four or five years ago and which they were party to the development of. It is important that there is cooperation between the Commonwealth and the states in developing the applications and in then considering the appropriate method of assistance to be provided in cases where there is severe drought.I want to emphasis that, unfortunately, because of the nature of the cases that have been presented or the circumstances in certain areas, some of the applications have not been successful. But in every instance the Commonwealth and the National Rural Advisory Council has recommended that we review the case in the months ahead. So there will be a constant review of the circumstances of people in areas where applications have not been accepted, and as soon as it is clear that an area meets the criteria we will be willing to reconsider and to make that kind of declaration. The states have a role in providing up-to-date information to ensure that those matters can be considered promptly. Instead of criticism and empty words from the states, we certainly need a bit of performance - a bit of caring about the needs of farmers and a desire to actually ensure that benefits flow as quickly as possible.Finally, the Commonwealth is aware of the fact that the current EC arrangements leave a lot to be desired. We have been trying to reform them now for more than two years and getting no cooperation from any of the states. What is important is that there is a spirit of cooperation and a willingness to try to provide benefits in the most effective way. States have never done less in a drought - never talked more, but never done less - but we have not been prepared to have farmers suffer just because they have uncaring state governments. We have been prepared to move in and provide realistic assistance, and we will do that until the drought is over.</DOC>

 - In relation to the way in which this matter was dealt with, the first document I would have seen was on 1 October 1998. That was an intervention request which was in the form of a schedule, in which no reference was made to the gentleman's family. The second relevant document is the letter from the member for Parramatta. I probably have the date of it, but I refreshed my memory earlier by reading it. The questions in relation to his family were not raised in that matter. I outlined that in response to the earlier question. The bishop wrote to me on 27 September after I had met with him on 25 September 2001. I have no idea whether my department may have received any other advice. - I could ask but I do not think it is relevant because it was not before me at the time I first considered the matter. It was not before me or the department at the time Mr Cameron wrote his letter but it was before me when I made the decision in January 2002. I simply affirm what I said before. The fact is, I considered it at that time. The letter that initiated this matter followed our meeting with the bishop on 25 September 2001 and the letter was written on 27 September.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Ryan for his question. I also take this opportunity to thank him for representing me recently when launching the excellent book on Australian grasses which has been produced by the Australian biological resources survey. Australia is very vulnerable to climate change. This is why the government shares international concern about climate change and the challenge that it poses to our natural environment and to our economy. This government established the first greenhouse specific agency in the world, the Australian Greenhouse Office, and, through a mixture of mandatory and voluntary incentives and grants, has encouraged action which has meant that Australia has been a leader in greenhouse gas abatement. In fact, the measures that the government has taken so far are estimated to deliver some 60 million tonnes per annum of CO2 equivalent abatement each year until 2010. That is equivalent to taking all Australia's passenger cars off the roads. Through the impact of new technology and improved standards, Australia is now successfully decoupling its economic growth from greenhouse emissions growth. Emissions per dollar of GDP were 24 per cent lower in 2000 than they were in 1990.Today I announced that applications are now being sought for round 3 of the $400 million Greenhouse Gas Abatement Program. As a result of the first two application rounds, 15 projects have already been offered a total of almost $145 million to abate more than 27 million tonnes of greenhouse gas from 2008 to 2012. Examples of these projects include funding of up to $26 million for combined heat and power cogeneration facilities to abate 3.25 million tonnes of greenhouse gases and funding of more than $40 million for several projects in New South Wales and Queensland to capture and use waste coalmine gas to abate over seven million tonnes of greenhouse gases. This government is committed to meeting the target that we negotiated at Kyoto of 108 per cent of 1990 levels. We are also developing a climate change forward agenda to cover the next 20 to 30 years that will lead a strong contribution to global climate control without sacrificing the competitive advantages that we have as a resource-rich nation.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and, although I have already done so, I again commend the very brave actions of the flight attendants on that aeroplane and also of the travelling passengers who sought to make a contribution to the actions in hand. It is, nonetheless, unfortunate that some in the media have chosen to depict last Thursday's incident involving a Qantas aircraft as indicating that Australia's aviation security arrangements are lax. That is not correct and nor is it helpful to aviation, to tourism or to a general and balanced understanding in the community about the very real efforts that we have made to ensure the safety of the travelling public.It is a fact that we have in place in Australia one of the most robust systems in the world. Indeed, the ANAO acknowledged this when it commended the responsiveness of our aviation security systems following the events of September 11. We have moved to improve security in a number of wide-ranging ways: tighter passenger and carry-on bag screening, the very substantial and ongoing upgrading of equipment and the extension of security arrangements to more airports.We have seen the deployment of more than 150 extra Australian Protective Service officers trained in the counter-terrorism first response role to 11 airports throughout Australia, bringing the total number of APS officers at airports to more than 400; the introduction of armed air security officers - sky marshals, as they are euphemistically known - on domestic flights, and negotiations are under way to expand that internationally on selected routes; the very effective training of flight crews to deal with security threats in flight; the introduction, completed on international airplanes belonging to the Australian fleet, of upgraded cockpit security measures - and that will shortly be completed on domestic aeroplanes - and the introduction of 100 per cent checked bag screening for all international and major domestic flights by 31 December 2004, which, it is worth noting, is a full year ahead of the deadline imposed by the International Civil Aviation Organisation. - We have written to Qantas seeking a full report on the incident on the Melbourne to Launceston flight. They are taking forward their investigation; so too are the Australian Federal Police. But it has not just been the media who have unnecessarily inflamed this debate. The opposition spokesman, who has spoken frequently about the parlous state of the aviation industry, wasted little time last week in describing the Qantas incident as a `major security breach' before he allowed the facts to come to light. This sort of shallow political opportunism only raises unnecessary alarm and is highly irresponsible. So is the sort of shallow opportunism that saw the member for Batman claim today in a media release that there is no security screening at Coffs Harbour and Gove. I inform the member for Batman that screening does take place at Coffs Harbour - as the member would know - and, as a result of the measures we have put in place, screening is in the process of being introduced at Gove. In direct contrast, as so often happens, some of his senior Labor colleagues have made far more reasoned comments about this incident. For example, the Premier of Tasmania said on the ABC in Hobart:This incident happened with a flight out of Melbourne, where there is at least as high a degree of security as any other airport, not only in Australia but, in my experience, internationally.Premier Beattie said:I do not think we should have an overreaction to this. It is impossible in this country of 19½ million across a wide area to check every airport. - Senator Kerry O'Brien, the opposition transport spokesman in the Senate, stated:I think the main issue here was that there were weapons that were available, and it is very difficult to understand how they would have been intercepted in a conventional sense other than a full search of every passenger going on board the plane.I urge the member for Batman to follow the more measured, reasonable and responsible lead of some of his state and, indeed, federal colleagues.</DOC>

 - As I have said in the media over the weekend, plainly, with the investigations that have been taken forward by the Transport Security Division of my own portfolio, by Qantas and by the Australian Federal Police - which is of course undertaking the chief investigation - we will garner all of the facts and all of the information we can and we will seek to respond appropriately and properly. You would expect that of the government. - I hear the Leader of the Opposition saying that we have done nothing. That is nonsense, as he well knows. The categorised airports across Australia all have to have security plans in place which are relevant to their circumstances. It is all very well for the opposition to jump up in this place and seek to sensationalise - to go beyond what wise heads in industry, in the state governments and in the tourism industry are saying.   - We have the task of looking to the security of the Australian travelling public at the same time as we seek to ensure that transport remains viable - that people can get around and that airports are not completely clogged and unworkable. - In relation to those regional airports that do not have security plans, I first make the very important point that we respond to risk assessments put together by Australia's intelligence agencies. I repeat: we respond to risk assessments given to us by highly competent agencies in Australia. There is something of a tendency on the part of one or two people in this place to apparently presume a greater degree of knowledge than our intelligence agencies have. If they know something, or believe they may know something, those agencies do not know or if they have some facts those agencies might not be in possession of, the responsible thing would be to approach our office, and we would then put them in touch with those organisations. Furthermore, if local councils or airport owners believe that further security upgrades are needed -  - The member for Batman does not want to hear this part of the answer, so he wants me to go on to the next part. I will get to it. Again I make the offer we have made before to airport owners: come and talk to us if you want to upgrade your security arrangements and if you think it is necessary. One regional airport in Australia has done it - none in New South Wales have, but one in Australia has. They came to inquire of us, we worked them through the facts and they went away saying, `We don't believe it would warrant the cost, the expense and the inconvenience,' based on the information given to them. These things have to be risk assessed; otherwise, almost by definition, you will clog everything hopelessly.Let me come to the Ansett ticket levy. We have made it quite plain that it will be removed as soon as we are sure that there is no remaining exposure for the taxpayer. The member for Batman, as a former leader in the trade union movement, will be fully aware that it is the Ansett ground workers' superannuation trustees who are delaying this matter by insisting on a higher priority for a couple of hundred million dollars in the creditors' queue. As soon as that matter is resolved, we may have the certainty needed to be able to wind up something that I would like to see out of the way as quickly as possible.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and note his particular interest in it and his very hard lobbying to ensure a fair deal for people in his part of Melbourne. We do run a program called RONI - Roads of National Importance - which gives us an avenue over and above the national highway to fund roads which will directly benefit Australia and to particularly address local needs. As a government, we can point to the upgrading of the Pacific Highway, which I think every Australian would now agree has been a major and worthwhile program. I hear a lot of people saying, `It's great to see major national infrastructure projects going on.' The Pacific Highway project is worth about $3½ billion - almost of the order of the Snowy Mountains scheme. Then there is the recently completed Geelong Road, better linking the growing economies of Melbourne and Geelong. The member for La Trobe, of course, acknowledges the importance of the Pakenham bypass. I want to come to a very important point. Of all of the roads of national importance in Victoria - three-quarters of a billion dollars worth - not one of them would have attracted one red cent under Labor, because they did not have a program like this. Having said that, I have to say that I am extraordinarily disappointed that the Scoresby Freeway is now in serious jeopardy. Out of the $750-plus million we have made available in Victoria, there is $425 million for the Scoresby Freeway - but it was to be a freeway, not a tollway. We went as far as to write into a formal agreement with Victoria that it would be a freeway, not a tollway. That was signed without any duress at all by the Victorian Minister for Transport. We want to keep that promise. We have frozen the funding; it is available to be picked up when Victoria agree with the terms of the MOU that we signed with them. The Victorian Labor government does not want us to keep our promise. Not only do the Labor Party feel that it is okay to break their promise to people in Victoria; we are still waiting for any indication from the other side that they think this is an issue that matters and that they believe they ought to come clean. I call on the Victorian government to fulfil its commitment and deliver the freeway that it promised. I was asked about alternative policies. It is interesting that the member for Aston should ask. A couple of weeks ago, at the time of the budget, I stood here in this House and challenged the Leader of the Opposition to make his position clear. I challenged him to state whether he supports a toll on the Scoresby Freeway and whether or not he thinks it is okay to break a written commitment. We have not heard anything yet. - What about the member for Batman? Do you support it? I heard yesterday that the member for Aston launched a bumper sticker, which I suspect will sell very well down in Melbourne and all over Victoria. It is very simple. It says, `Scoresby - no toll'. I thought the Leader of the Opposition might like one, and I challenge him to put it on his car. I will send it around after question time.</DOC>

 - I will answer the honourable member's question in two parts. As for Tamworth, I am informed by the Deputy Prime Minister that Tamworth does have a security plan and that it is based on a risk assessment. I am quite sure that, if the honourable member wants some more information about that, it will be provided by the Deputy Prime Minister. Speaking more generally, there is of course no limit to the amount of money that you could spend on airport security in this country - no limit at all. You could spend an unlimited amount. I do think it is important, particularly in the wake of the incident last week, that the country keep a sense of proportion. We have very safe airlines in Australia. This is the first major incident of this kind in more than 20 years. There is no suggestion that this incident was in any way related to an act of terrorism. The Deputy Prime Minister has already pointed out that the passenger who has allegedly offended boarded the aircraft in Melbourne, which is an airport which is subject to a very high level of security checks. I think we have to have a sense of balance and a sense of proportion. We are all concerned about security, we are all concerned about the dangers, but I suggest to the honourable member - and to all honourable members - that it could well be that the causes of this particular attack are causes that could have emanated whether or not we lived in an environment of a heightened threat of terrorism. -  - I am simply saying that, if the honourable member is asking for a reaffirmation of a commitment from this government to putting the maximum resources towards airport security, I give him that reaffirmation. If the honourable member is asking for the expenditure of such an amount of money as would cover all conceivable risks, however remote, no government could give that undertaking, and I do not intend to try to do so.</DOC>

 - When I was looking at the media yesterday, my eye was attracted to an article in the SundayAge. I thank the member for Flinders for asking me a question in relation to it. The Sunday Age reported that, on the basis of the OECD revenue statistics, including social security contributions, Australia is the sixth lowest taxed country in the OECD. In fact, the countries that have lower rates are the United States, Mexico, Korea, Japan and Ireland, marginally below Australia. Above Australia in terms of the tax to GDP ratio, according to the OECD, are countries like New Zealand, Switzerland, Canada, the United Kingdom, Norway, the Netherlands, France, Austria, Belgium, Germany and, of course, all of the Nordic states. According to the OECD, Australia is sixth from the bottom, with some countries which do not have social security systems anything like Australia's, such as Mexico and Korea, the only ones that are below it. That confirms Australia's position as a low tax to GDP country.After reporting that, the Sunday Age reported something else even more interesting. It reported Labor's pledge to cut tax and to spend. This apparently was a speech given to the Fabian Society by none other than the member for Fraser. I have heard of Labor's plans to spend more, because Labor claims more should be spent on Medicare, Labor claims more should be spent on health care agreements, Labor claims more should be spent on pharmaceutical benefits and Labor claims more should be spent in relation to higher education. Labor claims more should be spent in relation to practically every area of government activity. What I did not understand was that Labor plans to increase spending in all of those areas by cutting taxes. I thought to myself, `Why haven't we thought of that before? All you have to do to spend more is to cut taxes.' So I read very carefully as to how this was all going to be done down at the Fabian Society from the member for Fraser - his first big economic outing on how he is going to spend more by cutting taxes. I thought I would get some idea of the taxes he was going to cut, because we all know he thought the tax cuts in the budget Tuesday a fortnight ago were not large enough. Alas, there was no idea at all about how to cut taxes. There was just a grab bag of promises which are unfunded to spend more and cut less. And, of course, we should not leave the third leg of the trifecta out - the promise we had from the member for Hotham. Remember that, BS? BS: bigger surplus Crean. We tax less, spend more and have bigger surpluses - Labor's plan for the economy.I do want to say in defence of the Fabian Society that they did have one person down there who decided that it was time to call Labor's policy for what it was. Dr Keating - not the Keating who was a onetime Treasurer but Dr Michael Keating, former head of the finance department as well as of the Prime Minister's department - slated Labor for criticising Treasurer Peter Costello on the grounds of tax. He said that Labor should instead be considering increasing taxation. He said:Taxation can't be divorced from expenditure needs, and expenditure needs are likely to rise in future ...Dr Michael Keating knows what everybody in Australia knows - that every time the Labor Party promise to spend more, behind it is a promise of increased taxation. They have not changed their spots. They are high tax, high spend, high budget deficit and high interest rates. When it all comes back down at the Fabian Society they stand absolutely exposed on that front.</DOC>

 - I first of all say to the Leader of the Opposition that it is not our plan to limit bulk-billing to pensioners and card holders. That is a completely dishonest, reckless and desperate attempt to smear a policy which is designed to give a balanced response to the needs of the Australian health system at the present time. The reality is that neither the government nor the opposition is trying to undermine Medicare. We both support Medicare. But our method of supporting and improving Medicare is not only more affordable but is infinitely preferable to that of the Labor Party. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Wannon for his question, and I indicate to him that the business indicators released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics today show that inventories increased by 1.6 per cent in the March quarter after falling 0.5 per cent in the December quarter. This suggests that inventories will be substantially contributing to growth in the March quarter, with the national accounts due to be released on Wednesday. In addition, company gross operating profits increased by 1.4 per cent in the March quarter to be 8.6 per cent higher over the year. Company profits were up a very strong 20.7 per cent in the March quarter and are up 44 per cent over the year, which is pretty extraordinary really when you think about the year that the Australian economy has been through in relation to the international downturn, the war in Iraq, the threat of SARS, the increase in oil prices that were brought on by the war and, in addition to that, the drought.Detracting from the March quarter national accounts, however, will be the rural sector. The impact of the rural sector is still flowing through into national accounts and, as has been pointed out before in this House by the Deputy Prime Minister, the minister for agriculture and others, the drought has not yet ended. The drought will be showing up in relation to the March quarter. It is a once-in-a-century drought; the worst ever recorded, according to Australian meteorological records. The main impact is that farm production in 2002-03 is expected to fall by 27 per cent and to detract one per cent from GDP growth. That is an extraordinary detraction from a once-in-a-century drought which has not yet ended. The fact that the Australian nonfarm economy continues to grow so strongly means that Australia continues to lead the industrialised world, notwithstanding such a significant downturn in relation to drought.We hope that the drought will end. It has ended in some parts of Australia but not in all parts. Unless it rains very shortly, winter crops will not be able to be planted and will go through another season without contributing. In terms of farmers, that means that their incomes again will be very subdued and they will be drawing down on the assistance that the government has put in place in relation to drought assistance and farm management deposits.The picture we get of the Australian economy again is this. In the midst of an international downturn and a once-in-a-century drought, the Australian economy continues to grow because the nonagricultural product is strong, led by company profits, underpinned by low interest rates and also underpinned by the fact that the new tax system takes taxes on business inputs out of the system and gives them an opportunity to invest and to grow. We have seen that those factors have been very significant in relation to the figures which have been released today.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Jagajaga for her question. In response to a question from a young person who asked me whether I thought it would be fair to force young people going into medicine to pay $135,000 to do a medical degree, I said, no, I did not think it would be fair and that precisely is not what the government is doing.The persistent and rather repetitive nature of the questions from the opposition suggest that they do not understand the nature of these reforms, so I thought it might be appropriate to explain the reforms to higher education in a way that the opposition might understand. I should firstly say that in relation to medicine the government is increasing by 1,170 over the first five years the number of fully funded HECS places in Australian medical schools. But, having expanded the number of HECS places in medicine, the government is also allowing universities for the first time to offer a full fee paying, unsubsidised government place to an Australian citizen who is eligible for it in the same way that a student from Beijing or Jakarta would be offered one. - Just to explain it in terms that might perhaps be more understandable to the opposition, I was thinking of drivers and mechanics -  - So I thought to myself, let us imagine that a university is a bus. The driver of the bus is quite distressed, quite distracted. The driver has to look back all the time over his shoulder to see what is going on behind him. Into the bus are crowded rows and rows - each row representing a course - of students. They are crammed in, packed into luggage racks and hanging on to the straps in the aisle, and there are rows of mechanics sitting there with their tool boxes. - The government has now come along and said, `Right, we will now buy you a brand-new bus. It's going to be a longer bus; there are going to be a lot more seats on this bus; every person is going to be sitting down on the bus and they are going to have a quality journey as they go through their educational experience.' Let us assume that we are talking about medicine. We have the Vice-Chancellor of the University of New South Wales, Professor Rory Hume, standing at the door counting down the university entrance scores. He goes, `99.7, yes, you've got into medicine; 99.6, yes, you've got in; 99.5, yes, you've got in; 99.4, sorry, you haven't got in.' The vice-chancellor then says, `You can take up another seat in the bus. You can do engineering or you can do science or, if you like, if you've had your heart set on being a doctor since you were a very young girl, we've got a trailer on the back of the bus and you can get into that trailer. You'll get a quality experience in the trailer; you will train to be a doctor in the same way as the people in the bus will train. But, unlike the people in the bus, the taxpayer is not going to pay for three-quarters of your journey; you'll have to pay full tote odds. If you want to, to help you to pay for your trip to study to be a doctor, you'll be able to get a loan from the government.'  -  - Of course, what is happening, as the vice-chancellor is carefully explaining to the student who is disappointed -  - that she missed out on a place in medicine, having wanted to be a doctor since she was five - as he is explaining that there will now be a full fee paying place available in the trailer at the back of the bus - the member for Werriwa is standing on his toolbox and yelling out the window, `Don't let her on. I'm smarter than her. I got a HECS place at university and I don't want any of these people playing the full fare to get in.' - Exactly. It is reverse elitism of the worst possible kind. This government is expanding the number of HECS places that are available at universities, and creating a world-class, quality educational experience for Australian students and future generations. For the first time, those students who miss out on a HECS funded place - which are expanding in number - will be offered full fee paying places and loans to help pay for them. As Maxine McKew asked the member for Melbourne last week in the Bulletin magazine - she asks good questions, this lady, very good questions; I wonder who is having lunch with her this week - where on earth is Labor's blueprint for universities? `I dunno,' says Tanner, `but there's no question we've got a big challenge there.' You sure have.</DOC>

 - First, I thank the member for Curtin for her question. I appreciate that she has an ongoing interest in Zimbabwe after she was there for the Zimbabwe elections as an observer. Beginning today the opposition in Zimbabwe is going to conduct a series of what they call `democracy marches'. It is worth noting that, typically, as a government we would not become involved in the political affairs of other countries. But it is entirely understandable that the opposition in Zimbabwe would want to mount protest action against the oppression of the government. There are reports that the Zimbabwe government is determined to `crush these protests', to use their words. There have been reports of armoured vehicles and soldiers moving into the centre of Harare in preparation to do just that. This government would urge the government of Zimbabwe to exercise restraint and allow people to protest peacefully in a democratic society. After all, the government of Zimbabwe says that it is democratic, in which case it should allow the right of peaceful protest. The situation in Zimbabwe nevertheless continues to deteriorate at every level. In addition, state-sponsored violence, human rights violations, erosions of the rule of law and a general climate of impunity for the regime are features of this crisis. There does not seem to be any short-term prospect of change. It is worth noting that the economy in Zimbabwe is in such a disastrous state that, with an inflation rate of 269 per cent, the Zimbabwe central bank can no longer afford to purchase ink and paper in order to print banknotes. That really is the ultimate definition of the failure of an economy: that they cannot even afford to print banknotes. Zimbabwe was once the bread basket of Africa - or, at least, of southern Africa. Now it can no longer feed its people. The World Food Program estimates that about 7.2 million people in Zimbabwe, which is over half the population, need food aid. - On 20 May I was in London to participate in a meeting of the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group, a group of eight foreign ministers from a selection of Commonwealth countries. It has the job of upholding the Harare Declaration and the Millbrook Plan of Action, and ensuring that the Commonwealth members adhere to the standards set by those documents. While the troika that the Prime Minister presides over is currently responsible for the Commonwealth's response to the issue of Zimbabwe and has suspended Zimbabwe from the councils of the Commonwealth, I did use the opportunity of the CMAG meeting in London to press the other countries participating in that meeting to ensure that the CMAG kept as much pressure on the government of President Robert Mugabe as was possible.The truth, though, is that for one reason or another there is no consensus in CMAG to maintain pressure on the government of President Mugabe. Consequently, I tabled a paper in the CMAG meeting highlighting the problems of Zimbabwe so that the governments and, of course, the ministers would be a little more aware of the seriousness of the situation in Zimbabwe than they might otherwise have been. I table that paper in the House today because I know that it will be of interest to a number of members of the House who are interested in the issue of Zimbabwe.Let me just say in conclusion that the Prime Minister, through the troika, has been responsible for the suspension of Zimbabwe from the councils of the Commonwealth. We will continue as best we can to place pressure on the government of Zimbabwe to engage in dialogue with the Movement for Democratic Change, to uphold international norms of human rights and to start to make some progress in restoring the Zimbabwean economy. But the responsibility does not just rest on us; it rests in particular on other countries in southern Africa. We urge Zimbabwe's neighbours to continue to do everything they possibly can to persuade the Zimbabwe administration to undertake a substantial program of reform. </DOC>

 - In relation to the question asked by the honourable member, and to dates in particular, I will endeavour to find out from my diary what dates may be relevant to the question asked. In terms of my knowledge of this issue, I became aware of it on reading an article in the Sydney Morning Herald of Saturday, 2 February 2002. I do not involve myself in fundraising. -  - I observe the Liberal Party's fundraising code, which is quite prescriptive in terms of -  - It is quite prescriptive in relation to the way in which we should engage ourselves in fundraising events - not to collect money, but to leave it to office bearers of the party to be involved in those matters. That is the case with me. The Berowra -  - The Berowra federal electorate conference of the Liberal Party from time to time receives donations and, as required by the Electoral Act - let me make it very clear - those matters are properly reported and included in the party's return. The time at which I became aware -  - The time at which I became aware that a substantial donation had been made -  - As I said, I do not ask for my party organisation to tell me who has donated. These matters frequently, as in this case - in terms of the quantum of the donation involved - come to my attention when they are reported, and publicly reported -  - And not before. - No, I did not know. I did not know. - I did become aware of it when it was reported in the press, when somebody had been trawling through the party's returns. It came in an article in the Sydney Morning Herald on Saturday, 2 February 2002 under the heading `Froggy went a'courting ALP'. It said:The discredited former head of Froggy.com, Karl Suleman, was one of the biggest donors to the Labor Party last year, new records released ... by the Electoral Commission reveal.Mr Suleman, whose private companies are under investigation ... gave about $170,000 to the NSW branch of the ALP ...Told yesterday of the donations, the liquidator of Mr Suleman's companies, Neil Cussen - when asked whether he would investigate whether he could retrieve any of the money on behalf of the investors - said ... `They are of interest to us. We will be looking at any transactions like this.'But Labor's NSW secretary, Eric Roozendaal, told the Herald yesterday that Mr Suleman's donations had already gone. - This is an old report - it has been around since 2002 for people to ask questions about if they were serious. It is not a matter about which questions should have been asked but, the fact is, they have sought to ask them. In this story it was made clear that the ALP, when asked if it would refund the donation when the company had been liquidated, said, `Unfortunately, all those contributions went towards the federal election and they have been spent.' Too bad. Given what happened last week, I anticipated that you might bring forward a question like this. In relation to that, my department advises me that, since the beginning of 2002, New South Wales officers of my department have approved 23 religious worker nominations and 10 religious worker visas. The nominations are broader - they cover the person who might be nominated. Again, that does not mean a religious visa is granted; that is a nomination. There were 13 employer scheme nominations of which 10 have resulted in nomination scheme visas. I have also been advised by my department that there have been no ministerial intervention cases related to the monastery.</DOC>

The government has been very concerned to hear that Aung San Suu Kyi, who is the secretary-general of the National League for Democracy in Burma, has been taken into custody, and so too have a number of other senior members of the National League for Democracy. These actions were taken by the Burmese authorities ostensibly in response to incidents that took place on 30 May when there were clashes between Aung San Suu Kyi supporters and pro-government supporters in the northern part of Burma. Aung San Suu Kyi was travelling in that part of the country at the time. I understand that around four people were killed and 50 were injured in those confrontations. It is the view of the Australian government that this is not a justification to detain Aung San Suu Kyi and her supporters. The government urges her release immediately. I instructed our ambassador in Rangoon to convey the government's concerns straightaway to the Burmese authorities. This morning I had my department call in the Burmese Ambassador here in Canberra also to explain our concerns and call for the release of Aung San Suu Kyi and her supporters. I note that the United Nations Secretary-General's special envoy on Burma, Mr Razali, is due to visit Burma on Friday of this week. I hope that during his visit it will be possible for him to take up with the Burmese government these concerns of the detention of Aung San Suu Kyi. Indeed, I very much hope she is released by that time.But there is a broader and more fundamental issue, and that is that the Burmese authorities have for quite some time professed that they would be prepared to re-engage in dialogue with the National League for Democracy with a view to taking forward Burma's constitutional development. It is very disappointing that, although there have been talks from time to time between the two sides, a high level of dialogue - which the Burmese authorities, the SPDC, committed themselves to - has still not taken place, despite an assurance given to our ambassador in Rangoon in the last few days when he made a farewell call on the Foreign Minister of Burma. We very much hope that if Mr Razali continues with his visit to Burma at the end of this week he will be able to have some success in encouraging the Burmese authorities to understand the importance of engaging in serious dialogue about constitutional reform and the liberalisation of governance in Burma, and the upholding of international norms of human rights.</DOC>

 - I am broadly aware of the newspaper reports that the member for Reid refers me to. Let me make three simple points. The first point is that members of parliament and ministers are not responsible for the administration of Liberal Party fundraising, and should not be responsible for the administration of Labor Party fundraising - I do not know what the arrangements are on the other side of this chamber. The second point is that, if anything untoward has happened in respect of any fundraising and any disclosure, it will no doubt be looked at by the Australian Electoral Commission, which will take appropriate action. The third point is that it is not unusual at all for political parties to amend their disclosures. In fact, I am advised that the national Australian Labor Party has amended its disclosure for the relevant year twice. I am advised that the Australian Labor Party ACT branch has amended its disclosure twice. I am advised the Australian Labor Party NSW branch has amended its disclosure once. The Northern Territory branch has amended its disclosure once. The South Australian branch has made one amendment to its disclosure. The Queensland branch has amended its disclosure twice. The Victorian branch has amended its disclosure twice. What has happened with the matter in question is entirely in accordance with the usual practices of political parties. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Paterson for his question. As the Treasurer mentioned just a few moments ago, the drought in Australia is far from over. There is some welcome rain outside, and in some parts of Australia the wheat planting has been able to commence - particularly in Western Australia but there has also been some quite good plantings in parts of the eastern states - but in other areas there has not yet been adequate rain to enable planting to commence. In other places, the crops that have just come up are already starting to face some stress.So whilst there has been rain in some places - indeed, in some of the city areas and on the coast, quite generous rain - the reality is that most of the drought stricken areas of Australia are still facing significant difficulties. The Commonwealth is continuing to assist drought stricken farmers. On the latest figures I have received, 14,600 Australian farm families are now receiving income support and 3,480 are receiving interest assistance. The Commonwealth remains committed to helping drought stricken farmers through these difficult times.The honourable member asked whether other benefits are being withdrawn. I have already reported to the House on a number of occasions that the Victorian government, as soon as the state election was over, revoked drought assistance in the state of Victoria - a despicable action which demonstrated that Victoria's drought assistance was all about election stunts, not about providing real assistance to farmers.I can recall warning, before the New South Wales state election, that a similar thing was likely to happen in New South Wales. I am sorry to report to the House that that indeed is precisely what is happening. Not with any fanfare, but quietly and secretly, the New South Wales government have been delisting areas that were previously eligible to receive drought assistance. On their web site over the last four to six weeks, you see that New South Wales have delisted from areas eligible to receive drought assistance parts of the Tweed-Lismore area, parts of Kempsey, parts of Gloucester, parts of Moree, parts of Tamworth, parts of the Walgett Rural Lands Protection Board and all of the Narrabri, Northern Slopes and Maitland Rural Lands Protection Boards. The farmers in those areas are no longer eligible to receive any assistance from the New South Wales government. This was all done quietly on their web site. Indeed, the farmers in Tamworth were reported in the Northern Daily Leader on Friday as saying that they were not told about the fact that the drought relief had been axed until three weeks later - when I made it clear in their local media that it had been withdrawn by the New South Wales government. The New South Wales government did not even have the courage to tell them that they had axed their drought relief. This is an area that is receiving exceptional circumstances assistance from the Commonwealth. Indeed, some of the other areas where the New South Wales government have axed their relief are, we are told, going to be the subject of new EC applications. So New South Wales is asking the Commonwealth to declare these areas to be in exceptional circumstances while they are quietly revoking their eligibility for state assistance.What a contrast that is with the occasions when the drought assistance was announced. Premier Carr was rushing around New South Wales with plane loads of journalists to make announcement after announcement about drought assistance for the farmers. I am told there were over 50 announcements. Most of them were pretty empty and provided very little assistance, but there he was with all these journalists from outer Sydney and the metropolitan media to announce drought assistance for the farmers. But is Premier Carr travelling around the drought stricken areas of New South Wales to announce he has revoked the assistance?The reality is that we are seeing the collapse of the facade of care for drought affected areas. As soon as the state elections were over, the Labor Party were no longer interested in the concerns of drought affected farmers. This is a despicable action by the New South Wales state government - following on the lead of Victoria. They have no concern for farmers. This roll back of drought aid is the only roll-back we have heard from Labor for a long time, and they ought to be ashamed of it.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Moore for his question. I can inform him that, in April, the number of Australian workplace agreements that have been registered since 1998 reached 334,000. Nearly 10,000 Australian workplace agreements were registered in April alone. That is a 50 per cent increase on April last year and a 100 per cent increase on April 2001.It is not surprising that workers and managers should be embracing Australian workplace agreements, because they invariably mean better work practices and that means higher productivity, which means higher pay and higher profits can go hand in hand. According to the most recent available data, the average worker on an Australian workplace agreement earns $895 a week, compared to the average worker on a federally registered certified agreement who is earning only $721 a week. I have been asked about Western Australia. I can inform the member for Moore that, under the Court government, there were more than 200,000 Western Australian workplace agreements. These were abolished by the incoming Gallop government and replaced by a form of individual contract subject not only to the no disadvantage test but also to a form of union veto. Since May of last year, there have been 37,000 Australian workplace agreements registered in Western Australia. How many Western Australian individual contracts have been registered? Not 10,000, not 1,000, not even 100 - just 12 Western Australian individual contracts have been registered. This flight from the Western Australian system is a vote of confidence in the federal system. The Gallop government set these contracts up to fail, and fail they have. While the Gallop government's policies are failing, Western Australian workers and managers are embracing the freedom and fairness of the federal system in ever increasing numbers.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Deakin for his question. For the past 18 months, the Australian Labor Party have been hiding behind the member for Perth's so-called review of private health insurance and refusing to come clean as to whether they will strip Australian families of the 30 per cent private health insurance rebate. If they take the rebate off ancillaries, which has been suggested, this will slug Australian families who have private health insurance an extra $230 a year. And if they remove the whole private health insurance rebate, that will mean a tax slug of $750 to Australian families who have such insurance. Just last week, the opposition again suggested slashing the rebate when they asked: ... why does the rebate apply to ancillaries? Could you contemplate a system where the rebate was capped so far as individual payments are concerned and means tested so far as individual payments are concerned?This is a statement from the shadow spokesman for health, the member for Perth. So we know what Labor will do; they are considering a range of options, including rolling back the entire private health insurance rebate, capping means testing and taking it off the ancillaries. This means that they should explain to those nine million Australians that going to the dentist, getting new spectacles or having physiotherapy treatment, for example, will be 30 per cent more expensive under the Labor Party. They should explain why those one million people on incomes of less than $20,000 a year are going to be slugged up to $750 in tax increases under the Labor Party should they ever win government. The ALP will not come clean about this but we know that they are a high-taxing party when they are in government. One thing that Australians should know is that private health insurance will always be 30 per cent cheaper under this government.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Watson for his question. I think I answered that matter in large part last week and I was going to refresh my memory, so the figures I will use are indicative. Under section 417, I am advised it is about 1,100 - maybe a little higher - and under section 351, I think the number is about 600. That would be from amongst at least 20,000 rejected asylum claims. I think I also advised the House last week that it was something in the order of 80 cases where I had intervened when approached on a second occasion. The point I made last week was that I asked the department not to refer matters to me again after initial requests unless there is fresh information that warrants me looking at the matter.I advised the House last week that I had one case in which I had been approached on a second occasion by the Leader of the Opposition and had intervened. In the case of the member for Reid, I think I advised that there had been five cases where Mr Ferguson subsequently approached me where the initial request for consideration had been declined. - I do not know.  - No, I do not. I will ask. I only make the point that, if new and additional information has been provided to me, it would be churlish of me not to look at it.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Herbert for his question and acknowledge that he is one of the great supporters and defenders of the Great Barrier Reef - Australia's greatest natural icon. Two weeks ago I was in Brisbane to release the draft water quality protection plan - a program that seeks to protect the quality of water flowing into the Great Barrier Reef lagoon from the threat of sediments and nutrients. Today I am pleased to announce another major effort by the Howard government to protect the Great Barrier Reef and put it on a sustainable basis for the long term.This morning I released the draft zoning plan under the representative areas program for the reef, which increases the high protection zones on the reef from some 4.5 per cent of the reef to over 30 per cent. The effect of this plan will be to put the reef on a long-term sustainable basis. It will lead to an increase in the fish in the reef and the size of those fish. It is a plan which has been welcomed up and down the Queensland coast and across Australia.The reason why this plan has been so widely welcomed and received is the highly consultative process used by the government to develop the plan. Thus far, there have been something like 1,500 community service announcements on regional television in Queensland and 38,000 hits on the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park's web site, leading to some 10,000 submissions being available to help draw up the plan. I am delighted with the response from interest groups in Queensland, particularly from the recreational fishers. The member for Herbert drew my attention to a report in this morning's Townsville Bulletin, quoting Mr David Bateman, Chief Executive Officer of Sunfish Queensland - the major representative organisation for recreational fishers - who said:What they've come up with, with the increased yellow zones throughout the marine park, will give our members the space to go fishing, and we consider it very reasonable. We're extremely happy with the way in which it has been done ...I also draw attention to the fact that some 95 per cent of the area currently open for commercial trawling remains open under the plan. In particular, of course, the plan has been welcomed by the billion-dollar tourist industry on the Great Barrier Reef. The tourist industry attracts people to the reef through its thriving biodiversity - the fish populations, the coral, the dugong and the other animals that frequent the reef. This plan will make sure that that tourist industry has a secure basis to plan for the future. The Howard government is determined to protect the Great Barrier Reef for our children and for future generations, and this plan is one of the most important steps that have ever been taken to achieve this objective.</DOC>

 - As I have said in a number of interviews over the last 24 hours, as a government we are happy with the assessments that were made by the Office of National Assessments and other rather more specific intelligence agencies in the firmament of the Australian intelligence community. We have had no reason to question the overall assessments that have been made. I have explained also on a number of occasions - and I think the opposition has been briefed on our intelligence from time to time, if memory serves me well - that we receive an enormous amount of information, both publicly available information and intelligence from our intelligence partners in a number of countries, not just the United States and the United Kingdom. And we have our own intelligence collection capabilities.In the end, we have to make overall assessments. You cannot take every single piece of intelligence and give it equal weight. Some intelligence is rather poor; some intelligence is extraordinarily good. In the end, overall assessments are made. The Office of National Assessments has a particular role here, because it is one - though it is not the only one - of the agencies that makes those overall assessments. ONA is today confident - as it was before the war - in the judgment that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction materials and WMD capability in the lead-up to the war. ONA is continuing to assess the scope and nature of that capability in the light of post-conflict investigations.The House may be interested to know that the coalition partners - the United States, Great Britain and Australia - have established an investigation team of about 1,300 or 1,400 people. There are a number of Australians in that group. They are beginning the enormously substantial task of trying to put together a comprehensive picture of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction capabilities under Saddam Hussein's regime. This will take months of work. Not only is there a need to investigate a very large number of sites but there is also a need to investigate, over and above that, a large number of scientists. - Mr Speaker, the question covered just about every aspect of the issue of weapons of mass destruction in relation to Saddam Hussein's regime. I remind the House of the pride that we on this side of the House have in the role we played in contributing to the overthrow of Saddam Hussein's regime and changing the whole nature of Middle East power politics very much for the better.As I was saying before I was interrupted, this team will not only have to investigate particular locations - and there are many locations for it to investigate - but also discuss the issue and interview scientists. There were believed to be some 3,000 Iraqi scientists - that kind of number - involved in the weapons of mass destruction programs. It will take a good deal of time for those investigations and discussions - those two processes - to take place. Over time - and it will take time; we have to be patient - we will get a comprehensive view of Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction programs. The ONA assessments and the general overall assessments from my department were pretty good. I have no reason to doubt those assessments. My department, I thought, explained this very comprehensively at the Senate estimates committee hearings yesterday. They did a very good job of explaining the basis of their assessments, of ONA's assessments and so on. In the end, we will, of course, learn a great deal more about Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction programs from the interviews with the scientists than UNMOVIC was ever able to obtain. That will develop a fascinating and comprehensive picture of what Saddam Hussein was up to.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I appreciate his interest. The House will be aware that the G8 met in Evian on Lake Geneva in France. They issued a statement on 2 June highlighting the danger that the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery pose to us all. I think this is very important because it is an argument we have been making for a long time: the greatest threats to international security are weapons of mass destruction in the hands of rogue or dangerous states - irresponsible states - and the risk of the transfer of that technology to terrorist organisations. This is the greatest security threat the world faces today. The eight leaders at the Evian summit absolutely addressed that issue. We welcome the G8 leaders' action plan to prevent terrorists from getting access to radiological materials to make what are often described as dirty bombs - radiological bombs.We have played a longstanding and active role in ensuring the security and safety of these materials. The House may be interested to know that we are to run a course for ASEAN countries in November to assist the ASEAN countries with physical protection of nuclear materials and radiological sources. The G8 leaders, including Russia, unanimously urged North Korea to visibly, verifiably and irreversibly dismantle any nuclear weapons programs. I think it is encouraging that even Russia, which is a traditional friend of North Korea, signed up to that statement. It is also encouraging that the G8 meeting called on all countries to establish measures to control the transfer of weapons of mass destruction related materials. Australia is one of several countries that have been invited by the United States to explore practical ideas to coordinate efforts to curb weapons of mass destruction and missile proliferation. Such arrangements might include interdicting and disrupting the flow of WMD related materials to and from a country like North Korea. I know the Prime Minister discussed this with President Bush at the Crawford meeting last month. It was a significant component of my discussions with Japanese ministers a couple of weeks ago - the Japanese foreign minister, the Prime Minister and the minister responsible for Japan's self-defence agency, Minister Ishiba.We are under no illusions as to how difficult it will be to interdict WMD materials - it will be extremely difficult. But the importance of this issue does require a coordinated and immediate international response. North Korea and other countries that wish to get involved in this illicit trade - this highly dangerous trade - need to understand that the international community will not tolerate their involvement in activities that, in the end, threaten regional and global security.</DOC>

 - In response to the Leader of the Opposition, I have not remembered everything I said, but I could well have said words to that effect. I am very grateful that the Leader of the Opposition has asked a question about foreign debt because today's figures revealed that the debt servicing ratio is now the lowest since March 1983. And what happened in March 1983? That was the election of the Hawke Labor government. I take the opportunity of not only pointing that out but also reminding the Leader of the Opposition of some of the other things I said before the election in 1996. I said that we would reduce the level of unemployment, and we have. I said we would reduce the level of interest rates, and we have. I said we would run budget surpluses, and we have done that on six consecutive occasions. I said we would lift the living standards of the Australian people, and we have. I said we would increase the real wages of Australian workers, and we have done so in contrast to the Labor Party, who boasted about having driven those living standards down. I look forward to another question from the Leader of the Opposition.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Kooyong for his question and I acknowledge, because he has raised these issues with me before, his interest in the circumstances of East Timorese rejected asylum seekers. I also acknowledge that there have been a number of members who have also expressed interest in this particular matter. Some of them have seen me and others have spoken on these matters, some in the short statements made by members and others for, I think, Sunday television. The point that was being made -  - The member for Prospect and the member for Sydney, I acknowledge. Bearing in mind that some people have endeavoured to draw implications about the processing of East Timorese and other matters, I felt it appropriate to indicate to the House that I have been considering for some time the circumstances of those who have made applications under section 417. While I ordinarily would not put into the public arena the nature of the outcome of that processing, I think in this case I should.The first point I would make is that the government determined some time ago that it was not an appropriate course to follow that a special class of visa be introduced for all East Timorese. The reason for that was that the circumstances may vary from case to case. The government took the view that I should continue to process these matters individually and to take into account the circumstances that were raised.My department has been handing down primary decisions on protection visa applications for the East Timorese since 25 September last year. As at 27 May, some 1,617 applications had been refused; another 203 applicants had been granted another type of visa, had departed from Australia or had withdrawn from the process; and 80 East Timorese were still awaiting a primary decision. All applications are being assessed in accordance with the standard protection visa criteria, and the East Timorese have had an opportunity to provide further information in the light of current country information. As at 27 May, 1,000 East Timorese have been before the Refugee Review Tribunal or are within the review application window. Some 590 have received decisions affirming the primary decision.I do not know where all the representations I have had have come from in relation to these matters, but I have to say that, save for the interest of a small number of my colleagues from Victoria and the Northern Territory, the preponderance of representations have been by members of the opposition. I acknowledge that. I do not impugn your motives; I do not question them; I do not ask whether anybody has made any donations or whether -  - Yes, I know you do, because you are about impugning people's motives. - You are about impugning motives. - To reaffirm what I have said, I have received representations, and predominantly from members of the other side of the House. To date I have received submissions involving well over 500 East Timorese. In relation to the representations that they have been receiving, members should have received letters from me with respect to some particular matters, but generally on behalf of some 379 people I have stated a preparedness, subject to character and health issues being resolved satisfactorily, to intervene. - Some 379. I have at this stage determined not to intervene in relation to two. I have asked further questions in relation to another three and there are some 200 who are still being considered. I simply make the point that the sorts of factors that people have suggested that I took into account in other matters have been very much to the fore in my consideration of these matters - and well before any issues were raised in the House.</DOC>

 - The last time I was asked a question about what I had previously said on the question of HECS, particularly in relation to loans, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition was caught out having misled the parliament. - I will take the opportunity of checking what I have said on that subject before I give any currency to the assertion made by the Leader of the Opposition.But I want to take a moment to typify what is happening in relation to universities. We have a HECS arrangement in this country because it was sensibly proposed by the former government and sensibly supported by the former opposition - the Liberal and National parties. On this occasion, fast-forward to us being in government, the contrast could not be starker. We are proposing sensible changes to the universities and what is the opposition doing? Instead of doing what we did in 1989 and supporting a necessary change, what they are doing is taking the cheap political trick of opposing it. Let the opposition go on doing that. I invite the opposition to go on doing that between now and the next election so that once again the Australian people will have a choice between a Liberal-National Party government that believes in something and a Labor opposition whose only currency in politics is to oppose; whose only currency in politics is to take the cheap trick. Many of the reforms which the former government was responsible for, and for which they are given credit from time to time by me, were made possible because the opposition did not try to frustrate them in the Senate. We did not try to frustrate them because we thought they were in the long-term interests of our nation. The Labor Party does not care about the long-term interests of our nation; it only cares about short-term political opportunism. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Sturt for his question. -  - I can advise the House that the balance of payments for the March quarter showed a narrowing from the December quarter, coming in at $10.1 billion as compared to $11.2 billion in December. In percentage terms, this was a narrowing to 5.4 per cent of GDP from the December quarter's six per cent and it compares with the current account of 6½ per cent recorded in 1986, in 1990 and in 1995. It is estimated that today's balance of payments will subtract about 0.2 per cent from the March quarter GDP growth, which will be significantly less than the distraction in the December quarter. - The area that showed the greatest downturn was the volume of rural exports, which fell 12.9 per cent in the March quarter to their lowest level since 1996. Exports of non-rural goods increased 0.9 per cent but the volume of rural exports fell by 12.9 per cent. What this is showing is that Australia's balance of payments is being affected by the most extensive drought in Australian history, which is biting into agricultural exports. However, not only do we continue to trade strongly in terms of non-rural exports but, because the Australian economy is running stronger than comparable economies around the world, you have a strong Australian economy which is holding up imports and you have a weak world which is attacking Australia's markets. You also have the worst and the most extensive drought in Australian history.The foreign debt figures which were released today showed that the net foreign debt was 49.3 per cent of GDP, a little below the peak of 50.2 per cent in the March quarter of 2001. As the Prime Minister has already said, the debt servicing ratio has fallen to 8.3 per cent of export income, the lowest since 1983, since the election of the Hawke-Keating Labor governments.Tomorrow we will receive the national accounts, which come at a very difficult time. We have the international downturn, we have the SARS threat to tourism and particularly Asia, and we have the most extensive drought in Australian history. If the Australian economy can continue to grow in those circumstances, it will be one of the leading economies of the industrialised world.I will make one last point in relation to foreign debt. One of the big differences between foreign debt today and foreign debt during the Labor Party's banana republic period is that the government is not borrowing. None of that foreign debt is a government borrowing, because this government is repaying Labor's debt. By the end of June 2000 this government will have retired, in net terms, $63 billion of Labor Party debt. What that meant was not only did we have to drive the budget back into balance against a $10 billion deficit but, having driven it back into balance and delivered surpluses, we have in net terms now been able to retire $63 billion of Labor Party debt. That is future opportunity for young Australians. Instead of carrying the millstone of Labor debt around their necks, they will have the opportunity to be one of the lead economies of the world under a low interest rate environment which gives young homeowners the opportunity to buy their own homes and gives them a start in life which only a coalition government can do. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Throsby for her question and for recognising that the government has developed over the course of the last year a comprehensive reform program for Australian higher education which is intended to ensure that Australia's economic and social development is on a sound footing for the next 25 years and beyond. I also thank the member for Throsby for pointing out that one of the key initiatives in this package is to make $122.6 million available over four years for regional universities. In fact, there are 31 universities in 54 campuses that will benefit from additional loading in recognition of the need toprovide educational services in remote and regional parts of Australia. What the member for Throsby and others on the other side need to do is, firstly, to acquaint themselves with the serious issues that face our higher education; secondly, to support the $1.5 billion additional public investment that this government is proposing to put in over the next four years; and, thirdly, to support the significant initiatives which put more resources into the teaching of teachers and nurses: 31,500 extra HECS places over the first five years alone and $183 million to bring students from the periphery to the centre of the university experience with quality teaching and learning. In relation to a whole variety of initiatives in this package, if the member for Throsby were serious, for a start, she would be listening and, secondly, she would be most welcome to come along and discuss with me any of the concerns that she has about this.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for La Trobe for his question and his vital interest in this matter. During the last election campaign, the coalition government increased its commitment to the Pakenham bypass from the previously announced $30 million to $100 million. It ought to be understood at the outset that this is for a road that is a state responsibility. It is not one of ours; it is a state responsibility. But we recognise the very real transport needs of Melbourne.  - Unlike the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Batman, we have been prepared to make a very substantial contribution in the interests of the travelling public in that state. Let me spell this out for a moment. The federal government did not have to contribute to this road. Under Labor - and this ought to be remembered - not one red cent would have been available. They did not have a RONI program. They did not have the capacity to fund these sorts of urgently needed infrastructure projects for the benefit of Melburnians. Not only did we introduce this valuable program; we have committed no less than three-quarters of a billion dollars in the state of Victoria - spent and, in the process of being spent, if only we can get some integrity out of the Victorian government.At the time that I announced that we were increasing our contribution to this road of such interest to the member for La Trobe, I made a statement responding to the claim by the Victorian government that it was an election stunt. It was such an election stunt that the $100 million is there in the forward estimates. We are ready to start spending this year - it is a lot of money - but they said, `No, it's an election stunt.' At the time I made the comment:The Federal Coalition's promise of funds for both of these projects is rock solid. We don't make paper promises, unlike the ALP in Victoria which signs meaningless cardboard cheques to show its supposed support for big road projects, then fails to follow through.In building on that, I am sure people are aware that the federal government is dependent upon state government costings for these projects. This has created a bit of a problem for us because the Victorian government seems extraordinarily unable to get its figures right. At the time of our commitment of $100 million to Pakenham, that was equivalent to half the cost as advised to us by Victoria. What has happened since then? It has blown out. We made a commitment to half of the estimated cost at that time, signed and agreed to at a cost of $200 million. Now we are being accused of breaking our word, because Victoria's cost estimates are blown out by $42 million in this case.The member for McMillan claims that we have broken our promise on this. We have not. What the member for McMillan ought to be explaining to his constituents is very simple. It is this: the Liberal-National Party government has been extraordinarily generous in providing half of the estimated cost - a very large cost - and a cost to us of $100 million in a way that the federal ALP would never have made available because they did not have such a program.Opposition members - Rubbish! - `Rubbish'? Where was the ALP's program? Where was their RONI program? Where was the program under which they would have provided three-quarters of a billion dollars for Victorian roads?  - It was going to come in the 14th year? Sorry, I should have known! It might be useful to take members opposite down memory lane and over to the wild west side of Melbourne for a moment. If you can get through all of the notorious Victorian speed cameras - the ones designed, regardless of how many people stop speeding, to catch no less than two out of three Victorian motorists in the coming year while they are supposed to believe it is about safety and not about revenue raising. What sort of budget do they operate down there? If you can get through all those speed cameras and emerge out on the other side of Melbourne, you will come to a gleaming new piece of work called the Geelong Road. We half-funded that one as well. We signed a commitment to put up $120 million of the $240 million cost. You know what? It blew out, too. There is no doubt about the Victorians. It blew out to around $270 million. Our commitment remained the same and the Victorian government funded, as they rightly should have, the blow-out.My memory is jogged, I am afraid, in relation to another road down there called Scoresby. It would not have been jogged except that the Leader of the Opposition, in what I would have to describe as an extraordinary lapse of judgment, has allowed one of his backbenchers to draw attention not only to our extraordinary generosity in providing all of this money - not only to the three-quarters of a billion dollars we are providing for state roads - but also to their own duplicity in relation to Scoresby. The member for McMillan has put on notice a matter of public importance which reads:The breaking of election commitments by the Commonwealth Government relating to ... Roads of National Importance Projects.The breaking of election commitments? What about Scoresby? This is a major project which, interestingly enough, is of very great interest to the member for Hotham's electorate. His constituents want to know how it has come about that when we said we would fund this road he and his spokesman immediately went out to say that this had been a longstanding objective of the Leader of the Opposition and that he unequivocally supported the building of the Scoresby freeway. - He does - freeway. He wants it built. Why won't he come clean and declare whether or not it should be a freeway or a tollway? Why not? The Leader of the Opposition's constituents want to know. But because the Leader of the Opposition will not point out to his constituents the realities of life, I will. This was a project that also blew out massively in cost. - I do not think I have ever heard a couple of points of order reveal such sensitivity. They do not like having exposed the simple reality here that, in the incompetence of the Leader of the Opposition in allowing this matter to be put up as a matter of public importance, he has not only draw attention to the extraordinary generosity of this government in dealing with the transport needs of the Victorians that he purports to represent, he has also jogged our collective memories on the extraordinary indecency of the Labor Party in signing an MOU committing to a freeway, which, I might add, in closing, was estimated originally to cost $400 million, and we committed half of that, which has blown out to nearly $900 million. We have committed to half of that. It is all sitting there, frozen in the forward estimates, available the minute we see a bit of a show of integrity from the Victorian Labor government and a return to the conditions of the MOU - a freeway for the people who will benefit from it, including the Leader of the Opposition and his constituents. Thank you, again, for drawing attention to our generosity and our integrity in dealing with this matter.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Jagajaga for the question, because it is a very important one. There are a number of issues intertwined throughout this question. The first is the loans that are available for full-fee-paying students, who represent about 1.7 per cent of all students in undergraduate courses in Australian universities. We are not talking, at the moment, about the 98.3 per cent of students who are in HECS funded places - places which will be expanding by 31,500 over five years under this package. The second important point which is obviously implicit in the question is that, having totally opposed full-fee-paying opportunities for Australian students, the Labor Party's position now is that the government should lend more than $50,000 to those full-fee-paying Australian students. We will take that submission on board. For the record, it should be pointed out that the 1.7 per cent - that is, 9,316 - of full-fee-paying Australian students in Australian universities are in 784 courses. There are 264 students, in 13 of those courses, who are currently paying $100,000 or more. The government's reform package proposes that, in addition to the 1,170 extra HECS funded medical student places that will be put into the system over the next five years - beginning with 234 next year - for the first time, a student who has done extremely well at school and who has wanted to be a doctor all of his or her life will be offered the opportunity to take up a fee-paying place. The $150,000 to which Professor Gilbert refers emphasises the extent of the public subsidy which exists for HECS funded places. The Labor Party is now arguing that the government's $50,000 loan at 3½ per cent plus CPI capped at 10 years, which will cover two-thirds of all full-fee-paying places - including places in a Master of Business Administration at the Macquarie Graduate School of Management - needs to be raised. We will take that on board.On this issue of fees and loans there are couple of points that must be made. I draw your attention, firstly, to the comments of Mr Ross Gittins, who I think is one of the finest economic commentators in the country. On 28 May in the Sydney Morning Herald he wrote:I have long known how easy it is for unscrupulous political operators to panic [people]....	...	...With its repeated references to kids emerging from university with $100,000 debts, the debate has given people a quite exaggerated impression of the extent to which Brendan Nelson's plan would add to debt levels. The opposition parties and interest groups have used several tricks to mislead us.First, they've got people's thinking muddled between two separate things: the changes to the HECS scheme and the changes to the arrangements for full-fee-paying places.In Adelaide, David Bevan and Matt Abraham run a program on the ABC, as would be well known to the member for Makin and the member for Sturt, for example. On 20 May 2003 they interviewed the member for Jagajaga. She said:When I go to primary schools, parents are saying to me, `Gee, are we going to have to start saving almost from that time to make sure we can afford to send our children to university?' - And, Prime Minister -  - credit must be given where it is due to these two ABC commentators. David Bevan then said:And you would say to them, `No, of course not,' because there is a loans scheme here if your child wants to take a higher degree - they can take out a loan. They won't have to pay it back until they start earning over $30,000, so there is nothing to worry about.' You would say that to them, wouldn't you?Then she said, `Oh, well - ' and then five days later we got a press release from the member for Jagajaga entitled `Start saving now for your baby's university education'. It says:Parents with a baby born today should immediately begin saving up to $44 a week if they want to be able to afford to send their child to university, Deputy Labor leader Jenny Macklin said today. As Professor Mary Kalantzis, President of the Australian Council of Deans of Education - not a longstanding supporter of the government's policies - said in Campus Review last week, `The government has preserved HECS and effectively abolished up-front fees.' The point here is, as the member for Jagajaga herself was quoted as saying in the Sunday Tasmanian on 25 May:`It's a shocking waste of talent to have people who want to go to university frightened off by the debt' ... `It's no good for students, families or the country.'I could not agree more. It is not good. It is irresponsible. It is a manipulation of the emotions of everyday Australians to mislead them into believing something which could not be further from the truth. This government is opening opportunities for all Australians. What we are proposing to do is not only put a lot more money into Australian universities but also open opportunities to Australians who are no less deserving than those students who come from other countries.</DOC>

 - First of all, I thank the honourable member for his question. I know he has a lot of interest in the efforts we are making with our regional neighbours to address the problem of terrorism. It is a profoundly important and serious issue for all of us, and no doubt Australians will forever remember the Bali bombings and the consequences of that for so many people.A great deal of progress has been made in working with our regional partners to address the issue of terrorism, certainly with Indonesia but also with a range of other countries. I know the House will be interested to hear that under the auspices of the ASEAN Regional Forum, which is the Asia-Pacific's regional security forum, Australia and Singapore are co-hosting a workshop on managing the consequences of a major terrorist attack. This workshop is to take place in Darwin and is under way this week. The workshop will be chaired by Nick Warner who, as many honourable members will know, was formerly the High Commissioner in Papua New Guinea and is now Australia's very able Ambassador for Counter-Terrorism.The workshop is looking for really practical ways to build regional capability in managing the consequences of a terrorist attack. I do not think we should overestimate for a minute the capacity throughout the region to be able to deal with the consequences of a terrorist attack. What this workshop is doing is looking at realistic situations and problems, including urban search and rescue, dealing with structural collapse and forensic aspects of the criminal investigation following a major terrorist attack - drawing in particular here, of course, on the joint experience of Australia and Indonesia in investigating the Bali atrocity.This is the first time that the countries of the Asia-Pacific collectively have met to discuss a capability to respond to a chemical, biological or radiological attack. I am particularly pleased that this should happen in Australia, that the meeting should be chaired by the Australian Ambassador for Counter-Terrorism, and that we should share the running of this meeting with our friends in Singapore. It is a very interesting and very typical illustration of the enormous cooperation that there is now between Australia and our regional partners on counter-terrorism. By the way, I am delighted that the Vice Governor of Bali is attending the workshop. He is going to speak about how that tourist destination, so loved by many Australians and so marred by the tragedy of 12 October last year, is starting to recover following that terrible attack. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Cunningham for his question. I must say that the member for Cunningham has, on a number of occasions, asked me specific questions in relation to higher education in an informal environment and has shown, unlike others in this place, continuing interest in the issue. One of the things that the government realises is very important for embracing reform in Australian higher education - including the things that might be less popular than other aspects - in order to build a stronger country is providing additional resources to universities in regions, particularly those servicing education needs in remote parts of the country. As I said in response to an earlier question, there are 31 universities on 54 campuses that will receive extra money, ranging from 2½ per cent loading to five per cent, to 7½ per cent and to 30 per cent in the Northern Territory - which I know was very well received by the member for Solomon.In relation to what is regional and what is not, the definition we took was a population size of 250,000 or less, and then we looked at the size and the proximity of a university to a large population centre. The University of Wollongong, which is relatively proximate to Sydney -  - The Leader of the Opposition laughs. The Leader of the Opposition needs to tell someone in Mount Isa that Wollongong is not proximate to Sydney. If the Leader of the Opposition were mature enough to sit through an answer without interjecting, he would benefit from hearing me say to the member for Cunningham that I am about to meet the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Wollongong. I will also be meeting, in the not too distant future, the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Newcastle. One of the things that we are doing, clearly, is looking at the needs of these particular institutions and to what extent we might reasonably entertain a constructive argument from people who are interested in solutions instead of creating problems.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Canning for his question and for the interest he has taken in the work of the Cole royal commission, which found that significant sections of this $40 billion a year industry were marked by widespread illegal and improper payments, regular failure to adhere to agreements, chronic disrespect for court and commission orders, and an underlying culture of coercion and intimidation. This failure to respect the rule of law imposes very significant costs on the rest of the community. For instance, plastering the same wall in the same way costs 40 per cent more in the commercial construction industry than it does in the domestic housing industry and laying a slab of concrete costs 10 per cent more in the commercial construction industry than it does in the domestic housing industry - mostly due to frequent work stoppages and chronic overmanning.In the commercial construction industry, some 7½ per cent of the Australian work force is responsible for just 5½ per cent of Australia's GDP. Econtech has estimated that productivity growth in the commercial construction industry, matching that in the rest of the economy, between now and 2010, would produce a boost to Australia's GDP of $12 billion. Econtech further estimates that, if labour productivity in the commercial construction industry matched labour productivity in the domestic housing industry, our CPI would be one per cent lower, our GDP would be one per cent greater, and Australian consumers would enjoy benefits of $2.3 billion a year. This is a potentially great industry, but it has a dark side. That is why the government are determined to clean up the industry: not because we are against big business, not because we are against unions, but because we want the ordinary workers and the ordinary consumers of Australia to enjoy lower costs and better products.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Dunkley for his question. In lifting the highly protected areas of the reef from 4.5 per cent of the total area to around 30 per cent, the government's goal is to secure a healthy reef that will be good for tourism, good for fishing, good for the communities, good for Australia and good for Australia's international reputation as a guardian of World Heritage.Two very major industries rely almost entirely on the health of the reef for their future, and they are the tourism industry and the combination of recreational and commercial fisheries. Tourism is the giant of the reef economy. Including the onshore flow to the tourist industry, it is a $4.3 billion industry. It employs almost 48,000 people. It dwarfs the other major reef industries, the recreational and commercial fisheries. According to the Productivity Commission, the recreational fisheries have a gross value of production of $240 million and it is around $120 million for commercial fisheries. Clearly these industries are almost entirely dependent on the reef remaining healthy. Without a healthy reef, none of these industries can be sustainable. It is crucial for the communities that live adjacent to the reef, from Bundaberg through Gladstone, Mackay, the Whitsundays, Townsville and Cairns, that the reef remain as healthy as possible.There has been a very positive response to the government's proposal, reflecting the recognition by the communities and industries along the reef that what the government is aiming at is fundamental to their future. The Tourism Task Force Australia, I see, was reported this morning in the Financial Review saying the following:For the overall economy and the health and viability of the Great Barrier Reef we think it is a good thing.As tourism operator Jason Brown said on ABC News last night: There's going to be a lot more marine life, which is certainly an increase for tourism.I must say that I was very pleased to read the comment of David Bateman, Chief Executive Officer of Sunfish, the principal recreational fishers organisation, when he said:We're extremely happy with the way it's been done. What they've come up with, with the increased yellow zones throughout the marine park, will give our members the space to go fishing, and we consider it very reasonable. I was also pleased to see that the World Wide Fund for Nature is reported as saying, `We think it's a fantastic step forward.'The interests of commercial fishers have also been taken into account, and some 95 per cent of the areas currently open to commercial fishing are unaffected by the plan. Even in the relatively short term, we believe that commercial and recreational fishers will benefit from increased numbers of fish and the increased size of fish that result from the protection of healthy populations. I invite everybody interested in the draft proposal to put in submissions over the next nine weeks before the closing date of 4 August.</DOC>

 - I would like to thank the member for Flinders for his question. It was a very good question. I know he has a passionate interest in young families in his electorate, like all members do on this side of the House. Why shouldn't he, because of the unprecedented amount of assistance that we have given families, particularly through childcare benefits and family tax payments? I am happy to announce today that, on 7 July this year, there will be a three per cent increase in payments to the family tax benefit and the childcare benefit, in line with the CPI. This three per cent increase will benefit more than two million Australian families and directly assist more than 3.5 million children. The total amount that they will be receiving will be around $13 billion - the combined amount of FTB and CCB. Of course, specifically in answer to his question, over 530,000 families will be recipients of the childcare benefit, and 760,000 children will get an increase in their childcare benefit. What that actually means is that the maximum assistance rates to families on full-time care for one child will go from $133 to $137, for two children from $278 to $286 and for three children from around $434 to $447. On this side of the House, we are interested in helping Australian families. We are pleased with that increase, but of course we never hear that acknowledged by the opposition.The other interesting point to note, in answer to the member for Flinders, is that since we have been in government the rate of fee increase in child care has been half what it was when the ALP was last in power - a 4.7 per cent increase since 1996, compared to 8.5 per cent under the previous Labor government. Considering that the CPI has gone up 12 per cent since we have been in power, a 4.7 per cent increase in child-care payments obviously makes child care far more affordable. To give another example, the average long day care weekly fee for 50 hours of care is $186. If you are on the maximum rate of child care - 50 hours per week - the gap fee you will be paying is $1 per hour. You will pay $1 per hour on a maximum rate. Child care is far more affordable today than it has ever been before. The member also asked about - and I will not mention the individual person, but he is obviously interested in special needs - that allocation that we are giving to children who may have a disability. I notice another member nodding his head. The Special Needs Subsidy Scheme was introduced by the coalition in 1997 to enable childcare services to employ additional child-care workers, undertake training and purchase equipment to assist and integrate those children with special needs. Over 8,000 children have benefited from that scheme since 1997. I am very happy that the coalition government in the last budget allocated an additional $25.8 million over four years to help those special children with needs. That will help 1,200 children with the highest support needs, and it will also cover the current unmet demand. - I am happy to say that ACOSS has welcomed this along with the child-care sector, and all we get are interjections from the opposition. Aren't you happy about that? I would have thought you would be. - Mr Speaker, again, the commitment of the coalition is $8 billion over the next four years. We are interested in helping Australian families, and it is the coalition government that is forging ahead in helping families.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, the matters raised in the question are serious. They have been canvassed in newspapers today, and obviously some questions are going to be asked about that matter, so I will deal with it fully. Can I first confirm that I suspect the box number that was quoted is mine. I do not remember the box number, but I suspect it is mine.An opposition member - You know it is yours! - No, I do not. I do not write to myself every day. That is the reality. -  - I wish to affirm to the House that if during the course of a campaign any donations are received at my office, they are directed to the treasurer of the Berowra federal electorate conference. That is the proper way for them to be handled, and any donations are properly declared. Any information you have about that is because the donation was properly declared.Mr Tan is a business migrant from the Philippines. I regret very much that, in wanting to make this a political issue, his personal affairs are being canvassed in this way. Let me say that. People are entitled to some privacy. In the Migration Act there is an expectation of that. He is a business migrant from the Philippines who was granted a business skills visa for migration to Australia on 11 September 1998. I have been advised that his application was lodged in Manila on 20 January 1998 and that all criteria set down in the migration legislation, including local penal clearances from the Philippines National Bureau of Investigation, were met. I had no involvement in the processing of his application at the Australian embassy in Manila.All business migrants to Australia are monitored for three years after their arrival to assess whether they are making genuine efforts to engage in business, as this is required by this particular category of migration. Mr Tan did not provide an initial contact address in Australia. Such an address or contact is normally necessary to complete a business skills monitoring survey. My department sought out, from his initial application, the only address that was available to them. Business migrants who do not engage in business activity may be liable for visa cancellation under section 134 of the Migration Act. On 25 May 2001 a notice of intention to cancel was sent to Mr Tan at the only address the department had. - No. I am told that it was a registered migration agent. But that was the only address that we had at the time in relation to this matter. These notices were returned to the department, and all of the envelopes were marked, `Left this address'. In the absence of any information about Mr Tan's business activities, Mr Tan's visa was cancelled on 5 September 2001. Notices of cancellation were sent to the same address and, again, returned to sender with the envelopes marked, `Left this address'. Subsequently - I believe it was in November 2001 and I assume it was Mr Kisrwani, although my notes, which were prepared by the department, do not indicate that - a business partner of Mr Tan's contacted my office to inquire about the status of his visa. Much to his surprise, I suspect, he was advised that Mr Tan's visa had been cancelled under the provisions that I referred to.As a result of that he appealed to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. My department assessed that the procedural requirements set down in the migration legislation were not met, as an incorrect address was used for the notification of Mr Tan's cancellation. I should say that I was provided with a brief to look at the question of costs - that is, whether we should continue, in the light of that advice, to insist that the AAT proceedings continue or whether we should withdraw. - I do not remember the date. The decision was taken to withdraw from that matter. Mr Tan subsequently provided a completed business skills monitoring survey to my department, detailing his business activities. Key elements of these details were confirmed with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. On the basis of this new information and the error of notification of cancellation, my department vacated the decision to cancel Mr Tan's visa, as he had met his business requirements. In relation to the citizenship matter, my department processed his application, which satisfied the criteria to be eligible for Australian citizenship. As part of the criteria for Australian citizenship, all applicants must pass Australian police checks. The character issues with regard to Mr Tan that are reported in today's newspaper did not emerge in the processing of Mr Tan's migration application in 1998. I think that is fairly obvious because they were not laid until 2000. Australian citizenship character checking involves Australian police checks only, and Mr Tan's were clear. As part of the processing of Australian citizenship applications, people are required - and this, I might say, was a change made by this government to enhance the integrity of the migration program and arrangements -  -  - Yes, I might say that; it will become clear as to why I am saying that. Mr Tan signed a declaration, in applying for Australian citizenship, that he did not have any criminal convictions and that he was not subject to current charges. My department is investigating whether Mr Tan's statement in his citizenship application would bring him within the scope of the powers that allow deprivation of his citizenship. I view the character issues that have been raised in this matter seriously. On the surface it appears that he may have misled my department by his statements in his citizenship application, and I have asked the department to pursue that matter vigorously.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Forde for her question. She is a hardworking member in a growth area of the growth state, a place to which a lot of people are wanting to move to be well serviced by her. Last week, the Review of Settlement Services for Migrants and Humanitarian Entrants showed that our programs are advanced on the world stage. We as a government are committed to helping new arrivals become strong contributors to the Australian community as early as they possibly can.We on this side of the chamber believe strongly in a sense of investment in individuals. We believe that the key to participation in Australian society is the English language. The Adult Migrant English Program is a well recognised initiative which offers 510 hours of English classes to migrants. A few years ago, the Howard government introduced a special preparatory program which provides an additional 100 hours to further assist humanitarian and refugee entrants who require that extra help. In the past five years alone, 105,000 clients from over 170 countries have participated in the AMEP. This program has improved its overall reach to eligible clients, particularly in the family visa category. It is up by over 11 per cent, to 72.7 per cent in 2001.This government is getting on with the job of providing even better settlement programs - further investment in individuals. Before new arrivals even come to Australia, there is better information for them about our society, our culture, the responsibilities of Australians and how to access support services. There are more coordinated services and proactive planning mechanisms to assist new arrivals to settle in regional areas where there is a strong demand for their skills. We will continue to work alongside other government programs to build stronger regional communities. Just last week, I was with the member for Murray, the member for Ballarat and the member for Bendigo in their respective areas. I know that, in those particular parts of Australia, especially the Riverina - in fact, in your own part of Australia, Mr Speaker - there has been a strong sense of achievement over generations of migration where people have made a difference, brought their skills, their ambitions and their passion for Australia to the fore, created more jobs and made new industries possible. In the parts of regional Victoria I was in last week, there is a real determination to see more of that. They are thankful that the government has a focus on more regional outcomes for migration into those areas, directly bringing skills that are needed.We want to make sure that there is greater flexibility in the English language programs we provide, especially for humanitarian entrants, to ensure that those with greater needs are accommodated. As a government, we are always working to assess our programs and ensure that they are up to date and fully responsive to the changing needs of the Australian community, particularly people coming to Australia. The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet will chair a high-level government task force to ensure that there is a continuation of, and improvement in, coordinated efforts across portfolios to be even more responsive to our ever changing diverse Australian community.</DOC>

 - The answer to the first part of the question is that I have seen some advice to the effect that an amount of $39,000 was spent in relation to the description. Whether it included other matters, I do not know. As to the expenditure of $100,000 to a PR representative or agency in relation to the selling, I have no direct knowledge of that. I am not suggesting that it has not happened; I do not know. I would point out to the honourable member that it has been the practice of governments of both persuasions to seek advice on the explanation of policy changes. If the honourable member for Perth would like me to go back over the years and produce all the material, we could drag out Bill Hunter. We would be delighted to do that, if that would facilitate the understanding. - We are not talking about the title - if I might answer the Leader of the Opposition's interjection. I know that not only interjections are out of order but also answers to interjections are out of order, but I will answer it nonetheless, Mr Speaker.  - It is not uncharacteristic or uncommon of governments to do those things. Could I finally say to the honourable member that the proposals we have put forward are a credible and fair response to the needs of the Australian health system. Instead of focusing on the sorts of things that he is focused on, I suggest that, as he perambulates between those two Labor Party caucuses that the mate sitting next to him told us about last night, he might focus a little on explaining to his own colleagues the virtue of supporting our proposals.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Boothby for his question. I know he has a particular interest in the South Pacific, as does the government. The House would be aware that for quite some years, since June 2000, the government has been particularly concerned about the situation in the Solomon Islands. In response to an invitation from the Prime Minister, the Prime Minister of the Solomon Islands, Sir Alan Kemakeza, has been invited to Canberra tomorrow for discussions with the Prime Minister, Senator Hill, Senator Ellison and me about the current situation in the Solomon Islands and what further actions countries in the region, including Australia, can do to help the Solomon Islands. Sir Alan will be accompanied by his foreign and police ministers, the National Peace Council chairman and the new police commissioner. As the House would know, Australia has played a central role since the ethnic conflict erupted in 2000 in trying to help the Solomon Islands address its problems. For example, we put together the Townsville Peace Agreement and, through that process, brought an end to the ethnic conflict that had taken place in the Solomon Islands over a long period of time, culminating in the events of June 2000. Having said that, we still remain very concerned about the extremely poor law and order problem that remains in the Solomon Islands. That was illustrated quite starkly recently when the banking sector closed its doors for several days as a result of direct threats by lawless elements in the Solomon Islands. We have focused our aid particularly on the law and order sector. We are spending $17.2 million on improving police, court and prison services. The Australian Federal Police has two advisers working with the Royal Solomon Islands Police Force. After June 2000 there were no police on the streets. Our programs mean that the Solomon Islands, Honiara in particular, has a visible police presence. There have been 129 new recruits under our funded programs and 12 trained criminal investigators are now using their new skills. The visit to Australia by Sir Alan and his ministers will give us an opportunity to hear first hand from Sir Alan about the dimensions of the law and order problems. Of course, we are familiar with those problems from reports from our high commission. I myself met with Sir Alan Kemakesa two weeks ago in Okinawa and I was able to hear what he had to say then, but it is important that he meets with us on a broader scale, in particular with the Prime Minister, to talk these things through. We will listen to any requests, bearing in mind any upgraded assistance must be at the explicit request of the Solomon Islands and it must include a genuine commitment from its leaders to do their part. As I have stressed before, though, this is not something outsiders can fix; it is not something that can just be solved by outside countries. The heart of these problems - as is true in most countries, if not every country - must be addressed by the local people themselves. We have always said that we do not wish to be a neo-colonialist power, as some have urged us to be -   - Someone is urging us to be one even now, but that actually is not our objective. We do need to make sure that we do everything we can to try to help the Solomon Islands through this difficult period, so we very much look forward to Sir Alan and his team's visit tomorrow. It will be an opportunity for us to hear what they have to say, and we will of course be considering whether there is anything further, in response to a request from the Solomon Islands, that we can usefully do to help them address their law and order problems.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Deakin for his question and his interest in the national accounts. The March quarter national accounts released today showed that Australia's gross domestic product increased by 0.7 per cent for the quarter and 2.9 per cent for the year through to the March quarter. Against the background of an international downturn, drought, SARS and the background of war in Iraq, these are very solid results and keep Australia amongst the strongest growing of the economies of the developed world.Non-farm GDP increased 4.1 per cent through to the March quarter and farm GDP through to the March quarter fell by 33.1 per cent, which will give you some idea of the impact and the toll that the drought is taking. The drought is affecting farm incomes, agricultural production and rural exports and is detracting from growth in overall GDP numbers by at least one per cent.Household consumption remains strong, supported by low interest rates and solid growth in employment. Dwelling investment is up 18.4 per cent over the year, supported by the First Home Owners Scheme and low interest rates. Although investment in machinery fell in the quarter, it was coming off record highs, with the import of the Qantas civil aviation aircraft in the December quarter. Profits continue to grow strongly, with private non-financial corporations up 9.5 per cent in the year to the March quarter. There are significant downside risks to the Australian economy: the weakness of the international economy; the drought, which has still not broken and is still taking a toll in many parts of Australia; the impact of SARS, which will affect our tourism exports in the June quarter; and the fact that we are seeing the effects of the drought still continuing to flow through. So, amidst a very difficult background - a background which is taking its toll on all economies - the Australian economy continues to be strong, supported by low interest rates. One of the secrets of economic management over the last seven years has been the balancing of our budgets, the retirement of Labor debt and the low interest rates that have come about as a consequence, which has kept Australian consumption strong in a difficult world environment. Australia has been secure as a result of strong economic management.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Newcastle for her question. Last year, the government went through a very detailed and, dare I say, unique process of reviewing Australian higher education. It included the release of seven detailed discussion papers to inform the public policy debate in relation to higher education, the establishment of a special reference group and a Productivity Commission review of higher education in Australia, comparing it with North America and Europe. It also involved 49 focus groups, with 800 people in 200 hours, and 732 submissions - and not one submission was received from the Australian Labor Party. We even had the Queensland government working with the Commonwealth on the review. Yet here we are, having gone through all of that, and the member for Newcastle has suddenly decided that she wants to pick away at one of the very important initiatives in this policy which will provide 31 universities on 54 campuses with additional funding in recognition of the provision of educational services to remote and rural parts of Australia. If the member for Newcastle would like to put a point of view to the government then the very least she could do is engage in the process.I think the problem that the member for Newcastle and others on the other side have was summarised in yesterday's Financial Review by John Button - a good man - who said:There are still some important constituent groups out there, including business, rural voters and battlers on low incomes who are able to say 'I don't know what your lot stand for'. Further to that, a former education minister, Susan Ryan -  - Thank you, Mr Speaker. There is $122.6 million available over four years for regional universities in Australia. As Susan Ryan, a former Labor minister for education, said in the Financial Review on 28 April:Labor collectively has not convinced the electorate that it has a clear and constructive plan for the nation ... how universities should be funded.Why don't you get on the bus and contribute to public policy?</DOC>

 - I would like to assure the member for Page that ensuring the safety and security of the Australian community is a top priority of the Howard government. It is something the government takes very seriously, as do all members on this side of the House. The government has demonstrated its resolve to protect Australia against terrorist threats, both at home and abroad, through a multipronged strategy designed to strengthen and bolster our national security capabilities. We have significantly increased resources to our security, intelligence, law enforcement and border protection agencies to improve their capacity to deal with threats to our national security. Since 11 September 2001 we have allocated nearly $2 billion in additional funding to these agencies. We have implemented tough new counter-terrorism legislation to strengthen the ability of our agencies to identify and prevent terrorist attacks wherever possible and to bring those responsible to justice. Further vital counter-terrorism legislation is currently before the parliament.We have strengthened our cooperative ties with the states and territories and their agencies to ensure quick and effective responses to national terrorist incidents. We are continuing to work closely with the states and territories and private owners of Australia's critical infrastructure, such as electricity, transport and banking, to ensure they are properly protected from terrorists and other threats. We have been working hard in the region to strengthen law enforcement and intelligence ties with our regional neighbours and to improve coordinated counter-terrorism efforts. On the broader international stage, Australia has built strong partnerships with other countries to make it clear to terrorists that there is a united and effective coalition of countries determined to end their destructive and deadly activities.While this work is important, it is only part of the story. The government believes that every Australian has a role to play in keeping Australia safe from terrorists and has kept the Australian public informed about national security issues, providing the public with information and advice on what they can do to help keep Australia and their families safe. The full list of the Howard government's achievements in national security is extensive. In addition to these efforts, the government has taken active measures in the areas of defence, foreign affairs and immigration which form part of the comprehensive whole-of-government strategy for keeping Australia safe. We do not intend to rest on this substantial and impressive record. In fact, it would be irresponsible to do so. The government remains vigilant to any potential threats to Australia's national security and will continue to take a responsible approach to addressing any new and emerging threats. I can assure the House that our security, intelligence, law enforcement and border control authorities are hard at work protecting Australia and Australians.In order to ensure our intelligence agency has the tools it needs to help identify potential attacks on Australia at the most crucial time - that is, before any Australian is hurt or killed - we will continue to push for powers for ASIO to be able detain and question people who may have information about planned terrorist attacks. We look forward to the opposition cooperating with us to pass this legislation for the sake of national security and the safety of the Australian community. We will continue to push the government's legislation which would reclaim Australia's independence to make our own assessment of what constitutes a threat to Australians and Australian interests and to list terrorist organisations without having to first wait for the United Nations Security Council to do so. Legislation to do this is now before the Senate, and we look forward to the opposition supporting it there.The government has proven that it is responsible and takes national security seriously. We can already point to a significant list of achievements to support that commitment. We will continue to take appropriate action to ensure the safety and security of Australians and Australian interests.</DOC>

 - In answer to the honourable member for Lilley, I will check the precise figures covering the period that has been mentioned, but of course there has been expenditure on wine at the official establishments, the Lodge and Kirribilli House, over that period of time. - The great bulk of that expenditure, of course, has been for entirely official purposes. Given that the period he canvassed included the Sydney Olympic Games, maybe the member for Lilley is suggesting that it is not appropriate for the Prime Minister of this country, whoever he or she might be, to extend official hospitality to visiting heads of government. Maybe he is suggesting that, instead of entertaining the Emperor of Japan at Kirribilli, we should have repaired to McDonald's at Neutral Bay. Maybe they are the suggestions. I will be very happy to examine the figures, but I tell you what: I will also examine earlier figures. Let me say to the honourable member for Lilley that proper official hospitality extended by the Prime Minister of this country, whoever he or she may be or from whatever party that person should come, is entirely legitimate and completely defensible. If you lapse into the juvenile practice of complaining about something like that, then I think that reflects a little more on the barrenness of your policy cupboard than it does on the amplitude of the wine cellar at Kirribilli.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Macarthur for his question. I can tell the member for Macarthur that this government has moved the workplace relations focus from awards to agreements, from industry wide to enterprise level negotiations. Enterprise and individual agreements mean higher productivity, and that means more jobs and higher pay. This government's focus has been where it always will be: on doing the right thing by the ordinary Australian workers - by the ordinary battlers of this country.In the 1980s, in the era of the union accord, labour productivity increased by just two per cent a year. In the early nineties, with the beginning of enterprise bargaining, labour productivity increased by 2½ per cent a year. But under this government, with a move to different types of agreements - particularly individual agreements - labour productivity has increased by three per cent a year. More productivity means more jobs and higher pay. We have had one million more jobs since 1996. We have had half a million new full-time jobs since 1996. We have had a 12 per cent increase in average weekly full-time earnings since 1996. Because under this government workers and managers are talking more and fighting less, not only have we had more jobs and higher pay but also we have had fewer strikes. The level of strikes in this country is just one-thirtieth what it was in the early and mid-1980s and it is just one-third what it was in 1995. Partly as a result of these sorts of changes, the OECD estimates that Australia's structural rate of unemployment has dropped from 8½ per cent to just under six per cent since the mid-1990s. This is only the beginning of the kinds of reforms and improvements that the government want to bring about. We are determined to take the unfair dismissal monkey off the backs of the small businesses of Australia; we are determined to ensure that there are no strikes without secret ballots first; and, above all else, we are determined to restore the rule of law in our workplaces, particularly in the construction sector, because honest workers, honest unionists and honest managers deserve a clean industry and a safe workplace.</DOC>

 - It is the case, as I have disclosed, that Mr Kisrwani has had dealings with my office from time to time in relation to migration matters. That is not at all surprising. There are many prominent community members who make representations about migration matters. I can detail some of that in relation to a wide range of cases. Like the honourable shadow minister, I would be very concerned if there were any evidence that Mr Kisrwani took money for advising in relation to migration matters, because that would be a breach of the act. - I am not going to try to offer a legal opinion, but my understanding is that a migration agent is required to be registered if they charge for migration advice and that community representatives - provided they do not seek to charge people money - are free to make inquiries and to seek information in relation to matters which are brought to their attention.I will say, as I disclosed yesterday, that Mr Kisrwani had approached me in relation to the matter of Mr Tan. He did so to seek information in relation to whether or not his visa continued, because he had no information in relation to it. Mr Tan was a business partner. In relation to that, Mr Kisrwani was given advice that Mr Tan's visa had been cancelled. I outlined fully yesterday the way in which that matter was dealt with. Could I just say - because I think the implication in the question is directed at me, and I would not normally go to these matters that are obtained by the department and given in background to me - in relation to the citizenship matter which I adverted to yesterday, a departmental note refers to a phone call from Mr Kisrwani that suggested that the minister was concerned with Mr Tan's citizenship application. The DIMIA officer contacted my office and was told that the minister was not interested in Mr Tan's case and that it should be processed normally.</DOC>

 - I did answer that matter fully in comment yesterday, but I think the particular issue that might be of interest to members is the way in which the processing of these matters will continue. In view of the question that was just put to me, I should say I have received representations from across the Australian community, including from premiers, chief ministers, colleagues opposite, members of state parliament, the Catholic Church, community groups and a wide range of individuals. I do not intend to name them, as I think that would be a breach of their privacy, but I will name members of parliament because I may have misled the parliament yesterday in relation to this matter. - I said yesterday that I had been approached primarily by members of the Labor Party. A quick viewing of the representation by federal members reveals that I have received representations from only five members of the Labor Party and 15 members of the coalition. - That may well be -  - As I indicated yesterday, I have already considered 379 East Timorese and stated a preparedness, subject to health and character issues being resolved satisfactorily, to intervene under my section 417 public interest powers. I have before me another 200 people who are involved in this process and, as I can, I will get to them and I will get to them as quickly as possible. I mentioned in the House yesterday that, as of 27 May, some 80 East Timorese were awaiting primary decisions. I was told on 3 June that all but 12 primary decisions on East Timorese protection visa applications have been made by my department. The majority of cases - around 1,000 - are now with the Refugee Review Tribunal, and I understand that the Refugee Review Tribunal is moving expeditiously to deal with that cohort.It is important to understand that I cannot look at those matters until a decision has been made by the Refugee Review Tribunal. That is what the legislation requires, and it is legislation that was introduced by Senator Ray when he was the minister for immigration. I simply make the point that under those provisions, which were introduced at that time by Labor, the intervention power is noncompellable. It has to be exercised in the public interest and it can only be made if the matter has been considered by the department and a review decision has been undertaken.However, the House should know that as decisions are made by the RRT I have instructed the department to quickly refer cases to me. The department has set up a streamlined process to ensure that they can be dealt with expeditiously. Based upon the cases that I have dealt with to date - while it is unsafe to assume that the processing would be precisely the same, because it is done on a casebycase basis, and I would not want to prejudge any of the individual circumstances - it would be suggestive of a fairly high success rate. I expect that the initial consideration of most cases will have been undertaken by October this year.</DOC>

 - I fully answered the question yesterday. I outlined the proceedings that were followed and I made it clear, in relation to the decisions that were taken, that the only decision that I was involved in was in relation to withdrawal. The reason for withdrawing related to the extent to which one could reasonably expect in all the circumstances that we would be successful if the matter continued before the AAT. I might say that withdrawal in relation to Administrative Appeals Tribunal decisions as well as legal proceedings in which the department is involved where the prospect of success is not high is quite frequent. For the year 200102, 22 per cent of matters, or 79 matters, were resolved by withdrawal of proceedings before the AAT and the courts. In the current financial year I have withdrawn from 42 matters before the AAT. Avoidance of unwarranted expenditure on unmeritorious litigation is one of the factors that I take into account when making decisions whether to pursue a matter.There are, in relation to files of the department of immigration, provisions which deal very specifically with people's entitlement to privacy in relation to those matters. It has not been my practice and it will not be my practice to table personal files of individuals in the parliament. I will answer questions where it is reasonable; I will answer them fully -  - I have - and I answered them fully yesterday.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Ryan for his question and also for giving me the privilege of visiting with him recently the Centenary State High School and the Gap State High School, both of which are in his electorate. The Commonwealth government this year in its budget has increased funding for state government school students by 5½ per cent. That means that over the last seven years the Commonwealth has increased its funding to state government high school students and primary school students by 59.9 per cent, being a period in which enrolments in the government sector increased by 1.6 per cent. So in seven years there has been a 60 per cent increase in Commonwealth funding with a 1.6 per cent increase in enrolments.The reason why that is the case is that the Commonwealth government increases its funding to schools on the basis of what is described as the average government school recurrent cost index - AGSRC. This is a matter that has been of concern to the state and territory governments, because the Commonwealth provides about 12 per cent of all of the money that goes into the education of our children in state government schools. So the states, which are responsible for regulating, administering and primarily funding their schools, are always concerned to know that the Commonwealth is providing the kinds of resources that the states need - so much so that on 5 December last year the Queensland Minister for Education made a ministerial statement in the Queensland parliament. She said:The AGSRC index increased by 36.86 per cent between 1996 and 2001.That is an accurate statement.Therefore, Commonwealth funding increased by that amount during that time. That is refreshing honesty. She went on to say:In contrast, the CPI - the consumer price index - ... increased by only 14.24 per cent over the same period.In other words, the Queensland minister was pointing out that Commonwealth funding to Queensland state government schools was increasing at a rate almost three times that of the inflation rate. She followed it up with a letter to me, which she referred to in her ministerial statement, expressing concern that the Commonwealth may move away from this indexation. She said of that prospect:I find this totally unacceptable and seek your assurance that the current indexation arrangements will remain in place.The Prime Minister, certainly the Treasurer and I have said that the AGSRC indexation of Commonwealth money to state government schools will continue. So you could imagine it was with bated breath that we waited for the Queensland budget to be delivered yesterday afternoon. The Commonwealth had increased its funding to Queensland government state schools this year by 5.4 per cent, with enrolments forecast to increase by 0.9 per cent. To our surprise, we did not find in the Queensland budget a 5.4 per cent increase in funding to the 460,000 students in Queensland state schools. It was not a 5.4 per cent, not a five per cent, not a four per cent, not even a three per cent increase. Instead, there was a 2.4 per cent increase in funding by the Queensland government to its state government schools, which is within the inflation band of the Reserve Bank - in other words, a real reduction. I looked for independent analysis of the Queensland budget, and I chanced upon a media release which read:The Education Budget is a dud despite the Government's weak attempt to hoodwink the public with half-smart spin-doctoring. It went on:State school funding in real terms has been stalled since 1999 despite Government attempts to fudge the figures.Could this be the member for Ryan, the member for Forde, the member for Fairfax or the member for Petrie? No. This was from the Queensland Teachers Union President, Julie-Ann McCullough. The point here is that the Queensland budget is replicating a process occurring throughout the country. In Western Australia, the Commonwealth increased its funding by 5.1 per cent, and the Western Australian budget increased it by 2.8 per cent. In Victoria, the Commonwealth increased its funding to government state schools by 6.1 per cent, and the Victorian government increased it by 2.3 per cent. And on it goes. It is time in this country that we realise that we need to move from eight different educational jurisdictions to one single educational framework for Australia. We need a common curriculum and educational outcomes. We certainly need to increasingly move to a common indexation for school funding, and the states need to keep up with the Commonwealth, because this year the parents of the 2.2 million students in government schools will be deprived of half a billion dollars because state governments are not indexing their funding in line with the Commonwealth.</DOC>

 - I gave the answers that I gave yesterday after a good deal of consultation with my department and on advice I had received from my department. In relation to the question of age I will check, but my recollection is that the provisions in relation to business migration provide some latitude depending -  -  - Well, they do. They provide some latitude depending upon whether or not you present more capital, whether you speak English -  - The point I was making was that the provisions in relation to business migration do provide for variation in the age that is required to satisfy various criteria depending upon the amount of capital and other capacities of the applicant. A question was asked in relation to the date on which the visa was cancelled and the time limit within which he had to appeal the decision. I guess what the member is saying is that, if you have never had any notice that your visa has been cancelled, we should be able to use an artificial time limit to exclude you from appealing. I do not know whether or not the department had a role in relation to that, but I will ask in relation to it.An opposition member - Will you come back to the House? - Of course I would come back to the House. I will ask about that matter. But let me just say that I have had no role in relation to that. Let me just say, because I do not mislead the House in any way, that I have had some further advice in relation to migration agents. The advice I have is that anyone who uses knowledge of migration procedures to offer advice or assistance to a person wishing to obtain a visa or enter or remain in Australia, or to a person nominating or sponsoring a visa applicant, must register as an agent with the MARA.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Wentworth for his question. I acknowledge his personal interest as former Chair of the World Heritage Committee and his active contribution to the formulation of the government's approach. The Australian government has taken action to restore and protect stolen Iraqi heritage. The Australian government is committed to the rehabilitation of Iraq. It has committed over $100 million in financial aid and provided some 13 officials to the provisional authority as well as a range of specialists. Recently, I announced the formation of an expert reference group of Australian experts in Iraqi heritage to provide recommendations on what further can be done to restore Iraq's cultural heritage. I must say that I have been impressed with the level of expertise that exists in this country and the quality of the people available to the Australian government to perform this very important international role.During the conflict a member of the government's reference group, Professor Dan Potts, was one of the first on the ground to start the rebuilding effort. He travelled to Iraq with the assistance of the Council for Australian-Arab Relations and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and has provided much-needed equipment - laptops, scanner, digital camera and database software - and practical help, which have been gratefully received by the Iraqi National Museum. Another member of the group, Mr Bryan Hanley, an international art crimes expert, was recently sent to work with Interpol in the effort to track down stolen items. The government's expert group is liaising widely, from the British Museum to UNESCO and Interpol, to help with the restoration. Australian museums, universities -   - and other heritage institutions are providing the expertise to make these efforts possible. I have just received a report from the expert reference group on further steps that could be taken. These include supporting international efforts to address the urgent need for security at museums, libraries and archaeological sites in regional areas of Iraq; coordinating Australian responses with other initiatives, including those of UNESCO, the British Museum and the Library of Congress; as soon as the emergency red list of Iraqi antiquities at risk is completed, circulating details to all dealers in Australia and the Pacific region and facilitating ready access to this list by making it available on the Internet; and supporting Iraqi museums and libraries with the development of databases where possible. The expert group has done an excellent job in a very short space of time. I will be consulting further with my ministerial colleagues on its recommendations and making further announcements at a later time.</DOC>

 - My recollection is that, in relation to the year in question, I fully answered the question. The nominations did not in all cases lead to visa grants. The visa grants were 10. I just make the point -  - I gave you the answer the other day and I stand by the answer I gave. Let me just say that my recollection is that the figures for that year indicate that something of the order of 1,600 visas were granted for religious workers.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Robertson for his question and his interest in the health and wellbeing of all Australians, including those in his electorate. Since its election in 1996, the Howard government has restored balance in the Australian health system and, indeed, increased expenditure by 65 per cent. This is a significant achievement. There is a lot of talk in this House from time to time about supporting medical professionals through Medicare. It is this side of the House which is delivering real outcomes. For example, in relation to chronic diseases, we have now put in place national programs dealing with asthma, diabetes, breast cancer and bowel cancer. We have doubled the amount of expenditure on Indigenous health in Australia. In terms of Medicare itself, there is almost $1 billion which this government is now offering to make Medicare more available, more accessible and more affordable.I was interested when earlier the Leader of the Opposition asked the Prime Minister a question in which he was suggesting that somehow there was some better advance with the ALP's policy in relation to Medicare. What he did not do was quote fully from the article which he was referring to. The Prime Minister did not have access to it, but I do. - What this report in the Australian Doctor says, which is spelled out clearly in the headline, is `Coalition Medicare plan gets the nod'. The opening sentence says:Coalition plans to rescue Medicare -  - What the member for Perth well knows is what the opening sentence of this article says:Coalition plans to rescue Medicare offer a better deal for GPs than rival ALP proposals, an independent, analytical comparison of the two blueprints suggests.Quite contrary to what the Leader of the Opposition was trying to suggest to the Prime Minister, this analysis says that the coalition plan is much better than that provided by the ALP. In fact, it goes on to say that the only way in which there could be some degree of equity under the ALP plan would be if GPs had to offer an extra 200 services to patients each week. Under this analysis, which the Leader of the Opposition wanted to quote to the parliament, the ALP is basically reducing six-minute medicine down to three-minute medicine. That is the ALP plan in relation to this.In addition to those considerable changes, the Commonwealth are not only supporting the medical system in Australia by increasing the funding by 65 per cent but also improving what is provided by the states for the funding of their public hospital system. For example, under the first Medicare agreement, we substantially increased the funding. We are now offering an additional $10 billion over the next five years under the Commonwealth-state health care agreements, an effective real growth rate of over 17 per cent. We are not only meeting our obligations and responsibilities by significantly increasing Commonwealth expenditure on Commonwealth health programs but also offering real additional expenditure to the states for the conduct of their public hospitals.In addition to that, we have restored the balance between private and public health. Under the ALP, only 30 per cent of people had private health cover; today it is around 44 per cent and private hospital admissions have grown by 12 per cent. In addition to that, we know that today many of the common procedures are now carried out in private hospitals. Six out of 10 major joint replacements, half of the chemotherapy procedures - over half of the procedures, for example, for malignant breast cancer conditions - almost 60 per cent of cardiac valve replacements and seven out of 10 major eye lens procedures are all carried out under private health insurance in private hospitals in Australia. The member for Robertson represents a rural seat. There has been some $2 billion for targeted rural health and aged care assistance, including a $562 million package over four years for more rural doctors, increasing the number by 11.4 per cent over the last five years. The outer metropolitan program, with an extra $80 million to put more doctors into outer metropolitan parts of Australia, is also part of this government's continuing commitment to improve the health and wellbeing of all Australians.Under the Howard government, we have improved Medicare, we have immunised Australia's children, we have substantially increased funding to the states for their public hospital systems and we have taken some of the pressure off the system by restoring the balance through private health insurance. These are significant achievements.</DOC>

 - I would like people to read carefully what I say and not come into the House to put forward words that suggest that I had given a different answer. The advice I had given in relation to the Maha Buddhist monastery - and it was advice from my department - was that it has, since the beginning of the year 2000, finalised 23 religious worker nominations and 10 religious worker visas. That is not for the year 2000; that is for the years 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2003. Let me give you the figures for religious grants over that time. In the year 2000-01, it was 1,554. For the year 2001-02, it was 1,243. For the year 2002 to the end of April 2003, it was 1,263. In other words, a major Buddhist institution received 10 visas grants over a three-year period in which, if my calculations are correct, some 4,000 visas were granted.Let me indicate where I also believe I may have been verballed by the honourable member earlier today. A question was asked that drew upon the answer I gave yesterday, and I think it is very important that I repeat this matter so that what I said is understood and so that the inferences that were drawn in the question are not taken as fact by those who write on these matters. Yesterday I said in relation to this matter:The decision was taken to withdraw from that matter. Mr Tan subsequently provided a completed business skills monitoring survey to my department, detailing his business activities. Key elements of these details were confirmed with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. On the basis of this new information and the error of notification of cancellation, my department vacated the decision to cancel Mr Tan's visa, as he had met his business requirements.That is the answer I gave yesterday, and it dealt quite clearly with the issues that were tested by the department and with how they did it. To suggest that that was not done was clearly verballing me. </DOC>

 - It is refreshing to have a positive question about Work for the Dole. I thank the member for Petrie for her ongoing commitment to unemployed people and, in fact, to all her constituents in Petrie. There will be 330 new Work for the Dole programs around the wider part of Australia this month that will contribute to some 13,000 Work for the Dole programs brought about since the inception of the program announced by the Prime Minister in 1997. There will be some 230,000 job seekers who will have been helped by this program and who will have, in turn, helped their communities. This is a very positive thing.Recently I have had my attention drawn to some very positive articles in newspapers. There is a young man in Burnie in Tasmania who has been part of the Bleriot aircraft project there, which is recognised by the Prime Minister's Work for the Dole awards - in fact, I believe the Prime Minister visited that program. Young Chris so impressed a local employer after having worked on Work for the Dole that his employer not only gave him a job but also sent him to Denmark to do training. So as a result of Work for the Dole we saw a part of Australia's heritage - I believe this aircraft was responsible for the first mail run between Sydney and Melbourne - being maintained and retained for future generations. We have a young unemployed Australian being given a chance and, as a result, going on and getting training overseas. That is a great news story.The member for Hinkler pointed out to me an article in the Bundaberg News Mail from last month on a Work for the Dole participant. The Work for the Dole participant said she felt like she had been given a second chance in life. That is the sort of thing that Work for the Dole does for unemployed people. Everyone on this side recognises that - absolutely everyone. I am pleased to say that there is the odd person on the other side who recognises it too. I have an article from the Wynnum area. It says that the member for Bowman - and he is a very effective member from time to time; he would not mind being back on the frontbench - said Work for the Dole was a valuable initiative to help local communities. He said:The Work for the Dole participants have been able to help promote Manly and our local products and bring in more tourist dollars to our community, as well as gain valuable work experience.The member for Bowman has got it in one. And there are other responsible members on the other side. I have previously brought to the attention of the House a book of opportunities, Work for the dole: Prime ministerial awards 2002. On page 40 we see Brighton Gardens Club, Bridgewater, Tasmania. This is a CWC from Mission Australia and its sponsor is Brighton Gardens. As everyone knows, people have to be nominated by someone for these awards. The Brighton Gardens Club was nominated for an award by an MP of this place who thought it was worth while. That, of course, was Harry Quick, a member of the opposition who understands the value of work experience and Work for the Dole - and I congratulate Harry for that. I was asked about the value of this work to communities. Unfortunately, not everyone on the Labor side has been able to tear themselves away from their ideology and understand the value of this work. The city of Brisbane was offered a Work for the Dole project to help to install cat's-eye reflectors, which help firemen to identify fire hydrants when they are going to put out a fire and hopefully save property and life. Unbelievably, when this government - the Howard government - offered Brisbane this project, they refused it and have spent $1.5 million of ratepayers' money in Brisbane to provide a valuable service that the unemployed could have provided.When questioned about this on 4BC, the now Lord Mayor said, `We've evaluated Work for the Dole and it doesn't have much value.' Well, there has not been one Work for the Dole project with Brisbane City Council because they have refused to have them. I rang the Mackay City Council in the electorate of Dawson because I knew that they had actually installed cat's-eye reflectors and I asked them whether they were satisfied and whether there was a problem. Their executive manager for infrastructure said, `It's been very positively received by the council. It is doubtful if the installation of the cat's eyes would have been done without Work for the Dole.'Those on the other side disagree with each other on a lot of things. They should get on board with the coalition and support Work for the Dole - a positive initiative for the unemployed and Australia.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, I fully addressed these issues yesterday. I had advice in relation to the answer I gave. I am disappointed that the honourable member for Lalor has not read the answer I gave yesterday. She clearly had not in relation to the earlier question she put to me, and she clearly has not in relation to some of the information that she asserted as fact on this occasion. - No, it is quite clear she has not. The only occasion on which I had any role in relation to this matter was in relation to the withdrawal in relation to the AAT, and the circumstances of that have been recounted. The only other involvement I have specifically had is to instruct the department in relation to the matters I adverted to yesterday, where the department may have been misled in relation to the grant of citizenship, that they should expeditiously pursue that issue in relation to character. I do not suggest that this is in any way a defence of what has happened on Mr Tan's part, but in relation to donations that are made -   - to my electorate conference, they are fully disclosed, as they are required to be under the law. The fact that we have done that and done it properly has meant that on your fishing expedition, your trawling over the party's register, you have disclosed this donation and that has led to a situation where his visa is very much at risk. - It is. - And I clearly do believe if people mislead us -  - in relation to the grant of a visa, those matters should be pursued, and they are and they will be.</DOC>

 - I say in reply to the Leader of the Opposition that I will examine the precise details of what I said. - No, I just do not believe what you say about what I have said - that is the reason. I will also take the opportunity to analyse Labor's policy.Seeing that I am on my feet about the environment, it gives me an opportunity to remind the parliament that spending by environment and agricultural portfolios, which jointly administer the Natural Heritage Trust and the National Action Plan for Salinity and Water Quality, and on environmental activities has more than doubled since 1996 to a record $957.6 million next financial year. That is an increase of $578 million since 1995-96. - It is a very interesting thing - the Leader of the Opposition says that when you have increased spending by $578 million since 1995-96 you are going backwards. No wonder you are going backwards in your own party. There is the $2.7 billion Natural Heritage Trust and the $1.4 billion National Action Plan for Salinity and Water Quality, which is a joint program with the states and territories which is delivering real grassroots results and environmental benefits in partnership with local communities. We are spending about $1 billion - a record amount - on reducing greenhouse gases, and that includes $18.2 million of new funding for the National Oceans Office to bring in the first regional marine plan for the two million square kilometres of ocean that comprise the south-east marine region. Then, of course, there is the visionary, historic plan released by the Minister for the Environment and Heritage regarding the Great Barrier Reef. There is the determination of the government to achieve what I would call the `Kyoto double'; that is, to aspire to and achieve the emissions targets set under Kyoto without encumbering Australia with the unfair requirements of the Kyoto Protocol - incidentally, a stance that has the support of both the Western Australian and the Queensland premiers, because they lead resource states in this country that know that, if we were to sign the Kyoto Protocol in its current form, we would be betraying Australia's national interest.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Wentworth for his question on an issue that I know he has a very deep and continuing interest in. I know that members on both sides of the House will join in saying how much we welcome yesterday's summit held in Aqaba in Jordan between President Bush, the Prime Minister of Israel and the Prime Minister of the Palestinian Authority. That meeting marks a new phase in the hard march towards a Middle East peace settlement. It was the first face-to-face meeting between the three leaders, and it saw a renewed commitment to the road map for peace in the Middle East from each of those three men. Can I say on behalf of the Australian government that each of those men has displayed conspicuous personal courage in committing themselves to achieving this long sought after outcome, but an outcome that is going to be difficult to achieve. Not only was it the first face-to-face meeting, it was the first time the Israeli government has officially accepted a plan for Palestinian statehood. The courage that Ariel Sharon has displayed in doing that should not be underestimated. Equally, the Palestinian Authority should be applauded for recognizing two fundamental propositions: the first is the condemnation and renunciation of terrorism and violence against Israelis - not only within Israeli territory but also outside the state of Israel; the second is that, for the first time, a spokesman for the Palestinian Authority has acknowledged the suffering over the centuries of the Jewish people.Significantly, and this was reported by our own foreign minister on his recent visit to the Middle East, there is growing support from neighbouring Arab states - from Egypt, from Jordan, from Saudi Arabia, from Bahrain - for the road map. That was evidenced in the meeting with President Bush in Egypt on 3 June. The Jordanian foreign minister recently wrote in the New York Times: The truth needs to be clearly stated. Suicide bombings have only hurt the Palestinian cause.That has been the view of the Australian government and, I know, the view of all civilised people for a long period of time.I want to say just two other things about this very important, very hopeful and - we all would want to believe - historic development. The first of those things is that the Aqaba summit would not have been possible without the American led action against Saddam Hussein. If the coalition of the willing had not got rid of Saddam Hussein, the Aqaba summit would not have taken place. Those who condemn the Australian government for joining the Americans and the British in removing Saddam Hussein must acknowledge that this historic summit would never have occurred. You would never have had the combination of circumstances that led to it occurring. I know that the member for Melbourne Ports understands that, and I know that there are many members on the other side of the House who understand that. I wonder if the Leader of the Opposition has the courage to acknowledge it.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Aston for his question. I can inform him that the eighth budget which has been brought down by the Howard government is another budget which is in surplus and another budget which retires Labor debt and keeps our interest rates low. In addition to that, the government was able to cut income tax, with $10.7 billion worth of income tax cuts so that for some people at $24,000 there will be an income tax cut of $329 a year; at $40,000, $208 per year; at $60,000, $448 a year; and at $70,000, $573 a year.I say to the member for Aston not only that but also, of course, that the budget funded the Scoresby Freeway, which the member for Aston has worked tirelessly for, as have the member for Dunkley, the member for Deakin and the member for Casey. That is public investment so that there can be a freeway through Scoresby. We remain intrigued as to what federal Labor's position is on tolls on the Scoresby Freeway. There may be only one last question time for the member for Hotham to announce a policy in relation to the Scoresby Freeway. - He said, `Don't put your money on it.' On what - your leadership, or the Scoresby Freeway? - The federal government is reducing income taxes. Unfortunately, one of the things for which people will need more money in their pockets from federal income tax cuts - one of the reasons why they will need that extra money in their pockets - is to pay the Labor state government tax rises. The Queensland state Labor government brought down its budget yesterday, not cutting taxes but bringing in a new $88 ambulance levy. Get a load of this: the $88 ambulance levy which has been introduced by the Queensland Labor Party is going on electricity bills - there being an obvious connection between ambulance levies and electricity bills. It is nothing to do with an ambulance levy; it is just another Labor tax rise.What did we see in the Victorian Labor Party budget? We saw hundreds of fines and fees increased. The Bracks government still cannot tell us how many, but it is thought that there were 300 tax increases in the Victorian budget. Drivers licence fees were increased by three per cent, and general fees and fines as well. What did we see in South Australia? Did we see a tax cut from the South Australian Labor government? No; we saw a new $30 levy on every water bill in South Australia. What did we see from state Labor in Western Australia? We saw an increase in the stamp duty on property conveyances - up 15 per cent - an increase in the stamp duty on general insurance policies, an increase in payroll tax from 6.4 per cent to 10.7 per cent and an increase in land tax. What did we see in the ACT Labor budget? We saw a new rate of duty on the transfer of business assets, a new loan security duty on commercial borrowers, an eight per cent increase in gambling tax and a new fire reconstruction levy of $50 on all ratepayers. You do not need to listen to what Labor says. Watch what Labor does. There is only one government in Australia that has been cutting taxes in its recent budget, and it happens to be a Liberal-National government. There have been six governments which have been increasing taxes, and every single one of them is a Labor government. They might call it an ambulance levy, a fire levy or a duty levy, but at the end of the day Labor has only one policy: to increase taxes. We have the member for Perth on the record calling for an increase in the Medicare levy - one of the roosters of the Labor frontbench shaking his tail feather and calling for an increased tax. Do not listen to what Labor says; watch what Labor does. Labor stands for higher taxes. In each of the states, it is increasing taxes. There is only one party interested in cutting taxes in Australia, and that is the Liberal Party.</DOC>

 - I have not made any final arrangements in relation to that visit. I have stayed at the hotel that you nominate in the past. My understanding is that any hotel in a whole range in London is very expensive. The member for Swan asked me yesterday about wine, and I asked him rhetorically whether I should have taken the Crown Prince of Japan to McDonald's at Neutral Bay. I should have amended that to have said `the Big Rooster at Neutral Bay'. Can I simply say that, like every Prime Minister of this country, from time to time it is necessary for me to travel overseas. All overseas travel is inherently expensive. Unless we get to a situation where Prime Ministers do not travel, incurring a certain amount of expense is unavoidable.</DOC>

 - First, I thank the honourable member for his question. I appreciate the interest he shows in a serious issue like the situation in the Solomon Islands and in the Pacific generally. As we in this government have said on many occasions over the last 7½ years, we give a very high priority to our relationships with the Pacific island countries. We have intervened in a number of different ways to assist those countries through difficulties - Fiji, after the coup of May 2000; and of course we have assisted the Solomon Islands very substantially over the last three years, as a result of the upheaval that has taken place in that country, and played a decisive role in bringing to an end the ethnic conflict. As the House knows, the Prime Minister of the Solomon Islands - Sir Allan Kemakeza - his foreign and police ministers, as well as the Chairman of the National Peace Council and the police commissioner, are all here in Canberra today. The Prime Minister, the defence minister, the justice minister and I had the opportunity to meet and have lunch with them today to discuss the law and order situation in the Solomon Islands and to review the progress that has been made in addressing those issues by the Solomon Islands government and by partners - particularly by Australia.As a result of the very constructive talks that we had this morning - and they will be continuing this afternoon after question time - we have concluded that we will be likely to send a team of officials to Honiara next week to look at a comprehensive approach to the problems besetting the Solomon Islands. Our aim is simply to help the elected government of the Solomon Islands fulfil its own responsibilities in accordance with its constitution and to help it as best we can over and above what we are already doing to restore law and order more effectively.In case people should wish to speculate on precisely what we might do, it is too early to talk about specific actions that the Australian government may take. It is very important to understand that we have made no decisions about what we will do. The Solomon Islands government itself has not. There is a good deal more talking that has to be done, and there needs to be consultation with our regional neighbours in the Pacific Island Forum - New Zealand, of course, very importantly, but also other Pacific island countries. We are willing to consider carefully any practical proposals that come from the Solomon Islands government.As we have often said, this country has enormous responsibilities in the South Pacific region, and we are prepared to work with our regional partners to fulfil those responsibilities. I have always said we do not want to be neo-colonialists in our approach. We do not want to be telling other countries what to do; on the other hand, we do not want to let countries' constitutions and political environments deteriorate to such an extent that they become unmanageable and their economies, in turn, collapse. Our real concern with the Solomon Islands is not just a law and order situation on the ground but the consequences that flow from that - the difficulty they are having in running their central bank and their finance ministry, the problems they have in just running businesses day by day. The problems are complex but they go to the heart of the law and order problem. I think we have had a very constructive round of discussions this morning. I look forward to meeting with the Prime Minister and his team again this afternoon to talk through further measures that we could consider and to talk about our team being dispatched - probably with New Zealanders as well - sometime during the next week.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Calare for that question. I disagree with one assertion contained in his question, and that is: there is a new copayment option. There is no new copayment option. I reject that. What is proposed is that doctors who participate in the Fairer Medicare scheme - which involves incentive payments in relation to the bulk-billing of concession card holders - will have the facility of HIC online, whereby they can have the Medicare rebate directly credited within two days. There is no suggestion in that of a copayment. The last party in Australia that proposed a copayment was the Labor Party. It was, in fact, proposed in the budget of 1991. That was proposed by the former Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Howe, and it was killed, I think, when the former Prime Minister, my predecessor, assumed the leadership of the Labor Party. Legend has it that that is how he finally secured the vote of Senator Crowley and one or two others in order to get rid of his leader. It is on occasions like this when you bone up on the history of leadership changes. I have been reading some of that very closely.  - It is an inaccurate characterisation of our policy change to suggest that we are introducing a copayment, and it is important that that rejection be placed very firmly on the public record. I do not believe that the outcomes in relation to bulk-billing that are implied, indeed inferred and suggested, in the honourable member's question are going to occur. Therefore I do not accept that in relation to the cost of the safety net scheme there are going to be the consequences he suggests.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Corangamite for his question. He is a well-recognised supporter of free trade and free trade agreements in opening up markets across the world. This week, in the margins of the APEC ministerial meeting held in Khon Kaen in Thailand, I had the opportunity of progressing further our ambitions as far as a free trade agreement with Thailand is concerned. Whilst there, I had the opportunity of meeting with not only my counterpart, Dr Adisai, but also Prime Minister Thaksin with regard to the progress that has been made thus far. As far as the Australian-Thai free trade agreement is concerned, during those discussions we agreed that we should try and conclude the negotiations by October, if possible. That will be a challenging agenda for our negotiators, but it is one that is not unachievable. Certainly we want to pursue that, with our objective that the free trade agreement remain a high-quality agreement, a comprehensive agreement that would contribute positively to our global trade liberalisation efforts. Interestingly, whilst I was in Thailand there was a very interesting piece in the Bangkok Post. It went to the benefits that could accrue from a free trade agreement with Australia. It was by the leader of the Thai Chat party - there is bipartisan support in Thailand for this free trade agreement with Australia. The heading was that a free trade agreement would provide both Thailand and Australia with multiple benefits. But also in the article there was a very interesting paragraph commenting on the Australian economy that I am sure the Prime Minister and the Treasurer would be keen to hear. He said: During a recent visit to Australia I was struck by the economic dynamism and affluence of this large but sparsely populated neighbour and began to explore what lessons Thailand could learn from its recent economic successes.Of course, that is part of a free trade agreement - drawing two countries and two economies closer together. Following our FTA with Singapore, an agreement with Thailand will reinforce Australia's acknowledged commitment to the East Asian region. That was well recognised in discussions I had with all ministers at the APEC MRT in Thailand.The member for Corangamite also asked what other governments are supporting FTAs. It was interesting that, when we did an analysis of the 21 economies in APEC, it was found that there are 20 other economies pursuing bilateral free trade agreements - all committed to the multilateral round, as we are in Australia, but all at the same time pursuing free trade agreements. So our Asian neighbours are clearly focused on the benefits of free trade agreements bilaterally and the energy that can be put into the multilateral agenda. That was recognised in the communique that came out of the APEC ministerial meeting, which I will quote very briefly:Ministers noted that comprehensive RTAs and FTAs can promote overall liberalisation in the region and help to ensure the momentum in the Doha Development Agenda negotiations is maintained.All the APEC economies recognise the complementarities between bilateral negotiations and the multilateral agenda, as we do in Australia - or, in fact, as we do on the government side. We know that the opposition, the Labor Party, do not support this trade policy or this view, but they have now found themselves completely out of step with everybody in South-East Asia and East Asia as well as the government of Australia.</DOC>

In relation to the comment attributed to my spokesman yesterday, he checked that with me and that was my recollection. I have no complete recollection of the people who were at Romeo's. I might say that the event took place on 14 September, not in October, as was suggested by the member for Reid.  - No; I checked my diary to find out that. I have also checked my diary to ascertain whether or not I have at any time met Mr Tan in my office, and there are no engagements recorded. But I do recall, in general terms, having met him, primarily in company with Mr Kisrwani - I do not disguise that - and they were at social occasions.   - I do not recall Romeo's; I made that clear. I do not recall him being there. He may well have been, but I do not recall it. In relation to the question of his address, I have no knowledge as to where my conference may have sent a receipt, but I assume that it was probably to the address that was declared in the register.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Cook for his question. He is chairman of the Friends of Tourism, which is a great initiative of the coalition and the first time a government has taken tourism very seriously right across all the seats. Today we released the green paper for the future of tourism. - Listen, mate, we will not have to wait until September this year for the Roosters to pick up another title. The tourism industry represents nearly five per cent of Australia's economy, encompasses more than 500,000 jobs, particularly in regional and rural Australia, and is one of Australia's largest export industries, with five million people coming to Australia, representing around 17 billion export dollars every year. We recognise that the tourism industry has had a very tough 18 months, from September 11, the collapse of Ansett on 14 September, the impact of drought and bushfires, the threat of terror and, more recently, the impact of SARS. We recognise that the tourism industry needs to undertake structural reform in order to cope with potential volatility. Importantly, the tourism industry recognises that as well. We have taken a whole-of-government approach to this, because we believe that all the resources of the government need to work in a common direction with the states and the industry to inoculate the tourism industry against the sort of volatility which we may be facing well into the future.Today we put a directional path to the industry, focusing on how we can increase the number of visitors, both from within Australia and coming to Australia, travelling to regional Australia - because regional Australia represents one of the great competitive advantages that Australia has. We recognise that Australia has to be more than just another international tourism destination. It needs to become an experience in the same way that young Australians want to go to Europe to do the London thing. We believe that we can make Australia attractive, unique and a special experience for the millions of people around the world that are looking for something more than another travel destination. There are ways of doing that. One of the best ways to do that is to encourage regional development in partnership with state and Commonwealth governments so that we can lift the tourism product in regions around Australia. One of the proposals includes consolidating Australia's around 500 tourism regions into a smaller number of regions with targeted marketing programs, particularly into key markets such as New Zealand and a range of others.We put forward a bold platform. The platform includes the first reform of the tourism industry bureaucracy in 40 years, including the merger of See Australia and the Australian Tourist Commission into a new body called Australian Tourism. It includes the creation of a body called Australian Tourism Events, because we recognise how important events are to Australia, whether it be the Rugby World Cup, which we are all looking forward to in October, or the Commonwealth Games. We can take a lead from Victoria, which has done events very well. We are proposing a new body called Australian Tourism Research, which will focus on how we can improve the quality of information coming to the fore in relation to tourism. We are also targeting key markets. One of the most valuable markets to Australia is the backpacker market. Every backpacker who comes to Australia leaves $4,500 dollars behind. That is the equivalent in export dollars of 77 tonnes of coal or 17 tonnes of wheat. It is a valuable export but, more importantly, a backpacker who comes to Australia becomes an advocate for Australia for the rest of their lives. That is what we want. We want every Australian to become an ambassador for Australia and we want every visitor to Australia to become an advocate for Australia when they go home. This is a partnership planned between industry, state government and the Commonwealth government. We are determined to ensure that the tourism industry has sound foundations for the future. Importantly, it is a whole-of-government approach including all my colleagues, who have been participating actively in the development of it. It also includes Minister Macfarlane, whom we would like to see come back as quickly as possible.An opposition member - Send him a cheerio. - He will be watching. We wish him well. We thank everyone for their involvement, and we look forward to the development of the white paper - something the Labor Party never did and never proposed to do. Significantly, we are getting on with governing the country while the Labor Party tears itself apart.</DOC>

 - A question like this is not surprising. Let me just say that I do not purport to give legal advice in relation to these matters. If people believe that an offence has been committed, they should advise appropriate authorities so those matters can be investigated. Let me just say that the relevant section, which is 280, of the Migration Act makes it clear that this section does not prohibit an individual from giving immigration assistance if the assistance is not given for a fee or other reward. In other words, it is quite clear in the schema that people can, unregistered but on behalf of people that they know - it might be a family member, it might be a community leader - assist in a voluntary capacity by writing -   - The schema of the act was quite clear: it was in no way to restrict people advising of their interests in relation to particular applications, and communicating that to a minister or to the department. They cannot charge for it; that is certainly the case. But community leaders are clearly envisaged, within the schema of the act, to be able to make those representations.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Sturt for his question. As Australia moves into its second century as a nation it is more than high time for us to also move towards a more unified national system of workplace relations regulations. Everyone knows that having six separate state and federal industrial jurisdictions makes as much sense as having six separate railway gauges. Even the Leader of the Opposition, in the days before he became consumed by numbers, knew that. He said some years ago:I think there is a substantial view within the ACTU that there should be a movement towards the development of a national industrial relations system.Recently the prominent union official Bill Shorten said:Variations in state laws are also time-consuming and frustrating for employers. It is ridiculous there are more than 130 pieces of state and federal legislation pertaining to industrial law.Bill Shorten is a prominent member of the AWU faction that has now set itself up as plotters' central and is open for business this afternoon at Aussie's cafe. The federal government has taken a decisive step towards a more unified national system with the termination of employment bill. The termination of employment bill uses the corporations power to bring some 85 per cent of Australian workers within the scope of the federal unfair dismissal laws. These laws are not perfect. They embody the kind of compromises necessary to satisfy the Senate.There is an added value in greater certainty and greater uniformity. There is an inherent value in greater certainty and greater uniformity. That is what the federal government is trying to achieve with this bill. Thirty per cent of employers do not know whether they are covered by federal or state law, and this confusion is likely to be even greater amongst employees who have just lost their jobs. The termination of employment bill is now before the Senate. I would respectfully suggest to members opposite that they take their minds off the leadership struggle for just a moment and consider what they really stand for and, just for once, stand up for principle and support the government's bill. </DOC>

 - The `Lebanese Friends of Philip Ruddock' are a group of people who have been known to my family for something like 40 years from a particular village in north Lebanon, the village of Baan. They have settled in the area of Thornleigh and Pennant Hills, where I was brought up from the time I was a child. They have given me very warm support as their local member. That is as they are entitled to, and I am sure nobody would complain. I have to say, given that they have not been using migration for family reunion purposes - they have long settled - it is rare for me to be approached by either the leadership of that group or members of that group. It is rare. It could happen, but I simply make the point that it is rare.In relation to the number of approaches I get, I receive correspondence in the order of 30,000 to 40,000 pieces a year. I do not attempt or purport to remember every letter that comes to me. I will look at the information that has been provided, I will find out what I can and I will inform the member at the earliest opportunity.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Fairfax for his question. There are aspects of my portfolio responsibilities, it may come as a surprise to some, that have a very positive benefit for Australia and are designed to contribute to the overall wellbeing of Australians generally and enable us to be a progressive and outward-looking nation that reaches out to the rest of the world.I would like to take this opportunity to inform the House of some of the characteristics of the sponsored professional development visa, which will start from 1 July. This visa class will cater for the emerging market to supply tailored training to groups of skilled professionals and government officials from overseas. The programs are designed by Australian educational providers to meet the needs of overseas employers in particular. The training is fully funded by the overseas employer.The visa product is a unique opportunity for Australia in a number of ways. First, the ability to offer this training will enable Australia to establish itself in this niche market and will further support the growth of the Australian and international educational export industry, with the economic opportunities that this entails. The Australian educational industry has called for such a visa product and the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee has recently issued a press release - let me say modestly - congratulating me for acknowledging and responding to the rapidly changing demand for international education. Second, this visa supports Australia's bilateral, economic and political relations with countries in our region. It demonstrates our commitment to support the broad reform agenda of countries in the transformation of their key economic and social institutions. I am aware that there is a very significant and potential demand for this training. In particular, we see that the People's Republic of China, in acceding to the World Trade Organisation and in the lead-up to the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games, is likely to represent a significant demand for training products of this sort. It has already been commented on very positively in the press in China. This will also bring a benefit to Tasmania, in particular, because my department has centralised the processing of this new visa class in its Hobart office.I expect that the visa regime, which has a number of important safeguards, will bring very considerable benefit. Included in these new arrangements are requirements for sponsors to enter into legally enforceable undertakings, which we believe, along with security bonds, will provide a very important range of measures to ensure that this visa class is a highly compliant visa product.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Gilmore for her question, and for the strong support that she and the member for Eden-Monaro, supported by the member for Hughes and Senator John Tierney, have given to bringing the concerns of the University of Wollongong directly to the government. To enable them to understand the problems facing higher education, on Monday I introduced to the Australian Labor Party the concept that universities at the moment are like a very overcrowded bus. The government is investing $10.6 billion over 10 years in the higher education sector, and part of that $10.6 billion investment - the bus that is being bought; the big, new, shiny, expanded bus - is a significant commitment to regional universities. The government is committing $122.6 million specifically over the first four years to support regional universities. I am able to say that the Nowra, Batemans Bay and Moss Vale campuses of the University of Wollongong will attract a 2.5 per cent loading. Further to that, the Bega campus will attract a five per cent loading. I have also invited Professor Gerard Sutton, who is the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Wollongong - and an outstanding leader of that institution, I might add - to, in conjunction with Professor Roger Holmes from Newcastle University, submit a proposal to me to give consideration to what issues they might like to further raise in relation to those two universities and their regionality.I think it is important that honourable members realise that, in this transformational package for higher education, the $1.5 billion of extra public investment in the first four years includes a 7.5 per cent increase in Commonwealth grants scheme funding, a 7.1 per cent increase in funding for the training of nurses in universities - including Wollongong - a 9.7 per cent increase in funding for the training of teachers, 31,500 extra publicly funded HECS places in the first five years, $138.5 million for universities like the University of Wollongong to access so they can concentrate on and specialise in teaching, in addition to significant initiatives to provide increased access for students from what we describe as equity groups as well as increased access for Indigenous students.Three vice-chancellors of leading regional universities have supported this package. The Vice-Chancellor of Southern Cross University, Professor John Rickard, in the Coffs Harbour Advocate on 28 May, congratulated the government for a budget package that supports high-quality education in regional Australia. The Vice-Chancellor of Sunshine Coast University, in the Sunshine Coast Daily on 17 May, said -  - The Vice-Chancellor of the Sunshine Coast University said:Whilst there are a number of details to be worked through and there are some issues exciting debate, the scale and scope of the changes being driven by the government represent the most exciting vision for higher education I've seen in over 30 years in Australia.Professor Kerry Cox, the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Ballarat, was quoted in the Courier as saying, `Of considerable benefit to the University of Ballarat and to other universities -  - Finally, as I was saying, the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Ballarat, from whom I think the Australian Labor Party could learn one or two lessons in relation to leadership in higher education, said that he supports these reforms because they serve the best interests of Australia and Australian higher education. He said: Of considerable benefit to the University of Ballarat specifically and other regional universities is a new regional loading to help offset the higher costs in regional and rural areas. - He said:Taken as a whole, the higher education proposals should provide opportunities for more Australians to become productively engaged in the knowledge society in which we live and should help position Australia on a per capita basis to be a leader in the timely application of new knowledge as well as the ongoing generation of knowledge and ideas.The point here is that universities the length and breadth of this country, and in regional communities in particular, strongly support this because this is in the interests of Australia and future generations of students, researchers and academics. The Labor Party have to either get on the bus or get out of the way.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, I might take the opportunity to deal with some of these matters quite fully, if I may, because yesterday I saw some comments by the shadow minister and her colleague the member for Reid that clearly indicated that they have not been listening too carefully to the answers I have given, nor have they taken those answers into account in their public comments.First, in relation to the question that was raised yesterday as to the material available to prove that Mr Tan was operating a bona fide business in Australia, I am advised by my department that the department assessed that Mr Tan had met his business skills visa requirements prior - which is a little different to what I said in this House - to the withdrawal from the AAT review of cancellation. - In fact, it strengthens my position. The assessment was based upon Mr Tan's completed business skills monitoring survey form which detailed his business activities in Australia. Mr Tan provided the detailed supporting documentation requested in the survey form. That demonstrated a genuine attempt to be involved in business activity in Australia, which is the requirement of the monitoring. The material that Mr Tan provided was reviewed by my department, and an Australian Securities and Investment Commission check was undertaken which independently verified his ownership of a business. That led to the department withdrawing from the AAT review on 25 March 2002. Yesterday there was some criticism offered that Mr Tan, being 47 years of age at the time of application, was able to obtain a business skills visa. As we are in the mood for tabling, let me table the business owner 127 class visa which was operational at that time. The fact is that at the time of Mr Tan's application for a business skills visa class AD on 20 January 1998, the criteria to be met was set down in regulations. Schedule 7 of the regulations contained the business skills points test and set out in part 2 the relevant points available to applicants for their age at the time of application. The regulations provided in item 7202 of part 2 of schedule 7 that if an applicant is not less than 45 years of age but less than 50 years, the number of points to be awarded was 25. There was no requirement for him to be under 45 years of age at that time.As the suggestion was made yesterday that in some way he had improperly obtained entry under departmental scrutiny and that in some way I might be compounded in that - that was what you were trying to do - I thought it was particularly appropriate to put before you the criteria so that you would be aware of it.Finally, I was asked yesterday to confirm that there is a 28-day time limitation for an appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The fact is that there is a 28-day period to appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal but the period starts from the date of notification of a decision. In this case he was not sent a notification of the decision because he did not receive it. The department has evidence of this because it was returned -  - with a note on the envelope: `Left address'. My department considered that the address to which the notification was sent was inadequate for the purposes of the legislation and on this basis my department consented to Mr Tan filing a late appeal. I am advised that my department did not seek my approval for allowing an appeal to the AAT.There was a further question in relation to this matter, and I dare say it affirms the reason for privacy in relation to many of these activities that have been raised in this instance. Let me affirm what I said several days ago: I regard it as a very serious issue that Mr Tan may have misled the department in relation to the information put to the department in relation to his citizenship application. In citizenship applications, because of a change made to the law by this government, people have to provide information as to whether or not they have been the subject of any charges or convictions - that is, serious criminal offences - so that can be taken into account. The reason for that was to provide an opportunity for the cancellation of visas if the department had been misled. There was no requirement, and there never has been a requirement in citizenship matters where people have been largely resident in Australia, to make further inquiries after the original checks associated with their first entry into Australia. So when he first entered in 1998, those checks had been carried out fully with the Philippines authorities and no further advice was received by my department about any of the issues that have since been raised.  Due to the fact that this is now a matter of public notoriety that has been treated in this House for a number of days, I advise the House that I believe Mr Tan left Australia yesterday. -  - The members of the opposition treat this matter lightly. Opposition members - Oh! - Let me make it very clear that one has to act lawfully in relation to these matters. Immigration officials do not have the power under the Migration Act to prevent an Australian citizen from leaving the country. I am advised that no formal approach from the Philippines government, either for a provisional arrest or for an extradition request, had been received prior to his departure. As I said before, we have no power to detain an Australian citizen from leaving the country. But, given that this matter has been raised in the House in the way it has, I have no doubt that, in relation to his own behaviour, Mr Tan may well have taken that into account.  - Yes. -  - The way in which you traduce people's -  - I want to make the point that when we bring into the debate - contrary to the rules in relation to privacy - the names of people, it becomes clear in relation to the issues that we are dealing with here that people will take into account the prospect of extradition. It is perfectly obvious that that is what would happen. - Well, let me make it clear that the extradition of Australian citizens - and I am not the Attorney-General; I do not speak for him - is available for criminal offences that take place abroad that are similar to criminal offences that take place in Australia. Provided there is no capital punishment associated with it, whether it is an Australian citizen or any other person, extradition is available. That would be clear from the treaty agreement that I understand we have with the Philippines and which was signed in recent years. I have also been advised that the AFP made contact with the Philippines police this morning and have advised them of the departure details. They have also issued a general alert to Interpol so that further action might be taken in relation to this matter.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Mackellar for her question and for her interest. We have been working tirelessly with our regional partners on the issue of counter-terrorism. Tomorrow I will be going to Phnom Penh for a meeting of the ASEAN Regional Forum, as well as the ASEAN postministerial conference later in the week. A very important component of the discussions in the ASEAN Regional Forum will be a focus on counter-terrorism. I remind the House that Australia recently co-hosted with Singapore an ASEAN Regional Forum workshop in Darwin on managing the consequences of a terrorist attack. I talked about this in the House on a previous occasion. The outcome of that meeting will be part of the discussions in Phnom Penh.It is true that it would be quite wrong to claim that the battle against terrorism in our part of the world - in South-East Asia and the east Asian region more generally - is a battle that is won; it is far from won. There is a long way to go and there is still a lot more work to be done, but there has been an unprecedented level of cooperation between countries in the region, particularly on sharing of information, law enforcement and so on. This has not come quickly; it has come more slowly sometimes than we would have liked. But the House does not need reminding of the excellent cooperation between Australia and Indonesia, particularly on the Bali investigations. There is also very good cooperation now on the question of Jemaah Islamiah and its activities in South-East Asia, including Indonesia.Recently I have been delighted that Cambodia has arrested three people suspected of having Jemaah Islamiah connections. On 11 June, Thailand arrested three people suspected of planning attacks against Western interests in Thailand at the time of the APEC Leaders Summit in October. One of the targets was alleged to have been the Australian embassy. We are delighted that the Thais have now taken action against Jemaah Islamiah. We have been very concerned about Jemaah Islamiah activities in Thailand, and on many occasions we have drawn our concern to the attention of the Thai government. It is a good development that they are now taking decisive action against Jemaah Islamiah. We were reminded of the dangers just the other day, when a Thai national was arrested in Bangkok trying to sell radioactive material. According to media reports, the material originated in Russia and was smuggled through Laos into Thailand. Incidents like that not only reinforce the great dangers of terrorism but also remind us of the links between terrorism and weapons of mass destruction. The meeting this week of the ASEAN Regional Forum will coincide with the continuation of the Bali trials. Those two events should help our region to focus substantially on our continuing work on counter-terrorism. As I said earlier, there is still a long way to go to win the war against terrorism in our part of the world, but enormous progress has been made.</DOC>

 - As to the funding shortfall, I will check the claim made by the Leader of the Opposition -  - You sometimes verbal people, including some on your own side. - Let me say to the Leader of the Opposition that the claim implicit in his question - that, in some way, the number of HECS funded places will be fewer under our policy - is wrong. There will be more. The claim implicit in your question that students will have to pay $100,000 when they become entitled to a HECS place is wrong. The current situation is that 98 per cent of students who attend Australian universities are the beneficiaries of HECS funded places. There will be more HECS funded places under our scheme. We will give the same treatment, in relation to full fee paying students, to Australian citizens as we have for years to foreign citizens. I think that is fair, and I am amazed that the Australian Labor Party is opposed to it.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Makin for her question and her interest in economic policy. The recent NAB monthly business survey showed that, notwithstanding a very difficult international situation, business conditions rose by one point in May to an index of plus seven per cent. In addition to that, consumer confidence remains sound. The Westpac Melbourne Institute has indicated that consumer confidence is around 10 per cent above its long-term average, at 110. Last week, when the House was not sitting, the May labour force statistics showed that, for the month of May, employment grew by 29,000 people; unemployment fell by 10,200; most of the job creation was in the full-time sector; and unemployment fell to six per cent. For the first time in a very long period of time, the Australian unemployment rate stands below that of the United States. The United States has a much more flexible labour market than Australia. It is generally assumed that that probably gives the US a two per cent edge against the Australian unemployment figures at the same point in a cycle. The fact that Australian unemployment is now lower than the United States, notwithstanding that structural inhibition we have in Australia, is indicative of the fact that the cycle has been much stronger here in Australia. What could be done to create further job growth here in Australia? First of all, there is the issue of labour market reform. If the Senate would get out of the way - if it would pass labour market reform - more Australians could have jobs. That would be great for young Australians and home buyers. If the Senate would get out of the way, we could pass the government's budget changes in relation to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and disability support pension. We could also heighten work incentives and start reforming the welfare system if the Senate would get out of the way and allow the government to get on with restoring economic confidence. Again, this would be one of the great things that would help sustain the Australian economy.Notwithstanding that, in the midst of a very difficult international environment - a US recession, a downturn in Europe, the Japanese recession and SARS - the worst drought in 100 years and Senate obstructionism, this government has laid down a strong economic program that has kept more Australians in jobs than would otherwise be the case. It has kept lower interest rates than would otherwise be the case. It has allowed young Australians to buy houses, which otherwise would not have been the case. These are the pay-offs from good economic management, all of which have been opposed by the Labor Party. The best thing the Labor Party could do for economic management in this country is to get out of the way and let the government get on with the job.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Barton for his question. Obviously, no-one likes strikes. The tragedy of this strike is that those workers who have listened to the AMWU are thousands of dollars out of pocket. That is because of this strike. I should point out that, while there are some workers still on strike, the majority of the work force of this particular factory are back at work under Australian workplace agreements which have been facilitated by the policies of this government. Yes, it is true that workers have every right to seek a certain sort of agreement. But employers have every right to seek a different sort of agreement, and that is what our system is about. It is about facilitating choice.  - This government believes in an important role for the Industrial Relations Commission. The Industrial Relations Commission should be an umpire and not an adjudicator. The role of the Industrial Relations Commission is to ensure that the law is observed; it is not to try to settle every single dispute. If members opposite want to go back to the good old days of Bob Hawke riding in at the last minute to settle disputes, that is fine. But what this government has done under its system - a system which facilitates choice - is deliver more than one million new jobs, a 12 per cent real increase in full-time average weekly earnings and the lowest number of strikes since records were first kept, in 1913. That is the industrial trifecta for the workers of Australia.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Blair for his question, because Australia has a very charitable involvement -  -  - I reiterate what I said: Australia has a very charitable role in terms of resettling refugees in its refugee and humanitarian program. Something of the order of 12,000 places each year have been allocated. Of course, that program in the past has been reduced because of onshore claims - and I think members are well aware of that - but as at 31 May this year 9,811 offshore humanitarian visas had been issued. That comprises something in the order of 3,976 refugee places and 5,835 places in the special humanitarian program; 45 per cent of those went to people from Africa, 24 per cent to people from the Middle East and nine per cent to people from south-west Asia. That is a 50 per cent increase in the number of offshore humanitarian visas granted for the same period last year. Why has this happened? It has happened primarily because we have seen no boats arriving in Australia - none of substance - since December 2001. We are now able to offer more places to those who never have a chance to engage people smugglers and who confront us. We see those people coming through this program, with poor nutrition and high infant mortality, from camps around the world.As a result of our policies, we have also seen a significant reduction in onshore protection places. This year 824 visas have been issued, and that is a 75 per cent reduction on the 3,776 onshore places that had been issued at the same time last year. Applications from people in Australia are also down significantly for this year. To the end of May they were down to 4,518. I have never seen figures of that order in the time I have been minister, and I cannot remember when they have been that low before. It certainly compares very favourably with 8,122 for the same time last year. Who are the winners in relation to this? The winners are refugees in the most deplorable situations abroad and, of course, the Australian taxpayer. We have been able to return something in the order of $467 million over four years as a result of the reduction in the number of unlawful arrivals. Contrast that with the programs that are spoken of by our opponents opposite, who want to set up a coastguard at a cost of half a billion dollars. They have other measures that add up to something in the order of $2 billion. While we have been delivering savings, they seem to be out there wanting to spend again.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Boothby for his question. I know he is very actively engaged in and interested in these issues. The government is very concerned about the possibility of weapons of mass destruction materials being traded internationally. Of course, it has happened over the years. Australia is one of only 11 countries that took part on 12 June - that is, last week - in a meeting in Madrid to promote the proliferation security initiative, which is, initially, an initiative of the United States. That meeting strongly endorsed the need for new practical and imaginative measures to constrain trade in weapons of mass destruction materials. We are very happy with the way the meeting progressed.The measures could include - and, at this stage, the proposals are somewhat speculative, because a great deal more work has to be done on them - the searching of transport planes and vessels and tightening of relevant domestic and international laws. Participants have agreed to meet again during the course of next month at a location yet to be determined.The Madrid process complements very much the strong position Australia has taken over many years - and that includes the position taken by the previous government, not just by this government - to do all we possibly can to try to advance the nonproliferation agenda. This government brought to life the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty in September 1996 and the previous government was very active on the chemical weapons convention, and so the list goes on. There has been a certain amount of speculation that this initiative - the Madrid initiative, as we might call it - is North Korea specific. It is not North Korea specific, but of course it is directly relevant to measures that are being taken or at least considered in relation to trying to stop the movement of weapons of mass destruction related materials in and out of North Korea. We had discussions during the course of last week with the United States and Japan in Tokyo on this very matter. The Australian delegation was led by the Secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Dr Calvert.Contrary to some speculation, Australia is not about to launch a blockade of North Korea, but we are looking at practical cooperation with key countries to deny North Korea further access to weapons of mass destruction materials and to deny it access to markets as well. North Korea must understand that it does have to cease these activities and, of course, abandon altogether its nuclear programs. I take the opportunity to say that I am very disappointed that the North Korean foreign minister has decided not to participate in the ASEAN regional forum this week. The Australian government is responding in, I think, a very forthright and constructive way to do everything it can to deal with the immensely challenging but also very difficult issue of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction materials.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Griffith for his question. I assume that the report attributed to the LondonObserver is of a piece with the report in the Sydney Morning Herald this morning which says the same thing. - It sounds as though it says the same thing. As a result of reading that report, I had some investigations made through the Office of National Assessments, and I have been informed as follows. United States and United Kingdom intelligence agencies have concluded that at least one of the three vehicle trailers found in Iraq is a mobile biological weapons production facility and closely matches the description given to the United Nations Security Council in February by the Secretary of State.Let me take the opportunity of saying this to the member for Griffith and to all members of this House: I, and the government I lead, remain intensely proud of what Australia did in relation to Iraq. I do not in any way retreat from the justification that I provided on behalf of the government for our entry into the war against Iraq. The legal justification for that entry was, of course, the noncompliance by Iraq with UN Security Council resolutions. I also sought - to a lesser degree but, nonetheless, importantly - to justify our involvement in terms of the importance and the centrality of the American alliance. I note also, relevantly, that yesterday on the Channel 10 program the member for Brand expressed the view that perhaps in the end evidence of weapons of mass destruction would be found, which seems to run a little counter to the cacophony coming from the current frontbench of the Labor Party. I go on to say that I remain confident that the coalition's investigations will uncover the full extent of Saddam Hussein's WMD programs. Patience is needed as the process of investigating more than 1,000 suspect sites will take time. It will also require time to encourage the Iraqis involved in the program to come forward.The intelligence community in Australia was firm in its assessments of Iraq's WMD status. The Office of National Assessments remains confident in the judgment that there was a WMD capability in Iraq in the lead-up to the war and is continuing to assess the scope and the nature of that capability in the light of post-conflict investigations. Let me repeat: this country did the right thing in joining the Americans in waging war against Saddam Hussein's regime. Those from the opposition who now seek to denigrate what this government and this country do are, in effect, calling for the restoration of Saddam Hussein as the ruler of Iraq.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Mallee for his question. He and other members who represent electors who live on the banks of the River Murray are very conscious of the importance of having a healthy River Murray. It is very much the lifeblood of a significant proportion of Australian agricultural wealth, but also rural and urban communities are critically dependent upon this river system. We are committed to having a healthy Murray system not only for the two million people who benefit from and use its water but also for the 40 per cent of Australia's agricultural wealth that comes from that particular region.The Living Murray initiative is a plan to improve the health of the Murray-Darling river system by increasing environmental flows in that system. The Commonwealth has been working with the states in a process of community consultation to look at the environmental, social and economic implications of various options that might be considered in relation to increasing the levels of environmental flows. When we make those assessments it is important that we look at what can be achieved for the amount of water that is available, the cost of those proposals and how that cost is actually going to be met. There are many communities and regions in which livelihoods are dependent on that decision, and it is appropriate that they should be effectively consulted about that process. We have already spent a considerable amount of money on improving the quality of the River Murray system - more than $60 million on new salinity management initiatives and $33 million on salt interception schemes - and a significant proportion of the $4 billion for the National Action Plan for Salinity and Water Quality and the Natural Heritage Trust will be spent on those particular regions.The honourable member for Mallee asked whether there are any alternative policies. I heard the Leader of the Opposition throw a number around a few months ago and again today but, frankly, I would have to say there are no alternative policies. The Leader of the Opposition went to the River Murray mouth and said that he is going to provide 1,500 gigalitres for environmental flows. He did not say what he is going to use it for. Is it all going to be used for flushing out the mouth?The honourable member for Mallee, who is an engineer, would have a better idea than the Leader of the Opposition as to whether that is a practical idea or not. The Leader of the Opposition has not done any engineering or hydrological studies to know whether that would do any good. Is he going to remove all the barrages from the system to enable all this water to get down? If so, what about the towns and the regions that will be flooded as a result of his decision to take this action unilaterally? Or is he going to put the water towards some of the 30,000 wetlands in the system that would like to have improved water flow? You do not have a policy when you do not even know what you are going to do with the water.The next question obviously is: where is the water coming from? The Leader of the Opposition might think he can walk on water after this morning, but I do not think that even he thinks he can just command it to fall from the sky. If you are going to have 1,500 gigalitres extra going down the River Murray, where is it going to come from? Is he going to take it from the water supply for the people in the city of Adelaide or in the country towns, or from the industries that use it, or is it all going to come from the farmers? Are they going to have to give up the 1,500 gigalitres? And, if that is the case, how are you going to pay for it? Where is the money put aside for this significant new initiative?The South Australian government have just introduced a new tax that they say is going to improve the health of the Murray, but that tax would have to run for more than 500 years to pay for 1,500 gigalitres of water. So where are the opposition going to get their 1,500 gigalitres from? Where is the money coming from? This is the policy: Labor are going to provide 1,500 gigalitres for the Living Murray initiative, but they do not know what they are going to use it for, they do not know where it is coming from, and they do not know how they are going to pay for it. If that is the best they can do for policy, it takes us back to the 13 years when they did absolutely nothing. - </DOC>

 - The answer is no. -  - By way of further elaboration: Mr Wilkie of course is perfectly entitled as a private citizen to appear anywhere he wishes, and he is not in any way barred from giving his views. I do not share his views, and those views are not shared by the organisation he used to work for. I should refer the Leader of the Opposition to a statement made by the Director-General of ONA at the time of Mr Wilkie's resignation in March when Mr Jones, who is the director-general, pointed out that Mr Wilkie had been an analyst working mostly on illegal immigration issues and in a branch that was not responsible for ONA's coverage of Iraq.In supplementation of the question asked by the member for Griffith, I might also specifically say, in relation to the media report claiming UK officials believe the suspect BW vehicles were for hydrogen gas production, that on investigation with our agencies I have been told that Australian agencies are not aware of any UK official view that gives any credence to these media reports.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Solomon for his question. I had the privilege of being in Solomon last week, and in the suburb of Winnellie in Darwin we saw an outstanding program run jointly by the Territory Construction Association and the Northern Land Council in relation to the Alice Springs-Darwin railway line. Under this program, 1,200 Territorians have received formal training, 350 of whom were Aboriginal Territorians receiving training specifically in construction and civil engineering from certificate 1 through to certificate 4. Further to that, not only was that program supported by significant Commonwealth funding this year of $684 million in total to support new apprenticeships and training, but also the industry services training organisation has taken two lots of 15 Aboriginal Territorians recommended to it by the Northern Land Council and is putting them into a pre-employment training program for five to six weeks. This will enable those Indigenous Australians to go from having no skills at all to having formally recognised training that they can take to any part of Australia, having done their pre-employment program up to and including certificate level 3 in engineering and construction.It is interesting that, when I visited the men who were working on the Alice Springs-Darwin railway, a couple of hours drive south of Darwin, I did not get many questions, as they toiled away, about their concern for vets, dentists and lawyers and the kinds of HECS debts they might face. I can tell you that their concerns were far more fundamental than that. On Friday, the National Council for Vocational Education Research released the latest data on this government's initiatives in relation to apprentices and training. We have now got 391,000 Australians - 54 per cent of them under the age of 25 - in apprenticeships and training. That is 15 per cent growth in the last year.  Commencements were up 264,000, which is a 14 per cent increase. - I am coming to that. Most importantly, there were 118,500 completions - that is, a 19 per cent increase. Four per cent of the commencements are now school based, and 37 per cent of all those in training are women - and it is increasing. Behind all of that data are the lives of everyday Australians, young people in particular.This government has also just announced and offered to the states $3.6 billion to support training over the next three years. On Friday in Darwin, the states and territories agreed to discuss in detail the proposition that we will be further expanding training over the next three years. If the Labor Party wants to reflect on the problems it has, it should reflect on this: in 18 months I have had 17 questions without notice on universities and one on apprenticeships and training. Reflect on it!</DOC>

 - I have already indicated our attitude to an independent inquiry. I do recall reading reports in relation to one of the British documents. As to the relationship between that and my February statement, I will have a look at both of the documents. But nothing can alter the fact that this country -  - Nothing can alter the fact that this House resolved to support the government's decision to join the coalition against Saddam Hussein, legally based upon the noncompliance of Iraq with resolutions of the Security Council of the United Nations relating to weapons of mass destruction. That was the legal justification. I remain totally of the view that that legal justification was sound. The moral justification for taking part is even sounder, and that moral justification has been reinforced by the successive discovery, since the end of hostilities in Iraq, of the atrocities practised by Saddam Hussein - atrocities that exceed in their magnitude manyfold the casualties that were involved in the military operation.  - Nothing can wipe away the fact that all of the doomsday -  - forecasts of those who sit opposite: the flooding of the Tigris-Euphrates valley, the hundreds of thousands of refugees and the hundreds of thousands of deaths forecast by the member for Fremantle -  - On top of that, another issue has clearly emerged. Despite the terrible bloodshed that continues in the Middle East, the determination of the United States administration - born out of their successful prosecution of the war in Iraq - has now given those in the Middle East who want a peace settlement greater hope than we have ever had before. That is one of the bonuses of that military operation. I know those who sit opposite rail against the decision that was taken by the government. Go on railing against it, because you are railing against the judgment of your fellow Australians. You go on railing against it -  - Let me make this very clear, Mr Speaker: the judgment that we made in relation to the intelligence -  - was based upon assessments properly made without any kind of improper influence by our intelligence agencies. They were judgments honestly made by, amongst other things, an organisation - the Office of National Assessments - that celebrates its 25 years of existence today. We went to war in a just cause, on a proper legal basis, to liberate an oppressed people, and I remain eternally proud of the role played by the Australian military forces and this government in the liberation of the people of Iraq.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Macquarie for his question, and I can tell the member for Macquarie that the reduction in strikes is one of the most significant achievements of the Howard government. The strike rate today is just one-third what it was in 1996 and just one-thirtieth of what it was in the early 1980s. Strikes cost jobs, they damage industries and they jeopardise investment. The real victims of strikes are normally the ordinary workers, who lose hundreds and sometimes thousands of dollars in pay while strike organisers - the union officials - keep getting paid. Strikes should be the weapon of last resort, not first resort, in industrial disputes.The government believe in industrial democracy. We believe in democracy in the workplace. Workers should not be railroaded or intimidated into strikes they do not support. Workers and not union officials should make the decision to go on strike, and that means there should be secret ballots before strikes. The Leader of the Opposition is a convert to the cause of secret ballots. When his leadership was being undermined by people who did not know the meaning of loyalty, he decided that he supported secret ballots. He decided that he supported secret ballots, and 58 lemmings cannot be wrong. - I was asked about secret ballots. I simply put it to the Leader of the Opposition, who has just been supported by people who have gone for the union candidate rather than the people's candidate -  - A rooster would do better than the member for Werriwa in this position. - Of course, Mr Speaker, and I apologise if you think I have transgressed. Let me simply put it to the Leader of the Opposition: if secret ballots are the way to resolve intractable political disputes, why can't they also be used to resolve intractable industrial disputes?</DOC>

 - The statements I made were after I had read the brief that had been prepared for me for 2001. That brief set out those facts. The first schedule, in which I made a decision not to intervene, did not include reference to three sisters. The one letter I have seen from Mr Cameron to me did not refer to three sisters. So I stand by the explanation I gave. If you are going to say there is some other material that I have not seen and was not -  - I don't know. - Do I read the file? I look at a very large number of requests for intervention, and I do not get the file in relation to every request for intervention. That is clear. I get a brief, and the information upon which I make up my mind as to whether I will intervene or not is the information that is disclosed in the brief. Of the two decisions I had to make, in the first decision it was not disclosed that there were three sisters. On the second occasion, when I made the decision, it was disclosed. If there is anything else on the file it was irrelevant to the decision I made.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Petrie for her question. She is a tremendous advocate for children, particularly for Commonwealth funded child care in her electorate - indeed, I know she does a lot of work across in Lilley as well, because she knows she can get results on this side of the House. There is no doubt that family day care, along with many other forms of Commonwealth funded child care, has been a tremendous success, giving families flexibility with children and with their care arrangements. With family day care specifically, we have seen a very large increase since 1996 - a 17 per cent increase from 60,000 to 71,000 places. There are 113,000 families who currently use family day care. They receive about $240 million directly in child-care benefits, or about $2,100 for every child. What is interesting is that the average fee for family day care is around $65 a week. If you break that down to a per annum figure, it is about $13 a day. More interesting is that 30 per cent of those families using the average amount of care pay less than $5 a week. The gap fee is less than $5 a week. The reason for this is that we have significantly increased funding through the child-care benefit. Another interesting note when it comes to family day care is that we spend $60 million through the broadband on family day care, which is about $1,000 per place going to family day care. I must say that we have had very good cooperation from all the key stakeholders, particularly in the development of how we can do it better in the appropriation of those resources to the changing nature of Australian families.  - I hear the shadow spokesman shouting out. - It is interesting to note that Jo Comans, who is the Executive Director of the National Family Day Care Council of Australia, congratulated the government on the transparency of the process that we are going through. Unfortunately, we do not see that transparency, or even an appropriate debate, from the Labor Party - it is back to their stock standard ALP policy of scaring families. Far from me to comment on this, but I noticed a comment on the Insiders program by the main writer for the Sydney Morning Herald, Mike Seccombe, that I thought demonstrated this lack of policy. He was talking about the member for Lilley - perhaps the last swansong? - and if ever there was one example of everything that is wrong with the modern Labor Party, it is Wayne Swan. He is unimaginative and poll driven; he is a shocker. - I know, Treasurer. I am sure there are 58 people on that side who would agree with me. What it does demonstrate is that the ALP still lacks a policy position when it comes to work and family and when it comes to children. It is this government, with its example of increased funding for family day care, that is giving greater opportunities and more flexibility to Australian children.</DOC>

 - I can confirm to the Leader of the Opposition that the foreign minister has issued a statement today attesting that he was provided with an ONA briefing on regional terrorism on 18 and 19 June 2002. That has been the subject of a submission to a Senate inquiry by the Office of National Assessments. The submission confirms that there was no intelligence warning of any kind about the attack on Bali - it confirms it. - And it confirms, in that sense, the finding of the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security, Mr Bill Blick, which was the subject of an unclassified report tabled in this parliament and a classified report that has been made available in full to the Leader of the Opposition. The ONA submission confirms that there was no intelligence warning of a possible terrorist attack in Bali. That is, as I said, consistent with the Blick report. During an ONA briefing on regional terrorism that took place on 18 and 19 June, one ONA analyst, in response to a question from Mr Downer, commented that Bali, Riau and Singapore could be attractive targets -  - This observation was based on speculation about what Jemaah Islamiah had the potential to do, not on any intelligence - I repeat, not on any intelligence. In some 20 written ONA reports on terrorism compiled between this briefing and the Bali attack, there was not one mention of the possibility of an attack in Bali. Significantly, ONA did not include this observation in any of its written assessments. Moreover, during the briefing, Mr Downer expressly asked whether the ONA analysts' observation about Bali required a change in the department's already strong travel advice for Indonesia. ONA's response to the direct question was that there was no specific intelligence about any such threat. As a result, no change was made to the travel advice. Security warnings in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade travel advisories are based on careful assessments of available intelligence. At the time of the Bali attack, our travel advisory for Indonesia was consistent with other Western countries such as the US and the United Kingdom. It warned Australians of the potential for terrorist bombings, including in areas frequented by tourists.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Indi. I take the opportunity of reaffirming the unconditional commitment of this government to its Tough on Drugs strategy. We remain committed to that strategy because it is right for the future of Australia, it is working and it has very strong support from the Australian public. It is the largest single initiative ever undertaken in this country to respond to the supply of, and to reduce the demand for, illicit drugs. More than $1 billion has now been committed and I acknowledge, in the main, the cooperation of the state governments of Australia over the time that the program has been in operation. We have clear evidence that the commitment is working. There are fewer people now using illicit drugs. Fewer people are dying from drug overdoses, particularly heroin. More parents are talking to their children about drugs. More treatment services are now available and all states and territories have now established diversion programs. Since the commencement of Tough on Drugs, more than eight tonnes of heroin, cocaine, ecstasy and amphetamine have been seized by law enforcement authorities. While these are very encouraging results, more needs to be done.Mr Speaker, with your indulgence, I will move briefly from the area of illicit drugs to licit drugs. The reports in the media yesterday highlighted that young women, in particular, are putting themselves at very serious risk through the use of illicit drugs, alcohol and tobacco, often, of course, compounded by the use of cannabis. A key to reducing drug abuse is to get the message across at a very early age. The best way to do this is through schools and by encouraging parents to talk to their children about drugs. Every school in Australia has received information for use in educating young Australians about drug use, focusing on illicit drugs and on alcohol and tobacco. Parents also have a vital role in educating their children, and the booklet sent to parents during our 2001 National Illicit Drugs campaign was designed to encourage parents to talk to their children about the danger of drug use. Research has shown that, as a result, 78 per cent of parents had discussed the issues raised in that booklet with their children.I am very pleased to say that the music industry recently joined forces with the government to promote a national alcohol campaign specifically targeting young people under the title of Drinking: where are your choices taking you? I understand that Jake Nicolaisen, from the band Another Race, spoke eloquently at the launch and had a simple message for young people when he said:There's nothing cool about not being in control. Our choices are our own, we live and die by them, we prosper and fall and we can hurt or help, but they are ours and we own them.He could not have more eloquently and directly expressed, in language very understandable to young Australians, the sorts of choices that young Australians face in this area. This government remains resolutely and unconditionally committed to its campaign in relation to illicit drugs. But it also recognises, as I am sure all members of this House will recognise, that the abuse of alcohol and tobacco can also have dreadful consequences. Binge drinking is a serious social threat in this country. It is not only something which is a responsibility of schools and community leaders; it is also a responsibility of parents. In fact, a major responsibility for tackling the problem lies with parents and, until there is a greater assumption of parental responsibility, the problem will grow as a threat to the future stability of our society.</DOC>

 - The arrangements regarding travel advisories do involve a judgment made by the foreign minister and by DFAT, and nobody is suggesting otherwise in my answer. But the point I made in the answer, and the point I would make again in reply to the Leader of the Opposition, is that you adjust travel advisories on the basis of specific information, and there was no specific information. - I would remind the Leader of the Opposition that that was not based on any intelligence, any advice or any facts.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Sturt for his question and for his devastating appearances on Lateline from time to time against various roosters of the opposition. Let me inform him, in answer to his question, that, as a consequence of this government's economic management, from 1 July this year every Australian income tax payer will receive an income tax cut. For people who are on $25,000, there will be an annual cut of $327 per annum; for those who are on $35,000, an annual cut of $208; for those who are on $55,000, an annual cut of $448; and for those who are on $65,000, an annual cut of $573. That is an income tax cut for every Australian.Unfortunately, it seems as if the Labor Party has decided to try to claw those tax cuts back by increasing state taxes in every one of the states and territories that it controls. If you are a Queenslander, you get an income tax cut from the federal government and the Queensland Labor Party claws back $88 with an ambulance levy on electricity bills. If you are a Victorian income taxpayer, you get a cut from the federal government and Steve Bracks puts up 300 taxes and fees to try to claw the money back. If you are in South Australia, the South Australian Labor government imposes a $30 water levy to try to claw back federal income tax cuts. There are gaming taxes here in the ACT and insurance taxes in WA. Now we see the Labor Party meanly trying to claw back income tax cuts by putting up fees, taxes and levies right around the states, and we say, `Don't listen to what the Labor Party talks about on tax; look at what it does.' Labor is the party of higher tax.I am asked whether there are alternative policies. I have been sitting around this parliament now for seven years, waiting for an alternative economic policy. Notwithstanding my very keen interest - and nobody reads Labor Party press releases with the interest that I do - I am still to find an alternative economic policy. In fact, the Hawke-Wran review into Labor's performance in the 2001 election said, on Labor:This was the second consecutive election in which Labor failed to present a credible and comprehensive policy on taxation.It also said:Labor's proposal to simplify and roll back the GST was a failure.There has been a bit of talk about who the author was of the small target policy - and he is actually presenting himself as a rather small target at the moment, near the dispatch box. I want to say in defence of the member for Brand that he has never been a small target! - What are the alternative policies which are about to come through from Labor? Again, I fear they are making the same mistake they have made for the last seven years. Labor say on the one hand they want bigger tax cuts, on the other hand they want more spending and at the end of the day that they want bigger surpluses. That is how the member for Hotham got his nickname `B.S. Crean' - bigger surplus Crean. Ross Gittins said this in the Sydney Morning Herald yesterday in relation to Labor's tax policy. I ask the House to listen to it:Labor is selling two propositions: the Liberals aren't putting enough money into government services and they're making you pay too much tax. So it wants to portray itself as the party of bigger government and the party of lower taxation.Remember that this is Ross Gittins, whom I never thought was a friend of the coalition in the past. I think Ross would be upset if we described him otherwise. Ross said that this makes Labor:... the Magic Pudding Party. Under Labor, you can have your cake and eat it. Like Bunyip Bluegum, you can 'cut and come again'.The one principle Labor stands for now is the abolition of opportunity cost. You should be able to spend all dollars twice over.We have been here for seven years and we have never figured out what Labor's policy is. You take a dollar and you spend it twice, and at the end of the day you have lower taxes and bigger surpluses! When they call Labor the party of MPs, it is not the party of members of parliament, it is not the party of major policies; it is the party of magic puddings! There is the magic pudding from Jagajaga in relation to more spending on higher education, the magic pudding in relation to health, the magic pudding in relation to the member for Hotham spending dollars twice! All I can say is: why didn't we think of that?</DOC>

 - The federal government is currently engaged in a process involving all of the states who are a part of the Murray-Darling Basin Commission and the people in the Murray-Darling system in community consultations about an environmental flow regime. We are essentially looking at three benchmarks: one at 350 gigalitres, one at 750 gigalitres and another at 1,500 gigalitres. Work is being done on what can be achieved in relation to each of those potential environmental flows - where the water might come from and what cost would be associated from both economic and social perspectives. It is impossible to make judgments about which is the most appropriate choice until that work has been done. The opposition have jumped on a figure of 1,500 gigalitres without any engineering or hydrology studies, without any social or economic impact assessments being done and, of course, without any costings being done. It is an empty policy. It is one of these little targets that they want, where you just name a number and then have no basis to support it. That has clearly been the basis of their discussions to date. No decision will be made in relation to appropriate levels of flow under the Living Murray initiative until the appropriate socio and economic work has been done. Because we want to make some progress as quickly as possible in relation to these matters, the commission has decided that we will seek to make a first step initiative at its next meeting, in November. On the basis of that work, this would be a relatively small but key first step, which would enable some identified priorities to be addressed in an economically and socially responsible way. We are engaging the communities. We are dealing with these issues in a constructive way and we will deliver outcomes - something Labor has never done.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Makin, who herself is a lover of Holdens and is an excellent driver - much better than some other colleagues, who I will not name! This is great news for South Australia: the Holden plant at Elizabeth had its inaugural third shift yesterday. That means that, for the first time, the Holden plant in South Australia is operating 24 hours a day.The member for Leichhardt, who was at the inaugural ceremony yesterday, advised me that the Holden plant at Elizabeth is one of only a handful of car factories in the world that operates 24 hours a day. That is a great story. It means 1,000 new jobs, which will affect the member for Makin's electorate, the member for Sturt's electorate and a number of other electorates. It means almost an extra $50 million in wages in South Australia. That boosts Holden's work force in South Australia to 5,200 employees. On top of that, there will be approximately 1,000 new jobs in the components industry, many of which are small businesses. That is a great story in itself. It proves that the Australian automotive industry is incredibly resilient.Last year was a record year for production, and this year is expected to increase above that by seven per cent. That means that Australia will have over 850,000 vehicle sales this year. That has come about because of consumer confidence and tax cuts. Whether the tax cuts are the result of the new tax system, which makes new vehicles cheaper, or the result of tax cuts to fuel, they all make a difference. The government has not just given tax cuts but has provided $4.2 billion in assistance to the automotive industry over the next 10 years. Sadly, the Labor Party and the unions have had nothing to do with this.It was only recently that the automotive industry was stalled by a wave of strikes, many of them illegal. The automotive strike rate was almost six times the national average. Strikes cost the industry around half a billion dollars in lost production. Sadly, industrial action is again under way. Strikes and bans have hit eight component producers in the last month alone. If this campaign escalates into a five-day stoppage it will mean the loss of $230 million, and at least 20,000 employees will be affected. It will obviously affect exports, and it threatens up to $100 million in automotive exports. If the Leader of the Opposition is looking for a policy, I have a suggestion for him. It is a very simple policy. He can ring Dougie Cameron and say: `Listen, old buddy; listen, China. Stop the strike action, because it's affecting jobs. Stop the strike action, because it's affecting wages.' If the Labor Party is serious about industrial relations and policy, it will stand up to the unions when it comes to strikes, and it will stand up for the workers in South Australia. </DOC>

 - I have seen reports that Labor have allocated $150 million to set up the Murray-Darling River Bank. I do not know whether it will be like the State Bank of South Australia or the State Bank of Victoria or how this $150 million will achieve the suggested targets that the Leader of the Opposition has identified. He said that he wants 1,500 gigalitres of water to run down the River Murray, and that he will buy it for $150 million. I do not know whether he has checked the water market but, for $150 million, you would be flat out buying 150 gigalitres, let alone 1,500 gigalitres. This is a classic example of an uncosted Labor policy. They have allocated an amount of money in their budget reply, but they have not thought out how they will achieve anything. They have done no engineering work and no planning. There has been no suggestion as to where the money will be spent or what it will achieve, and there has been no indication of where the water will come from.If you think I am the only one who considers that $150 million is a pretty paltry contribution towards buying 1,500 gigalitres, you might like to take the advice of a guy you have probably heard of - former environment minister Graham Richardson. He might know a little more about this than the Leader of the Opposition or the member who asked the question. On the night of the opposition budget reply, he said:Some of the things that the opposition leader had said are a little bit, I think, hard to believe. You are not going to save the Murray with $150 million. That is for sure. It needs a hell of a lot more than that.That is what your own people think about your proposal to put up $150 million. It is indeed a fraud on the people of the Murray-Darling Basin, it is a fraud on the people of South Australia and it is a fraud on anyone who wants the environment in the River Murray system to be improved. You simply cannot achieve it with that level of money unless you take the water from people and do not give them any compensation. It is time that Labor came clean and told the truth about where the water is coming from and what it hopes to achieve with it. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Corangamite for his question. I am aware of allegations made in last week's Sunday program. These allegations were principally directed against Mr Greg Sword, who is the National Secretary of the National Union of Workers and the National President of the Australian Labor Party. One informant to the program accused Mr Sword of involvement in orchestrating union ballot rigging, and I quote the informant:An army of workers, both from the NUW and from Network, on phone banks, work stations, day in, day out for about a week, all in support of one particular candidate of a rival union's election.More seriously, the Secretary of the Victorian Health Services Union, Mr Jeff Jackson, accused Mr Sword of involvement in an attempted bribe. He said:People who are running on my ticket were invited to a meeting at the NUW's office, which Greg Sword attended. And at that meeting, five other people who were involved in our ticket were offered an inducement of $190,000 to continue not supporting our ticket, basically to change sides.Mr Sword is certainly entitled to a presumption of innocence. Everyone is entitled to a presumption of innocence, but these are very serious allegations indeed. I have asked my department to consider what laws may have been broken and what remedies may be available. No-one is above the law. This government is totally committed to the rule of law, and the rule of law should apply in trade unions just as it should apply everywhere else.</DOC>

 - In answer to the honourable member for Bass, I will get advice on the figures that she has quoted. I do not carry them around in my head. I reject the suggestion that there have been any bungles or delays; certainly I reject any suggestion of bungles. - There was a need, because of the failure of one of the contractors or consultants involved in the design to meet deadlines, to find a replacement. That kind of thing happens. I might also -   - before those opposite get too excited with their interjections - remind the House that the stonework and the design in relation to this memorial is the responsibility of one and the same firm and of one particular person who was responsible for the tomb of the Australian unknown soldier, which was opened during the prime ministership of my immediate predecessor and which I think most people would agree is a wonderful piece of work. I think the memorial will be a very fitting tribute to those Australians who lost their lives in defence of the common values of Australia and the United Kingdom. - As to the question of the treatment of veterans, let me say to all those opposite that the Clarke report, which investigated conditions for veterans, is being considered by the government. There are some recommendations in that report which, I have to say, we will not be able to accept because they make recommendations that we do not think, in the circumstances, can be placed ahead of other priorities of the government. There is no government that has done more -  - in relation to commitment to veterans than has this government, but that does not mean to say that every proposition that is put to us on behalf of the veterans community is a proposition that we can meet. Let me also say to the honourable member that this government has demonstrated its commitment to Australian veterans and its willingness to listen to their concerns. For example, in the 2002-03 budget, we expanded access to the gold card to help veterans meet medical expenses. We did establish, as I mentioned, the independent Clarke committee to consider perceived anomalies in veterans' entitlements and the level of benefits and support to veteran disability pensions. The committee has made a total of 109 recommendations on a wide range of issues. This is the recommendation in the conclusion of the independent committee established by the government:... lifetime T&amp;PI rate disability benefits are adequate when compared with community norms.The government is still considering its response to the Clarke review. We are committed to listening to the views of ex-service organisations before announcing our response. The Repatriation Commission met peak national ex-service organisations in March to give them an opportunity to provide feedback on the report.The government has already rejected one of the recommendations of the Clarke review, and that is that future access to the gold card should be subject to means testing. I mention that to make the point that anybody who sees the Clarke review as being a panacea for the concerns of the veteran community ought to read the fine print. One of the recommendations would have been overwhelmingly unacceptable to the veterans community - that is, the means testing of access to the gold card - and the government has already rejected that.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Paterson for his question and his interest on behalf of his constituents in the government's Fairer Medicare package - a $917 million boost to Medicare and to the health system in Australia, which will make health more affordable, more available and more accessible. It will be more affordable for constituents of the member for Paterson because of the additional payments of up to $22,000 to enable general practitioners in electorates such as Paterson and in other parts of rural Australia to bulk-bill those seven million Australians who have concession cards. It will be more available also - and this is particularly important for people who live in rural areas of Australia - because it will resolve the difficulty of having to reclaim the Medicare rebate. There were often cases where people had to wait some time to do that and they had to travel distances to do that. They will be able to go to the doctor now and swipe their Medicare card, not having to go back to the Medicare office, queue and wait that extra time. This is a real benefit for Australians generally, particularly those in rural and remote areas of Australia.Health will be more accessible in terms of Medicare and in terms of placing more doctors, particularly in rural and remote areas and also the outer metropolitan areas of Australia. Indeed, in the three years from 1997-98 to 2000-01, there was an increase of 11.5 per cent in the number of doctors in these areas; an increase overall from 5,700 to 6,663. As a result of this government's Medicare package, there will be a more accessible, a more affordable and a more available Medicare system for Australians.I am asked about whether there are any alternative health policies. The only alternative health policy has been the one to shore up the health of the Leader of the Opposition. I note that in his budget reply -  -  - I hear the interjections from the other side.  We have the roosters and the turkeys waiting around for Christmas, and we have the mad dog and a few dead ducks. This is not an opposition; it is animal farm. In his budget reply, the Leader of the Opposition said that his approach to Medicare was a `cut and fix' approach. We know what he wants to cut - that is, the private health insurance rebate. How do we know that? On 4 February this year, the health ministers of all the Labor states around Australia said that what the Labor Party federally should do is cut the private health insurance rebate. For the 37,000 constituents in the electorate of the member for Paterson, it would mean that the Labor Party, if it were to win government, would cut that rebate. In fact, it would mean a tax increase under the Labor Party for some 40,000 constituents of the Leader of the Opposition. What he wants to do under his policy - if the Labor health ministers have their way - is to cut the private health rebate. That is the cutting part of the Labor Party package.Of course, we know what `fixing' it is, because the former shadow health spokesman for the Labor Party, the member for Perth - now banished to the back bench - was proposing another tax increase, and that was a Medicare levy rise proposed under Labor. So what we know about the alternative policy is that it is a policy to slash the private health insurance rebate; to effectively increase taxes for ordinary Australians and to put up the Medicare levy. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for New England for his question and for raising issues which have already been raised with me by Senators Tierney and Macdonald. I also thank the member for New England for pointing out that, in the government's $1.5 billion investment in Australia's higher education over the first four years and $10.6 billion increased investment over 10 years, one of the key elements, which both the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister argued very strongly for, was to see that specific recognition was given to support and recognise the increasing burdens that are carried by universities and campuses in the regions of Australia. The result of that was funding of $122.6 million specifically for 31 universities in 54 campuses, and the University of New England will receive a 7½ per cent additional loading to its funding in recognition of the requirements that are being placed on the Armidale campus.I should also point out that one of the many things in this package is, firstly, a 7½ per cent increase in the core funding for universities in the first three years, including the University of New England. If any university in any way is disadvantaged by the government moving to fund the university on the basis of the course content it delivers - and I do not accept it from the honourable member at face value; we will obviously be examining that in some detail - there is a $12.6 million transition fund specifically in 2005 to ensure that no university is disadvantaged.I might also add that there will be 31,500 thousand additional HECS funded places in the first five years. The over-enrolled places at the University of New England, which attract only a quarter of the funding of the students up to the enrolment target, will become fully funded by the Commonwealth at a total cost of $347.6 million over three years. - Those 25,000 places will indeed remain in the higher education sector. - In addition to that, there will be 25,100 scholarships, 7,500 of which will be targeted for students in regional and rural areas to support accommodation costs - $16,000 each. There will be $138 million for a learning and teaching performance fund, specifically focused on universities such as the University of New England. In addition to that, we are increasing by $6.9 million the equity pool for universities over three years. A major withdrawer from that fund at the moment is the University of New England. There will be $10.3 million extra for the Indigenous support fund. That will be performance based. The University of New England has one of the most outstanding programs to support Indigenous students throughout the country. In addition to that there will be major changes in relation to industrial relations and governance for universities. Australia's vice-chancellors are here this week. I commend not only Professor Ingrid Moses, the Vice-Chancellor of the University of New England, but also all of the vice-chancellors for the leadership that they have shown in working with the government and even unions and students and the business community over the past year in developing a reform package that will build Australia's future in higher education. Sadly, the only organisation that did not contribute in any way is on the other side of the parliament.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Riverina for her question and her continuing and outstanding advocacy for Charles Sturt University. The government, as I just said, has announced a major reform package for Australian higher education. It is about the sort of economic and social development this country can expect over the next 10 to 20 years. Reform is necessary to make sure that we are internationally competitive in higher education.Apart from the $1.5 billion of extra public investment in the first four years, one of the things that was argued to the government by each one of the vice-chancellors of the 38 universities was that they should for the first time be able to set their own HECS charge according to what they think the courses require in terms of a student contribution, that student contribution being paid back, of course, only when the student has finished university and is earning, under this package, in excess of $30,000 a year. The vice-chancellors of Charles Sturt University, the University of Wollongong, the University of Western Sydney, Macquarie University and indeed the University of Tasmania have all said that their HECS charges will essentially not change at all - and, of course, in Tasmania we had TasUni fees to stay as they are.I was asked whether there were any other policies in this regard. Last Sunday week, in answer to a question in relation to Labor's higher education policy, the Leader of the Opposition told the Sunday program, `It's a work in progress' - which of course was also the title of one of Barry Jones's books. Two weeks ago we had the member for Melbourne, who, when asked where Labor's blueprint was, said, `I don't know.' So there is obviously a major challenge there. We have also had the member for Jagajaga, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, running around as Henny Penny Jenny, telling parents that they are going to have to start saving up for their child's higher education from the time of their birth - and it seems that the Leader of the Opposition has been swallowing some of this nonsense as well. I read with some interest, if not concern, in the Australian of 12 June under the heading `Students united on division': Simon Crean ventured to the university's - that is, the University of Western Sydney - Penrith campus yesterday to listen to students' concerns, including those of one student who he said faced a $90,000 debt under the Government's education reforms.So I asked myself -  -  - Given the leadership qualities with which the opposition seems to be obsessed, I thought, `How could this be true?' A student doing, for example, arts-law in 2005, under the current arrangements, would be paying $5,300 a year and would leave with an arts-law degree of $26,500. Under these proposals, if the University of Western Sydney decided, which it said it would not, to increase the HECS charge to the maximum possible amount - all of that money going into the university - that student would leave university with a debt of $34,500. - The Leader of the Opposition says that that is cheap and that is good. Precisely - $34,500 to spend your working life as a lawyer, when the chippies and the boilermakers and the mechanics down the road in Penrith are paying for three-quarters of the education of those who go to university under this package.Did the Leader of the Opposition actually say to this student, `Look, I don't think you've got it right; I have carefully read this package, I've listened to the leadership of Australian universities and I have listened as the Leader of the Opposition to the minister for education and indeed the Prime Minister in the parliament'? No, he did not. An hour later he did a press conference and he said:I was speaking to a student who is doing a combined law-arts degree. If that policy is put into place, her degree will cost $90,000.It is at least intellectual laziness, and it is at worst an out-and-out lie that is being deceitfully perpetrated upon some of the most vulnerable families in this country to make them believe that in some way higher education will be beyond their means. - Mr Speaker, I withdraw. But it is obvious that -  - Mr Speaker, I withdraw. But the Leader of the Opposition has been stating things which he knows -  -  - The Leader of the Opposition has been making statements to Australians which he believes not to be true. The consequences of those statements, he has pointed out himself -  - This issue rises above many of the things that pass for debate here on a day-to-day basis. This is about the attitudes, emotions and concerns of parents, and they deserve to be told the facts by governments and by oppositions. By all means debate the facts, but the Leader of the Opposition himself, in speaking to Laurie Oakes last Sunday on Channel 9, gave the consequence of what he, the member for Jagajaga and others on the other side are deliberately doing. Referring to the University of Western Sydney, he said:Two thirds of the students on that campus are the first members of their family ever to go to a university ... and ... Laurie, they will be the last, because he's putting up fees ...If they are the last, it is because they will have been deceived and given misinformation by people who should know better - and the member for Brand knows what I am talking about.</DOC>

 - The matters raised are only serious in the context that I would not want to knowingly mislead this House - let me make that very clear. What I said needs to be seen in terms of what I uttered on 29 May. What I said was that the information provided to me initially made no reference to the man's family. I went on to say, `I have no idea whether my department may have received any other advice,' to which the Leader of the Opposition interjected, `Find out.' I then continued:I could ask but I do not think it is relevant because it was not before me at the time I first considered the matter.I said, and I repeat: it was not a matter which was relevant to me because it was not before me at the time when I first considered the matter. That is the relevant issue. The next issue arose in the context of a letter written by Mr Cameron. What I said in relation to that letter - and it is absolutely true - was:It was not before me or the department at the time Mr Cameron wrote his letter but it was before me when I made the decision in January 2002. - It clearly was, in the context, and you are clearly selectively quoting. -  - Absolutely. Those remarks were uttered absolutely in the context of Mr Cameron's letter, and Mr Cameron's letter made no reference to the man's family being in Australia. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for McPherson for her question and look forward to seeing her and a number of other colleagues down in Melbourne for the Australian Tourism Exchange on Friday. It is one of the largest tourism exchanges in the world, and the government, together with the industry, has flown 650 buyers from around the world to meet with more than 1,200 Australian businesses to help promote the Australian tourism industry. It is a very big event. The member for McPherson knows just how important the tourism industry is to the Australian economy, not just to the Gold Coast but also to the Sunshine Coast, the Shipwreck Coast, the Snowy Mountains, Brisbane -  - Abermain in the Hunter Valley and a range of other places. The government has announced, amongst many other things, a new $20 million campaign, involving $10 million of new money, that takes the Australian Tourist Commission to its highest ever budget of $99 million. This $20 million campaign is an adrenalin shot into the tourism industry to promote Australia internationally. We have opened up new marketing campaigns in Japan, Korea, the United States and the United Kingdom.This has been welcomed by the industry, so much so that they have matched us dollar for dollar. I understand Australia is now the only country in the world that has had the industry match the government dollar for dollar in marketing tourism. That is a significant step forward. It was welcomed by ATEC. ATEC put out a press release which should warm the cockles of the Prime Minister's heart. It said:The Prime Minister went out of his way to state his government's commitment to the industry at the ATEC Symposium in Perth last month and in the last few weeks he has been true to his word.I am happy to table that. Manny Papadoulis of the Tourism Council Western Australia said:Western Australia is delighted to see the federal government acknowledge the importance of the tourism industry to the Australian economy and recognises the tremendous value of tourism to our export earnings.Yet, Mr Speaker, the Labor Party criticised this initiative. Can you believe that? It is hard to believe, isn't it? We put more money into the tourism industry and the Labor Party, led by the member for Corio, criticised it. What a surprise!This is on top of the green paper, which is a first of its kind blueprint for the future of the tourism industry. That was praised by ATEC in a document I am happy to table. ATEC represents about 150 members who are major exporters, about 4,000 other members and tens of thousands of jobs. It was praised by Restaurant and Catering Australia, which represents 29,000 businesses. It was praised by Richard Mulcahy of the Australian Hotels Association. Quite sadly, he is retiring; he is a good man. The Australian Hotels Association represents about 9,000 hotels and described the green paper as very welcome. ATSIC, which represents thousands of Indigenous Australians, particularly praised the initiative on Indigenous tourism. The green paper was praised by ACCI, which represents 350,000 businesses; by the World Tourism Organisation; and by the Property Council, which represents 40,000 people. The only people who criticised it were the Labor Party. What a surprise! The Labor Party have never had a decent tourism policy. Add that to the list of all the policies which, to the great expectation of the Australian people, are going to come from the member for Hotham, but have not come to date. </DOC>

 - It is quite true that in the documentation that was prepared for me by the department and considered by me on 26 October 1998 no reference was made to Mr Bedweny Hbeiche's family being in Australia. That is clear. If you have any evidence to the contrary - and you seem to have access -  - Mr Speaker, let me simply say that the opposition seem to have access to documents from my department relating to these matters. If they think there is a document in existence in my department that is different to what I have said, they should produce it. - No. In relation to matters that involve people's privacy, I am not intending to put departmental files on record every time you raise an issue. And that is what you are seeking. If you think there is evidence that I have misled the parliament, and I say that again deliberately, in relation to the document that was before me on the relevant date, 26 October 1998 - the document that disclosed to me, at the time when I took the decision, that there were three family members in Australia - then produce it. I am not going to blame my department for what may or may not be put to me in relation to these matters; that is not my style. But the fact is those who raise this matter are impugning the integrity of my department. - In matters of this sort I act on the advice that is prepared by the department. I act on it with integrity; of course I do. That information was not before me when I first considered the issue on 26 October 1998.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dobell, who is doing a very fine job on unemployment issues for the people on the Central Coast and, in fact, on all issues. He has been a breath of fresh air since he has come into this place. This government has a proud record of developing and implementing policy and producing results for Australia's unemployed. The unemployment rate is now six per cent. In 1993 there were eight per cent of mature age people unemployed; today, it is less than 50 per cent of that number - 3.7 per cent of mature age Australians are unemployed. That is a great result and it is a result of the development and implementation of policy by the Howard government over the last seven years.  We realise there is always more to be done. You can never rest of your laurels, and you must always strive to get those other 3.7 per cent of mature age Australians into the work force. To that end, we have training accounts, which we established as part of the Australians Working Together initiative, and we are revamping those to make them more flexible so that mature age people can actually go into a workplace and have informal training on the job. This will allow them to gain real work experience back at the coalface, so to speak, because they have told us that they would prefer to be working on the job rather than receiving formalised training outside of the work force. We think this will be a positive initiative. In doing so, we are lifting the cap from $800 and leaving it open ended, so that our many fine Job Network members can identify the actual skills, training and initiatives that are needed and provide them to mature age people where they are required.We have also today announced the Green Reserve contract, which will continue through to August 2005, and which has been won by Conservation Volunteers Australia. This is an ongoing, wonderful program that is providing mature age people - in fact, some 3,501 mature age people - with an opportunity to volunteer to gain self-esteem, and to be able to work in their communities to provide valuable assistance in those communities. This will give mature age people an opportunity not only to add to their own portfolio of experience but also to connect with the community.The member for Dobell rightly asked, `Are there any alternatives?' There is only one alternative that I have seen from the shadow minister, and it involves calling for more money. At every opportunity he calls for more money for employment services. He never says where it is going to be spent, where it is going to come from or who it is going to target. The fact is that in the last 10 years, mature age unemployment has gone from eight per cent to 3.7 per cent under the Howard government. We are determined to see it go down further, and that will happen through the initiative of putting in good policies and ensuring that they are implemented.</DOC>

 - I say this without checking, but I understand that the Labor Party has been hawking around a document that purports to be the application of Mr Hbeiche -  - No, I have not. - I go back to the point I made on 29 May in responding to the Leader of the Opposition's interjection. He said then, `Find out.' I said: I could ask but I do not think it is relevant because it was not before me at the time I first considered the matter.'There may well be a departmental record of advice being given -  - No, I made it very clear that it was not relevant and it was not advised to me at the time when I made the decision. We come then to the question of the relevance that you put on Mr Cameron's letter. The fact is that Mr Cameron's letter raised issues with me again, and the department looked at it and determined not to put it to me on the basis that it raised no new information. The point that I was making was very simple: there was no reference in Mr Cameron's letter to suggest the department should take family links into account and put that information before me. The two issues were quite clear and quite separate and -  - No, I will not. You can ask Mr Cameron whether he has permission to release somebody's letter. The fact is that what I told the House then was true, what I told the House yesterday was true and what I have told the House today is true.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dickson, who has been a very good representative since he entered the 40th Parliament. What is good about the member for Dickson is that he has been involved in small business - like most members on this side of the House. In earlier days, he was in the child-care business - he had a direct interest in raising our children - and his previous role was in law enforcement in Queensland. He is certainly a very good addition to this side of the parliament.The Australian economy has changed significantly over the last couple of years, and I think we have to recognise new programs and new techniques to help young Australians. The minister for education does a terrific job there. What we have to do is foster youth entrepreneurship. Indeed, youth entrepreneurship, or a career path into small business, is a very good way of engaging young people on full-time career paths.  - I hear the minister for small business, who has been a very good advocate. He has continued to articulate that small business is one of the key engine drivers for the economy, and he reminds us that this side of the House is involved, and has a track record of members who have been involved, in small business - unlike the ALP in the Senate, where there still is not one member who has been involved in small business.There are a couple of initiatives that I want to reiterate to the House. The first is called First Australians Business. This is a one-to-one mentoring program helping young Indigenous people. One particular example is a chap called Anthony Czygan - his mates call him Simmo. Simmo comes from Malak, up in the member for Solomon's electorate, and he is a very good example of a young Indigenous man. He has set up Simmo's Aboriginal Fishing Adventures. I am sure there are 34 members on that side of the House that might have some more free time to participate in those adventures. We are finding that through this one-on-one mentoring not only is his business expanding but also he is putting on more staff to help engage and give self-empowerment to young Indigenous Australians.On that note, I would like to welcome a number of young Indigenous Australians who have come to the leadership group forum here in Canberra this week. These young people are engaged in their own advocacy. It is important to acknowledge that 40 per cent of the population of Indigenous communities are under the age of 15, so it is even more imperative that we give them the skills, particularly through fostering youth entrepreneurship, to give them career opportunities.I would also like to acknowledge that one way the government is listening to young people is through our National Youth Roundtable. One of those individuals, James Austin from Cairns - in the member for Leichardt's electorate, who I know started out in small business in the waste industry - developed his own Internet business at the age of 17. Again, it is a very good example of a young person setting up their own business. Because of some of these programs, at the end of this year 52 Commonwealth nations have been invited to Australia to share in the knowledge that we have gained, through our forum called Creating Common Wealth, where we are inviting five members from those Commonwealth countries to attend. I hope it receives support from both sides of the House.</DOC>

 - The Leader of the Opposition is correct in saying that that paragraph does refer in those terms, but there are other things that are contained, that are relevant and that fully contextualise the issue. The ONA submission to the Senate inquiry said as follows: ONA had seen no sign that Laskar Jihad planned to target tourist hotels on Lombok or Bali, though extremists saw them as havens of Western decadence. But a tourist hotel in Bali would be an important symbolic target, damaging Indonesia's standing and its debilitated economy.Further, it said:This judgment was not based on specific intelligence reporting but was an assessment by an export analyst on the basis of knowledge of Indonesian Islamic extremist attitudes and objectives. It was the only written ONA report of some 35 dealing with terrorism in South East Asia between 11 September 2001 and 12 October 2002 which mentioned Bali specifically as a potential terrorist target. I would remind the Leader of the Opposition that the DFAT travel advisory extant at the time of the Bali attack on 12 October 2002 contained the following paragraph:Bombs have been exploded periodically in Jakarta and elsewhere in the past, including areas frequented by tourists. Further explosions may be attempted. In view of the ongoing risk of terrorist activity, Australians should maintain a high level of personal security awareness at all times.The advice I have from DFAT is that that assessment, in the absence of any specific intelligence or warning in relation to an attack specific to Bali, was appropriate and consistent with past practice in relation to the sort of warning that should be given in the light of the generic concerns that were felt about terrorism in the region.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Sturt for his question. The member for Sturt has written in this area and expressed a good deal of interest in Indigenous issues over a period of time. I know that he would have welcomed yesterday that I announced that a discussion paper had been concluded. That discussion paper concerned Indigenous involvement and participation in government policy making, including the role of ATSIC. It is a review of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission. The discussion paper was prepared as a first stage of a process that has involved an independent panel, including the former New South Wales Attorney-General, John Hannaford; a former colleague of many of us, the Hon. Bob Collins; and Ms Jackie Huggins, who is the Co-Chair of Reconciliation Australia. The paper reflects the findings from the panel's initial round of consultations. It identifies issues and options concerning the future of ATSIC and related matters. The paper observed that ATSIC has reached a crisis point in respect of its public credibility and with its Indigenous constituency, that it lacks vision and strategy and that it does not have the requisite skills and understanding of government policy to drive a policy agenda. The discussion paper also identifies a range of issues for the future to be examined. They include under-representation of women, the tension between ATSIC's internal government policy role and its independent advocacy role. This discussion paper is a very important paper. It will form the focus of further consultation over the next few months. The panel expects to be able to present a final report to the government at the end of September. The government obviously looks forward to receiving that and will address very positively the issues that have been raised in the review and the final report which will canvass a range of options which have been developed to this stage and the conclusions that the panel observed.</DOC>

As to the second part of the question, I will also check what was said by the Canadians. I might point out that, in relation to comparative travel advisories, some of the language used in ours - particularly in relation to the reference to the bombings - was tougher than the language used in the British or the American advisories.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Moncrieff for his question. I can inform the House that yesterday the Westpac-Melbourne Institute survey of consumer sentiment was released, and it showed that consumer sentiment rose 5.3 per cent in June to be approximately 16 per cent above its long-term average. Indeed, consumer sentiment in June was the highest in Australia for nine years. When you think that this is against a backdrop of international weakness, the American recession, SARS, and the most extensive drought in Australia's history, the fact that consumer sentiment could still be so strong is quite unusual. Westpac noted that there are two reasons behind that. The first, of course, is interest rates, which are now at 30-year lows and are giving families a lot of extra disposable income because they are able to finance their mortgage at a little over six per cent. The second is the labour force. There have been 1¼ million new jobs created since 1996, and unemployment is now at its lowest level for 10 years. Unemployment is at the lowest level since Labor's recession of 1990. So you have the combination of jobs growth and low interest rates keeping consumer sentiment high, notwithstanding a very difficult international situation.In addition to that, I note that the VFACTS monthly sales report for May which was released today shows that, seasonally adjusted in May, the number of vehicle sales rose 3.8 per cent and that this will be a record year for motor vehicle sales in Australia. What is the best thing you can do for the motor vehicle industry? The best thing you can do is promote sales. This has been very important to keep people in jobs in the motor car industry, notwithstanding reductions in tariffs. Vehicle sales are increasing because prices are falling and consumer sentiment is strong.The biggest advantage that the motor vehicle industry in Australia was given was tax change. Before a tax change on 1 July 2000, cars were taxed at 22 per cent. Under A New Tax System, it is 10 per cent for consumers and no tax at all for business. Taxes on cars for business were removed. Of course, fleet buying is a big part of the Australian motor vehicle manufacturing market. So tax reform is good for the motor vehicle market and good for people getting jobs in the car industry. Low interest rates are supporting consumer sentiment, job opportunities are giving Australians the opportunity to remain in work and, notwithstanding a very difficult international situation, consumer sentiment continues to underpin Australian growth, which is now leading the developed countries of the world.</DOC>

 - The information that was provided at the time was based on my honest belief of what the situation was. I have complied in full. But I am glad that the Leader of the Opposition has asked me a question about Iraq's weapons capacity, because I have in my hand an interview conducted this morning on the ABC program 774 in Melbourne. It was an interview conducted by John Faine with David Skeat, the National Director of Australian Relief and Mercy Services Ltd, who has just come back from Iraq. Mr Skeat was one of a number of aid agency leaders who signed an open letter to me under the title `The humanitarian consequences of a war in Iraq'. The thrust of that letter from 55 non-government organisa-tions was to the effect that, on humanitarian grounds, we should not join a military operation in Iraq. John Faine asked Mr Skeat: Have you formed an opinion though about whether or not military intervention was or was not in the end appropriate?Interestingly enough, having just returned from Iraq, Mr Skeat answered:In my own personal view, I think it was appropriate.He then went to on to criticise the process in which it came about, but the bottom line was:I think that the people of Iraq are best served without Saddam.He then went on, interestingly enough, to say -  - He then went on - and I think this is of great interest to all members of the House, or it ought to be of great interest to all members of the House - to say:We had some very interesting things happen to us. One happened in Um Qasar. We were at a military checkpoint, just checking in, and people were coming up to us and crying and saying, `Thank you, thank you, thank you for getting rid of Saddam and for freeing us.' - The quote continues:... people were coming up to us and crying and saying, `Thank you, thank you, thank you for getting rid of Saddam and for freeing us.' I mean, we had nothing to do with it. We weren't part of the coalition. We were an aid organisation coming to work in a medical situation. We had another situation at that same point -  -  - The quote continues: We had another situation at that same point, where a man hushed a crowd outside a military checkpoint and, in perfect English, gave us a very gracious speech, where he thanked us for toppling Saddam and thanked the troops for coming in and setting his people free.These are the words of a man who signed a letter, before the military operation, opposing it. He now recognises, on understandable humanitarian grounds, that Australia did the right thing. - I am quite happy to table it or send him an email - I do not mind. - On the point of order, Mr Speaker: the reason that I said what I did is that my recollection of the statement I made on 4 February was in the following terms:On the basis of the intelligence available, the British Joint Intelligence Committee judged that:...	...	...·	Iraq continues to work on developing nuclear weapons - uranium has been sought from Africa that has no civil nuclear application in Iraq ...I was quoting from a source, and the quote was entirely accurate.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Wentworth for his question and, through the process of reviewing Australian universities, for his strong advocacy both for the University of New South Wales and for the Australian Institute of Music, whose 900 students for the first time will be able to access a government loan to assist them in their education. This week Australia's vice-chancellors are meeting the Australian parliament, and they issued a media release on 17 June in support of the government's transformational $1.5 billion higher education reforms. They said: Overall, the Australian Vice-Chancellors' Committee endorses the direction and commitment for reform put forward by the government. For our part, we will work with all political parties and stakeholders to ensure that the necessary legislation is implemented.I have been asked about alternative policies. I regret to say that, sadly, there are not many. The spokesperson jointly for the Australian Labor Party and for the Leader of the Opposition on higher education is, of course, the member for Jagajaga. If we go back to 27 October 2002, a Channel 7 reporter asked the member for Jagajaga:The talk is fine, but the concrete ideas, when will we see those?The member for Jagajaga replied:Well, you'll see them progressively over the next 12 months or so.Fair enough, the member for Wentworth might say. Then on 27 May 2003, the member for Jagajaga told the Adelaide Advertiser:Labor would release its alternative higher education package in coming weeks.In mid-June 2003 - this month - the Leader of the Opposition went to the University of Western Sydney and said:What I'll be doing in coming weeks is to lay out the blueprint in terms of education.You are going to like this, Mr Speaker: four days later, on 15 June, the Leader of the Opposition was interviewed on the Channel 9 Sunday program - and those who attended the mid-year ball last year would have again been impressed by John Clark and Brian Dawe; if you are wondering where they get some of their material, I can give you some inspiration. The Leader of the Opposition said:Well, it's a continuing piece of work.The reporter asked:Do we ever see anything from it?The Leader of the Opposition replied:Of course you do, because its timetable was always in the context of the national conference.The reporter said:But no-one seems to know where it is.The Leader of the Opposition replied:I know where it is.The reporter then asked:Can you tell me where it is? You say you know where it is. Where is it?The Leader of the Opposition replied:It's a work in progress.As a postscript, the member for Jagajaga yesterday was asked by a reporter:When do you plan to launch your policies?The member for Jagajaga said:Soon.The reporter asked:How soon?The member for Jagajaga replied:You'll have to wait and see.So over the past year as the government has been getting on with the process of building Australia's future and, in particular, that which will be driven in Australia's 38 publicly funded universities and its 84 private ones, the Australian Labor Party has not agreed to participate in any meaningful way in any serious policy debate about the future of Australian universities, has sought to make the Australian public think that they have a policy that is about to be released and has opposed at every step everything the government has sought to do in working cooperatively with Australia's vice-chan-cellors - many of whom I see in the gallery here today and who are very welcome and who have shown outstanding leadership over the past year. Now that the government has announced a $10.6 billion 10-year program for Australian universities, the Australian Labor Party is opposed to it. One of the vice-chancellors I see in the gallery is Professor Gerard Sutton, who this week was interviewed by Maxine McKew - who would be well known to us here - in the Bulletin. Professor Sutton, who heads one of the most outstanding universities in the country that enjoys a very high international reputation, notwithstanding the very high reputation it has in the Illawarra region, said:Labor is quite wrong. My view is that overall the package is a strong positive for the universities. $1.5 billion of new money in the sector is a substantial increase in anybody's language. I would have hoped that Labor would be prepared to negotiate on it because, if this package goes down in the Senate, then universities will be facing a genuine crisis.Let those words be recorded, because they will record, if the Labor Party does not constructively engage in this debate about Australia's future, that it was the Labor Party that was responsible for precipitating an educational, economic and social crisis in higher education for which the future generation will pay a very high price.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Swan for his question. There are a number of very important issues in this. When I met with the state and territory ministers at the University of Ballarat in October, I said to them that there were four things that had to be addressed by the Commonwealth and the state and territory governments collectively whatever happened with higher education reform. One of the four things was that the states and territories should work cooperatively with the Commonwealth in developing a system that would enable us to distribute future places in higher education right across Australia.As the member for Moncrieff and members of other Queensland electorates will know - as will the member for Swan and the member for Canning - our key priorities in future growth lie in Western Australia and in South-East Queensland. One of the things that are critically important in this package is that the government has announced that what it will do over a four-year period is to fully fund 25,000 over-enrolled, marginally funded places in Australian universities. At the moment, 8.2 per cent of all undergraduate places in Australian universities are over enrolled, and they are attracting only a quarter of the amount of public money that the government is proposing to put in at a cost of $347.6 million over four years in this package.What the government will be doing is negotiating and working, as we have for more than a year, with the leaders of Australian universities, with the state and territory govern-ments, and I invite the Labor Party - still - to participate cooperatively in designing the future of Australian higher education. It is important that the Australian Party understand. I think the Sydney Morning Herald put it very well. Prior to the budget, the Sydney Morning Herald -   - The Sydney Morning Herald put it, I think, very well on 2 May 2003 when it said that, in this context, New South Wales would lose almost 6,000 university places by 2005. The reason it was reporting this was that universities right across Australia are in the process of reducing the over-enrolled places. As announced in this package the government will fully fund 25,000 over-enrolled marginally funded places, including those at Curtin university. The only guarantee that I can give the Labor Party and the only guarantee that I can give the men and women who have come from Australia's universities is that, if the Labor Party does not engage in this process constructively and do it now, there will be a crisis for which the future generations of Western Australia, in particular, will pay a very high price and the Labor Party will go down in infamy.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Blair for the question. It is especially appropriate because the drought-stricken farmers of Blair are amongst the latest to become eligible for Commonwealth drought assistance. Around 3,500 farmers in the Upper Brisbane Valley and the Burnett regions are now eligible to receive income support from the federal government and subsidies on interest on loans of up to $100,000. I am sure that assistance will be very helpful to the farmers of Blair, as it has been to farmers in many parts of Australia.The Commonwealth's commitment to drought assistance continues to grow. Around 15,500 Australian farm families are now receiving Commonwealth income support and about 4,000 farm businesses are receiving some business support by way of interest subsidies on their loans. Yesterday the Deputy Prime Minister, the member for Parkes and I met mayors from western New South Wales in some of the worst drought affected areas and where the drought is having a devastating impact on the entire community. We want to work with those communities to help them by continuing to provide the assistance that is necessary to support them through these difficult times and then look to rebuilding once the rain comes. It is interesting to note that around half the farmers in the Bourke and Brewarrina region are receiving income support, and that clearly demonstrates the depth of the crisis in that region.However, by comparison with the Commonwealth's efforts, the states continue to walk away from their responsibilities. The farmers in Blair who are now going to get assistance from the Commonwealth have got little or nothing from the Queensland government. That has been typical of their approach. It takes the Commonwealth only four days, in its assistance to Australian farmers, to provide the same amount as Queensland has given since the beginning of the drought. Every four days we provide more assistance to Australian farmers than Queensland has since the beginning of the drought. The story in Western Australia is the same: about four days of effort on the Commonwealth's part is all Western Australia can manage. As for New South Wales, it takes us only about two weeks to provide more assistance to Australian farmers than New South Wales has provided since the beginning of the drought. If you want to move to South Australia, the Commonwealth takes about half a day to spend more money on assisting drought-stricken farmers than South Australia has provided since the beginning of the drought. It is shameful the way in which the states, prepared to do absolutely nothing, have walked away from their needy farmers. The Commonwealth will continue to play its role and to assist farmers in need, but so much more could be done if the states would only cooperate and do their share to help farmers through these difficult times. </DOC>

The second thing: with deference to Professor Kerry Cox, Albert Einstein was a very intelligent man, a man of considerable scientific repute.

 - I have been asked for further information and I have further information, funnily enough! I have further information, and I am sure members opposite are just waiting for it. - Thank you, Mr Speaker. I say to the member for Casey that I am aware of continuing allegations of financial irregularities, ballot rigging and attempted bribery inside the National Union of Workers and against its head, Mr Greg Sword. Since 1996 the National Union of Workers has donated more than $1.7 million to the ALP, and Mr Sword is of course the National President of the ALP. Mr Sword is the Leader of the Opposition's best mate and principal protector, and he is described by dissident members of -  - It was probably only $1.3 million, but there is $400,000 they provided in the last financial year. - I am aware that last week's Sunday program obtained a draft auditor's report into the National Union of Workers, which Mr Sword heads. According to the program:The auditors founds that the 'official receipts book was missing.' That there has been 'no regular reconciliation for the suspense account and wage clearing account.' There was 'no evidence of review of bank reconciliations by an independent official.' And 'certain transactions were found to be misallocated.'Also, in a court case last year about the misuse of union funds, the judge found:It is a matter of concern that a large union should have been found so wanting in ordinary standards of financial care.When the Leader of the Opposition was asked about these allegations against his own former union, the National Union of Workers, what did he say? He said, `Quite frankly, they are irrelevant.' So the Leader of the Opposition thinks that allegations of financial irregularity, ballot rigging and attempted bribery are irrelevant. This government takes allegations of this nature very seriously indeed. This morning I have written to the Industrial Registrar drawing his attention to these allegations and to his powers to investigate and prosecute breaches of the Workplace Relations Act.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Jagajaga for what I think is the first question without notice I have had on apprenticeships and training; for that I am extremely grateful. The Commonwealth has made an offer to the states and territories for the next three years of the Australian National Training Authority agreement which represents a $3.57 billion commitment over the next three years. It includes $325 million of growth money, which is included in the current three-year agreement with close to $100 million added to it for indexation. It includes $218.7 million of extra Commonwealth money over the next three years, including $68.7 million to assist mature age people to go back into training, parents who want to go back and acquire more training and, most importantly, Australians with disabilities. The Commonwealth's commitment represents a 12½ per cent nominal increase above and beyond the current three-year agreement and a 2½ per cent real increase per year over the three years of the agreement. If the states and territories -  - If they agree to match the Commonwealth's growth money and the money for Australians Working Together that supports those with disabilities -  - The states and territories are being asked to make a 1½ per cent real increase in funding to match the Commonwealth's 2½ per cent real increase in funding per year over the three years. The other thing the member for Jagajaga ought to read is the report by Access Economics which was provided to ANTA and which looks at growth in demand for training over the eight years from 2003. It has forecast a 2.7 per cent growth in demand over eight years; for the three years of this agreement, an average of 2.9 per cent growth, with 1.7 per cent in the second and third years of the agreement. In other words, in an environment where quite a number of states and territories will struggle to meet the Commonwealth's offer, we also have an environment where forecast demand is certainly met by the Commonwealth's offer.I should also point out to the member for Jagajaga and the state and territory Labor cousins that there are a number of things that the states and territories are doing which are not helpful to the government providing training in traditional trades. There are 11 industries where we have skills shortages. For example, the member for Jagajaga might like to know that, in New South Wales, training positions in the building and construction industry have declined by around 1,400 over the past year, while those in the engineering and mining industry have remained static. In Victoria, we have had a reduction in automotive training; in South Australia, a reduction in engineering and utilities; and in Tasmania we have also had similar contractions in those traditional industries. I might also point out, with respect to the state and territory governments, that the Victorian government, for example, has introduced full fee paying degrees into TAFE - there are no loans there. Have I heard anything from the member for Jagajaga about the outrage? In the state of Victoria's budget this year, the Victorian government imposed a $155 million impost over four years on employers who take on apprentices. In the state of South Australia, there has been a 12 per cent increase in charges for those who go to TAFE - there are no loans there! There has been a 50 per cent increase in fees for people doing apprenticeships in plumbing and carpentry in South Australian TAFEs. Do I hear any outrage? None whatsoever.I conclude my answer by pointing out one thing: 26 per cent of those who are full time in TAFE are there for non-vocational reasons; 36 per cent of module completers are there for non-vocational reasons, and in many cases for some very good reasons. But the question I put to the states and territories is: why is it that we are funding belly dancing at the West Coast Institute of TAFE in WA? Why are we funding feng shui at the Torrens Valley Institute of TAFE; blues harmonica for beginners at the Moreton Institute; astrology and tarot workshops at Box Hill Institute of TAFE; art foundation courses and fruit carving; and dance music events and rave party management, for example, at the William Angliss Institute of TAFE? If the Labor Party want to be serious about addressing significant skills shortages in traditional trades, they should get behind the government's campaign and support the ANTA offer.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Gilmore for her question and say in respect to it that elderly Australians have just as much right to hospital care throughout this nation as do younger Australians. I say that because the rhetoric of the state governments in the last couple of days would suggest otherwise and would suggest a lack of care and a lack of respect for the dignity of older Australians. For example, we have state governments talking about `granny dumping' and `bed blockers'. It implies that older people should not receive hospital care in the first place and that, if they do, the states believe that they should be shoved out of hospital as quickly as possible. This rhetoric is supported by facts. If we look at the number of public hospital beds provided by the states around Australia between 1987-88 and 2000-01, we see a substantial slashing in the number of public hospital beds - not by 1,000, 2,000, 4,000 or 5,000; over that period of time, state governments have reduced public hospital beds by 14,352. That is one in five beds which have been slashed from the system by state governments around the country. The worst offender, so far as the states are concerned, is the state of New South Wales. Indeed, over that period of time, there has been a reduction of 6,130 public hospital beds in New South Wales - 6,130 public hospital beds that existed in New South Wales just over a decade ago no longer exist. One in four -   - I hear an interjection from the member for Lyons. The state of Tasmania has slashed 950 public hospital beds for people in the state of Tasmania. Even though Tasmania's population is not growing as fast as the population of some other states, if the member for Lyons wants to do something about the issue he should be talking to his state colleagues in Tasmania about increasing, not reducing, the number of public hospital beds. The member for Gilmore asked me what the Commonwealth are doing about the care of frail older Australians. We are doing two things: firstly, we have put an offer of $42 billion over five years on the table, under the Commonwealth-state health care agreements, to assist the state governments to run their public hospitals. That would be a $10 billion increase in hospital funding to the state governments over the next five years, which is a 17 per cent increase in real terms. We also expect the state governments to commit to growth, as we have done at the Commonwealth level. Why haven't the state governments signed up to these agreements? They have not signed up because, for the first time, we require some transparency and accountability from the states so that they do not simply cost-shift to the Commonwealth.The second thing the Commonwealth are doing is making a substantial investment in aged care. Since we came to government, we have increased funding of aged care from $3 billion in 1995-96 to a projected $6 billion in the next financial year. In the last five years, we have released an additional 52,700 beds. We are on target to achieve 200,000 aged care places by 2006. In the member for Gilmore's electorate, there has been a substantial increase over the last four years. There are an additional 1,590 aged care places for the Illawarra and Southern Highlands planning regions, which is worth some $25 million in annual recurrent funding. In the 2003 aged care approvals round, the electorate of Gilmore will share in some 313 new aged-care places that have been released to these two regions. That is in addition to the $29 million of federal government funding for aged care already being spent in Gilmore. The Commonwealth government have been, are and will continue to be committed to older Australians. We call upon the state governments to do likewise.</DOC>

 - I am delighted to have a question from the member for Canberra. She has shown so much interest in aged care that I think this is her maiden question to me about aged care since coming to the job! - I can tell the member for Canberra and the House that an independent analysis of the aged care situation and bed shortages by the Auditor-General showed that, when we came to government, there was a 10,000 bed shortage left by the Labor Party. After 13 years in government, having established some benchmarks in 1986, the Labor Party left us a 10,000 aged care bed shortage. Not only are we making up for that shortage; we are putting extra beds in place. As I said earlier, in answer to the previous question, 52,700 extra beds have been allocated in the last five years for aged care in Australia. We are on target to reach 200,000 aged care places by 2006. We have increased the number of community aged care packages. Remembering that people aspire to stay in their own homes and their own community as long as possible, we have increased the number of community aged care places from just over 2,000 when we came to government to over 28,000 today. We are on target to increase that to 34,000. In last year's budget we put an extra half a billion dollars into aged care over four years. In the meantime, we are conducting a pricing inquiry into the continued sustainability and viability of aged care in Australia. This government has a proud record so far as aged care is concerned. If the member for Canberra would like to exert some influence on some of her state colleagues, perhaps she could take up with the Victorian aged care minister why, having been offered $6.6 million in funding for a transitional care place, he is still refusing to take up the offer. That offer has been on the table for almost 12 months now. It would have provided 90 beds and enabled up to 470 people to be moved out of public hospitals in Victoria. - Go and talk to your colleague in Victoria. There are 470 people each year in public hospitals in Victoria who could move into transitional and rehabilitation care if the Victorian government got its planning decisions together to enable this to go forth. - The Commonwealth money is sitting there on the table waiting. Perhaps at the same time you could take up with the South Australian aged care minister why they are not prepared to match the growth in HACC funding, thereby denying South Australians some $9 million worth of aged care services over three years. If you want to make a complaint, go and make it to your state colleagues.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hinkler for his question. He has always been a very hardworking member, as the Prime Minister articulates, and has a very keen interest in ensuring that people in his constituency who may have disabilities are given the best possible opportunities. In line with the comments made by the Minister for Ageing, the government has been trying to negotiate a Commonwealth-State Disability Agreement. Those negotiations began almost 11 months ago between Senator Amanda Vanstone and her relevant state counterparts. It has only been in the last week that we have finally achieved a breakthrough with some of the states, who are prepared to increase the level of funding, which they have been rather reluctant about - indeed, recalcitrant - to date. We are putting $2.8 billion of Commonwealth money into the new Commonwealth-State Disability Agreement. That is a $900 million increase by the Commonwealth over the next five years. Until recently the states have been doing very little. The amount that we are putting in represents a 7.3 per cent increase per annum in new Commonwealth money going into the CSDA. I am pleased that, at long last, Victoria and Western Australia have finally signed up to that agreement. We are expecting the Northern Territory, the ACT and South Australia to finally sign up to that agreement. I am led to believe by Senator Amanda Vanstone that Queensland and Tasmania have made some funding offers, and hopefully those will be negotiated shortly.Again, the one state that has not come to the party at all is New South Wales. It is quite a disgrace. Less than a year ago the Premier of New South Wales was beating his chest about the lack of funding put in by the Commonwealth, yet his own record is appalling. Indeed, when the offer was made initially last year of a 7.3 per cent increase by the Commonwealth, they were putting in a paltry 1.5 per cent increase. I gather that the latest offer is up to four per cent, but that is still quite outrageous considering the actual numbers involved and the amount of money going to support people with disabilities - particularly through accommodation, which is a responsibility of the states. Victoria has one-third less population than New South Wales. In New South Wales, 6,111 people are provided with accommodation; in Victoria, that figure is 7,068 people. That is 15 per cent more than New South Wales, even though New South Wales has one-third more population. It is absolutely outrageous.In Victoria they spend $4,233 per capita, compared to New South Wales, where they spend $3,000. In other words, the Victorian Labor government spend 40 per cent more than New South Wales when it comes to helping people through the Commonwealth-State Disability Agreement. What is even more outrageous is that last year the New South Wales government were complaining about one of the awards of $40 million but they still have not been able to account for how they spent it. The threshold question we have to ask ourselves is how genuine and serious the New South Wales government are in signing up to the next five-year Commonwealth-State Disability Agreement. All we are asking of them is to have at least a significant contribution, similar to that of the Commonwealth, to have transparency and openness and to guarantee that they will continue to fund that agreement for the next five years - which they have failed to do. We look forward to New South Wales eventually signing up to that agreement, which is now 11 months overdue.</DOC>

 - I stand by the answers I gave. What I said on 29 May was abundantly clear: the information provided to me initially made no reference to the man's family. I went on to say, `I have no idea whether my department may have received other advice.' I would expect that, on an application form lodged by an applicant where they are required to give details of family, details of family would be included. It is irrelevant to the answer I gave, in that on the date when I considered this matter, 26 October 1998, that information was not before me. It was not abstracted by my department and included in the brief. - I made the point that the next time I was asked to look at that issue was when Mr Cameron wrote to me. Mr Cameron's letter did not raise that issue. -  - It is quite clear; it did not. The officer who looked at the matter said there was no new information contained in that letter, and it was not brought to my attention.An opposition member - What was the name of the officer? - Come on! Why would I want to go round blaming officers in relation to the way in which these issues are dealt with? They deal with thousands of applications. They do their job conscientiously and well, and I do not think their integrity should be impugned in the way in which you are doing. That is the point I am making. The facts do not change because you come in here day after day regurgitating the same issues. The issue has been fully and comprehensively dealt with.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Solomon for his question. As everyone in this House would know, the government has been working on implementing ESC3, the contract that delivers employment services around Australia from more than 2,500 sites and comes into force on Tuesday, 1 July. As part of the original contract the government reserved the right to be able to provide fee for service into remote areas of Australia where the main active participation model may not best suit the needs of the communities. To that end, I am pleased to inform the House that we have now covered those areas and we are announcing the successful contractors. There are three areas covered - the Top End of the Northern Territory, the West Kimberley in Western Australia and the Ceduna region in South Australia - by five separate providers. In the Top End the Industry, Training and Employment Council, Darwin Skills Development Scheme and Jobfind Centres Australia will be delivering very innovative products to their unemployed constituents. A community account will operate in the Top End, which will allow us to develop and implement local employment and volunteering plans to meet the needs of those markets. In the West Kimberley, Workplace Employment Services, outside the Broome township, and Jobfutures in the township of Broome will be operating the active participation model. In the Ceduna region services will be enhanced with the provision for a greater focus on promoting Indigenous participation and retention in education. It will be encouraging Indigenous students to go back to school, as we know that has a great impact on their employability. In Ceduna the use of a job seeker account to initiate local training and develop options for job seekers will also be an important innovation.In addition, as part of a Howard government the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations will consider proposals for the funding of specific outcome based strategies on a project basis. That will build capacity within these communities to provide opportunities for people both to work and to volunteer. This builds on the ESC3 initiatives that this government has implemented. It is a far cry from the days when we had some 350 CES offices with a very poor level of service. Today we are providing a tailored service to Australia's unemployed, no matter where they live.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Wannon for his question. I also thank him for his commitment to our Defence Force reserves and for his active involvement as chairman of the subcommittee in the last parliament. This is a great news story. Since 1996 the coalition government have fundamentally changed the role of our Defence Force reserves. We have made them more valuable, more modern and a relevant asset to our Australian Defence Force capability. In the first term, we introduced the common induction training for our Army reservists and our regulars alike. This was to ensure a similar standard of basic training, thereby improving the capability of our reservists. Since the 2000 Defence white paper, the reserves have played a key role in supporting and sustaining the ADF's military capability, especially in our operations in East Timor, Afghanistan, Iraq, Bougainville and other parts of the world. For example, I am sure the members opposite would be interested to know that 1,000 of our ADF reservists actually served for us in East Timor - the reserve unit from the 5/7 Battalion group. This was the first time we have deployed such a reservist unit on operations since World War II, and they have done an excellent job. The good news continues. We have also supported the employers of reservists. In two years since the introduction of the employers support payment scheme over $19 million has been paid to over 1,700 employers of reservists to compensate them for the loss of the service of their reservists when they are on active Defence duty. We have already delivered on our election commitments to introduce the high readiness reserves, the first establishment of which will be raised by the Army on 1 July - the reserve response force. These forces will be trained to complement existing ADF elements, conducting short-notice responses to domestic security incidents. This is a significant milestone in the enhancement of our ADF. This modernisation of our reserves has also encouraged many more Australians to participate in our reserve forces. I am pleased to advise the House that our Army reservist enlistments have increased over 60 per cent in the past three years. This government has made our ADF reserves an integral part of our Defence Force's operational capability. There has never been a better time for any Australian to be part of our Australian Defence Force reserves.</DOC>

On this particular matter, I can confirm that all the matters relating to Mr Tan's application for Australian citizenship were handled by departmental officers who, as the delegated authority, made the decisions regarding Mr Tan's citizenship. The decision regarding that was made fully and completely without any discussion with my office, and it was all done in quite normal ways. As far as -  -  - Thank you, Mr Speaker.

 - I have seen reference made to that study. It does not accord with the advice coming to the government. We do not believe that it will have that effect. If people are concerned about the capacity of pub-lic hospitals and if the Leader of the Opposi-tion is concerned about the capacity of public hospitals to treat people who present themselves, he will encourage his Labor colleagues at a state level to match the massive increase in federal government funding for public hospitals. The story about public hospitals in Australia is that we are offering to increase our funding by 17 per cent in real terms. So far, the states have not agreed to match that increase. Instead of criticising our policies, I suggest that the Leader of the Opposition get on the telephone, ring up his mates in the state governments - all of which are in Labor hands - and tell them to be as generous with public hospitals as the federal govern-ment is.</DOC>

However, we will not raise any objection as a government to an appropriate response from the three agencies covered by the relevant intelligence committee. If, in fact, requests are made to ONA or DOI to make submissions, we will not raise any objection to that. The only other comment I would make is that, of course, in its behaviour and conduct the committee will need to observe its charter. In particular, it should be cognisant of the provisions relating to the use of foreign source intelligence.</DOC>

It is true that there has been some decline in rates of bulk-billing. That is why the government has introduced the policies under the title of `A Fairer Medicare'. That is why our policy will provide an effective, a speedy and a comprehensive response to the difficulties that are now faced by Medicare. I take the opportunity of reminding the House that, as we committed to in 1996, we have maintained and strengthened Medicare in the seven years that we have been in government.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Fadden for his question. I note that he is the chairman of the parliamentary intelligence committee and has a great interest in these issues. I think everybody accepts that, from 11 September 2001 onwards, the world has changed and that since then Australia has played a leading role in the campaign against terrorism globally, regionally and, of course, domestically. We have never had any illusions that the challenge to defeat terrorism would be difficult - of course it will be. In that light, the government negotiated back at the beginning of 2002 a memorandum of understanding on counter-terrorism with Indonesia. We have through 2002 negotiated and signed like agreements with Thailand, the Philippines and Malaysia. I think we signed one with Fiji this year, and just last week when I was in Phnom Penh I signed an MOU on counter-terrorism with my Cambodian counterpart. We have been funding capacity building initiatives, supporting law enforcement, transport, security, border controls and antiterrorist financing projects. Since the Bali bombing there has been extraordinary cooperation between Australia and Indonesia in investigating that tragic incident. As we became aware of the emerging terrorist threat in South-East Asia, we spoke about it publicly on many occasions. I answered many questions on the issue from our side of the House and even one or two from the opposition. We drew attention in particular to Abu Bakar Bashir, Jemaah Islamiah and their activities through 2002. It is tragic that all of our efforts were unable to prevent the Bali bombing. I know that all Australians are aware there was no specific intelligence on that. That has been made clear in the last few days. It was also made clear quite some time ago in the Bill Blick report.As for alternative views, I did notice while I was away last week that the member for Griffith was playing with this issue in, I thought, a rather incendiary way. We certainly do not believe that grief should be in any way politicised - and I am sure the opposition would not want it to be. But last Thursday I saw the member for Griffith at a doorstop had said:Mr Downer received specific intelligence on Bali ...I could not help but think that that was entirely untrue and that that was politicising an issue. I note that the member for Griffith, having said that, turned around the very next day and said, `No-one seriously engaged in the debate about Bali has ever suggested that the Australian government had specific prior intelligence about the bombing' - precisely what the member for Griffith said the day before. Somebody obviously took him aside and spoke to him - and, if they did not, they should have done - in relation to the misuse and the misleading abuse of the Canadian travel advisory.  This was a travel advisory - and I do not think everyone in the House quite understood this - which had been issued for a total duration of four days over one year before the Bali bombing. I thought for a minute that the member for Griffith may not have known that that travel advisory had been withdrawn after just four days, but I note that on the Insiders program, when he was asked about it yesterday - and I thought it an interesting interview as well - he said that he had been aware that the travel advisory was withdrawn four days later by the Canadians.  -  - It is my point. My point is that trying to politicise this issue in that way is a very sad reflection on the honourable member. I am very glad to see that since then somebody, somewhere, has drawn him into line and he has started to back away from some of the inflammatory, unnecessary and, frankly, completely incorrect remarks that he has made. </DOC>

 - Firstly, the Prime Minister's reference in his statement to parliament on 4 February to Iraq having sought uranium from Africa from the country of Niger was not an Australian judgment and the Prime Minister made that clear in his statement. This is what happens the whole time. The member for Griffith takes a little bit of a quote and turns it into something entirely different. The Prime Minister made it clear that this was an assessment by the British Joint Intelligence Committee. I suppose it does not count that the Prime Minister said it was an assessment by the British Joint Intelligence Committee. As usual, a convenient piece of information was left out. He did say it in his 4 February statement. That statement was accurate and was made in good faith. The government had no reason at the time to doubt the accuracy of the Joint Intelligence Committee report. As time has gone on, the Joint Intelligence Committee has begun to change its judgment, and the government has made it perfectly clear that that judgment has changed. But I make this broader point: this government has no doubt about the judgments made before the war against Iraq that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction capabilities, and that is a point that apparently the Leader of the Opposition and other opposition spokesmen used to agree with. Sometimes they do agree with it; sometimes they do not agree with it - it just depends what is convenient to them.  - I have made it perfectly clear that, as time has gone on, the Joint Intelligence Committee has made a reassessment of the information. As that information has become available to us, we have been happy to make it public, and I have made it public. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Curtin for her question. Can I indicate that from 1 July next the government will be introducing income tax cuts for every income taxpayer in Australia. For somebody who is on $25,000, it will be $300 per annum; for somebody on $45,000, it will be $200 per annum; for somebody on $60,000, it will be $450 per annum; and for somebody on $65,000, it will be around $573 per annum. This is the government which also abolished bed taxes, financial institutions duty and stamp duties on shares. We have a commitment from the states for the abolition of bank account debits tax shortly. But how does this compare with other governments around Australia?Unfortunately, whilst the federal coalition government is cutting taxes, we now have a concerted campaign by Labor state governments to put up their taxes and to claw that money back. We have seen 300 fines and charges put up by Premier Bracks and an $88 levy on all electricity bills in Queensland - supposedly to pay for an ambulance. What is the connection between $88 on your electricity bill and an ambulance levy? Gaming taxes have been put up here in the ACT - but that tells only half of the story.The state Labor parties are now ripping money out of average Australians in relation to properties. Let me give you the figures, Mr Speaker. In Western Australia in 2003-04, stamp duty went up 16.6 per cent. In Victoria in 2002-03, stamp duty went up 11.5 per cent. In South Australia in 2002, stamp duty went up 11 per cent. In Queensland in 2002-03, Premier Beattie put stamp duty up by 30 per cent. In Tasmania in 2002-03, stamp duty was put up by 24 per cent. Then we come to the grand-daddy of them all - the New South Wales government - which is bringing down its budget tomorrow. If you want to have an idea of what Labor does when it gets its hands on money, have a listen to this. When the Carr government was elected back in March 1999 the stamp duty on the average Sydney house was $8,556. In December 2002 tax for the very same house was $13,600 -  - a tax rise on the same house of $5,000!  - The Socialist Left interjects in defence. For the same house, after four years of Labor government, you now pay an additional $5,000. - We would be expecting, in the New South Wales Labor government budget tomorrow, a tax cut -  - To restore the situation, they would need to cut taxes by $5,000 on the same house. Stamp duty on conveyances in New South Wales over the last four years is up by 46 per cent. When you hear the Labor Party talk about tax, remember this: the Labor Party has one policy on tax - it is higher. The Labor Party has one policy in relation to houses - to keep the rates the same and to profit from price increases. When this government introduced the $7,000 increase in the First Home Owners Scheme, we wrote to all of the state premiers and said, `Because this will be boosting construction in your state, will you please cut stamp duty for first home buyers.' Mr Speaker, which of the six Labor states do you think accepted that offer? Not one of them. Not one Labor state would cut its stamp duty in order to help first home buyers with the $7,000 Commonwealth grant. That is why the coalition is the party of home buyers. That is why young people are voting for the coalition: they know that this is the party of low interest rates and assistance for home buyers. Labor is the party of higher taxes and higher interest rates.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Petrie for her question on this matter. The honourable member for Petrie is, of course, the Chair of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration and is recognised for having a great deal of interest in these matters. She is very much aware that regional migration has been an agenda item of this government. We have worked very hard, in consultation with the state and territory governments, to implement a range of measures which are now having quite a significant impact. Since 1996-97, some 24,000 skilled migrants and their families have made regional Australia their home. This has been a result of the government's determination to develop a mechanism for getting a better dispersal of the migration intake. I am sure members of the House would be interested to know that this financial year over 7,000 additional settlers will go to regional Australia, and that is in excess of 10 per cent of the total skilled migration stream. Through a range of initiatives that have been put in place over time, we are achieving very significant dispersal of the migration program.We have a number of other initiatives in place now. From the beginning of March this year, the business skills program has a range of incentives for state and territory sponsorship consistent with state and regional development plans and needs. From 1 July, points testing arrangements for students will be introduced, whereby we hope to see a beneficial linkage between students who study in regional Australia and where they settle. Further, I will be consulting with state and territory governments on a possible two-stage process to encourage more independent skilled migrants to settle in regional Australia.As I flagged in the beginning, there are some latter-day converts in relation to these matters. The parliamentary committee has looked at the question. I looked for new suggestions that I could follow up, and I have been dealing with those issues. But it has been suggested by those opposite that there may be other initiatives that could be followed. It was suggested that I might look to Premier Carr for some initiatives. The shadow spokesperson said yesterday:I think what he's found from that dialogue - speaking of Premier Carr's dialogue with me - is that the government is really just fiddling around the edges when it comes to regional migration.It might help the House to know that before the state election Premier Carr - keen, I think, to distract attention from some of his policies on migration - agreed to a working party with the Commonwealth to look at changes that might be put in place. The fact is that the work of that group has largely stagnated, and I think that was circumscribed particularly by the premier's unwillingness to grapple with hard policy decisions in an election environment.Some of the suggestions that I put to Premier Carr at that time - which certainly were not `fiddling around the edges' - included consideration as to whether or not some limitations might be put on family reunion in Sydney. I also suggested that he might care to look at the humanitarian stream and put limitations on the number of people settling in Sydney in favour of people settling elsewhere. I also asked whether he wanted to discuss overseas students, but I have to tell you that each of those areas were quarantined by the premier during those discussions. The only area in which he was interested in any negotiations was putting restrictions on the skilled migration scheme - which is the part that would benefit Sydney in terms of growing it as a regional headquarters and making job opportunities for people involved in business. I have to say to the shadow minister that, if she thinks she is going to able to discuss issues of this character with the Premier of New South Wales and get meaningful advances, she will have a fairly barren route to follow. </DOC>

I understand that the International Atomic -  -  - The issue is a little more complicated, my friend, than you will ever understand. - The International Atomic Energy Agency produced an assessment back in March - I do not remember the exact day, time or moment that it happened - where it said that it thought the relevant document had a forged signature on it. The question that is still outstanding is: is the document a genuine document with a forged signature - and clearly the signature is forged, because the person who signed it has not been the foreign minister of Niger for a very long time - or is the document itself completely forged? We do not know comprehensively the answer to that -  -  - You ask a question, but you do not want an answer. I said to you that during March -  - My point is that in March of this year the International Atomic Energy Agency, I recall, made the assessment that the signature on the document was a forged signature. This is the key point. Therefore, it has been assumed that the documents overall are forgeries, although the question still remains whether the actual document is a forgery or whether the signature is a forgery. Instead of giggling away there because you have another few months left as the Leader of the Opposition, you should treat this as a serious issue. My own personal assessment -  -  - All right.

The most significant outcome from the ASEAN Regional Forum ministerial meeting on 18 June was a strong unequivocal message to North Korea - one of the 23 participants in the ASEAN Regional Forum - that it must give up its nuclear ambitions, resume cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency and reverse its decision to withdraw from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.The chairman's statement from the meeting and numerous statements at the meeting by ASEAN Regional Forum foreign ministers did reflect the depth of concern felt in the region about the North Korean issue. The strength and direct nature of these messages was unprecedented in the 10-year history of the ASEAN Regional Forum. I am glad to say that Australia was able to play a leading role in these discussions.Terrorism was, not surprisingly, yet again this year a major focus of the ASEAN Regional Forum's discussion. This was the first such ministerial meeting since the Bali bombing. One of the points that I have made all along on this issue of terrorism is that it is very important that the ASEAN Regional Forum move beyond just pious and appropriate statements and that the countries of the region continue to build their activism in addressing this issue. We have done that through our memoranda of understanding; some of the ASEAN countries have done likewise with each other. But there is still a long way to go in terms of strengthening that cooperation between the countries of the region.Finally, while there are differences of approach on the issue of Burma between members of the ASEAN Regional Forum, there is not a difference of objective. The fact is that I was able, like a number of other foreign ministers, to use my bilateral meeting with the Burmese Foreign Minister, Win Aung, to reiterate Australia's deep concern about the detention of Aung San Suu Kyi and other members of the National League for Democracy and to call for her immediate release. I was actually quite interested that the Burmese Foreign Minister, having been hit with these representations from a number of countries, was able to say that he would take these messages straight back to Rangoon and that he thought the leadership there would be interested to hear what the tone of this important international conference was.In conclusion to the member's question, there is a lot of interest in ASEAN and a lot of enthusiasm among the dialogue partners as well for the issues that we are very engaged in: North Korea, terrorism and making sure those particular human rights concerns in the region - concerns such as Burma - are constructively, aggressively and hopefully in the fullness of time - though not so far so good - properly addressed. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. It has been a long time in between drinks. I hope he gets a few more in because I keep reading about his future being under a cloud. - You have the full support of those on this side of the House. In relation to those who are on the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, like any government appointee, they are required to give undertakings to the government in relation to their own financial affairs, undertakings which have, of course, been given by Mr Samuel. In relation to any matters that come before the commission, the commission consists of six or seven commissioners and it makes a decision as a commission.A lot of people began to think that the commission was one person. In fact, that is not the case; it makes its decisions as a commission with all of the members taking part. For any of those matters where they have an interest, they can disqualify themselves. But the commission - that is, the remaining members of the commission - can make decisions. That is easily coped with. It has been coped with by previous chairmen; it will be coped with by this one. We look forward to further questions from the honourable member for Fraser.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Maranoa for his question. I am aware of an ACTU report on the future of work, and I have to say that almost every assertion in the report is either false or deeply misleading. For instance, the report says that 60 per cent of overtime worked in Australia is unpaid. In fact, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, only 14 per cent of full-time employees work unpaid overtime, and the percentage working unpaid overtime is actually going down rather than up. The report said that 28 per cent of Australian workers were casuals. That is true, but it neglected to point out that 52 per cent of casuals have been with their current employer for more than 12 months and that 54 per cent of casuals have regular work patterns. In fact, only nine per cent of all part-time workers are actively seeking more hours. But the biggest porky of them all in the ACTU report was the claim that only seven per cent of workers are now working traditional hours. They really had to torture the data to come up with this figure. They restricted it to people who were working precisely 35 to 40 hours a week strictly between 9 and 5, when in fact the ABS says that 73 per cent of full-time workers usually work between Monday and Friday. The truth, as Ross Gittins pointed out in the Sydney Morning Herald last week, is: ... that the great epidemic of overwork is subsiding.Ross Gittins said:Of late, we're working less, not more.Frankly, the ACTU has cooked the statistics. It seems that the first thing that people learn when they turn up at ACTU training school is: never let the facts get in the way of a good scare.</DOC>

 - I am very happy to answer that question. I point out that Mr Samuel was the nominee of the Victorian Labor government, supported by the Tasmanian government, the Northern Territory government and the Western Australian government, and supported by me because no other nominee was put forward who was qualified for the post - a post, incidentally, which he has not even taken up yet. He takes it up on 1 July. As to these allegations, I am aware of them, because Mr Kerry Stokes came and put them to me, just as no doubt he has put them to you. There was in fact a lobbying campaign, which included Mr Stokes, against Mr Samuel. It always rather amused me when I read in the press that he was the candidate of big business. In fact, big business lobbied against him. The allegations that were put by Mr Kerry Stokes were that there was this case that was proceeding and ought to proceed in the courts. There is nothing wrong with that. There is nothing wrong with these cases proceeding in the courts. I have great confidence in the courts to be able to handle civil matters. As I said earlier, from 1 July, if there is any matter in which he has an interest - as other chairmen have had interests - he can disqualify himself, in much the same way as people in the cabinet can disqualify themselves from taking decisions in the cabinet. - Martin, you are onto a big point now, old son. We always take our advice from the ACTU on these issues, Martin, don't we? They know a conflict of interest when they see one. -  - As I said earlier, I think the commission has six or seven commissioners. It takes decisions as a commission. Various people can disqualify themselves if they think that they have a particular conflict of interest. Can I say that in all of the dealings I had with Mr Samuel when he was President of the National Competition Council he behaved impeccably. I congratulate the Keating Labor government for appointing him to that post. It apparently thought that he had no conflicts of interest when he was running competition policy as the chairman of the National Competition Council. I inherited him in that post, and I think he did a very good job. I have no doubt that, other than Professor Fels, he is the most qualified person on competition policy in Australia, and I am yet to hear anybody who has higher qualifications mentioned in debate. I pay tribute to those four Labor governments - at least - which take the same view. If federal Labor wants to sniff around with its muckraking in relation to Mr Samuel, all I can say is that it pales considerably in comparison with state Labor - and that is not a very high standard to pale against. </DOC>

 - I will come to that. I would like to thank the member for Corangamite for his question and for carrying the lantern for Bert Kelly, a great defender of free trade; George Reid; and a few other free traders. The flame still burns, and why not?The member for Corangamite understands the benefits of free trade. He also understands the impact of union thuggery on the automotive industry. That is because in his electorate, in Geelong, we have seen the impact of union thuggery at the Ford plant, on the components industries, on delivery drivers, on truckies and on all the small businesses that rely on the automotive industry, from the sandwich suppliers right through to the components businesses. They are all affected by industrial thuggery.On top of that, we have the opposition of the unions to any attempt to expand the potential market for car sales. It is no wonder that last year the head of Ford, Geoff Polites, complained about trade union militancy. He said that the marginal cost of importing from Japan was a hell of a lot less than losing a couple of days of production. He would know. As the head of Ford, he is basically saying that the impact of union thuggery is far worse than any changes to trade rules. A free trade agreement with the United States provides Australian workers and Australian manufacturers with access to a third of the world's market and the world's biggest car market. - I am asked what the car industry thinks. The Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries, representing Holden, Ford, Toyota and Mitsubishi, believes that zero tariffs between the US and Australia would boost exports, sustain the local industry and increase economies of scale. We say, `Hear, hear' to that. Holden will start shipping 18,000 Monaros - great cars: V8s, good-looking cars too - to the United States. The spokesman said that they believe a FTA will help boost Australia's economy and secure more exports. The only people who seem to oppose a free trade agreement are our old mate Dougie Cameron, who is leading the charge in industrial action against the automotive industry, and Sharan Burrow.  - When you look for a view from the Labor Party, do not look at the member for Hotham. He likes to talk about policies; he does not have a policy on this. His mate Premier Carr says:It is in Australia's interests to link ourselves with the world's most dynamic and creative economy. It's about more than trade, it is about more than investment, and it doesn't rule out Australia's growing economic relationship with East Asia.Australia's most successful Labor leader supports a free trade agreement. Premier Beattie says:A free trade agreement with the United States has my support because it has the potential to offer Queensland exporters unfettered access to a market of 280 million people.One of Australia's most successful Labor leaders, the Premier of Queensland, says that he supports a free trade agreement with the United States. We wonder what the Labor Party's view is on a free trade agreement. For too long now, the Labor Party has been sending its union mates out to oppose a free trade agreement with the United States because the Labor Party does not believe that the everyday Australian worker can compete with the everyday American worker. We on this side of the House have great faith in the Australian worker. We believe that the Australian worker can compete pound for pound on an equal footing with the American worker. We will back the Australian workers and we will back Australian jobs.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I want to assure him that, along with everyone else in Queensland and throughout Australia, he has the opportunity to comment on the draft proposals for the Great Barrier Reef which are currently out for public consultation. I take it that the comments that you have made in your question are effectively your submission to this parliament and this House on this proposal. You are, however, incorrect in making a number of statements -  - I would like to correct a number of the inaccurate comments that were made by the honourable member in his question. For example, the proposal has not in any way been to close 30 per cent of the reef. The proposal is in fact to lift the level of high-protection no-take zones - or green zones, as they are commonly known - from 4.5 per cent to 30 per cent, with the objective of securing a healthy reef. We need to have the Great Barrier Reef survive for future generations. We need to have the Great Barrier Reef put on a sustainable basis. We need to have the Great Barrier Reef able to increase fish populations and sustain healthy recreational and commercial fishing. That is precisely what the draft proposals intend to do. I was very pleased to read the comment of David Bateman, the Executive Officer of Sunfish, which is the principal recreational fishers organisation. He said:We're extremely happy with the way it's been done. What they've come up with, with the increased yellow zones throughout the marine park, will give our members the space to go fishing, and we consider it very reasonable.I was also very interested to see the comment of the Great Barrier Reef Research Foundation, which has endorsed the process for the implementation of the representative areas program. The foundation chair, John B. Reid, said that both the scientific process and the community consultation process were world's best and could be templates for the management of all reefs. This is a very significant initiative by the government. It shows the government's commitment to this magnificent Australian natural icon. We will continue to do all in our power to protect it.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Grey for his question. Obviously the question of Indigenous leadership is an important one for all Australians. There are many Indigenous leaders who are worthy of note. I will not take the time of the House to identify all of them, but I do want to identify some of the programs that are involved in endeavouring to improve the capacity of Indigenous leadership.Last week I attended a unique meeting here in Canberra; it was the first time since 1996 that the 35 regional council chairs of ATSIC had had an opportunity to meet. I have to say that the younger leadership that is emerging in ATSIC, particularly at a regional level, is first class. The council chairs passed a number of resolutions - a number of positive decisions, I might say - particularly in supporting the government's efforts to improve integrity in the way ATSIC operates and particularly in relation to the separation of powers. I want to commend ATSIC for setting aside half a million dollars for capacity building in relation to ATSIC commissioners and their regional councils in policy development and leadership skills.One other area that I would like to note is the Office of the Registrar of Aboriginal Corporations. The office of the registrar is important, and it is about to change its role from that of a corporate policeman to a more contemporary one in advising and assisting Indigenous organisations on better governance. In positioning itself to take up this role, it has put in place a number of programs to target individuals as well as groups and incorporated bodies with a number of training programs. The first pilot of the registrars' training package will commence in Far North Queensland in mid July, and the first participants are expected to complete their training by December this year.The last area I want to mention is AIATSIS, the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies here in Canberra. The institute has been funded by the Department of Family and Community Services to the extent of $400,000 through the Stronger Families and Communities Strategy to be involved in an Indigenous leadership program. The centre is providing diploma and certificate courses for emerging young Indigenous leaders from across Australia. Equally, the Minister for Education, Science and Training and the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, through their National Indigenous Youth Leadership Group, have been playing a very important role in encouraging young Indigenous leaders to come forward and to enhance their skills. These developments, amongst many others supported by this government, are assisting in very tangible ways in building capacity and particularly Indigenous leadership for the future. </DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, I wrote to the honourable member after a similar question a week ago. I have to say that some information was provided to the House about matters in which it was suggested Mr Kisrwani was involved and in which, on the information available to me, he clearly was not. Let me say that there is nothing remarkable in the fact that repeat requests are made to me. I have not done a full analysis of all of the requests that have been made to me but, in relation to matters involving sections 351, 345 and 391, first-time requests involve some 5,433 cases and there were repeat requests in about 385 cases.If you look at members of parliament, for instance, the member for Reid, who has often asked questions in relation to these matters, made 22 first-time requests and 11 repeat requests. It appears that he came back to me on something like half of the cases about which he had initially approached me. The only point I make is that there is nothing at all unusual for people to come back with further requests for matters to be looked at. It is important, particularly for those who are genuinely interested in the subject, to know that I do get a very large number of requests from a very large number of people - many of them members of parliament, but frequently also community leaders in a number of areas. I have looked at the nature of some of those requests and have found that some people have been involved in as many as 500 requests.  - No, certainly not. Let me make the point that, in relation to the way in which I am approached, I certainly take the view that I should be as open as possible in the way in which people are able to come to me. In relation to the way in which these issues are brought to my attention, they come to me because the parties themselves sometimes write; tribunals will occasionally draw matters to my attention; occasionally judges draw them to my attention; members of parliament have relationships with people in their constituencies - and sometimes, I might say, well beyond - and take those matters up with me; I get them from community representatives; I get them from migration agents -  -  - `Community representatives' is the term I use - very deliberately - because there are a wide range of people who approach me. I am required by law to examine those matters when they are referred to me. It is interesting that when a former minister endeavoured to put a gateway between himself and the review of these decisions in the Ozmanian case -  - It was a case in which his chief of staff would not refer matters to him and the courts gave specific instructions that there ought not to be anybody standing between the minister and his consideration of these issues. People try to draw particular conclusions about the way in which, looking statistically at particular groups of people, some applications are worked through. I do not look at them on the basis of whether they are from particular communities or from particular backgrounds; I look at them, as I have said, according to the guidelines that I have issued. I am not bound to follow those guidelines, but the guidelines I have issued give general advice as to the way in which these matters will come forward. This is unlike the former government when it was in office, which took the view that case by case determination was largely inappropriate. That was the view, I think, Senator Ray took when he was minister. It was quite prepared to resolve situations in the tens of thousands by seeking change in criteria for the consideration of particular claims. - Well, when you had the Chinese students, the former Yugoslavs, the Sri Lankan populations and when you had what was called, I think, the Clayton's amnesty for all rejected asylum seekers - and people who were not, in fact, rejected asylum seekers - you had 42,000 people who were visaed -  - When the former government were in office - and I think that is true to form in relation to the East Timorese - their view was, and has always been, that if you have a potential problem in relation to people who are in Australia and that issue needs to be resolved, you do so in the generality. This government determined some time ago that the way in which we were going to deal with these issues was by case by case consideration on the basis of the individual claims, weighing up countervailing circumstances and taking into account the range of issues that people might raise. That is the approach that we took, and I notice from time to time that the opposition say: `Look, when you take that approach, we applaud it.' The largest number of interventions I will probably ever make will be in relation to the East Timorese cohort. The fact is that I am considering them case by case. Some have been rejected; in a majority of those matters I have looked at, I have intervened in circumstances similar to the many cases that have been adverted to by the opposition. I simply make the point that the nature of that community and its linkages - and the electorates that they are in - probably has far more to do with the Labor Party than it has ever had to do with members on this side of the House. We will probably have something in the order of 1,600 interventions dealt with on that basis.I notice that there has been some comments on other groups, saying that they have been particularly advantaged. Let me deal with those. Some people have said, `Why isn't it happening in relation to Iraqis? Why doesn't it happen in relation to Afghans?' The reason in relation to Iraqis and Afghanis, in the main, is that they got temporary protection visas when they came here without lawful authority. So there are very few requests for intervention in relation to that cohort, but people raise that as an extraneous issue.They raise the issue in relation to Fijians. I have to say that it did surprise me that Fijians were the largest group of people collectively, in terms of country of origin, in which I was intervening, but that is the way the statistics have fallen. I look back and I say to myself, `Why would that be the case?' I suspect it is because there was a coup in Fiji on two occasions. I think there were two coups. In relation to those coups, many people came to Australia, often on tourist visas and over a period of time, particularly when they had been in relationships with Australians or they had family connections. When there are claims that are not convention related but might well have other substance, intervention has been obviously seen by me to be appropriate in exercising the judgment that I have to make.Let me come to the community which has been most maligned by the Labor Party at this time - that is, the Lebanese community. The Lebanese community has experienced something like 17 years of civil war. Of course there were some people who came to Australia, many of them at the time when it was your watch, and they have been here over a period of time.We are at the point where claims will be forthcoming from people who have relatives already in Australia, from somebody who has married an Australian citizen and may have children from that relationship and from people who have claims that may not be con-ven-tion related but are of substance when you consider the overall situation in the Lebanon. I do not apologise in relation to the nature of the consideration I give to these issues nor in relation to the claims on a case by case basis that I deal with. I will continue to make - and have continued to make over this weekend, I might say - genuine decisions on their merits as they are properly put to me.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Barker for his question. As members on both sides of this House would know, there have been many allegations in recent weeks involving alleged influence buying, influence buying in particular involving the gentleman who was the subject of a previous question. Today we had allegations by the member for Reid about donations by Mr Dante Tan. I can inform the House that the Australian Electoral Commission has received allegations of a large undisclosed political donation. Unlike some of the allegations that have been made by members opposite, these allegations involve hard evidence and a number of statutory declarations, along with other supporting documentation, which have been given to the Australian Electoral Commission.The allegation in question involves a certain Mr Dante Tan - that he gave nearly $10,000, not to the Liberal Party but to the Australian Labor Party. Members opposite come into this House claiming that Mr Dante Tan is the biggest corporate crook in the Philippines' history. They claim that he is the Philippines' version of Christopher Skase. They are happy to smear him, but they are not too proud to take his money it seems. The material given to the Australian Electoral Commission asserts that Mr Tan told a number of business associates that he had given a large donation to the ALP. The donation of $9,880 was given directly to an Australian Labor Party frontbencher at a Sydney cafe prior to the November 2001 federal election. The donation was made by means of a cash cheque at the request of the senior ALP parliamentarian and was written on the account of Mr Tan's company, Universal Lionshare. A cheque for $9,880 was written by Universal Lionshare and it was presented for payment.These allegations are not just about donations given to the Australian Labor Party; they raise serious disclosure issues because Australian Electoral Commission records disclose no donation to the ALP either by Mr Tan or by Universal Lionshare. However, AEC records do disclose a significant donation to the ALP by the senior ALP parliamentarian in question. Let me say this: it is not illegal to make donations, but it is illegal not to disclose them. It is very much illegal to launder money. On the evidence presented to the AEC, that is precisely what has happened. I call on the Australian Labor Party and its members to come clean on the extent of its relationship with Mr Dante Tan.</DOC>

 - The member for Reid asks me another question - two question times and two questions; quite a trend. As I said in response to the first question ever by the member for Reid to me, it was a departmental officer who had the delegated authority to make those decisions in relation to Mr Tan's eligibility or otherwise as far as his citizenship was concerned. As the member for Reid should know - if he understands the Citizenship Act - there are provisions within the act for those who make those decisions to determine whether or not it is in Australia's interests for a person without two years of actual residency in Australia to be able to receive citizenship. As I said last week in response to the earlier question, that decision making took place at the officer level. With regard to the granting and conferral time, nothing unusual occurred there either. -  - Mr Speaker, they are happy to laugh and make all these allegations but, when the facts get in the way of their good muckraking, they do not want to hear the answers. At the end of the day, all that occurred with regard to the decision making as far as Mr Tan's citizenship application was concerned was in keeping with normal practice. In fact the dates are very interesting: the application was lodged on 25 March 2002, the grant of citizenship occurred on 9 May and the conferral took place on 17 May. There is nothing unusual with that. Due to my department's great efforts we have been able to ensure consistently over the last couple of years - including the year that this took place and this current year; in fact we will use the month of May past - that some 75 per cent of applications are decided within 30 days of lodgment. This year to date, some 94 per cent of applications have been decided with 90 days, which -  - is all, from a performance point of view, we ask the department to try to undertake. Generally, where a candidate is seeking citizenship urgently or when a private ceremony is specifically requested by a candidate who can provide a valid reason to the officer making these decisions as to why a public ceremony is not appropriate, a private ceremony can occur. So, of course, it is not unusual for conferral to occur shortly after the grant of citizenship. In fact, the statistics are quite interesting on that too: nearly half of the applications, excluding electronic lodgments, are decided on the lodging day. So my department is hitting high levels of results in the whole process of people applying for citizenship, having it granted and indeed having the conferral which follows soon after.The member for Reid asked about private ceremonies. He needs to understand that there is nothing unusual about private ceremonies. Citizenship ceremonies can be as large as 600 and as small as one person, and they happen every week and every month of the year. You could ask the Premier of Queensland for an example of that. Just a few weeks ago he presided over a citizenship ceremony for 600 and a couple of years ago he presided over a citizenship ceremony for one - somebody particularly close to him. Of course, another member of the Australian Labor Party - a member of parliament - happened to have a spouse who was not a citizen until recent times, and I was very happy to provide a discrete and private ceremony so that that member of parliament was not embarrassed.  - </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. The most important outcome of the International Whaling Commission meeting in Berlin last week was the adoption of the Berlin initiative on the conservation of whales. Australia was very proud to co-sponsor the initiative which recognised the evolution of the International Whaling Commission from a body principally concerned with the hunting of whales to one whose primary objective is to conserve whale populations for the future. The initiative passed on a vote of 25 to 20 and will establish a new conservation committee to help the IWC meet the conservation objective, which is one of the key and primary objectives of the 1946 convention. The debates at the commission recognised that today the economic benefits from whales come overwhelmingly from whale watching and the contribution it makes to the tourist industries. Whale watching is now a $1 billion industry, far outweighing the economic benefits of hunting whales. The Australian and New Zealand resolution to establish a South Pacific whale sanctuary once again received a clear majority of the votes, though it did not receive the three-quarters vote necessary to obtain its formal establishment. Increasing numbers of South Pacific states are however declaring national whale sanctuaries - and this is a very positive development - with Fiji having recently done so and Papua New Guinea and New Caledonia indicating their intention. It took 10 years before the ban on commercial whaling was agreed. Australia is going to persist in arguing for the protection of whale species and making the point that the greatest value of whales lies in their conservation and not in their hunting and killing.</DOC>

 - I remind the Leader of the Opposition that just about every time he - and his deputy is pretty good at it too - quotes something that I said, it is normally wrong or taken out of context. So I will apply the `no concession' rule to the quotation. But more generally I make the observation to the Leader of the Opposition that if he is inter-ested in making an intelligent contri-bution to the future of Australian universities he would look rather more seriously at the gov-ernment's package than he has done. I remind the Leader of the Opposition that when the former government proposed a major change - namely, the introduction of the HECS system - we did not take the negative, uncooperative attitude that the opposition is taking. We looked to the future of Australian universities. I say to the Leader of the Opposition that if he had been in the Great Hall of parliament last Thursday night and heard what the representatives of the vice-chancellors of Australia's universities had to say, he would realise how far out of touch he and the Australian Labor Party are with what is needed. What the government has done is courageously embrace reform. What the opposition is doing is confirming its continued irrelevance to the educational and economic future of Australia.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Macquarie for that question. The member for Macquarie, in common with many members on this side of the House - and, I am sure, many members on the other side of the House - is aware that within the Australian community there is a level of concern about and unhappiness with the operation of matters relating to the custody of children following marriage breakdown and a measure of unhappiness with the operation of the Child Support Agency. The government want to respond to that concern because we believe that these are issues that go to the heart of personal happiness for millions of Australians. We all aspire to an ideal but an ideal is never realised in an overwhelming majority of cases, and the obligation of society when a marriage breaks down is to have arrangements which are in the best interests of children but which also have proper regard to the interests of the parents of those children. I have expressed before, and I will say it again, that one of the regrettable features of society at the present time is that far too many young boys are growing up without proper male role models. They are not infrequently in the overwhelming care and custody of their mothers, which is understandable. If they do not have older brothers or uncles they closely relate to - and with an overwhelming number of teachers being female, in primary schools in particular - many young Australian boys are at the age of 15 or 16 before they have a male role model with whom they can identify. I do not imagine that any one legislative change or pronouncement can alter that, but I think as a national parliament - because this is a national responsibility - there are things that we can do about it. Having regard to that, and particularly to the recent response to the report of the Family Law Pathways Advisory Group, I will be sending a reference to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs. That reference will, amongst other things, while noting that the best interest of the child is the paramount consideration, be asking the committee to investigate what other factors should be taken into account in deciding the respective time each parent should spend with their children post separation, in particular whether there should be a presumption that children will spend equal time with each parent and, if so, in what circumstances such a presumption could be rebutted.The committee will also be asked to investigate in what circumstances a court should order that children of separated parents have contact with other persons, including their grandparents. This is an issue that I think is quite properly in the same genre as the other matters I have discussed. We will also be asking the committee to examine whether the existing child support formula works fairly for both parents in relation to their care of, and contact with, their children, because - as members on this side of the House and particularly the member for Macquarie will know - there are many non-custodial parents in Australia who are profoundly unhappy with the existing formula used by the Child Support Agency and wish that matter to be examined.We are asking the committee to report to the parliament by 31 December. There is no point giving it two or three years. I think that six months, given the intensity and amount of public interest in this matter, is an appropriate period of time. I look forward to the work and the report of that committee. I encourage the committee not to see its remit as a licence to recommend large increases in the expenditure of taxpayers' money but rather to look at the structure of these arrangements. I cannot think of anything that is more important to millions of Australians than current custody arrangements. This issue is properly the concern of the national parliament, and I hope it brings forth the genuine bipartisan involvement of the opposition.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Barton for his question. It is almost, I might say, a fraternal question, because we do not need to get behind the ACTU on this issue; we are ahead of the ACTU on this issue. We are ahead of the ACTU on this issue because Australian workplace agreements are the epitome of flexibility. The whole essence of the government's policy is to encourage agreements at the individual workplace between the employer and the employee. You do not need the cumbersome one-size-fits-all approach of the ACTU; you need the flexibility of individual Australian workplace agreements. - Let me say that I have no argument at all with the philosophy of what the ACTU is proposing; I simply say that you will get better results going down the government's path.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Moore for his question and say how much I appreciate members on this side of the House showing such an interest in Bougainville and in Papua New Guinea more generally. For nine years a civil war raged in Bougainville. Some three or four times as many people died as a result of that civil war as have died in Northern Ireland since 1969 when the troubles there began. As a neighbour of Australia, Papua New Guinea sought some support from Australia. Efforts were made, but it was not until the wash-up of the Sandline crisis in 1997 that real progress was made. At the time of the cease-fire in Bougainville in 1998, which was brought about with substantial assistance from New Zealand and Australia, a peace monitoring group was set up to oversee the establishment of a Bougainville peace agreement. That agreement was signed in August 2001. Under that agreement, 1,900 weapons have been contained, the Papua New Guinea Defence Force has left Bougainville and a constitution for Bougainville has been drafted.I do not think that any of this would have been possible without the support of Australia and the support of the peace monitoring group which has been led by Australia but assisted by New Zealand, Fiji and Vanuatu. The life of the peace monitoring group comes to an end on 30 June. From 1 July we will be deploying the Bougainville Transition Team to assist Bougainvilleans in their transition to full, autonomous government, which is part of the peace process. This Bougainville Transition Team will be a small civilian team which will include people from Australia and from New Zealand, and I hope that Fiji and Vanuatu will be able to contribute to the team as well.Members may be aware that the United Nations has an observer mission in Bougainville. It is their task to verify the second stage of the weapons disposal process. I hope - but I am not sure - that this will happen by the end of this month; that is, in the next few days. That will in turn trigger the establishment of Bougainville's autonomous government. In conclusion to my response to the question from the member for Moore, whilst we accept that there is still more to be done in Bougainville, it is one of the true achievements of this government's foreign policy in recent years that we have been able to assist so substantially in bringing peace to Bougainville, that important part of Papua New Guinea, and that the people of Bougainville are now able to live in peace with the opportunity to build their lives. We will continue to assist Bougainville - it is important to understand that - through the deployment of the Bougainville Transition Team. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Jagajaga for her question. Firstly, it ought to be remembered that, when this government came to office in 1996, the Australian government was facing a $10.3 billion deficit that had been left to it by the previous Labor government, which had accumulated $69 billion in additional debt in the last five years of its term alone. Every sector, as the Treasurer reminds me, of Australian life, with the exception of defence, made a contribution to filling what was known as the `Beazley black hole'. One of the things that the government was forced to do was reduce the rate of growth in funding to Australian universities as a result of Labor policies of economic and financial neglect.One thing that this government strongly believes is that every Australian parent should be free to choose the kind of education which he or she feels best suits the aspirational needs of their children. This government strongly believes that the 2.27 million children in Australian government schools and their parents should be well funded - in particular, by state and territory governments that are responsible for funding those schools - and be supported by the Com-monwealth, which has increased its funding to government schools by 60 per cent in the past seven years when enrolments have increased only 1.6 per cent. Having done that, this government believes that a parent who chooses to send his or her child to a non-government school - whether it is a Catholic, Islamic, Anglican or Jewish school, an Aboriginal community school, an independent school or any other community school - will be supported by this government, both politically and financially, according to the financial circumstances of the families from which those children come. The children in non-government schools who come from the wealthiest families in the country receive 87 per cent less funding than if those children were to go to a state government school; and the children in non-government schools who come from the poorest families receive at least 30 per cent less than if they were educated in a government school.I table an expanded map of Sydney to show to the House and the Australian Labor Party the new non-government schools established in Sydney in the last 12 years. The Labor Party might care to note that the growth in new non-government schools is not on the north shore of Sydney, nor is it in the eastern suburbs - it is right throughout the western suburbs of Sydney. There has been a 14 per cent growth in enrolments in the schools that serve the poorest communities in the outer western suburbs of Sydney. The last thing that I would remind the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Jagajaga and those who are desperately trying to rediscover Western Sydney is that, as Greg Fletcher, a factory worker, and his wife Gina said at the Bird in Hand Inn in the electorate of Macquarie on 26 November 2001:People around here don't have much money, but they save and save so that they can send their kids to a private school and get a good education.The Labor Party says they should not try to do it but it seems they have not stopped.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. It is not often that you come across a report like the one which was released by the Australian Industry Group today. The report was called How competitive is Australia? and it cites the findings of IMD International, which surveyed countries around the world. The report says this: ... Australia's international competitiveness as measured by IMD International for countries with populations greater than 20 million has remained at 3rd out of 30 countries from 1999 to 2002, and rose to 2nd behind the United States in 2003.The Australian Industry Group went on to say this: ... Australia retains a record as being amongst the strongest economies, with the Federal Government's Budget being one of the few in surplus, a low inflationary environment, a stable political system and a AAA-rated Australian dollar.The Labor Party had Australia's credit downgraded not once but twice. One of the things that has happened over the last three or four years under the economic management of the coalition is that we have restored Australia's international credit rating to AAA. That was one of the achievements of this coalition government. Reports like this are an indication of how far we have come in recent years, but there are no grounds for stopping. Each one of those 28 countries which are rated below Australia in competitiveness is working hard to improve their competitiveness. If we were to stop, we would gradually shift down that table. You have to run faster, year after year, just to maintain the same position, let alone to improve it. So it is absolutely essential that, just as the reforms of yesteryear have taken us to the competitive position where we now stand, reforms today will take us to the competitive position we want to be in in three or four years time.I am asked if there are any factors that might prevent the Australian economy becoming more competitive, and I have thought about this a lot. The biggest brake on Australia becoming more competitive is the Australian Labor Party. The biggest brake on Australia's economic future is the Australian Labor Party. Let me go through this. The Australian Labor Party opposed the budget measures to put the budget back in surplus. The Australian Labor Party opposed the repayment of Labor debt.Government members - Shame! - The Australian Labor Party opposed tax reform. The Australian Labor Party opposes privatisation. The Australian Labor Party opposes labour market reform.Government members - Shame! - The Australian Labor Party opposes unfair dismissal reform. The Australian Labor Party opposes tariff reform. The Australian Labor Party opposes international tax reform. Government members - Shame! - The Australian Labor Party opposes reform of the welfare system. The Australian Labor Party opposes reform of the PBS, and it opposes higher education reform. It is the most oppositionist political movement in modern history.I have noticed an attempt recently to say that it is all the fault of the member for Fraser; he is not hitting the mark as shadow Treasurer. In defence of the member for Fraser, he is not the worst shadow Treasurer the Labor Party has ever put up. Its first shadow Treasurer was Gareth Evans, the then member for Holt. Then we had a shadow Treasurer who was WTG - worse than Gareth - the member for Hotham, the now Leader of the Opposition. - Mr Speaker, I was asked about the brakes on economic reform, and I am going through them. They were the member for Holt, followed by the member for Hotham. The point is this: it is not the Labor Party's spokesman who is the problem; it is the Labor Party policy. Whilst the Labor Party policy is complete opportunism, it does not matter who the spokesman is. Whilst the Labor Party follow the Creanite economic policy, then it does not matter whether the new spokesman is the member for Werriwa or the member for Griffith or whether they want to bring back the member for Perth or even the member for Brand. It does not matter who it is. Until Labor can find somebody who is prepared to stand up for a decent economic principle, Labor will continue to be the biggest block to economic reform, the biggest block to international competitiveness, the biggest block to the creation of new jobs and the biggest block to the creation of better living standards for Australians.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Pearce for her question. Litigation before the courts in immigration issues has been growing exponentially. In fact, the growth in immigration matters is alarming, particularly to the Attorney-General. I mentioned to him that it is anticipated that during this financial year approximately 5,000 immigration cases will be filed before the courts. I think the implications of that for Australians who expect to have access to the court system are particularly germane.The number of cases has doubled those filed last year, and there are 12 times the number filed during the year to 30 June 1995. The costs have also increased very significantly. This year of the order of $23 million is expected to be spent, as against $6.5 million in June 1996. I suspect the litigation costs will be even higher if the numbers increase as we have outlined. There are currently 3,100 cases before the courts and the AAT. That number will increase to almost 4,000 when the individual cases from the class actions have been processed by the courts. Despite the extension of the jurisdiction of the Magistrates Court and the case management initiatives of the Federal Court, the sheer magnitude of the number of cases will put very considerable pressure on the court system.If applicants were being successful in this litigation, one might think that it had some justification. But, of the 1,904 cases resolved by the courts during the year ended June 2002, applicants won only 111 cases or six per cent of the matters brought before the courts. The reason people bring these matters to the court is that they expect to obtain delay. They pursue unmeritorious litigation because they believe it will assist them, particularly if they are able to gain employment in the Australian community. It is in this context that the proposal of the opposition to establish an asylum seeker referral panel ought to be looked at.I alerted the House yesterday to the Ozmanian litigation before the Federal Court. I think it is important to expand on the implications of that. That was a test case that dealt with of the order of 40 applications before the Federal Court in relation to access to ministerial intervention. At that time the procedure in place for screening requests for ministerial intervention was that only those matters which fell within certain guidelines were to be referred to the minister. The Federal Court held that the conduct of departmental officers in conducting inquiries, making recommendations and doing preparatory work could be challenged and was subject to judicial review. That decision was appealed and, because of the potential for continued disruption to the administration of the intervention powers and because of the success of that case, I sought advice as to the way in which I should deal with those matters in the future. Senior counsel's advice was that all requests for intervention should be placed before the minister.The important point that needs to be made in relation to this is that the Labor Party, when they get around to thinking about policy, say: `We believe you should put between the minister and an intervention request a further body to advise as to whether that is appropriate.' Of course, the very outcome that would be achieved is that there would be another opportunity for every party that wanted to use the courts to further delay matters to challenge the decisions about what matters would be put before the minister. That is what the outcome would be in relation to the course of policy that you want to suggest. We have some 5,000 cases in prospect before the courts and further delay occasioned in relation to those matters. And what is the opposition's approach? The opposition's approach is to say, `Let's put another opportunity in the system for people to be able to go before the court.'  - </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Lyons for his question about private health insurance. I understand his concern about this issue, because more than 25,000 of his constituents have private health insurance. The reason they have private health insurance is that this government has put into place measures to encourage people to take out private health insurance. The 30 per cent rebate and the lifetime health cover measures mean that those constituents in the electorate of the member for Lyons have the opportunity of having private health insurance in a way which was never available when the Labor Party was in government.This is something which I understand the member for Lyons is keenly interested in. If there is any deficiency in relation to the notification which the honourable member has addressed, I will have it looked into and get back to him.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, I know the interest of honourable members in this subject, particularly in relation to the Family Court assuming jurisdiction to determine the lawfulness of detention of minors. I made a decision some time ago as minister that, if a state welfare authority recommended that for the best interests of a child in detention they should be released from detention and cared for by state welfare authorities, I would accede to that course of action. It has not been a course recommended to me by any state welfare authority in Australia where detention facilities are placed. The second matter that I would inform the House of is that in relation to the alternative residential arrangements which we are seeking to expand - and I have mentioned that in relation to Port Hedland and to Baxter in Port Augusta, South Australia - while we have a facility still operational at Woomera and not fully utilised, we have given an opportunity to all those at both Baxter and Port Hedland who are eligible to participate the opportunity to do so and they refused.It is in that context that I want to answer the question about the view taken by a majority of the full court of the Family Court on 19 June that found that its welfare jurisdiction extended to determining lawfulness of detention and the power to order the release of children in immigration detention, notwithstanding the provisions of the Migration Act. I said on Friday that I was seeking advice from the Solicitor-General on this matter. The advice I have received is that there are strong grounds for overturning this decision on appeal. I am advised that the full Family Court judgment clearly misstates a number of submissions put to the court on my behalf and that it addresses the issue of unlawful detention, notwithstanding that this was neither raised at the hearing nor put to my counsel at any stage during the proceedings. That is the advice that has been given to me.In accordance with senior counsel's advice, the following steps have been taken. I am seeking a certificate in the Family Court which would enable an appeal to be brought before the High Court, such a certificate being granted in cases which involve important questions of law and public interest. In conjunction with the above application, I have applied for a stay of the full Family Court's orders pending determination of any appeal. I have also lodged an application for special leave in the High Court. In the event that the Family Court certificate is not granted, then I will pursue that appeal directly.The government does not accept that the Family Court has jurisdiction to determine the lawfulness of immigration detention in face of the immigration act or to order the release of persons from immigration detention. This decision undermines parliament's clearly stated intention, as evidenced in the Migration Act, that unlawful non-citizens are to be detained until removed, deported or granted a visa. Mandatory detention is an integral part of the government's policy in relation to unauthorised boat arrivals and we will continue to ensure that remains the case.</DOC>

 - Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I can tell the member for Mackellar that the government is determined to uphold the rule of law in Australian workplaces. Lawbreakers must face consequences according to law, and no-one should be able to break the law with impunity in the workplace or anywhere else. Unfortunately, for many years in this area we have had far too much legalism and not nearly enough real justice. To give just one example, which is typical of many, last year there was a strike at the Patricia-Balleen gas plant in Gippsland for two months costing several million dollars. In continuing this strike, the strikers and their unions flouted no fewer than three Federal Court injunctions and two Industrial Relations Commission return to work orders.I can tell the member for Mackellar that there is hope of improvement in the future. The Workplace Relations Amendment (Compliance with Court and Tribunal Orders) Bill now before the parliament will oblige officials of registered organisations to adhere to the law or risk losing their jobs, and the contempt of the commission bill to be introduced later this week will strengthen existing provisions making defiance of the Industrial Relations Commission a criminal offence. Members opposite -  - Members opposite are always talking about how much they respect the Industrial Relations Commission. These bills will give members opposite the chance to ensure that commission decisions are taken seriously and that their union mates are no longer able to thumb their noses at the industrial umpire.  </DOC>

 - Clearly, the travel advisories during 2002 - as is certainly the case now - reflected the information that the department got, in particular, from ASIO. I do not have the details in front of me, but I do certainly recall during 2002 our travel advisories made it clear that there was a risk of terrorist attacks. These are travel advisories for Australians so, ipso facto, they were directed to Australians. There was no question of our concern about possible terrorist attacks. We had been warning not only through travel advisories but also, as I said yesterday, in answers to parliamentary questions - some of them from this side of the House and I think some of them from the other side of the House as well during the course of last year - and in a number of speeches about the risk of terrorism in South-East Asia and Indonesia. I particularly recall during the period of September-October, before the Bali bombing on 12 October, making some very robust and somewhat criticised comments in parts of Indonesia. I said on Lateline at one stage in September that Abu Bakar Bashir, who is the spiritual leader of Jemaah Islamiah, should be arrested. - Yes, on Lateline. The Leader of the Opposition will be interested to know it is a very good program. He should be prepared to go on it more often. I also made a comment in a speech -  -  - I know he is frightened of Lateline. - During early October when I was in Kuala Lumpur, I took the opportunity at a World Economic Forum conference of referring again to my deep concerns about Abu Bakar Bashir, who himself responded with some gratuitous remarks about how I should become a Muslim or something. The serious point here is that throughout 2002 - not only through travel advisories which warned Australians in Indonesia of possible terrorist attacks but also in a number of other ways, and ONA in particular at the recent Senate committee hearing made this clear - our understanding of the threat of Jemaah Islamiah grew. It is well known that that particular concern came to a head towards the middle of the year. As that concern grew, so did our comments about the risks and the dangers. That was reflected in travel advisories. But it was very important to do more than that, and to talk about these issues.  All of this of course does not give much comfort to the victims of the Bali bombing. We all know that. It is such a terrible thing that so many people would be killed. It is a matter that everybody regrets: that nobody knew the Bali bombing was going to happen. Otherwise it could have been stopped. There has been information from time to time about possible terrorist attacks in South-East Asia. As the House may recall, there was one not very long ago in Surabaya, and it was possible not only to issue a warning in relation to that but also for people on the ground to take steps to try to deal with it. There was not the terrorist attack that had been feared. This was a few weeks ago. If only we had had that information on Bali, perhaps history would have been different.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Sturt for his question and his interest in the subject of doctors in the work force in outer metropolitan areas. I say to the House that the Howard government is committed to improving access to doctors right across Australia. In relation to the rural and remote areas of Australia, between 1997-98 and 2000-01 there was an increase from 5,700 doctors to 6,363 - an 11.5 per cent increase. That program, which is being successful in rural and remote areas of Australia, is also being successful now with the $80 million More Doctors for Outer Metropolitan Areas measure, which was announced in the 2002-03 budget.An essential component of this program is the relocation incentive grants to help health professionals to move to the outer metropolitan areas of Australia's major cities. Under this relocation incentive, doctors in inner metropolitan areas can apply for grants of up to $20,000 to move to existing practices in outer metropolitan areas or $30,000 if they are going to establish new practices in outer metropolitan areas. The program is also available for general practice registrars in the general training pathway who have finished their training and are eligible for the incentive payments.The government, under this component of the program, set a target of 150 doctors over a four-year period under the overall program. I can indicate to the House and to the member for Sturt today that, since the announcement in March of this year, in just on three months 75 doctors have taken up placements or agreed to permanently relocate to the outer metropolitan suburbs. So, having set ourselves a target of 150 over four years, we have actually delivered, or are in the process of delivering, 75 - half the target within the first three months of the program. Of these 75 health professionals, 52 are doctors, 22 are general practice registrars and one is a specialist trainee. The $30,000 incentive for inner city doctors to relocate has, therefore, been extended by the government to 31 December, which will give more urban doctors the opportunity to take up the initiative. This will be complemented by the measures in the A Fairer Medicare package, which aims to boost the work force of doctors, particularly in the hinterlands of the six major capital cities of Australia.I was asked whether or not there were any alternative policies. Of course, what we were left when we came to government was a huge maldistribution of doctors: too few in regional and rural Australia and too few in the outer metropolitan areas of Australia. The ALP's response is to continue to ignore the outer metropolitan areas of Australia. It has made no commitment to keep these work force initiatives of this government. In fact, its wasteful Medicare proposals would do nothing about doctors in outer metropolitan areas. The ALP has no plans to send doctors where they are most needed - no plans whatsoever. It has no outer metropolitan medical work force scheme and it has no commitment to keep such a program. One thing is sure, and that is that under the coalition government there will always be more doctors in outer metropolitan Australia. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dawson for her question. Indeed, I had the pleasure of being in that electorate recently with the member for Dawson at a graduation of a Green Corps project in Sarina. I have to say that this has been one of the most outstanding programs that the coalition has put in place, with two key objectives: better environmental outcomes, which we are doing, and great youth development by encouraging young participants across Australia. It is focusing on our two greatest assets: our young people and, of course, better outcomes for the environment.For our young people it no doubt improves their skills, gets them more job ready, builds camaraderie and, specifically, increases their confidence about and knowledge of environmental issues. Indeed, since 1996 over 10,000 young people have participated in the program, in over 1,000 projects. They have been very diverse. In the member for Parkes's electorate, near Forbes, there is a Green Corps team working on a wildlife corridor - it is all about replanting native trees and shrubs. In the member for Brand's electorate, down near Peel waterways at Mandurah, there is another great project for young people. So far in Perth South in Western Australia they have planted over 7.9 million trees and eradicated about 30,000 hectares of weeds.I must admit that the most encouraging element of Green Corps is the feedback that we get from the participants. I was up in the member for Dawson's electorate recently, and she had received a letter from a young graduate. I would like to share it with the House. It says: Green Corps has done wonders for all of us. I myself never used to want to work at all. Four months down the track after this program, now I am willing to try anything. The program has benefited us all in many ways. Now we have confidence in ourselves, it has given us so much more worth in our lives. We now know that we can go out into the world with our heads held high and believe in ourselves.What a wonderful testimony from those young Green Corps teams up in the Dawson electorate and across the country. Even in my own electorate, I was reassured the other day by Green Corps participants who are doing wonderful work in the Dunbible catchment, having teamed up with a local land care group. The team leader, Janica Pearson, said that Green Corps `improves the attitude, the self-esteem and the work ethic for young people involved with the project'. Green Corps is a terrific program, and I hope that all members of the House get behind these young Australians and encourage them. Good for them and good for the environment.</DOC>

Let me say that these allegations smear a fine Australian - who is certainly not the Liberal Party bagman, as represented by people like the member for Reid. Over the years, Mr Kisrwani has had many friends - not all of them Liberal Party members - and has been involved in many political party fundraisers, not all of them Liberal Party fundraisers. For instance, the other day I came across some interesting information in a book called The Fixer: The untold story of Graham Richardson. It says:In December, Eddie Obeid - Eddie Obeid is, in fact, a minister in the Carr government - and his business partner - rather, he is an ex-minister in the Carr government - Karim Kisrwani, attended their first of many $100-a-head fund-raising dinners for Premier Neville Wran.These people are happy to smear Mr Kisrwani now, but they were not too proud to use him once. The chapter from Marian Wilkinson's book is entitled `Ghosts from the Past'. I have to say that this is one ghost that is still haunting members opposite. In fact, before the last election the member for Reid was concerned about the preselection of his factional colleague, Mr David Borger. He asked no less a person than Mr Karim Kisrwani to provide stackers for branches friendly to Mr Borger. He also said that he would pay the membership fees of those stackers. The member for Lalor likes to provide numbers. After investigations, I suggest that the member for Lalor might have a look at Australian Labor Party New South Wales branch membership No. 991484. Investigate that, and see how far it complies with the rules of the Australian Labor Party. We all know that the Labor Party plays its politics pretty rough in Western Sydney, but things have come to a pretty sorry state when the member for Reid has to draw on the services of someone who he now says is a Liberal Party bagman to try to protect his own factional position.Over the past few weeks, we have seen a great deal of stone throwing against the minister for immigration, who is an honourable man doing a very good job under difficult circumstances. Let me say this: these stone throwers do not live in glass houses; they live in glass cathedrals. It is about time that members opposite got off the dirt track and tried to give the Australian people a bit of policy that one day they might be able to vote for.</DOC>

 - I gave a lengthy answer to a question yesterday in which I outlined comprehensively the way in which the powers that are reposed in me were developed over time and the way in which those powers are exercised. I simply make this point: I have no say in who approaches me. The numbers of times people approach me vary greatly. Some members of parliament never approach me. Others approach me on one or two occasions. Others approach me on tens of occasions. It is the same with migration agents and community representatives. The only point I make is that I determine these issues on a case by case basis, and the way in which they are resolved depends upon the facts in each individual case. I stand by the decisions I have made, and I do not intend to have them micromanaged by you.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Boothby for his question. I can inform the member for Boothby that comments in today's paper by Mr Dante Tan's business partner certainly seem to indicate that a member of the Australian Labor Party, former frontbencher Senator Nick Bolkus, gave dodgy advice on how to avoid the disclosure requirements of the Electoral Act. I want to make it very clear to members opposite that the Australian Electoral Commission advises that any receipts which aggregate to more than $1,500 must be disclosed by both the receiver and the donor. In other words, large donations cannot be disaggregated just because they are channelled through the device of a dodgy raffle. Mr Speaker, you have to ask yourself just what political planet Senator Bolkus has been inhabiting these last few weeks. How could Senator Bolkus have been reading the newspapers over the last few weeks and not have recalled his own handling of a Dante Tan donation - unless, of course, Senator Bolkus does this kind of thing all the time? Senator Bolkus must now provide answers about what seems to have been the world's most expensive chook raffle. How many tickets did Senator Bolkus sell? At what price did Senator Bolkus sell these tickets? How many tickets did Senator Bolkus sell to Mr Tan? And the questions that Senator Bolkus really should answer are these. When did he tell the Leader of the Opposition? When did he tell the member for Lalor? When did he tell the member for Reid? - After Senator Bolkus has told us when the Leader of the Opposition first knew about this raffle, the Leader of the Opposition might tell us what he is doing to discipline his members who apparently are trying to launder money and avoid the disclosure provisions of the Electoral Act. - It should not be too hard for the Leader of the Opposition to find out answers from Senator Bolkus. Let us face it, they flat together in Canberra. You can just imagine the late evening -  - You can imagine the conversation tonight, can't you, back at this exclusive Canberra -   - `How many dodgy donations have you made recently?' That is the question that the Leader of the Opposition ought to pose. - I have also been asked -  - I have also been asked about other Commonwealth legislation requirements which might have been evaded by the actions of Senator Bolkus. The Financial Transactions Reports Act 1988 requires mandatory recording of cash transactions over $10,000. I am advised that bank tellers are trained to identify suspect transactions just beneath the $10,000 threshold. The amount of the cash cheque, $9,880, suggests that it may have been designed precisely to circumvent these legislative requirements. The AEC certainly may wish to refer this matter to the Australian Federal Police for further investigation.It seems that Senator Bolkus has been involved in money laundering, pure and simple; it seems that the ALP is in this up to its neck. I call on the Leader of the Opposition to come clean about what has been going on and to discipline Senator Bolkus immediately.</DOC>

 - Over a long period, in dealing with questions that have been put by the opposition, I have endeavoured to deal with them fully. In fact, many of my colleagues complain about the extent to which I have done that.  - I would have thought that - with the number of questions I have fully answered and the number of times people have gone outside this House, ignored the answers I have given, considerably misrepresented me and at times defamed me - those that do not come with clean hands deserve no better answer than they have had so far.</DOC>

 - As the Leader of the Opposition knows, of course, the real cost of telecommunications to consumers has come down massively over the last few decades. When I was young, to ring my grandparents in Sydney was an expensive exercise and you thought twice about doing it. Now, nobody thinks about the cost of a long-distance phone call. In real terms, it gets cheaper and cheaper. The cost of sophisticated telecommunications is plainly on the way down, and it comes down faster the more competition you have. Let me make one other point. I am very proud of the improvement in telecommunications standards and outcomes in rural Australia since we came to power. In relation to adopting the Labor Party's policy, I will adopt, firstly, the Treasurer's approach to the counsel that we should always look at what the Labor Party does, not what it says, and, when it comes to privatisation, I will take my cue from what you said about Qantas and the Commonwealth Bank. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Fadden for his question, which touches upon a very important regional issue for Australia. The House would be aware that in April the Prime Minister of the Solomon Islands, Sir Allan Kemakeza, wrote to me seeking Australia's assistance to deal with the serious law and order problem in his country. He, accompanied by other senior ministers, came to Canberra on 5 June and held discussions with me, the foreign minister, the defence minister and the minister for justice. It was made clear by the Australian government during those discussions that, if the Australian government were disposed to become involved to assist the Solomon Islands government, it would have to be upon the basis of a properly backed and properly issued legal request from the government of the Solomon Islands so that, in every way, any action taken would fully comply with the requirements of international law.Subsequently, a team of officials from Australia and New Zealand visited Honiara to consult the government and the broader community of the Solomon Islands. The National Security Committee of Cabinet met this morning and had a detailed briefing on the outcome of that scoping study. I can inform the House that the government is strongly disposed towards responding positively to the request made by the government of the Solomon Islands on the basis of our anticipation that that response would be in concert with New Zealand and with other countries in the Pacific Islands Forum.The assistance that is being contemplated includes substantial policing, law and justice and economic assistance, backed up by significant operational support from the Australian Defence Force. The latter is crucial to the safety and effectiveness of any external assistance. It is the judgment of both the Chief of the Australian Defence Force, General Cosgrove, and the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police, Mr Mick Keelty, that backup of that kind is essential for any successful intervention and any successful operation of this type.The next step is for the foreign minister to chair a meeting of forum foreign ministers in Sydney on 30 June. I discussed the matter with the New Zealand Prime Minister, Helen Clark, after the national security meeting this morning. I have also taken the opportunity of personally briefing the Leader of the Opposition. I stress that no final decisions have been taken, but there is a very strong disposition on the part of the government to act. But of course it will not and cannot act - and I make this very clear to the House - unless proper legislation authorising external assistance is put in place.Our willingness to undertake an operation of this kind does represent a very significant change in regional policy. It is not in Australia's interests to have a number of failed states in the Pacific. The Solomon Islands has a long association with this country. We have been willing in the past to act as an honest broker. The Townsville peace initiatives came very much as a result of diplomatic efforts by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and I congratulate the foreign minister for the role that he played in that. It is a challenge to the international community, and the international community naturally and understandably expects Australia to play a leading role. If we do nothing now and the Solomon Islands becomes a failed state, the challenges in the future of potential exploitation of that situation by international drug dealers, money launderers, international terrorism - all of those things - will make the inevitable dealing with the problem in the future more costly and more difficult, and we would pay very dearly for our indifference if we were to adopt that course now.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. Can I say at the outset - and I will table this graph in the House - that the overall fall in telco prices since we came to government in 1996 is 24.8 per cent. I think that is quite a relevant consideration for the House. - The general point that has to be made to the opposition is that they no longer believe in competition. The reality is that, in the sort of environment that the member for Melbourne is talking about, competitive pressures will always drive better customer outcomes. That is a basic rule of economics. The fact is that competition is driving those price reductions. If Telstra is not able, in an area where there is dense business caseload, to hang on to its customers its customers will go somewhere else. - That is the way the market ought to operate. Let me make it quite plain that, wherever there is a sufficiently dense business caseload or load for Telstra and for telcos to operate, competition can only produce better outcomes for consum-ers. We have upgraded the USO and introduced a CSG - never done by Labor. Where there is not a sufficiently dense business load and where those mechanisms are nec-essary it is a question of the willpower and willingness of the government of the day to ensure outcomes that will produce a result - not the ownership structure, as has been well proved by past history. </DOC>

 - As the member for Kalgoorlie - who actually lives out there - would know, services have improved dramatically. Not only are we intent on continuing those improvements and closing any remaining gap but we are the only government that has ever moved to future-proof these arrangements to ensure that the gap that Labor left us in telecommunications standards does not re-emerge. If there is a black hole in communications, we have gone a very long way to filling it. Over the next little while we will fill it and, what is more, we will ensure that it does not re-emerge.I will come to some specifics - they are worth working over again, if members are interested. They include, firstly, I would think, the world's leading consumer safeguards in terms of the universal service obligation and the customer service guarantee -  which is a first; it has never been done before anywhere - to set timetables for installing and repairing phone services, and the network reliability framework to target and fix local network problems. We have vastly improved telephone services. People in remote areas now have untimed local calls. Who did that? We did that. It was a dream under the previous government. Service connection times in remote areas have been slashed from more than two years to less than six months. All Australians have dial-up access to the Internet for the price of a local call. We have set minimum speed standards for Internet connection and guaranteed access to a 64 kilobytes a second Internet service.We also have one of the world's best mobile phone networks. We have replaced the mobile phone network that Labor killed off - never forget that. They now talk about their commitment to regional services - but they killed the analog service and they had no replacement. It was under this government that CDMA was rolled out. We have now funded more than 900 mobile phone towers to cover 98 per cent of the Australian population. Was ever such a performance contemplated by the Labor Party in government? Have they ever put up a policy proposal to match that in telecommunications? We have funded near-continuous mobile phone coverage on major national highways, and for people in the most remote areas we subsidise the cost of a satellite phone.The measures announced this morning - another $181 million in response to the Estens inquiry - build on that record and, most importantly of all, lock in the benefits and improvements for the future to make certain that we do not get another black hole opening up. We will upgrade radio concentrated phone systems so that people in the most remote areas get yet another improvement in their service. There will be a further extension of mobile phone services and satellite phone capacity. We will be putting in place a national broadband strategy, very importantly, which includes more than $100 million of incentives so that people in rural and remote areas will be able to access broadband at prices reasonably equitable to those in urban areas. This broadband strategy is a very important step in ensuring that continuing improvements in technologies are delivered to people in regional Australia as well as to people in the cities. In addition to that, there will be a parliamentary group headed by the member for Hinkler. It will conduct a monitoring process and report regularly to the Prime Minister and to the government. On top of that there will be - and this is very important - continuing regular independent reviews of telecommunications services. That will be set in legislation and the government will be obliged to respond to reports. - The opposition spokesman is not in the slightest bit interested in this. - We will be imposing a licence condition on Telstra to ensure that it maintains a presence in regional Australia. Quite frankly, that is probably not necessary for the simple reason that Telstra Country Wide is a profitable operation in its own right and it has performed very well. I doubt that Telstra would want to wind it back, but that licence insurance policy will be there to ensure that Telstra Country Wide remains.</DOC>

 - What the government has said is that it seeks parliamentary authorisation to offer additional equity to private investors in Telstra and will do so at a time which is commercially appropriate. We have said that on a number of occasions. I have also said, incidentally, that we missed the opportunity, when the Labor Party frustrated the sale earlier -  - and I do find it rather interesting that the Labor Party now gets interested in the proceeds in relation to Telstra. The government equity in Telstra, from peak to trough, has fallen by $30 billion. I did not have any questions from the member for Fraser, when the Telstra price was up at $8 or $9, about the financials of offering the shares, surprisingly enough. But I must congratulate you: the fall from peak to trough represents, in the Commonwealth's hands, a loss of net worth of $30 billion. - The member for Melbourne says this is some -  - Mr Speaker, let me make one final point which perhaps even the member for Melbourne could understand. At the moment, Telstra is half in the hands of private investors and half in the hands of government. If the Labor Party policy really is that we need a nationalised telecommunications company, surely they would be proposing to buy back that 49 per cent interest. What logic is there in having a utility which is half in private hands and the other in relation to taxpayers? If you really do believe in nationalisation and the socialist objective of the Australian Labor Party, then come forward with your policy and buy back 49 per cent. There used to be an old saying: what is a socialist? A socialist is a Communist without any guts. And the Labor Party is a socialist without any guts. Have the courage of your convictions. Come on; tell us how you propose to buy it back. Stand here and tell us about the virtues of nationalised telecommunications.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Cook. He has asked me privately about this issue on a number of occasions, and I recognise the sincerity of his concerns not just in relation to Iraq but more broadly for human rights issues, which on this side of the House are enormously important questions.As time has gone on since the end of the war in Iraq, the sheer scale of the brutality of the former Iraqi regime is becoming increasingly apparent, with almost daily discoveries of grave sites. Some 150 mass grave sites have been found in Iraq. Estimates - and these are only estimates - indicate that some 300,000 people were brutally slain by Saddam's regime and buried in mass graves. But the reality inevitably is that we may never know the true extent of the atrocities visited upon the Iraqi people. No corner of Iraq was spared from Saddam's wrath. Graves have been discovered all over the country. - The larger groupings have been found in Shia and Kurdish regions, which bore the brunt of the regime's wrath over the years, and some contain the remains of Iranian and Kuwaiti prisoners of war. -  - Human rights don't matter to you. - It is not just the scale of the massacres that have taken place in Iraq that is troubling but also the horrific way that many of these people died. Baghdad markets are apparently selling copies of macabre video recordings of executions the regime recorded for later reference. Some footage shows execution by explosives strapped to victims' chests. People have come forward to give eyewitness accounts of how deserters were bussed into an intelligence facility near Baghdad and apparently summarily executed in the final days of the regime of Saddam Hussein. The Coalition Provisional Authority is helping the Iraqi people unveil the true extent of Saddam Hussein's brutality. It has deployed specialists with relevant expertise to locate, preserve and analyse material evidence of atrocities. It is searching for and detaining members of the regime who may be of interest to any future prosecution for atrocities. Atrocities and crimes against humanity committed by the former regime against Iraqi nationals should ultimately be dealt with by the Iraqis themselves. The Coalition Provisional Authority is now preparing to re-establish an Iraqi system of criminal courts. Judges and prosecutors under the re-established court system will be vetted to ensure that they have not themselves contributed to egregious human rights abuses under the former regime. The revelations that have come forth in the last couple of months of human rights atrocities in Iraq are as bad as any we have seen anywhere in a very long time. On this side of the House it reminds us of the pride we take in having liberated that country. </DOC>

 - That of course is a highly partisan interpretation of what I said this morning. In relation to the member for Calare, that is increasingly something of a pattern, I have to say and I regret to say. -  - It is. It is just a matter of record. I made the point this morning that in all of this debate nothing is more important to me, to the people I represent and to my colleagues from country electorates than getting telecommunications right - the services as sound as possible, at the lowest possible cost and with the greatest possible reliability. I made it very clear that that is plainly not a function of ownership. If it were a function of ownership, I would not have had the greatest gap that could ever have been described between what urban Australians enjoyed and what I enjoyed living out in the north-west of New South Wales 15 years ago under a Labor government. That is the simple fact of the matter: it was never worse - and I see the member for Calare nod.Public ownership per se is no guarantee of services - none. Firstly, the guarantee of services is, wherever the business case is dense enough, competition. It is as simple as that. Competition is what drives the price reductions that I tabled a moment ago and that the great majority of Australians, including the great majority of rural Australians, have benefited from, enjoy and now expect. Secondly, where competition will not do it, only a government with a regulatory framework and a commitment to see it through will guarantee it.  My point this morning was a very strong one. We have taken the steps to close the divide - and I outlined them at some length a moment ago to get them on the record. It is a proud record; I am proud of it. I can look anyone in rural Australia in the eye and say, `Your services now are one heck of a lot better than they would have been if the ALP had still been in power.' It was just pointed out to me by one of my colleagues - I think it was the member for Maranoa, who has a very good eye - that the former Labor minister who canned analog is in the gallery today. Michael Lee, thank you very much for canning it. That was a clear demonstration of the Labor Party's commitment to rural and regional Australia. One of the things we have done under this legislation -  -  - This is very interesting, but they do not want to hear it. It will be a licence condition for Telstra to continue to operate that they maintain a presence in rural and regional Australia. I note with very great interest that the ALP were never going to privatise anything - they were not going to privatise the Commonwealth Bank! Did they put a condition of licence into the Commonwealth Bank Sale Act to ensure that it maintained a rural presence?Let us get real. Let us concentrate in a visionary and forward-looking way on what will deliver what country Australia needs - not opportunistic rhetoric, not the ideology of opportunism, but some actual vision and commitment of the sort that this government has shown in getting the service gap closed and putting in place a future-proofing mechanism to ensure that it will remain closed, provided only that you have governments with the willpower and commitment to deliver on the future proofing. Our record there is second to none.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Eden-Monaro for his question. I can inform the House that in six days time, on 1 July, thanks to the policies of this government, every Australian income tax payer will receive an income tax cut. This is consistent with the coalition's approach to economic management, which is that, after funding responsible social services, our troops in the field and assistance to those who are suffering from the drought, taxes ought to be kept as low as possible.What alternatives have we seen in Australia? In Victoria we saw the Bracks government lift 300 taxes and charges, increase motor vehicle registration fees by 12 per cent and try to tax every user of the Scoresby Freeway. In Western Australia we saw stamp duty increases on insurance policies. In Queensland we saw an $88 tax increase on every electricity bill. In South Australia we saw the Labor Party put a $30 levy on every water bill. And yesterday, in a clean sweep of the Labor governments - eight out of eight in Australia - the New South Wales government increased fees, taxes and charges in very significant areas. Let me tell the House what those areas were. There were gambling tax hikes for clubs and hotels to raise $46 million; a new parking space levy, an increase of $40 a year for city business districts; and TAFE fee increases. TAFE graduate diploma course fees will increase in New South Wales - get a load of this - from $700 to $1,650 per year. That is a 230 per cent increase. Let us get this straight. Apparently the Labor Party is against a possible 30 per cent increase in university fees because it is in favour of a 230 per cent increase in TAFE fees. What about the interest-free loan? Is there a HECS scheme for TAFE students?A government member - No. - So what is the Labor Party's message to the students of the western suburbs of Sydney? If you go into a TAFE course, the Labor Party wants to increase your fee by 230 per cent with no HECS scheme, no interest-free loan and no ability to get in. That shows the contempt the Australian Labor Party has for the kids of the western suburbs of Sydney. Have we heard a peep from the Leader of the Opposition about any of these taxes? Have we heard a peep from the Leader of the Opposition about tolls on the Scoresby Freeway? If you ever go out to Hotham, you will realise that that freeway is pretty near the electorate of Hotham. - Let us come to the grand-daddy of them all - the New South Wales Labor Party policy in relation to stamp duty. In 2001-02 they had a windfall of $430 million and in 2002-03 they got $830 million - a $1.2 billion windfall in stamp duty. If you take the Sydney median house price index, when the Carr government first came to office in 1995 the tax was $5,420. In 2003 on that same house - the house has not changed - the tax is $16,190. That is an increase of $11,000.So what is the Labor Party's message to the battlers of Western Sydney? An $11,000 increase in the tax on your house, a parking levy, an increase in gaming taxes in your clubs and pubs and, if you want to get your kids into a TAFE course, a 230 per cent increase with no HECS scheme, no loan and no interest-free facility. The Leader of the Opposition has had every opportunity to condemn one state Labor government for its tax rises. If you want to see what Labor would do in office, look at what they are doing; do not listen to what they say. The Labor socialist alternative today is, as it always has been, higher taxes, slugging the people on median incomes, slugging the people of Western Sydney and making them much worse off.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Oxley for his question. I can inform him and the House that personnel deployed to the Middle East as part of Operation Falconer are being paid a tax-free salary and a tax-free allowance of $125 a day, in addition to other benefits. It is important to understand that the $125 a day recognises not only that ADF personnel in that region are considered to be serving in war-like conditions but also that the major combat phase of the operation in Iraq is over.  - The ADF personnel in Iraq during the war received a $200 a day allowance, and this was consistent with the government's commitment before the war that more generous conditions of service would apply to those personnel who were directly involved in combat operations. On the advice of the Chief of Defence Force, and following the end of the major combat phase of the conflict, the allowance for all personnel in the Middle East reverted to $125 a day. This was from 9 June 2003. However, following a recent review of the security situation in Iraq, the rate of this allowance has been increased to $150 for those personnel serving within Iraq. This change will take effect from 9 June 2003 and will soon be communicated to our troops. I think this is a great opportunity to again salute our troops for the fantastic job that they are doing in Iraq.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Sturt for his question, and I commend him on his continuing interest in security matters. As part of our continued commitment to the safety of the Australian community, the Howard government will strengthen the security powers of the Australian Protective Service. The APS is a front-line agency in the new security environment. It is responsible for protecting Commonwealth property, it is responsible for performing a counter-terrorism first response role at our major airports, and it is responsible for the provision of air security officers on domestic flights. Recognising this role, the government has funded an additional 156 APS officers in a counter-terrorism role at airports. This includes an increase in the number of explosive detection canine teams from six to 18. Building on this, the government has decided to introduce legislation to give the APS new powers to enable it to more effectively protect the community. In the new environment it is essential for the APS to play a stronger preventative role and to provide an extra layer of security at our airports. Rather than waiting until a person has committed or is committing an offence, APS officers must be able to respond appropriately in suspicious circumstances where an arrest is not immediately necessary or possible. The government proposes new powers that would allow an APS officer to request a person's name and address and reason for being in the vicinity of a place or a person in certain circumstances. It is also proposed that, in strictly limited circumstances, APS officers have the power to stop and undertake a frisk or ordinary search of a person or seize an item from a person. Those circumstances would be where the APS suspects on reasonable grounds that the person possesses a thing that can be used to cause damage or injury constituting an offence over which the APS has jurisdiction. An example of where these powers would be effective is where an APS officer sees a person at an airport who appears to have something hidden under their coat. With these powers, the officer could approach the person and ask their name and address. This would enable the officer to make an assessment of the demeanour of the person. If the officer remains concerned, he or she could request that the person take off their coat. If the person has in his or her possession a potential weapon, the officer could seize the item. This would obviously be a positive result in terms of protecting the travelling public against potential threats.This is not a plan to do pat-down searches or frisking of all passengers as they enter the secure areas of airports. Privacy issues have been taken into consideration in the development of the powers. The new powers are a balanced and appropriate response to the changed security environment in which APS officers operate, and they reflect the government's continued commitment to the protection of the Australian community from terrorist and other threats to our security.</DOC>

 - I suspected the member for Reid would come back to the question he asked yesterday, and I checked my memory as to the question he asked of me. He asked:in how many cases has ... Mr Karim Kisrwani had contact with the minister and his office in relation to intervention?In responding to that request, I said:I have no say over who approaches me. The numbers of times that people approach me vary greatly. Some members of parliament never approach me. Others approach me on one or two occasions. Others approach me on tens of occasions. It is the same with migration agents and community representatives.In order to satisfy the request made by the member for Reid, who believes that some indicative answers I gave on a limited basis in relation to specific requests by members in specific time frames against specific categories where it was possible to ascertain a limited number of cases -  Opposition member - Can you qualify it any more than that? - No -  - I think the member should be aware of the volume of requests that have been made to me in relation to my intervention powers since I became minister in 1996. It is some 27,000 requests for intervention. Given the volume of requests I have received and the period of time covered, it would be a major task to isolate, collect and assemble the details sought by the member for Reid concerning contact with me and my office in relation to every request for possible intervention that has been made over that time frame and then to identify in how many cases we were successful. It has been the practice of successive governments over a long period of time not to authorise the expenditure of time and money involved in assembling information on a general basis, and I would not be prepared to authorise such expenditure.</DOC>

 - I am aware of Senator Bolkus's claim that writing out 494 raffle tickets was `an innocent mistake'. I am also aware that today Senator Nick Bolkus has lodged a new return with the Electoral Commission. Senator Bolkus's amended return claims that on 11 July 2001 he received $9,880 from Dante Tan's company, Universal Lionshare. On the very same day he gave $11,000 to the South Australian Labor Party. On AM this morning, Senator Bolkus claimed that this particular $9,880 payment `fell between the gap'. Yet last night on the Channel 10 news Dante Tan's business partner, John Hadchiti, said:And we said: `Can we donate without this going ... to say the whole world that we donated?' And he said - that is, Senator Bolkus - `Yeah, it can be done. You have to buy raffle tickets.'In other words, Senator Bolkus gave Dante Tan's business partner the way around the disclosure rules. Senator Bolkus's previous declaration to the Electoral Commission simply stated that he made an $11,000 donation to the South Australian Labor Party in September-October 2001. Of course, this was entirely consistent with Dante Tan's request for anonymity, but it was completely false and it demonstrates that Senator Bolkus was in it up to the neck in this attempt to evade the disclosure rules. And there is more.Two days ago, Senator Bolkus issued a press release in which he said that he had been involved in a number of major raffles for the Hindmarsh campaign in accordance with South Australian law. In South Australia, major raffles must have a licence. There is no record of any such raffle or any such licence being granted. If on the other hand it was just a minor lottery, a minor raffle, not requiring a licence, with prizes less than $2,000 but not less than 20 per cent of the face value of the tickets, then under those circumstances a $9,880 cash cheque would have bought Dante Tan 494 - or 99 per cent - of the theoretically possible 499 $20 tickets. You can just imagine Senator Bolkus writing out 494 tickets, can't you? He would probably get RSI. But somehow he cannot remember it. Writing out those tickets would be entirely consistent with Senator Bolkus's statement on AM this morning, in which he said:All I know is that my advice to them - that is to say, Dante Tan and Mr Hadchiti - was that there was a limit, in excess of that limit I checked for them, but my understanding was that they wouldn't be able to exceed that.This was not a raffle; this was a rort. There was only one winner of this raffle and that was the Australian Labor Party.A $9,880 cash cheque would have been designed, first, to avoid the money being traceable to Senator Bolkus and, second, to escape scrutiny under the financial transactions tracking requirements and quite possibly also to avoid the South Australian lottery licensing requirements. Clearly, this was not an innocent mistake; it was money laundering - pure and simple.If it was just an innocent mistake, why didn't Senator Bolkus tell his flatmate two weeks ago? Why didn't he tell his flatmate, the Leader of the Opposition, two weeks ago that he had received a significant amount of money from Dante Tan and failed to properly declare it? Since this story broke, Senator Bolkus has been the biggest fugitive since Dante Tan himself. The Leader of the Opposition should release Senator Bolkus from house arrest and make him come clean. Then we will see who is really going to get consumed in Dante's inferno.</DOC>

 - The fact is that I have studiously avoided any contact with Mr Kisrwani since these issues have been raised. I do not consider that it is incumbent upon me to undertake investigations of the sort that the member has alluded to.Let me just make one point: the question itself is based upon assumptions which are clearly flawed. I have outlined fully to the House the circumstances in which I was involved in this matter, the fraud that I believe may have been perpetrated in relation to the citizenship issue and the instructions I have given that that issue should be addressed by the department. The assumption on which the question is based is flawed.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hume for his question - a man who has come from a hardworking life as a meat processor, a meatworker, to be the Liberal member for Hume in the federal parliament. The Commonwealth government announced in the budget that in relation to the next three years of funding for the Australian National Training Authority it would be offering a 12.5 per cent increase, or $3.6 billion, to the states and territories - a 2.5 per cent real increase per annum for each year of those three years - requiring the states to match it with only a 1.5 per cent real increase over the three years of that agreement. The ANTA agreement principally is the mechanism through which the Commonwealth government funds and supports TAFE.I was asked about any other policies in relation to TAFE. I should advise the House, as the Treasurer has already ably done, that the New South Wales government issued its budget yesterday. TAFE and TAFE fees in particular featured very prominently. Just so that the House knows exactly what we are talking about here, 26 per cent - just over a quarter - of all of the students who attend TAFE come from the poorest socioeconomic suburbs in the country. In TAFE, fees have to be paid up front. It is compulsory up-front payment in TAFE; you pay the fee when you go to the TAFE. They will not let you in the door until you have paid it. In relation to TAFE, unlike HECS for universities, there is no loan provided by the Commonwealth or indeed by state and territory governments. In fact, many of those low-income families have to go along to banks and other lenders to see if they can get hold of the money.Yesterday, the New South Wales Labor government announced it had increased fees for 40 per cent of its students - that is 170,000 TAFE students in New South Wales - by up to 300 per cent. A building studies diploma has gone from $710 to $1,000; an electrical engineering diploma from $710 to $1,000; a meat processing diploma from $710 to $1,200; and a telecommunications engineering diploma from $710 to $1,650. They are compulsory up-front fees for which no loan is available. When the New South Wales Treasurer was asked to explain why this was occurring, this was the response, as reported in the Daily Telegraph today:A spokeswoman for the Minister said the changes also were made because wealthy students had been exploiting cheap courses.What needs to be highlighted here, apart from the extortion being perpetrated in New South Wales TAFE on some of the poorest and most vulnerable students from the poorest families in the country, is the rank hypocrisy of the Labor Party here in Canberra. Mr Speaker, if you go to the member for Jagajaga's web site, you will find a photograph of the member for Jagajaga with two dogs. One is called Fats and the other is called Billie. Yesterday morning, the member for Jagajaga was here in a crispy, cold Canberra, making the toast and brewing the coffee -  - So on this crispy, cold Canberra morning, Fats brings the Sydney Morning Herald to the member for Jagajaga. She opens it and, to her delight, sees that the -  - So she opens the Sydney Morning Herald to find to her great delight that there is a story that one university might be considering increasing its HECS charges to the maximum possible of 30 per cent. She phones the Leader of the Opposition and says, `I must do a press conference immediately.' Then, for the first time, she brings a matter of public importance on education -  - Yesterday, we had the member for Jagajaga and the Labor Party running around, doing press conferences and accusing the government of doing the wrong thing in relation to higher education with changes that had been argued to it by every one of the nation's 38 vice-chancellors of leading universities. Then, this morning, Billie brings the paper in, and he is wagging his tail very excitedly. She opens the Australian newspaper and finds this headline -  - What we find in this morning's papers, and especially in the Australian newspaper, is a headline that says `TAFE students face 300pc fee rises'. - Today we have had not one word from the federal Australian Labor Party condemning up to a 300 per cent increase in TAFE fees in the state of New South Wales, but we have heard -  - I thank the member for Batman for reminding me of his family. We have heard a lone voice. The Treasurer said that he was not aware of any voices speaking out from the Labor side. We have had a lone voice, a voice that more or less says, `Oh, brothers, where art thou?' We have had no-one other than Mr Andrew Ferguson, the state secretary of the CFMEU in New South Wales, who told ABC radio this morning: We've got very high levels of youth unemployment, in particular in Western Sydney, and we need a state government that works with employers to not slug them for TAFE fees for them doing the right thing.What the Labor Party need to remember is that the day that they start to focus as much, if not more, on meat workers, electrical fitters and people who are training to carry this country, instead of the member for Jagajaga asking one question without notice about these issues in 18 months - the day that it focuses on those people more than on double-income families with doctors, lawyers and dentists from the upper North Shore of Sydney, they might start to make some traction in the outer west.</DOC>

 - My 60th birthday was in March. A function was organised to celebrate my birthday, not by Mr Karim Kisrwani - Opposition member - He was there. - Yes, he was there. I cannot recall any matters being raised with me on that occasion. - I think that those who organised the event would have thought it quite offensive for matters of that sort to be raised on an occasion such as that.Opposition member - They weren't raised? - I do not recall any matters being raised. That is the point I am making. - I do make this point. I said, I think about three weeks ago, that community representatives were entitled to raise matters with me, and there are no limitations on people raising matters with me. But I did say that, if the opposition were minded to look at these matters, one might well restrict access to ministerial intervention to applicants only. What I found quite fascinating were the comments of the member for Lalor, the shadow minister, in relation to this matter. She said that I was playing politics over the issue.</DOC>

 - I am aware of repeated allegations - repeated scurrilous allegations - coming from the member for Reid and the member for Lalor concerning Mr Kisrwani. Let it be very clear that Mr Karim Kisrwani is a long-time friend of the member for Reid. That friendship has been torched by the member for Reid in a desperate attempt to launch a cheap smear campaign against the minister for immigration. Not only that - the member for Reid and the member for Lalor have engaged in what amounts to a campaign of racial vilification against Mr Kisrwani's community. - If it assists, I withdraw, Mr Speaker. - I have here a joint reference for Mr Karim Kisrwani and Mr Safwat Arfan-Sayed. This reference says:I am supportive, due to the active leadership of Karim Kisrwani and Mr Sayed in this grouping. Both of these gentlemen - that is to say, Mr Kisrwani and Mr Sayed - have displayed ceaseless activity for the Lebanese and broader Arabic population of my region. Additionally, they are widely respected in their professional careers. The proponents - that is to say, Mr Kisrwani and Mr Sayed - have the history, contacts, experience and analysis to make a very real impact, and I endorse their initiative.This reference was not written 10 years ago; it was written on 30 September last year, and it was not written by Philip Ruddock. It was written by Laurie Ferguson, the member for Reid. There is more. The member for Reid now says that Karim Kisrwani is `no friend of mine'. Let me quote from this letter, addressed `Dear Karim':I write to thank you very much for your donation of $300 to my campaign.This letter on parliamentary letterhead says:Your support is very valuable to me - very valuable indeed, so it seems - and I will endeavour to continue to uphold the Labor principles for the people I represent in this electorate.The great Labor principle that the member for Reid is currently upholding is ratting on his mates when it suits him in a good cause.Yesterday I told the House that the member for Reid had asked for Mr Kisrwani's help to stack branches in order to support Mr David Borger's preselection and that someone else - someone other than these stackers - had paid their membership fees. The member for Reid came into the parliament and made a personal explanation denying what I said. Since that personal explanation, I have sought corroboration and I have got it. I have here the words of Mr Ahmed El Dirani, who says:In late October 2001 I received a phone call from my friend Karim Kisrwani ... if I can arrange another two people with me to assist the ex Lord Mayor of Parramatta David Borger by request from Laurie Ferguson, MP for Reid.It goes on to say:I or my brother never paid any membership fees. It was paid on our behalf: $37 per person.Mr Speaker, it is not just Senator Bolkus who is living on another planet; the member for Reid is living on another planet. I suppose you can hardly blame the member for Reid. Let us face it: no less an authority than the member for Werriwa has said that the Fergusons have been disconnected from reality for quite some time. The member for Werriwa has also accused the member for Reid of being a chronic branch stacker.  - Thank you, Mr Speaker. Let me say that there is a moral in this tale. The moral is that members opposite should give up this futile pursuit of the minister for immigration, for which they have no evidence whatsoever. There is an abundance of evidence of wrongdoing by the member for Reid and others, and no evidence whatsoever of any wrongdoing by the minister for immigration.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Herbert for his question. His advocacy for James Cook University is matched only by his advocacy for defence personnel in his electorate. The James Cook University will benefit substantially from the government's $1.5 billion transformational reform package for higher education, as will all regional universities. Apart from a 7½ per cent increase in its core Commonwealth grants, it will also get a 7½ per cent extra loading for Townsville, Mount Isa, Mackay and Cairns campuses and will be able to access additional places in nurses and teaching, increased funding for the training of nurses and teachers, and 25,000 scholarships to support students in educational costs and, for regional and rural students, to support their accommodation costs. It will also be able to access a $138 million learning and teaching performance pool and a whole variety of government initiatives which include support for low-income students and Indigenous students. As has been said by Eric Wainwright, an official from James Cook University, in the Cairns Post on 27 May: If the proposed changes go through parliament, access to university education in Far North Queensland is likely to be improved overall. James Cook University, he said, will be a beneficiary of the extra funding proposed for regional universities, particularly that proposed for nursing and teaching education, so much needed in far North Queensland.Today the alternative policy, if you could describe it as a policy, is one of obstruction and obfuscation from the Australian Labor Party, adding to the Treasurer's very long list of things that the Labor Party is doing to hold back Australia's economic and social development. Having refused to participate in a year-long review of higher education, which included not just universities and the business community but also unions and students and a whole variety of people, including regional communities, the member for Jagajaga stood up at the Sydney Town Hall five days before the federal budget and announced to union officials and a few friends that she would be opposing, before they were even announced, the government's reforms to higher education. Now Labor have announced that they want a Senate inquiry which will finish at the end of November. The Australian newspaper today reported that: ... the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee described Labor's move as 'pointless' last night and said it would endanger federal funding and deprive students of the time to make course selections.The AVCC believed there was 'no point at all in putting it to yet another Senate review', executive officer John Mullarvey said.What is it about the Labor Party that has enabled it in the space of 18 months to alienate a group of people who traditionally were seen to be essentially supportive of Labor Party largesse? That takes a lot of skill, and one would wonder who might be responsible for it. Finally, as Professor Gerard Sutton, Vice-Chancellor of the University of Wollongong, told the Bulletin magazine last week: Labor is quite wrong. My view is that overall the package is a strong positive for universities; $1.5 bn of new money in the sector is a substantial increase in anybody's language. I would have hoped that Labor would be prepared to negotiate on it because, if this package goes down in the Senate, then universities will be facing a genuine crisis.That is Professor Gerard Sutton, Vice-Chancellor of the University of Wollongong. Every person on the Labor Party side should reflect long and hard about his or her contribution to the future of this country and either get out of the road or get on the bus.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Boothby for his question and take the opportunity of reminding the House that, when I met President Bush in the United States last month, we both agreed to conclude the negotiation towards a free trade agreement between Australia and the United States by the end of this year. That is a very ambitious timetable but it reflects the very strong commitment of both the Australian government and the Bush administration to concluding such an agreement. A high-quality free trade agreement between Australia and the world's largest and strongest economy will be of unqualified benefit to this country in the years ahead.I was reminded of just how valuable a free trade agreement would be when I read yesterday a paper prepared by Stephen Roach, the chief economist of the New York based bank Morgan Stanley. He made the point that since 1995 the world has had only one real engine of economic growth, and that has been the United States. He pointed out that, over the seven-year period ending in 2001, the US economy accounted for fully 63 per cent of the cumulative increase in world GDP while over the same period of time the European Union - a region of comparable size to the United States - accounted for only eight per cent of the increase in world GDP. So over that period of time 63 per cent of the growth in world GDP was accounted for by the United States while Europe, by contrast, accounted for only eight per cent but is of comparable size.This is the market - this is the opportunity - that the federal Labor Party would apparently deny Australia. It is the policy of the federal Labor Party, as articulated by the member for Rankin, not to sign a free trade agreement with the United States. I cannot think of anything more calculated to deny this country an opportunity of being part of the fastest growing economic entity in the world - the one that, more rather than less, will bulk large in the future of this country.What the member for Rankin is saying is in stark contrast to what some successful Labor people in Australia are saying. For example, the Premier of New South Wales has said, `It is in Australia's interest to link ourselves with the world's most dynamic and creative economy.' The Premier of South Australia has said, `An FTA would give us access to 280 million customers.' The Premier of Victoria recognises potential benefits for the Victorian economy through increased access to markets and improved investment flows. And the Premier of Queensland has said, `An FTA could be the most momentous boost for our primary industries in 100 years.'Those are the words of successful Labor leaders. By contrast, those who represent the Australian Labor Party in this place are so ignorant of, and indifferent to, the opportunities for the Australian economy that they set their faces against this opportunity. The government will continue to negotiate to achieve a free trade agreement. If we can achieve it on proper terms, it will do more than any other single act to underwrite the economic future and economic security of this nation well into the 21st century.</DOC>

 - After this issue was raised yesterday, I said I would follow it up. As I advised the House yesterday, my 60th birthday was in March this year. - You are obviously not listening carefully, are you?An opposition member - He's not speaking up. - I did attend a function at the Rimal Restaurant at Brighton-le-Sands on 14 April 2003. It was arranged as a surprise but belated birthday celebration - as I said yesterday, not by Mr Kisrwani. In attendance, as I recall, there were approximately 100 people: a former premier, three bishops, community leaders, a consul-general and a large number, I believe, of both Liberal and Labor supporters. The organisers of the function made it clear that there were no immigration issues to be raised. Again, as I advised the House yesterday, I do not recall any immigration cases being raised with me at the function. My office has confirmed that no matters were brought to it following the function. As with the other matters that the opposition have raised over the last three weeks, their assertions have been, sadly, astray. Further, I did not instruct any member of my staff to attend a follow-up meeting, nor was there any such meeting involving my staff a week later in the meeting hall of the Lebanese Christian Community in Punch-bowl. I know of no body known as the Lebanese Christian Community. I do know that the Australian Lebanese Christian Federation is located at Punchbowl. This federation is a community settlement service scheme fun-ded body, funded by the department to offer settlement services to the Arabic-speaking community. For completeness, I should advise the House that I do have representations from the Australian Lebanese Christian Federation, and from time to time they are in touch with my office - as are representatives of most other like bodies. On one occasion, departmental liaison officers from my office have visited the premises of the federation, and that was on 18 February 2003 - two months before the birthday function. In discussions with federation representatives on that day, some eight immigration matters were raised with departmental officers. Four related to my intervention powers, in one I have declined to intervene, and three are currently under consideration. None has been acceded to by me - not, as alleged, 25. The other matters were various immigration cases being processed routinely by my department against standard legislative criteria. While it is clear that that meeting had nothing to do with the function in April, I think it was important to reiterate what I advised the House yesterday. It would not be unusual for me to ask my office, in relation to matters that have been raised with me, to follow up those matters with those who make inquiries. It would not be unusual or unexpected. I think anybody dealing with me or my office would expect that inquiries would be properly dealt with by departmental liaison officers in the office; to do otherwise would be an abrogation of my responsibilities.</DOC>

 - The Leader of the Opposition in Queensland would in no way adopt the Labor Party's policy on Telstra, which is to completely and absolutely ignore bush services. Based on their historical performance, they would be far more interested in closing down things like mobile services than they ever would be in ensuring that country people had a fair go.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Hinkler for his question. As his constituents and others around rural Australia would know, no-one has fought harder, and fights harder, than he does for the government's objective of ensuring that country people have access to the telecommunications services that they need - and that they have them in the future, because that is what we are determined to do. Securing the future of regional telecommunications comes in three parts. First, we will spend $140 million - which is quite a bit of money - on a national broadband strategy both to provide affordable access to broadband and stimulate the take-up of broadband. Second, we will impose a licence condition on Telstra that it maintains a local presence in regional Australia, and it will lay down parameters that Telstra has to fulfil to meet that requirement - tough conditions. This will be in addition to the licence conditions and other requirements already imposed by the government on Telstra and on other suppliers. Third, the adequacy of telecommunications services will be under continuing review. The Besley and Estens inquiries are not the end of the government's surveillance of regional telecommunications; they are the beginning. We will include in legislation a requirement for ongoing, regular and independent reviews of regional telecommunications, and ensure that important new services are being delivered equitably in these areas. These reviews will not only have to be tabled in the parliament; this government and future governments - unless they are going to say they do not believe in future-proofing and walk away from it, and go back to where they were before and never move to insist on an improvement in bush services and unwind our commitments - will be obliged to respond publicly to the findings of those reviews. Under this government's plan, Telstra cannot walk away from regional Australia, because if it tried to it would lose its licence to operate in the cities as well. That is what would happen. Under the government's plan, no government will be able to simply forget about regional telecommunications - as Labor did for so long - because, if they try, their abrogation will be publicly exposed and they will be obliged to address it. Mr Speaker, that is how you secure the future of regional telecommunications. First you close the gap in services, then you legislate and regulate so the gaps cannot reopen and finally, and very importantly, you foster competition to drive down the price and drive up service variety.It is interesting to note that thousands of schoolchildren in remote New South Wales and the Northern Territory are doing their schooling at home through School of the Air, and they are getting used to their new computerised real-time classroom. They have traded in their 50-year-old two-way radios for the latest two-way satellite technology. In western New South Wales - in Narromine, Bourke, Cobar, Gulgong, Lightning Ridge, Nyngan, Trangie and Warren - people are getting used to their new GSM mobile phone services. But do you know what, Mr Speaker? Telstra did not provide them; Optus did - the competition which is out there because there is a bob to be made, an opportunity to be exploited. That produces good outcomes in regional Australia - not because the government forced them but because there was an opportunity there to be met. That is a very important point.I have been asked whether there are any alternative policies. I can tell you that, when it comes to telecommunications standards, there certainly are not any that would encourage rural people to vote for Labor. All we hear is the repetition of a mantra that is never explained. They never explain how government ownership of Telstra will guarantee services, because they know the claim cannot be justified. It does not stand up. The fact is that governments have the power to ensure service outcomes. I hear from the opposition the idea that the poor little federal government would be frightened by a telco. What do they think the federal government is? They know full well - and the opposition spokesman for telecommunications acknowledged this on radio in Melbourne the other day; you acknowledged it, old chap - that the government has the power. You know it has the power. Let us have some integrity in this debate, and let us have the debate. </DOC>

 - To start with, in reply to the member for Lowe I reject completely the depiction of the government's media legislation contained in the first part of the question. As to the second part of the question, I am not aware of the remarks of the member for Calare. Thirdly, I have, since they were introduced, regarded the present media laws as ill conceived. They were designed largely to smash the power of the then Melbourne Herald group because it was seen as unsympathetic to the former government. It was also directed to reducing a lot of the power of the then Macquarie network and Fairfax group, which was far more extensive in the 1980s than it is now. The legislation was conceived on the basis of the blind hostility of the then Treasurer to the attitude of newspapers. It ill becomes somebody who comes from the same kidney of the Australian Labor Party as that particular individual to be accusing the government of some kind of attitude towards media proprietors.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I can tell him, as the government announced in its budget, that -  - after funding our commitments in Iraq, after funding investment in higher education and in health, after making assistance available to those who are affected by drought, the government is able to, and will from Tuesday of next week, reduce income tax for every Australian income tax payer.As we have watched the states bring down their budgets since then, we have seen eight state Labor governments increase taxes. Between them, we have seen a new levy on electricity bills in Queensland, a new levy on water bills in South Australia and a new levy on insurance in Western Australia. In Victoria, we saw 300 fees and taxes increased, and tolls on the Scoresby Freeway. We have watched the federal Labor Party sit silently through all of this, turn their backs and try to pretend they do not even know it is happening.Have we heard the member for Hotham on the subject of tolls on the Scoresby Freeway? If he ever goes out to the electorate of Hotham, he will find that nearby is a road reserved to go from Ringwood down to Frankston. During the last election, he launched Labor's policy for a freeway. Now the Bracks government has turned it into a tollway. Have we heard a whimper or a complaint?We have come to the last day of this budget session. I could have sworn, when the Labor Party was putting its rhetoric out, that somehow it was going to stand for lower taxation; I could have sworn that two months ago. In fact, we even had statements to that effect. I wondered, after the eight state Labor governments had increased taxes, what the commitment of federal Labor was to lower taxes. I decided I would go back to the Australian candidate study 2001, which is a confidential questionnaire of all of the candidates that took part in the 2001 election. They were asked a question, C3 - this is on the public record -  - It is confidential. It aggregates the outcome. It does not actually have the names. When candidates were asked whether they supported, mildly or strongly, reducing taxes, among the Liberal Party and National Party 65 per cent said they were mildly or strongly in favour of reducing taxes. - Right on cue, the member for Werriwa comes in. When the Australian Labor Party candidates were asked whether they were mildly or strongly in favour of reducing taxes, do you know the percentage that were in favour? Three per cent. Three per cent of the Labor candidates in 2001 were mildly or strongly in favour of reducing taxes. We have done an analysis. Sitting on the other side of the House are 64 Labor members, three per cent of whom are in favour of lower taxes, which means there are two Labor members sitting opposite who are in favour of lower taxes. -  - They may have three roosters, but two members are in favour of lower taxes. I am going to start a competition to try and identify the dirty secret of those two members. Which of you there supports lower taxes? Two. No wonder the Labor Party has gone quiet on lower taxes. The same question had something like 17 per cent of Labor members mildly in support of spending more and 68 per cent strongly supporting bigger government spending - a return rate of 85 per cent. So do not listen to what they say; look at what they do. Labor is, and always has been, the party of higher tax, and we conclude this session by outing the fact that 97 per cent of those sitting on the other side would like government taxes to go higher, not lower.</DOC>

 - I made it very clear yesterday that, in relation to the information I have provided to the House before about representations made to me, it was indicative and not exhaustive. In other words, I do not know, not having searched every file of the 27,000 where representations have been made, that the member for Reid has not been involved in it. - No, it was indicative. We might be able to give indicative information but, if you ask me a question which asks precisely for the number of occasions on which Mr Kisrwani has made representations to me or my office, it will require an examination of 27,000 files to be able to provide that information. What I said was very clear. I am not prepared to authorise an examination of 27,000 files in order to provide answers to what is clearly a fishing expedition on the part of the opposition.</DOC>

 - I am aware of continuing allegations against Mr Karim Kisrwani. Mr Kisrwani was a long-time friend of the member for Reid and a long-term donor to the member for Reid's conference. Yesterday I quoted a letter from the member for Reid to Mr Kisrwani acknowledging a $300 donation in 2001. Last night the member for Reid admitted a similar donation in 1999. I have here a letter on parliamentary letterhead of 25 September 1998. It says:Dear Karim, I write to thank you very much for your very generous donation of $250 to my campaign.The letter goes on:Your support and close association with my office is very valuable to me.Mr Kisrwani has also been conscripted by the member for Reid in the member for Reid's branch stacking activities. It turned out that Mr El Dirani was not just a single branch stacker. He was part of a group of 20 branch stackers brought along to a meeting to help David Borger.  - A question was put to Mr El Dirani by the Age newspaper. He was asked if it was Mr Kisrwani, Mr Ferguson and Mr Borger who paid the memberships. Mr El Dirani said, `One of them.' - And now the member for Reid is trying to smear Mr El Dirani by suggesting that in some way what he said was tainted. Let us look at the quality of the statements made by the member for Reid. The member for Reid told the parliament, in a personal explanation the day before yesterday: Mr El Dirani `resides in the Prime Minister's electorate and not in the Parramatta electorate'. That is correct at the moment but in 1999, when he joined the ALP, Mr El Dirani was enrolled in Parramatta. He was on the electoral roll in Parramatta. Referring to Mr El Dirani, the member for Reid said in his personal explanation:He continues to hold head office membership, entitling him to no voting rights whatsoever in ALP preselections.I have here a copy of Mr El Dirani's membership application, stamped by the head office of the Australian Labor Party in Sussex Street, stating that Mr El Dirani is in the Parramatta SEC. In fact, contrary to the statement to this parliament by the member for Reid, I believe that Mr El Dirani is in the Oatlands branch in the Parramatta area. Further, the member for Reid said to this parliament:The reality is that this person has paid membership fees from his credit card for a number of years.I have this membership application and there is no record of any credit card payment. - The point is: who paid Mr El Dirani's membership fees? Who paid his joining fees? I have the application to join and there is no credit card payment. The question is: just who did pay for this particular stacker to join the Australian Labor Party? I table the document so that the member for Reid can study it more closely. There is an issue here for the Leader of the Opposition. What we have seen over the last few days is that the member for Reid - this parliamentary PC clod; the Inspector Clouseau of forensic analysis - has completely derailed the Labor Party's attack on the minister for immigration, and he has burnt off the Lebanese community. - Not only that, the member for Reid has ended up drawing attention yet again to Labor branch stacking activities in Western Sydney - activities that the Leader of the Opposition says must cease. But what could we expect from the member for Reid? Let us face what the member for Werriwa has said, admittedly in a different context:Laurie Ferguson has again demonstrated why he is one of the great embarrassments. His letter ... is a rambling mess. The only reason he is in Parliament is his father had the numbers in Granville. The only reason he is on the frontbench is his brother had the numbers in the Left. ... If the Fergusons were listed on the stock market it would be under the trading name, Nepotism Inc. ...	...	...Laurie's political ability was fully exposed during the last campaign. It is an embarrassment to the Labor movement to think of him as a future minister.The Leader of the Opposition is now contemplating a reshuffle. I put it to the Leader of the Opposition that he must drop the member for Reid from his frontbench, first of all, for incompetence and, second, for misleading the parliament. - I quoted from this document. - This document is not confidential. It is an article from the Sydney Morning Herald, and I table it.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Farrer for her question and compliment her on her continuing interest in and support for the government's Tough on Drugs campaign. Today, as many members will know, has been declared the International Day against Drugs Abuse and Illicit Trafficking. The Global illicit drug trends 2003report released overnight by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime has some very interesting things to say about these matters within Australia. That report confirms that, in relation to Australia, law enforcement efforts have been very successful in dismantling heroin trafficking; that more treatment services are available to help those with a drug problem; and that there has been a significant decrease - and this is the most important finding of all - in the use of heroin in Australia and, as a result, the number of heroin overdose deaths has fallen significantly. The report properly goes on to say that vigilance against any regression in these areas is needed.I think it is a matter of significant achieve-ment that this report confirms that the objectives of the government's Tough on Drugs campaign are steadily being realised. Contrary to the doomsayers, we are making progress - albeit slow progress but nonetheless progress - in the long and hard fight against the terrible scourge of illicit drug abuse in this country. When we introduced the Tough on Drugs campaign in 1998, we had three objectives: we wanted to strengthen law enforcement, we wanted to educate young people against starting drug use in the first place and we wanted to provide alternative treatment for people who wanted to break the habit. We have now invested close to $1 billion in this campaign. What this report demonstrates is that, despite the people who said that a zero tolerance approach would not work, that approach is working: it is making inroads, it is reducing the number of people who die from heroin overdoses, it is resulting in people getting better treatment and it is resulting in record seizures of heroin. For those who care about the future of young people in this country, there is no more important fight than the fight against the scourge of drugs. This government will continue the policy that it has followed over the last seven years. It will continue to invest resources in fighting the drug tsars, it will continue to revive alternative treatment, it will continue to work with state governments - and I thank them for their cooperation in relation to diversion programs - and it will continue to educate the young based on the philosophy of zero tolerance and encouraging people not to commence drug use in the first place. We still have significant challenges. There is an unwelcome rise in the use of amphetamines and ecstasy and, although the use of cannabis has declined, its use is still far too high. Let me, on the subject of cannabis, congratulate the New South Wales government for having started a radio campaign warning young people about the deleterious effects of cannabis use. There used to be a stupid notion around in this country that you could use cannabis with no damage and with no potential ill effects in the years ahead - that has now been conclusively disproved. It is not only a massive contributor to depression and suicide but it is also a drug whose use will lead to the use of harder drugs. This is the last question time of this sitting, and I cannot think of a more important social note on which to end than to re-declare and reconfirm the absolute determination of this government to continue quite unconditionally its Tough on Drugs campaign.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Gilmore for her question. Overnight, Dante Tan's business partner, Mr John Hadchiti, has given a full account of the pair's business relationship with Senator Bolkus. Last night, Mr Hadchiti said:My partner Dante Tan basically said he doesn't want it publicised, so can we contribute something where we don't have to stand in the middle of George and Pitt Street, Sydney, and can it be done? And then Mr Nick Bolkus said, `You can buy raffle tickets.' The question of a big donation came about and Senator Bolkus said, `Thank you very much.' A cheque was handed over on the basis that it went to raffles - and he said, `Thank you very much.' That was what Mr Dante Tan's business partner said yesterday. He was asked whether Dante Tan was interested in winning a prize. Dante Tan's business partner said, `No, because the prize from the Labor Party in my opinion could have been a picture of Bob Hawke or a picture of Gough Whitlam, a portrait of some sort - we don't want it.' This raffle was a ruse; this raffle was nothing but a rort for laundering money to the Australian Labor Party.  - The other day Senator Bolkus said that he was involved in major fundraising raffles for the Hindmarsh campaign. Yesterday, the South Australian State Secretary of the Australian Labor Party said that he could not recall any raffle. Senator Penny Wong, who was the Hindmarsh campaign director, said she could not recall any raffle. Steve Georganas, who was the Hindmarsh candidate and a former Bolkus staffer, said that he could not recall any raffle. In fact, the only people who could recall any raffle at all were Senator Bolkus, who could not recall it when he filled out his political disclosure, and Dante Tan's business partner, who did not want it to be a raffle - he just wanted to give $10,000 to Senator Bolkus.If Senator Bolkus had really written out 494 twenty-dollar raffle tickets, why couldn't he remember that when he filled out his disclosures? If he has had to fill out a revised political disclosure, has he also had to fill out a revised taxation return? This is the ultimate phantom raffle. There was no prize; there was no ticket and there was no winner - except the Australian Labor Party. I said yesterday that, since this story broke, Senator Bolkus has been Australia's greatest fugitive after Dante Tan himself. I was wrong. Australia's greatest fugitive is Senator Bolkus's flatmate, the Leader of the Opposition -  - I was simply making the point that normally you cannot turn the radio on without hearing the Leader of the Opposition carping and snarling about some -  - It is important that we get to the bottom of the great raffle rort. It is important not just that Senator Bolkus come out of protective custody but also that the Leader of the Opposition let himself out of house arrest and come clean about Labor's money-laundering scandal. I looked up in the dictionary today the collective noun for `turkeys'. The collective noun for `turkeys' is `raffle' - a raffle of turkeys.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Curtin for her question. I know that, along with all of the members on this side of the House, she is delighted with the role this government played in overthrowing the barbarous regime of Saddam Hussein. The demise of Saddam Hussein's regime not only was a military victory for the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia but also was a momentous victory for the people of Iraq - people who will no longer be subjected to state-run torture, rape, detention without trial, summary execution and other grotesque human rights violations.During Saddam Hussein's rule, there was only one political party, the Baath Party, and membership of other political parties was punishable by death. Political parties in Iraq have now multiplied, with many new groupings - such as the National Democratic Movement, the Independent Democratic Movement and even the Constitutional Monarchists - emerging since the downfall of the regime. Saddam's regime systematically killed senior Shiite clerics, it desecrated holy sites, it interfered with religious education and it prevented Shiite adherents from performing their religious rites. The Shiite are now free to practise their religion, illustrated by the celebrations in April of the first Shiite pilgrimage for several decades - an event which of course had previously been banned by the regime of Saddam Hussein.In Saddam's day, the media in Iraq was very tightly controlled. Today there is unlimited access in Iraq to foreign satellite broadcasts, and about 90 newspapers are operating freely. Economic freedom for Iraqis has been facilitated by the transition from a centrally planned economy to the liberal market system. There has also of course been the lifting of sanctions against Iraq, which in itself was enormously beneficial. The House may also be interested to know that tariffs have been removed on imports - a dispensation that will remain in place until 31 December. That will, obviously, increase the availability of consumer items and it will make those items available at cheaper prices than would otherwise be the case. Services in Iraq are also improving. The honourable member would no doubt be aware that, in Iraq, electricity is now more available to more Iraqis than was the case before the war started earlier this year.Having said all this, despite the greater political, religious and economic freedoms we have no illusions about the challenges that lie ahead in Iraq - they are obviously very substantial. There are still sympathisers of the former Baathist dictatorship who are determined to attack coalition forces and also Iraqis. From our side of the House, the government, we very warmly welcome the growing international role in helping with the rehabilitation of Iraq. This week over 50 countries committed themselves to holding a major donor conference in Iraq in October this year and - this is an important statistic - some 40 countries are expected to send troops to support the coalition-led stabilisation force in Iraq.The transition from the barbaric dictatorship of Saddam Hussein to a more liberal Iraq is not only something that we on this side of the House welcome but also something which, most importantly, is warmly welcomed by the people of Iraq. I say again what I said yesterday: never will our pride diminish in the role we played in liberating the people of Iraq.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for the question. The question that was asked of me - in fact there were several questions asked of me - related specifically to a shipment coming from Brazil. The meeting I had with Mr Honan on 1 August did not relate to that issue. I do not believe therefore that I have misled the House, and I reject the allegation that has been made. All of the questions that I answered in this series of questions were in the context of the shipment by the company, Trafigura. I would remind the Leader of the Opposition that the series of questions commenced with a question asked of the Treasurer by the member for Fraser, and it said as follows: My question is to the Treasurer and concerns last week's government announcements concerning the ethanol excise. Treasurer, can you confirm that Trafigura Fuels Australia's contract to import ethanol was excise free when it was signed?Then there was a question asked of me by the member for Chisholm, Anna Burke, which said:My question is to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, was the government contacted by the major Australian producer of ethanol or by any representative of his company or the industry association before its decision to impose fuel excise on ethanol? If so, when? Was the government urged to take action to prevent Trafigura Fuels Australia ...All of these questions were in the context of the importation of that shipment from Brazil by Trafigura. They are all in that context, and it was in that context that I gave the answer that I did. I do not believe therefore that I have misled the parliament because, when I was asked these questions, I did not know of Trafigura's importation nor, indeed, is it my understanding that Mr Honan knew of it. As evidence of that, on 28 August, Mr Honan wrote to me drawing attention to this shipment and arguing that a certain course of action be followed. In fact, I disclosed the existence of that letter during the series of questions I answered, so I reject the claim made by the Leader of the Opposition.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kooyong. I know that all members of the House would have been distressed at the bombing outside the Marriott Hotel in Jakarta last week. I took the opportunity the following day to speak to President Megawati to convey, on behalf of all Australians, not only our condolences at the loss of life but also the renewed determination and willingness of the Australian government and the Australian people to work as closely as possible with the government and the people of Indonesia to strengthen the joint effort to oppose terrorism in our region. I am happy to say that not only were there officers of the Australian Federal Police on the ground in Jakarta ready to offer assistance but we were able to send additional police officers the following day, particularly police officers very skilled in crime scene investigation work. The AFP continues to work very closely with the Indonesian police and a specialist team has already started forensic work at the bomb site. It should be remembered by all members of this House that the overwhelming majority of those who died in this atrocity were Indonesian citizens and people of the Islamic faith. It totally repudiates the obscene claim made by the terrorists that, in launching terrorist attacks, they are avenging their Muslim brothers. In reality on this occasion, as on so many occasions, they have not avenged their Muslim brothers; they have killed their Muslim brothers and sisters. It is a reminder that terrorism is as repugnant to the basic tenets and instincts of Islam as it is to the instincts of Christianity and Judaism and, indeed, to the civilised values of people who hold no particular religious belief. It continues therefore to unite all of us in a common moral crusade against terrorism and that crusade has to be backed with strong cooperative action. It has to be backed with continued strong support for our intelligence agencies and cooperative action between the agencies of the countries in our region. Intelligence and information sharing are crucial and Australia's network of bilateral memoranda of understanding on counter-terrorism attests to this.The foreign minister is already working with Indonesia to arrange a regional ministerial conference on these matters, and I will have the opportunity of discussing these issues not only at the Pacific Island Forum later this week but also at the APEC leaders meeting in Thailand in October. The attack in Indonesia last week reminds us that terrorism is very much a grim reality of modern life. The fight against terrorism will go on for years, and it will require not only the combined cooperation and commitment of the agencies of our nation but also the cooperative efforts of the agencies of our nation and many others in our region. </DOC>

I did not know anything about the shipment from Brazil when these questions were asked nor, apparently, did Mr Honan.

 - I thank the honourable member for Eden-Monaro for his question and I acknowledge the wonderful work that he is doing in relation to the bushfire inquiry. Can I also inform him that the Australian economy continues to grow notwithstanding a very difficult international situation, as confirmed by the Reserve Bank's statement on monetary policy released today, which begins by saying:The year to date has been marked by a contrast between a disappointing global environment and a resilient domestic economy.As the statement points out, the average growth in G7 countries in 2003 is about 1½ per cent and in Australia, although the economy has slowed as forecast in the current financial year, the growth rate of around three per cent is double the G7 average. That has been also at a time when Australia has gone through the worst drought ever recorded. Normally a US recession would bring on an Australian recession and normally a drought would bring on an Australian recession. To have both together and to have the Australian economy continuing to grow, albeit at below trend, shows how resilient the Australian economy has been in the last year. One of the things that have underpinned that is the strong fiscal position that this government has put Australia into. This government has now delivered five budget surpluses, which are more budget surpluses than any government since at least the Whitlam era, and is budgeting for a sixth in the current financial year, unlike the United States, the UK, France, Germany, Japan or, indeed, most of the rest of the world.We have noted comments emanating from the opposition that they may now be coming around to the view of changing their policy and supporting the government in running a strong fiscal policy. Every now and then you come across a little gem of policy, and there was a little gem of policy from the new spokesman for the opposition, Mr Latham, in the WeekendAustralian on 2 August:On his core strategy Latham is clear - Labor is 'the party of fiscal rigour', unlike the Howard Government. It is the party of the budget surplus, not deficit.Well, the Labor Party delivered $80 billion in deficits and the coalition has delivered five budget surpluses and that made Labor the party of the surplus and the coalition the party of weak fiscal rigour! Every now and then when people say politics is not entertaining, you read something from the shadow Treasurer - `Labor is the party of fiscal rigour'. If Labor wants to demonstrate its conversion to the party of fiscal rigour, here is the first test: pass the government's PBS measures. The government's PBS measures are worth $1.3 billion of savings. They have been rejected twice in the Senate. A demonstration of the fiscal rigour of the Australian Labor Party would be the ability of the member for Werriwa to overturn the decisions of those that he now attacks for being fiscally profligate and to support the PBS measures in the Senate. That would be a start. Let me give a few other ideas: Labor's coastguard - $600 million unfunded; Labor's higher education policy that the shadow minister put - another $300 million black hole; Labor's health policy - a billion dollars of new spending, and it was described by the opposition leader on 19 May in these terms: As for the billion dollars - he said on 2UE - some of it comes off the surplus, some $500 million over the course of four years.So we have got health policy, which is $500 million; we have got blocked measures of $1.3 billion; we have got a coastguard at $600 million and we have got higher education at $300 million - and that makes Labor the party of fiscal rigour! If there is any decency that is to come from the opposition on these measures, the opposition would pass those PBS measures immediately. Labor is running around like a drunken sailor looking for a taxicab in Sydney on a Saturday night with measures to spend, at last count - unfunded - over $2 billion; over $2 billion and heading northwards.</DOC>

 - In answer to the Leader of the Opposition, `this issue' to which I am referring is the decision which was made and announced on 12 September by me, which triggered this series of questions in parliament, which of course was based on the pending importation of the shipment from Brazil. -  - The chain is very simple. -  - On 12 September we announced certain arrangements which withdrew the excise exemption and introduced a production subsidy, and the pattern of the package of questions that began to be asked on 17 September sought to draw a link between that decision and some allegedly improper support for the Manildra company. The big revelation that the Labor Party is talking about was a meeting between me and Mr Honan on 1 August. - Of course it did, and that actually goes to the very nub of the issue because the answers I gave about not discussing this issue with Mr Honan were based on the fact that we did not discuss that issue, because, as the Leader of the Opposition helpfully interjects, neither of us knew about it. Therefore, we could not have discussed it.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. It was only a little over two years ago that the coalition government thoroughly examined Sydney's airport needs. It was a pretty exhausting process. We came to the conclusion that building white elephants at that point of time was in no-one's interests because Sydney airport would clearly be able to handle the air traffic demand for many years to come. That was a good sound policy decision. It has proven to be even more durable than I could have imagined because of changing technology and better management practices. More people travelling on fewer aircraft and a whole range of other management practices have meant that, even within the very real and remaining constraints that we put in place - LTOP, the curfew and so forth - to ensure that nobody is too badly disadvantaged or affected by noise, our judgment has been confirmed as appropriate. We have said that we will review it in 2005, but even that review looks to me as though it is many years premature.I am asked about proposals to restart the search for a second Sydney airport site. For reasons that are inexplicable in policy terms and pretty hard to understand, I have to say, in political terms, the Leader of the Opposition has said that Labor will build a second airport and has reopened the whole debate. The shadow minister for transport, interestingly, has said that Labor is looking at `a variety of options,' but he will not tell anyone where they are. This is just not good enough. The opposition have to come clean on the secret undisclosed locations they are considering. We have to know where they are. There are a couple floating around -  - There we are! There is one. Which one is that? One shadow minister has proposed Wilton or Darkes Forest. Let me go to Wilton, which is near Wollongong. Depending on the runway alignment, aircraft could fly directly over Wollongong and create a significant level of noise for communities such as Picton and Wilton. Eighty-six per cent of the Wilton site is in the catchment for Sydney's water supply. But Labor has raised it explicitly as an option, despite that problem of water contamination, which is why we did not look at it again. Labor has also proposed Darkes Forest, which is off the Princes Highway, as a possibility. An airport there would create enormous noise problems for people living in Bulli, Thirroul and Coledale. I wonder what they think of that proposal. But it also ought to be noted that, for a lot of the year, it could not be used anyway. It is subject to fogs that can last for more than a day; it is much more of a problem there than it is in Canberra. It is also affected by windshear and turbulence.One way or another, I think members of the House would understand that there are not many potential sites in the Sydney basin that I have not heard of. I want to say to the Labor Party that there are residents in a whole lot of areas who want to know what this variety of locations that the shadow minister for transport is thinking about might be. The residents of Canberra, Newcastle, Goulburn, Warnervale, Somersby, Scheyville, Londonderry, Bringelly, Galston, Duffys Forest, Richmond and Windsor might like to know. All of them have a right to know if it is their backyard in which Labor's secret proposal is to be located.Labor refloating this at this time, when it is obvious it is not needed, demonstrates that they are incapable of making good policy. Firstly, they are planning to impose a second airport on the city with all its costs. It would be a white elephant. The international experience plainly says that, if you build on these things before they are needed, no-one is going to use it and nobody is going to go there. We do not need it, so it is not needed for policy reasons. Secondly, they say people need certainty. Where is the certainty? All the people in those various locations around eastern Australia need to know where it might be. This is stunningly incompetent. I cannot help agreeing with one Labor MP's comment about the shadow minister for transport, who comes from Sydney. If anyone ought to understand the politics of Sydney it ought to be - even though he lives in Melbourne - the shadow minister for transport, Martin Ferguson. One of his colleagues said, `He puts himself up as a policy man, but in the end he is just a brawler.' That leaves the new proponent of fiscal rigour in this country - that is, of course, the member for Werriwa, who only recently wrote an article about Badgerys in which, as a very strong piece of advocacy for this much-needed piece of infrastructure, he said: It has the potential to generate 30,000 jobs in a region which has the nation's highest rate of unemployment.That is not right, I understand, but that is what he said. He continued:Incredibly an essential piece of public infrastructure has been delayed by 14 years by a lobby group representing 0.1 per cent of the electorate. This is a black hole in Australia's microeconomic reform record.He went on to say that good policy and good politics are still synonymous. By that record, he plainly believes that Badgerys should still be built, but he just will not tell his leader.</DOC>

 - Firstly, I thank the honourable member for Moore for his interest in the operation that is being undertaken in the Solomon Islands. The Australian-led Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands, RAMSI, which is part of Operation Helpem Fren, was deployed on 24 July. It is essentially a police-led operation but has military and civilian personnel supporting it. It comprises personnel from Australia, Fiji and New Zealand, and they have been joined by personnel from Papua New Guinea and Tonga, making a total at the moment of around 1,800 personnel, and at full strength it will be nearer to 2,000 personnel. Over the two days 31 July to 1 August, I visited Honiara with my New Zealand counterpart and friend, Phil Goff. It was very clear over that brief period that the impact of our mission had had a significant effect on public confidence. I was really very pleasantly surprised by the strength of the mission and its impact. We met with the Prime Minister, members of the cabinet and other community leaders, as well as the opposition. Right across the board they thanked Australia for the leadership that it was showing and the other countries that were involved in the operation. There seemed to be no resistance at all to this initiative.I was told while I was in Honiara that the Solomon Islands Development Trust had conducted a reasonably scientific door-to-door opinion poll of 2,200 locals. It showed there was 97 per cent support for the assistance mission. One women's leader whom I met with in Honiara said that the excitement amongst local Solomon Islanders on the first day of the deployment was like, as she put it, Christmas Day, and she was somebody who had some reservations initially about the idea of the deployment. The immediate priority of this mission is to restore law and order in Honiara and then extend the restoration of law and order to other parts of the country. Clear progress is evident. Government officials and other public officers can now perform their duties free of any intimidation, and the public now have confidence to report acts of crime to the police, including past offences.Obviously a critical issue is going to be the effectiveness of the gun amnesty. This is a 21-day amnesty which will be completed on the 21st of this month. Honourable members might be interested to know that in the first 10 days of the amnesty over 950 guns have been handed in or otherwise secured, and many of these have been destroyed on the spot during village peace ceremonies. The fact that 950 guns have been surrendered, many of which have been destroyed, since the amnesty was introduced is simply an extraordinary achievement. It far exceeds my expectations. The assistance mission so far is proving to be an unqualified success. I note, for example, that Nick Warner, the special coordinator of the mission, and Ben McDevitt, the senior Australian Federal Police officer there, have met with a number of militant leaders to urge them to hand in their weapons before the deadline, and they have started to do so. I hope that Harold Keke will surrender weapons to the police shortly, as he has undertaken.In conclusion, as well as the mission is going, we have to face up to the fact that after 21 August it could become a little more difficult, because if there are guns that have not been handed in by 21 August, they will be found and collected. Those who have retained weapons illegally after 21 August will face penalties of up to 10 years imprisonment and substantial fines. It is going to be very important that the gun amnesty continues with the extraordinary degree of success that has been demonstrated so far. After 21 August, if there are guns to be found, the mission will find them, and it will collect them and bring them in. I do not have any illusions about that being the most dangerous part of the mission. I think that, in the moment of exuberance and confidence that we have now, we should reflect that the most difficult part of this mission is no doubt ahead of us.</DOC>

 - The context in which these questions were asked - and let me remind the member for Werriwa -  -  - Let me remind the member for Werriwa of the question asked by the member for Fraser of the Treasurer on 17 September:My question is to the Treasurer and concerns last week's government announcements concerning the ethanol excise. Treasurer, can you confirm that Trafigura Fuels Australia's contract to import ethanol was excise free when it was signed? Can you also confirm that the government's new arrangements, introduced after the contract was signed and entered into, will impose a crippling $5 million excise bill on a contract which was excise free when it was signed?Then the first question to me on that same day, from the member for Chisholm, which elicited the comment which I continue to hold to, that I had not discussed this matter with Mr Honan, was in these terms:My question is to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, was the government contacted by the major Australian producer of ethanol or by any representative of his company or the Industry Association before its decision to impose fuel excise on ethanol? If so, when? Was the government urged to take action to prevent Trafigura Fuels Australia from importing a shipment of ethanol from Brazil at a commercially competitive price? - Just for the benefit of those opposite, the member for Chisholm concluded her question as follows:Was the government urged to take action to prevent Trafigura Fuels Australia from importing a shipment of ethanol from Brazil at a commercially competitive price?Plainly, that question was about the behaviour of the government in relation to that shipment. That is the context in which this was asked. That is the context in which I gave the answers I have given, and it is why I asserted then and I continue to assert that I have not misled the House. The whole thrust of these questions is to try and allege that by this decision we had done some kind of special favour for a particular company. - `That's right,' he says. You can always rely on the Leader of the Opposition to helpfully interject. He said, `That's right.' That was the whole thrust. I have demonstrated that at the time I had this meeting with Mr Honan, on 1 August, I did not know about the Trafigura shipment; neither, apparently, did Honan.  - Once again, helpfully, the Leader of the Opposition has interjected, saying, `You didn't know about it.' I did not know about it then, and that is why the answer that I gave was palpably correct and why I have not misled the House. The strange thing about the allegation that we were meant to have done enormous favours for Dick Honan is that the two things that Mr Honan's company wanted most of all were, firstly, for the government to mandate -  - Continuing what I was saying, the argument is that we have done some special deal for this company. The two things that this company have advocated and lobbied not only the government but, I suspect, also the opposition for fairly actively over the past few months are, firstly, for the government to mandate a minimum use of ethanol in a blend of petrol and ethanol, and, secondly, they have argued vigorously again-st the imposition of a 10 per cent cap, because they are, in fact, blending ethanol up to levels of 20 per cent. Has the government acted in response to either of those pieces of advocacy? No. The government has not man-dated a minimum. The government, a few months ago, having got proper scientific advice on the matter, introduced a 10 per cent cap for ethanol. So not only does the opposition leader have his facts wrong but he has his conspiracy theory wrong as well.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Pearce for her question. The establishment of the interim task force in the building industry demonstrates this government's determination to replace the law of the jungle with the rule of law in this vital industry. Particularly in Western Australia, the building industry royal commission identified no fewer than 230 separate instances of unlawful conduct in this industry. It was for that reason that the government set up the interim task force, with a brief to try to secure zero tolerance of industrial law breaking.I can inform the House that the task force has 51 investigations currently under way, 14 matters have been referred to other agencies for possible prosecution, nine briefs of evidence are in preparation, and the task force has five prosecutions currently before the courts. The Chief Executive of the Master Builders Association said recently: Even with limited powers, the task force is already making a difference, causing those who operate on a basis of intimidation and standover tactics to realise that this sort of behaviour won't go unpunished.Concern for the rule of law is certainly not an idiosyncrasy of the Howard government. I note that the New South Wales Police recently launched a prosecution against a prominent official for malicious damage and a Victorian court recently convicted 16 unionists for various offences arising from a violent rampage in a Melbourne factory. The rule of law is making a welcome reappearance after a long and regrettable absence from our workplaces.</DOC>

 - I remind the Leader of the Opposition of the central reality of this issue, and that is that the context of the questions asked of me was the shipment from Brazil. -  - Those opposite interject, but it was they who framed the questions. I did not frame the questions; the tactics committee of the opposition framed the questions. They framed the questions about an ethanol shipment, and the reason they framed them about a shipment from Brazil was that I had made a statement five days earlier and they thought, `Aha, this is a conspiracy between the government and Mr Honan and Manildra. He's made this statement, and we will ask a whole lot of questions.' Well, I am quite happy: if the opposition want to ask me questions about an issue, I will answer those questions, and I have made it plain that the context in which I answered these questions was the context in which they were put to me, and that was in relation to this particular shipment. I disclosed particularly the existence of a letter from Mr Honan dealing with the shipment, because, quite apart from anything that may be said by the Leader of the Opposition, I had absolutely no difficulty in disclosing to the House that I had received a letter from Mr Honan on 28 August about the Brazilian shipment. So, if he had specifically raised the Brazilian shipment with me during a personal conversation, why would I not with ease have mentioned that? In other words, if I had no reason to suppress public knowledge about the letter about the Brazilian shipment, why would I have had a reason to suppress the existence of a conversation about the Brazilian shipment? It is obvious that the discussion I had on 1 August - which has the opposition salivating - was not about the subject matter of their questioning, and it is equally obvious that I have not misled the House.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kalgoorlie for his question and for his obvious ongoing interest in the welfare of the mining sector. Mining is a very important industry for Australia. It always has been and hopefully always will be. It represents around nine per cent of Australia's economy, with exports in excess of $43 billion. Nearly one-third of our total exports come from mining, and it is a very important employer. There are 83,000 people employed in the Australian mining industry, up from 78,000 in 2001, so it is a growing industry in employment, and it is also a growing industry in exports.Last week along came the Labor Party and proposed a half billion dollar export tax on the mining industry. I was trying to find out where this detailed export tax policy of the Labor Party's was, and I found it in their higher education policy. In their higher education policy there are 28 photographs of the Leader of the Opposition and just one line saying that they are going to increase the tax on the mining industry - nearly half a billion dollars! - The Prime Minister asks how popular Labor will be in Western Australia. The Chief Executive of the Minerals Council of Australia says that the added cost to the miners would not be offset in any way and would flow directly to their bottom line. He said:This is bad policy, poorly presented and done with no consultation with the industry - I don't know anyone who saw this coming.That is quite common at the Labor Party. The member for Hotham did not know it was coming: it was a piece of four by two at the back of the neck. What is the impact on the small miners? David McSweeney who is managing director of Gindalbie estimated that the federal opposition's plan would directly cost the company an extra $250,000 a year, but he said the broader impact would be far more significant. He said:For a small company liked Gindalbie that's a quarter of a million dollars coming directly out of our exploration campaign which could add another year's mine life, because that's been the history to date ...He goes on to say:... every year we can keep going, we produce another $25 million to $30 million in gold for export.This little company in Western Australia, in the member for Kalgoorlie's electorate, is producing that. The Labor Party is slugging the mining industry, because the Labor Party is bereft of ideas. At a time when the mining industry is doing it pretty tough with international competition and the rising Australian dollar, along comes the Labor Party and slaps a half billion dollar tax on the mining industry. On the coalition side, we want to get rid of taxes on exports; on the Labor side, they want to increase them. It is cheapjack politics, and it is common for the Leader of the Opposition, when the going gets tough, to slug those who are creating the most genuine benefit for people out there in regional Australia.</DOC>

 - Even in his questions the Leader of the Opposition cannot get his own assertions correct. The fact that I met Mr Honan is not in dispute. It is not in dispute. I am not the only one who has met Mr Honan. You used to meet him fairly regularly when you were a minister in the Keating government. That is not the issue. The issue is whether what I said in parliament regarding the shipment of ethanol from Brazil was correct, and nothing that the Leader of the Opposition has said, after 45 or 50 minutes of questioning, has altered the fact that I did not discuss the Trafigura shipment in my meeting on 1 August with Mr Honan. That was the basis of what I said then and that is the basis of my continuing to reject the absurd claim by the Leader of the Opposition.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Petrie for her question and for her continuing interest in the security of Australians. The Howard government are committed to combating terrorism and other multijurisdictional crimes. As part of our comprehensive approach to stamping out terrorist and multijurisdictional criminal activities, it is vital that we cut off the flow of money supporting them. Our track record on this is quite clear. We have implemented comprehensive terrorism legislation to prevent and deter terrorist activity wherever possible. This includes strong legislation and processes to deal with terrorist financing and supporting the fine work of AUSTRAC.But, as a result of limits in the Australian Con-stitution, we lack the power to enact comprehensive money-laundering offences. An effective national regime to combat money laundering requires comprehensive offences under Commonwealth law. Under the Constitution, the Commonwealth has power to enact some money-laundering offences in certain circumstances, but it is not a comprehensive power. There is a gap in the Commonwealth's legislative power. This gap is recognised by the states and territories, and if it is not addressed then there is a risk of a Commonwealth prosecution failing on technical grounds.States can assist by removing any doubt in this area by expressly referring power to the Commonwealth to enact comprehensive offences. This would be consistent with the commitment of the states at the leaders summit on terrorism and multijurisdictional crime in April last year. At the summit, the Prime Minister and state and territory leaders agreed to reform money-laundering offences to create effective offences. They agreed to a reference of powers to the Commonwealth if necessary. Given the gap in the Commonwealth's constitutional powers, this reference is clearly necessary.At last week's meeting of the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General here in Canberra, I requested the states to refer the relevant powers to the Commonwealth. Regrettably the states indicated they would not refer power to the Commonwealth in this vital area. This is a worrying setback to the national cause of preventing money laundering and the criminal activity that it supports. The states' uncooperative attitude was taken despite assurances that the Commonwealth did not seek to assume sole responsibility for investigating and prosecuting these activities. Comprehensive Commonwealth offences would continue to operate concurrently with state and territory offences. The Howard government remain committed to taking all necessary steps to combating money laundering. We will continue to pursue this issue with the states and we look forward to greater cooperation from them to ensure seamless and effective operation of laws combating money laundering. </DOC>

 - As to questions about meetings between ministers and other people, I will have to inquire of those other ministers before I say anything. When I know about those things, I will let the honourable member know. But it is interesting that it would appear that the Leader of the Opposition has already asked me this question - on 19 September 2002. In that question, the Leader of the Opposition said:I ask the Prime Minister whether he is aware of a recent meeting between the chairman of the Australian Institute of Petroleum and the minister for agriculture to discuss the regulation of ethanol blending in fuel.Then he goes on to make comments about remarks attributed to me. So there is nothing particularly new about this question, Mr Speaker. It is hardly a devastating new piece of information. But I would remind the Lead-er of the Opposition, of course, that we have placed a cap on ethanol blending of 10 per cent and that decision was not welcomed by Manildra.</DOC>

 - In reply to the member for Fadden, I can inform the House that I am aware of a statement released to Arab media outlets which purports to claim responsibility on behalf of al-Qaeda for the 5 August bombing of the Marriott Hotel in Jakarta. The preliminary information I have is that the statement could well be authentic. The statement described the bombing as part of a series of operations `Dr Ayman al-Sawahiri has promised to carry out'. Al-Sawahiri is Osama bin Laden's deputy and spiritual mentor in the al-Qaeda organisation. The statement portrayed the bombing as `a fatal slap on the face of America and its allies in Muslim Jakarta, where faith has been denigrated by the dirty American presence and the discriminatory Australian presence'. This, let me remind the House, is not the first time that al-Qaeda has referred to Australia, and this most recent statement does not, on our advice, of itself change the threat level facing Australia. It does, however, point to the strong links between al-Qaeda and Jemaah Islamiah, the latter being most probably responsible for carrying out the Marriott bombing. I would remind the House that on 29 May this year I informed the House that new information had come to light shortly before then indicating that al-Qaeda had explored possible targets in Australia in 2000 and 2001 - and that was before the attacks on New York and Washington on 11 September 2001. That information confirmed the earlier indications from a series of statements of al-Qaeda's hostility towards Australia.On 3 November 2001 Osama bin Laden first made specific reference to Australia when he criticised Australian troops in East Timor, who were then under United Nations auspices, calling them `a crusader force'. Bin Laden also specifically mentioned Australia on two subsequent occasions, including following the attacks in Bali. Al-Zawahiri also released a statement in May this year in which he confirmed that Australia remained a terrorist target.I say again to the House something that I have said outside the parliament over the past few days. Those responsible for terrorist attacks have frequently said that the attacks are carried out to avenge their `Muslim brothers'. It scarcely needs to be brought to the House's attention that, in the case of the attack in Jakarta, clearly, they were not aveng-ing Muslim brothers; they were killing them. In fact, the overwhelming majority of those who died or were maimed or injured were in fact faithful followers of Islam. It is yet another reminder of how obscene it is that terrorists seek to invoke the good name of Islam to justify their actions. The greatest demonstration and proof of that is that, in the process of carrying out these terrorist attacks, they are indiscriminately killing innocent members of the Islamic faith.</DOC>

 - I start my answer by correcting something that the Leader of the Opposition said. What I have claimed and continue to claim is that the denial I gave in answer to questions last September was of a discussion with Mr Honan about the pending shipment of ethanol from Brazil by Tra-figura. Let me remind the opposition lead-er again: that was the context in which the question was asked by the member for Chisholm. I did not discuss the Trafigura shipment with Mr Honan during our meeting on 1 August because neither of us were aware of it. That is why I did not mention that meeting in my parliamentary answers and that is why I do not believe that I have misled the parliament. </DOC>

 - First, I thank the honourable member for Maranoa for his question. I know that he is very concerned about the issue of the security of Australians overseas and agrees with the government's general position, which is that, as a government, we should do everything we can and take every possible measure to at least try to protect Australians overseas who might get into difficulties. That includes Australians who, in a most unfortunate circumstance, might be in an aircraft that is hijacked or where Australians are taken hostage. If that were to happen in Indonesia, we would obviously want to make sure that we have full cooperation and conceivably even interoperability with the Indonesians in order to help rescue the Australians and perhaps other hostages who had been subject to hijacking. That is commonsense.Therefore, we make no secret of the fact that we have been taking steps to develop very limited links with Indonesia's special forces, Kopassus, in the area of hostage recovery and counter-hijack operations. This activity is part of a broader counter-terrorism cooperation that is already occurring very successfully with Indonesia, between our respective police forces, immigration and in-telligence organisations and so on under the memorandum of understanding on counter-terrorism. It includes a four-year, $4.75 million capacity building program with the Indonesian police to improve its ability to deal with counter-terrorism. That specific contribution is part of the overall $10 million package that we announced in October last year.Currently, the Indonesian special forces have by far the most effective capability in Indonesia to recover hostages and resolve a hijacking situation. We just have to face up to that, whether we like it or not. It is enormously important to remember that this is the organisation in Indonesia that has by far the most effective capacity to do that job. So, in the event of Australian lives being at risk, we have to have some mechanisms in place to ensure cooperation between our special forces to facilitate their rescue.Senior defence officials met recently with their Indonesian counterparts to determine how best we might be able to cooperate in this particular field. I know there is sensitivity about Kopassus. When the Labor Party was in government in Australia under Mr Keating, it developed very extensive and close relations with Kopassus. In our case, as a government we have obviously severed links with Kopassus. We are only reintroducing those links in a very qualified and narrow way, because we are aware of the human rights record of Kopassus.I am not aware of any TNI policy of cooperation with Laskar Jihad, but individuals in TNI appear to have had contact with Laskar Jihad members. That could of course include some Kopassus people. The government has urged the Indonesian government and its relevant authorities to take quick action against any illegal Laskar Jihad activity. I note that Laskar Jihad formally announced its disbandment on 14 October 2002. The government is not aware of any policy of institutional links between TNI and Jemaah Islamiah. In talking to Kopassus unit 81, which is the unit responsible for dealing with hijacking and the taking of terrorists, we will limit our cooperation to exclude those people we know to have links to Laskar Jihad and other violent groups or who have been involved in serious human rights abuses. This government's main priority is the safety and security of Australians. We do not intend to be soft on terrorism. We do not intend to take a weak and equivocal stand on security issues. We intend to be as decisive and effective as we possibly can be. We believe that these very limited and qualified links with Kopassus will give us a capability to help Australians who might get into difficulties by being taken hostage or being involved in a hijacking. We can help them through cooperation with the Indonesians. I think that is just plain commonsense.</DOC>

 - I do not think that asking questions with that sort of suffix rises to the level of dignity one would expect in the parliament. One of the reasons the opposition lack credibility out there in the Australian community is their constant political point scoring. I answered a question which was asked of me by the member for Maranoa. In it I made perfectly clear that, whilst I am not aware of any TNI policy of cooperation with Laskar Jihad - an organisation which claims to have disbanded itself on 14 October 2002 - individuals in TNI appear to have had contact with Laskar Jihad members. I made that perfectly clear.For the benefit of the House, let me make two other points about that. Firstly, Kopassus is part of TNI, so there is no question of that. Secondly, I did say that in talking with Kop-asssus unit 81 we will limit our cooperation to exclude those people we know to have links to Laskar Jihad and other violent groups or who have been involved in serious human rights abuses. This policy stands in stark contrast to the policy of the Labor Party. My predecessor, Senator Evans, said in relation to links with Kopassus that he wanted work with Kopassus to focus on `low-level military war fighting skills'. That was the standard set by the Labor Party. All I can say is that when it comes to points of principle, this government is much more principled on the issues of Indonesia, East Timor and human rights than ever the Labor Party was.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question and for all the work she does on counter-terrorism. - She does one of the things you never do and that is to ask questions about these issues in the parliament. You have no interest in counter-terrorism. No wonder the public think you are soft on security issues. They are right. - As the Prime Minister has said, the Marriott Hotel attack was, as it turned out, more of an attack on Indonesians than on Western interests. The Prime Minister and I have spoken to our counterparts. We have conveyed our condolences to the injured and to the victims' families. We have reiterated our readiness to cooperate still further with the Indonesians to deal with the problem of terrorism. I want to make a point about the effectiveness of the Australian embassy and Australian officials in responding to the Marriott Hotel bombing. I think this is a very important point. Our embassy officials were at the scene of the Marriott within 15 minutes of the bomb going off, which was an extraordinary achievement on their part. They worked quickly to obtain the hotel register, to identify Australian guests and to establish their safety and whereabouts by that evening.The bomb went off around the middle of the day. The embassy was able to establish within one hour of the explosion the identities of two Australians who had been affected by the blast. Honourable members might recall that one of those was injured and had to have, off the top of my head, around 30 stitches. The other was not physically injured but was in his room at the time and somewhat shaken by the blast, as one can imagine. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade's crisis centre was activated quickly and remained open until around midday on 6 August - the next day - when it was firmly established that there were no Australian fatalities. My department also activated an emergency call unit, which took 350 calls and registered inquiries about 132 individuals.I want to take this opportunity, because I know the House will be pleased to hear it, to praise the work of the Australian embassy and Australian officials in responding so decisively to the Marriott Hotel bombing. I remember the extraordinary work that Australian officials did in Bali at the time of the Bali bomb blast, not only those working in the consulate but various people from Australian government organisations, and Australian private citizens who volunteered their assistance almost immediately at the time of the Bali bombing. It is that same absolute determination to help Australians where Australians get into difficulties that has been shown by the officials at our embassy in Jakarta. They deserve a great deal of praise for the excellent job they have done.</DOC>

 - Whilst I thank the member for Jagajaga for the question, there are a number of quite false assertions in the question. Yesterday afternoon immediately after question time I tabled a letter from the Secretary of the Commonwealth Department of Education, Science and Training addressed to me and dated 8 August. The letter said, in part:I would stress that the Department had already taken the decision to remove all material relating to unpublished internal Departmental analysis before that draft was provided to your Higher Education Adviser.As the letter was tabled yesterday, I presume it has been read by the member for Jagajaga. The real question we seek to address in facing Australia's future in higher education is: what is the impact of the Higher Education Contribution Scheme and the 25 per cent of university funding that is contributed by students, who subsequently pay it back in the main through the tax system once they become graduates?If you look back over the last 10 years, which is what this major report has done - it is a rear-vision look at higher education over the last decade - you will find that in 1991 there were 505,000 students in Australian universities. By 2000, there were 600,000. Commencements from 1992 increased from 127,000 to 167,000. Importantly, the commencements for students from low socioeconomic backgrounds - the students who have come from the poorest families and backgrounds in the country - increased from 20,300 in 1992 to 28,000 by the year 2000. In other words, there were 8,000 more low-SES commencements over that eight- to nine-year period. Importantly, Professor Bruce Chapman, the Director of the Centre for Economic Policy Research at the Australian National University, who co-designed HECS for the Australian Labor Party in 1989 and is Australia's pre-eminent researcher and commentator on the impact of HECS and income-contingent loans on participation in universities, concluded in his major report:... changes to HECS introduced in 1997 had no adverse impact on participation for members of any wealth group; indeed, there were large higher education participation increases for those from all family wealth backgrounds.Similarly, the Phillips Curran report initiated by the states, all of which are hostile to varying degrees to this government, concluded:Because the HECS charge does not have to be paid up-front and is repayable on an income contingent basis, students discount the size of the charge in their decision making. This is evident in the very limited demand impact of previous increases in HECS. This means that universities can increase charges, at least up to a point, without a commensurate impact in demand.But the key reason why the department itself, I am advised, chose to remove that and other editings of this retrospective of the last decade in higher education -  - The member for Jagajaga surely wishes to be educated about the facts. These are facts. The key reason, I am advised - and I have examined the research, as I do frequently - is that in 1997 there were a number of changes made. The first was that the funding of courses moved from the general field of study to actual subjects that were coded and then funded. For example, if you take the case of law, we went from 5,389 law students to 3,788.  - Of course it would be nonsense to say that 1,600 fewer lawyers were trained in 1997, although I suspect there are some Australians who would appreciate it if it had been the case. Similarly, if you look at veterinary science it appears that we went from 227 veterinary science students to 93. Of course we did not. What happened was that the Commonwealth changed the way it codes and funds places in higher education. In the same year the 25 per cent up-front discount that was being given to New Zealand citizens - 25 per cent discount on HECS - was abolished. That had an adverse impact on mature age participation. So in the end, examining it in the context of the scientists who are researching this on a day-to-day basis and the other issues which occurred in 1997, the department concluded that methodologically its own research was not of a sufficient standard - and of its usually high standard - and that it should not be part of the 10-year retroview of higher education. I conclude by quoting Professor Deryck Schreuder, the President of the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee. Writing in the Financial Review on Saturday, 9 August, he said:Unless Parliament legislates a significant package of reform for the universities in this current session, drawing from the major reviews and proposals now before it ... the nation's higher education system will be forced to battle on, an increasing shadow of what it could be for Australia's citizens.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Flinders for his question. I can inform the House that, when the government introduced A New Tax System in Australia on 1 July 2000, it made part of A New Tax System the First Home Owners Scheme, which gives a grant of $7,000 to every first home buyer coming into the market in Australia. Since we introduced it, 482,000 individuals and families have benefited from the First Home Owners Scheme. They have been paid a total of $3.8 billion in First Home Owners Scheme payments to help them get into the market. - It was $3.8 billion actually. Thank you for reminding me again that it was $3.8 billion. Mr Speaker, I can always rely on the member for Hunter to help the coalition put its case. He is one of its secret weapons! Stable income has also helped, with real incomes going up by 10 per cent since the government was elected. In addition to that, there is lower unemployment, because unemployment has come down since Labor was thrown out of office. In addition to that, the lowest home loan interest rates in 30 years have also helped people to get into the market.Every first home owner gets a first home owners grant whether they are buying a new home or an established home. There is no GST on an established home. Fifteen per cent of new home buyers buy new homes. In other words, the 85 per cent of first home buyers who are not buying a new home pay no GST and get a $7,000 grant. Again: the 85 per cent of first home buyers who do not buy a new house - they are buying an established house - pay no GST and get a $7,000 grant. In addition to those measures, the government has announced an inquiry by the Productivity Commission to look at other factors influencing the housing market. The inquiry committee will consist of the chairman, Gary Banks, Commissioner David Robertson and an associate commissioner, Dr Ed Shann. We on this side of the House believe that in particular it should look at the release of new land by state governments and councils and the supply of new land coming onto the market in big cities. Of course, it will no doubt look at taxation treatment, because, as I said earlier, although most first home buyers do not pay GST - only 15 per cent do - there is no doubt that a lot of first home buyers are paying stamp duty, which is being imposed by state Labor governments. Since 1996 the stamp duty on an average home has risen to $16,000, from $6,000, in both Melbourne and Sydney. Interestingly enough, we never really hear a whimper from the opposition about stamp duties. A deafening silence comes from Labor protecting its mates in state government over the issue of stamp duty.I am asked what other policies have been put forward in relation to housing affordability. I must say that one of the more interesting ones was one that was put forward by the member for Werriwa on 2 July. No doubt wanting to make a big splash on his first day out as shadow Treasurer, he went on the Lateline program and said that negative gearing was `part of Labor's policy review'. He went on to say:... any smart policy maker would be looking at it ...He said that any smart policymaker would be looking at abolishing negative gearing! His policies normally last for 24 hours; this was a policy that did not last from Lateline to lunchtime! Next morning, who was the first person off the blocks to say that the Labor Party was never going to look at abolishing negative gearing? It was the old member for Hotham himself. `We are not reviewing negative gearing,' he said on 3 July. They were reviewing it on Lateline, but by breakfast time they were not reviewing it.It has widely been assumed - I would like the roosters to stop smiling at this point - that this was a gaffe by the member for Werriwa. It was an enormous gaffe by the member for Werriwa. But his gaffe was not in saying that Labor was looking at reviewing negative gearing; his gaffe was in letting on that Labor had already commenced a review of negative gearing. On 5 July the Herald Sun reported that Labor has been looking at negative gearing changes as a way of paying for some of its ambitious programs. On 7 July the Australian reported:But there was at least one meeting of Labor's raz-or gang at which the proposed treatment of negative gearing was discussed.Critically, that meeting was attended by a number of the Opposition Leader's ... staff ...Then on 8 July the Australian revealed:Mr McMullan raised the issue in person rather than by written submission ... ... Mr McMullan did commission the Parliamentary Library to prepare a paper on possible savings from changing the negative gearing regime.In the Australian Financial Review on 8 July Laura Tingle reported:... Labor's expenditure review committee did have proposals before it on negative gearing as recently as a few weeks ago.There was a gaffe all right. He made a splash and it was a big bellyflop. There was a gaffe all right but the gaffe was not that he announced a review to abolish negative gearing but that he disclosed that the review had already commenced and was being actively considered in the forums of the Australian Labor Party. The Leader of the Opposition knows as well as I do that probably a majority of the Labor backbench, given their way, would want to abolish negative gearing in any event. We on this side of the House will not be abolishing negative gearing, because we believe that if you make a loss on an investment you should be able to set that loss against income, as you can under the normal principles of taxation law. We believe in a low interest regime. We introduced the First Home Owners Scheme. We will keep up the pressure on the states over stamp duties. We will make sure that those areas that can be improved will be improved with a thorough review by the Productivity Commission.  </DOC>

 - My answer again to the member for Jagajaga is that, firstly, in terms of the references to editing in the secretary's letter addressed to me, dated 8 August, it is a matter for the department as to who within the department actually did that. But I would remind the member for Jagajaga that, in terms of the substantive issue, Professor Bruce Chapman in 1988 found that only 18 per cent -  - The substantive issue is whether HECS changes have an impact on the participation of low-income students in Australian universities. The fact is that in 1989, 19 per cent of the poorest students at the age of 18 were in higher education. By 1998, it was -  - All the issues in relation to this particular report have been adequately and well dealt with in the secretary's letter to me. The last thing I say to the opposition is that, if the Labor Party really believes that, contrary to all research and evidence, the HECS changes have an adverse impact on participation in these courses, the Labor Party will now amend its policy to reduce HECS for lawyers, dentists and vets.</DOC>

 - The member for Grayndler has a real interest in this one. I thank the honourable member for Macquarie for his question and at the outset acknowledge the fierce advocacy that he has displayed at all times in relation to airport issues in his electorate. Yesterday I informed the House that it was quite clear that no second airport would be needed in the Sydney basin or surrounding areas for a long time indeed. I cannot see much point in building white elephants that cost a lot of money and will not be used. Despite that, in the Labor Party the hunt is well and truly on for a second Sydney airport site.  - I know quite a bit about some of these sites and I would be more than happy to provide some ongoing information, but I am asked specifically about a couple of them and, firstly, about Darkes Forest. Darkes Forest would not only create enormous noise problems for communities at Bulli, Thirroul and Coledale, but the Bureau of Meteorology has previously concluded that the Darkes Forest airport site is not a safe location for an airport. It said:The major hazards associated with the site are stratus fog which in many rain situations associated with onshore flow will extend from ground level to cloud top, and turbulence and strong down drafts associated with gale force westerly winds. It is not difficult to envisage instances of aircraft undershooting the runway when approaching in gale force westerly wind situations.So I do not think Darkes Forest sounds as though it has a lot going for it. Then there is Wilton. Wilton was looked at as part of the process very early on. It is about an hour and a half's drive from Sydney city, which is hardly convenient. It is a major water catchment area of the Sydney region. An airport there would risk contaminating Sydney's water supply - something that I think would not be very well appreciated by the residents of Sydney. A previous EIS -  -  - They are quite exhaustive; I would be only too happy to provide them if that facilitates consideration on the other side of this important issue. A previous EIS identified the environmental issues as very difficult indeed to overcome. It would also create enormous noise problems for communities like Picton, Wilton and Bargo. But the question is: why this panic and why this rush when there is no sound policy or political reason for it being on the agenda at the time? The answer of course lies in something that was said the other day by one of the opposition frontbenchers, and that is that the policy process has been such an utter mess that it has created a political crisis for them.There is a very interesting transcript from 2GB's Philip Clark of an interview with the member for Sydney which was conducted last night. It reveals why there is a panic and why the people of Sydney ought to be very concerned about the prospect of getting a resolution to this. Philip Clark asked the member for Sydney a few questions and, in part, the reply came:I think that what my party - That is, the ALP - needs to do is to determine a second site that we are happy with as soon as possible so that people are able to get some certainty so that we are not out there in communities -  And Clark interrupts:Oh, come on. Don't you - your side of politics established Badgerys Creek. What do you mean you are looking for a second site? You're going for another one?The member for Sydney replies:My view is that Badgerys Creek is the better site but, you know, wiser heads than me have decided that it's not so.I did not hear the interview but you can hear it in his voice; Clark says:You don't think they're wiser?And the member for Sydney replies:Of course I do. Of course I do.`No, you don't,' says Clark. `You think from leader down all of them are terminably stupid on the issue.' From the leader down! The transport adviser on that side comes from Sydney. We can excuse the leader for coming from Melbourne and perhaps not understanding Sydney policy and political issues quite so well, but not so the transport adviser. He comes from Sydney. He ought to understand them. He should have understood that there is no policy reason at all for reopening this debate - no sound reason at all - and he should have understood what political dynamite it was going to be. - No wonder the member for Sydney cannot deny that she thinks they are all terminably stupid on the issue. When prompted, she was very polite. She said:Well, I think it was the wrong decision to make. I have been open about the fact that I thought all along it's the wrong decision to make but, you know, all I can deal with is what I've got in front of me and what I've got in front of me is half a dozen other sites which need examining.I think I am pretty familiar with all of them. If you would like any more information on them tomorrow and the day after, we can keep it up. But of course those people, from the leader down, who should have been in a position to advise on this include the newly found fiscally responsible member for Werriwa because he too comes from Sydney and he too understands well and truly the policy and the political issues. We have been researching what he has had to say on this and it wasn't so very long ago that he said:Anyone with commonsense would know that the only available site acquired by the Commonwealth, cleared by two environmental impact statements and approved by umpteen economic studies is Badgerys Creek so Labor's policy is to proceed at Badgerys Creek. That is crystal clear.All I can say is that we wait with great interest to see what the next crystal clear decision from the Labor Party happens to be and how long it might last.</DOC>

 - This report, which seems to be occupying the attention of the ALP whilst this government is actually thinking about building Australia's future, was initiated by the Commonwealth Department of Education, Science and Training and was produced by the department. Any alterations, as the secretary's letter said, were made before it was sent to my office. It is a 500-page report, and essentially the government has been working earnestly on building a foundation for Australia's future. It was not, up until that point, a report which I had personally read. Can the Labor Party just get it into its mind that this is a report amongst many reports that the Commonwealth department is doing frequently on a whole variety of issues? As the secretary's letter says, the report was sent to my office late last year. All I can say again to the member for Jagajaga is: read the secretary's letter. It sets it all out. But here we are; we have had three questions on this. What about all those kids out there that are desperately trying to get apprenticeships and get into training? What about all the issues that really worry Australians? The Labor Party is focused on process instead of what sort of country we ought to be building.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Fairfax for his question and for his very strong commitment to higher education and the University of the Sunshine Coast in particular. During the recess, the Australian Labor Party released its policy on higher education entitled Aim Higher. I might add that that is a title which has been lifted from the Blair government's program for higher education. There were also 14 specific policy initiatives of this government which - to its credit, I suppose - have been adopted by the opposition. But on page 16, one of the policy announcements says:Under Aim Higher, students of maths and science will pay nearly $5,000 less in fees for a three year university degree. Labor will place mathematics and science in Band 1 of HECS to reduce course fees by $1,600 per annum.The Commonwealth Department of Education, Science and Training and also the Com-monwealth Department of Finance and Administration did a very careful, detailed analysis of the Labor Party higher education policy at the highest level. Given the obvious commitment that the opposition has to departmental research, it makes very interesting reading.Firstly, as the Minister for Small Business and Tourism, who is currently acting in the Industry portfolio, told us yesterday, the policy is funded in part with a $467 million tax impost on the mining industry. So apparently some of the 83,000 workers in the mining industry will have to lose their jobs in order to fund Labor's higher education policy - a $40 billion dollar industry. Secondly, the Labor Party intends to continue a loan scheme it set up in 1993 for some of the poorest Australians in the country; $2½ billion has been lent and $1.4 billion is considered to be doubtful debt. So in Labor Party economics, apparently you save money by lending the poorest people money so they can trade in their pension cheques, and that is how that they, in part, fund their policy.The Leader of the Opposition himself does not understand how they have funded their own policy. The Leader of the Opposition ought to have a look at the student financial support scheme. But it is interesting that the Commonwealth's analysis finds that there is at least a $257 million black hole in the Labor Party's higher education policy but, interestingly, it includes $6 million under budget for additional places in universities and at least $28 million underfunded for indexation of university funding. But the most important and the deepest black hole relates to reducing HECS charges for science and mathematics students. There are 57,000 places, or around 80,000 students, which comprise 14 per cent of all those in universities. The Labor Party has costed this at $43.6 million. The Commonwealth departments of education and finance have costed this at $262.5 million - a $218.9 million black hole. It is interesting that the member for Jagajaga does not understand how universities are funded. I challenge the member for Jagajaga to explain - in the parliament or, better still, in a press conference - how universities are funded. I will walk her through it. Universities receive a total operating grant. Seventy-five per cent of that, which is from the taxpayer, is the operating grant. A quarter of it is HECS - that is, the students' contribution, most of which is recovered through the tax system. The Labor Party has proposed to reduce HECS for science and maths students - $1,600 a year - and have undercosted it at $43.6 million. But in the Australian on 4 August the member for Jagajaga told Sid Marris:Dr Nelson's costings use the accrual accounting method, but Labor uses the cash system, which only includes the cost when it occurs.But the following day, in the Courier Mail, the higher education editor says:Macklin insists that under the accrual accounting system used in the Federal Budget, the $5,000 reduction to tens of thousands of students will have absolutely no impact on forward estimates ...Then she says:Sometime in the future there will be smaller cash transactions, which is what HECS repayments are, but this does not affect the Budget surplus or deficit.So in some way for 80,000 students you can reduce their HECS contribution by $1,600 a year and it costs nothing. In fact, it gets better. Under the heading `Dunce's cap or dux of the school?' Professor John Hay, the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Queensland, says:... the Opposition is trying to have its cake and eat it by claiming it can reduce HECS charges in some areas, fail to make good the $220 million cost of doing so and still have the same amount of money available for university grants.Then he says:It's nonsense.He continues:A first-year economics student could work it out.That is the reality. The problem here is that the Labor Party has not taken into account the impact of the reduction in the HECS discount for up-front fee payers and the fiscal balance nor the indexation of the HECS debt nor the remissions and write-offs which are reduced by reducing the HECS charge. It has not taken into account the impact on the cash balance in the medium or the long term. But, most importantly, in reducing the HECS com-ponent from the students, it has not budgeted for the increase in the operating grant. The Labor Party is basically saying that somebody else will be paying for it at some time in the future.</DOC>

 - In 1999-2000, Commonwealth accounts went to accrual accounting. For five successive budgets this government has run its accounts in accrual accounting. In 1997, because this government came to office and found a $10.3 billion deficit, it was necessary to reduce the rate of growth in funding for many things, including Australian universities. In 1997, when the HECS changes were introduced, under the accounting system the operating grant was commensurately reduced for universities, so the total sum of money available - for example, in veterinary science, law or medicine - to the university remained the same.The Labor Party is now arguing that it can magically either change the accounting system of the Commonwealth or reduce the HECS charges for 14 per cent of the students in the system, without at the same time having to budget for now in the forward estimates the increase in the operating grant. Under Labor's policy, you have $42 million less for Queensland universities. Professor John Hay, who says that even a first-year economic student could work it out, will lose $13.7 million from the University of Queensland alone. For the University of Southern Queensland, $2½ million will go down the tube if Labor gets into government, and the University of the Sunshine Coast, $1.7 million. - The member for Jagajaga needs to carefully explain the costings of the Labor Party policy. It is interesting that the Commonwealth Department of Education, Science and Training has decided that some of the information that it was producing was not of the usual high quality, and the Labor Party is clinging to that and saying, `This is wonderful.' Yet, at the very highest level, the department of education and the Department of Finance and Administration have found an almost $300 million black hole in Labor's costings, and all the member for Jagajaga can assert is, `Wrong, wrong, wrong.' I suggest that the member for Jagajaga actually go and have a look and educate herself about how universities are funded.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Barker for his question. He represents many of those people who are dependent upon the live animal export trade, which is worth about $1 billion a year to Australia and employs about 9,000 people. He, like the government, recognises that this trade, even though it is economically important to Australia, can only continue if it gives priority to the welfare and safety of animals that are involved in the trade. Many members would, no doubt, have seen the story on 60 Minutes a couple of weeks ago which raised some serious allegations about the treatment of live animals for export, especially in the Middle East and North Africa. The disturbing vision that was provided for that program came from a European animal activist group known as Animals' Angels and is obviously many years old. It suggested that the pictures were taken in Egypt, although I cannot confirm that. Some are even questioning whether the footage involved Australian animals. Nonetheless, the centrepiece of the story revolved around an incident of underreporting of mortalities on a voyage that occurred some two years ago on a vessel that, I might add, is no longer involved in the trade.Nonetheless, the government does take these allegations regarding the welfare of animals very seriously indeed. There have been a number of incidents over recent years where there have been completely unacceptable outcomes, and we have acted sternly to implement new measures to ensure that the trade can occur in safety. There were suggestions on the program that the trade was deregulated in 1998 - that is not true. There is a range of measures in place involving regulation in government agencies like AQIS and the Australian Maritime Safety Authority.Last year, following a series of incidents involving unacceptable mortalities, I called in representatives of the industry, and we agreed that we should reactivate the independent reference group that has done a lot of work on developing standards and supervising elements of the code of conduct for the industry. The group is chaired by the federal government's chief veterinarian officer, Dr Gardner Murray. It includes Professor Capel, from the veterinary school in Melbourne; Dr Hugh Wirth, the President of the RSPCA; and Malcolm Foster, representing the industry. It is very much an industry and animal welfare organisation based body that has the interests of the trade and particularly the welfare of the animals very much in mind.This group developed an action plan for the livestock export industry. Key elements of that plan include animal welfare organisations, the Veterinary Association and livestock industry organisations being involved in the oversight of the plan and the development of computer models to help assess the risk of heat stress in consignments and other risk issues. AQIS inspects and certifies all the feedlots that are used for exports, including an assessment of the stock preparation and preshipment arrangements; vets or qualified stockman are placed on board all of the vessels involved in the trade to the Middle East and North Africa; there is a better selection process involved in choosing the animals; and there are daily reports submitted from on board the vessel about mortalities and other events associated with the voyage. All of those things will help to ensure that there are no repeats of some of the incidents that have occurred in the past.In addition, the government is certainly prepared to take action against any exporters who do not meet satisfactory standards. We cancelled the licence of one exporter last year, and the biggest exporter from Western Australia, the biggest exporting state, has had its licence suspended since the beginning of this year and the licence has not been renewed. Many of the allegations involve the maltreatment of animals once they reach their overseas destination, and that is a more difficult issue for the government to deal with because there are obviously different religious and cultural practices in some of those countries which are difficult for many Australians to appreciate. We have also taken action to try and upgrade the appreciation of animal welfare issues in overseas countries. Last month we announced a further $150,000 project with industry to improve animal handling in the Middle East and North Africa. This is on top of an industry and government initiative to provide $3.3 million to improve animal welfare outcomes over recent years, and that has involved the installation of improved slaughter practices and equipment in some of the abattoirs overseas. We have permanently based an Arabic speaking vet in the Middle East and we have improved the unloading and handling facilities with the provision of better infrastructure.In light of the allegations that there has been some underreporting of a number of fatalities on some of these voyages, I have referred those allegations to the AQIS compliance unit to test whether there have been any breaches of Australian law. If that is the case, obviously we will seek to prosecute any offenders. I am pleased to be able to report to the House that since these new measures were introduced there have been 35 voyages overseas, involving more than 2.3 million sheep, and there have been no incidents of excessive mortalities. Indeed, the levels of mortalities are way below anything that has ever been achieved in the past. The industry is anxious to work with governments and animal welfare organisations to achieve the sorts of standards that Australians expect. This is an important trade and we are determined to ensure that it occurs in ways in which the welfare and the safety of animals are appropriately respected.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Calare for his question. I indicate broadly, in terms of the allocation of places, that this year the government will be allocating some 8,500 aged care places right across Australia, according to the ratio, which the honourable member mentioned. That brings the number of places which we have allocated over the last four years to more than 52,700. Indeed, we are on target to reach the target which we set of 200,000 places by 2006. That is a target which, according to all indications at the present time, we intend to meet.As the honourable member pointed out in his question, the basis upon which we seek to equitably distribute places throughout Australia, so that there is no allocation unfairly made to one planning region or another, is according to a ratio of 100 places per thousand people aged 70 years and over. That ratio was first established back in 1985-86, I think. When we came to government in 1996, according to an independent report undertaken by the Auditor-General there was a shortage of some 10,000 places left by the previous government. That is the shortage which we are endeavouring to overcome by meeting this target of 200,000 places. Specifically in relation to the question, one of the matters which my department is currently looking at is the actual formula by which the distribution is made. - I am answering the question, member for Hunter. I am sure all honourable members on both sides of the House who have an interest in aged care, as the honourable member for Calare has pointed out, will be interested in this. When the ratio was set, based on the age of 70, the threshold, if I can put it that way, of entering into old age was probably about 70. We know, because of the ageing of the population, that people are living longer. The average age of people, particularly in residential aged care in Australia, I think is about 84 now.One of the things we are looking at is whether or not the planning ratio of 100 places per thousand people over the age of 70 is relevant or whether it should be raised to, say, 75 or 80. That investigation is under way at the present time. When we have worked out all the aspects of it, including the modelling of it, then if there is a need to make a change we will make a change. Could I say to the honourable member for Calare that at the end of the day there must be some ratio in place to ensure that there is an equitable distribution of aged care places throughout Australia. The government is committed not only to increasing the number of places, as I have indicated in my answer, but to ensuring that the distribution of those places is done in a way which is equitable and fair to all Australians.</DOC>

 - The member for Mackellar has long wanted share ownership to be as much a part of the Australian way of life as home ownership, and I thank her very much for her question. This is a government which strongly believes in property-owning democracy. We believe in property-owning democracy. In 1986, just nine per cent of Australians owned shares. Thanks to the policies of this government - in particular the privatisation policies of this government - 37 per cent of Australians now own shares. That means these people personally have a direct stake in ownership of the means of production, distribution and exchange. In 1984, just 2.4 per cent of Australian workers owned a share of their businesses. I am pleased to say that, thanks to this government's doubling of the employee share ownership tax concession, there are now six per cent of Australians who are worker capitalists. This helps to explain why Australian workplaces are now more harmonious than ever before.The government has just established an employee share ownership development unit. This unit will focus on shopfloor share ownership and it will also focus on trying to extend share ownership for non-listed businesses. But on this topic I completely agree with the member for Werriwa, who said:Extending employee share ownership is an important way of civilising capitalism.I agree with him but no-one on his side does, which is the problem. We have the member for Melbourne, the shadow minister for telecommunications, saying:... employee share ownership schemes were almost invariably driven by tax avoidance ...We had the ACTU president saying:People like Mark Latham must have lost the plot when he thinks that shares are the elixir of life.The now shadow Treasurer has given a firm and repeated commitment that Labor will take to the next election an employee share ownership policy which is fully funded and fully costed. I would like to see that! I am looking forward to the fight. I am sure the Leader of the Opposition will handle it with the same kind of finesse which has characterised his handling of the Badgerys airport dispute. </DOC>

 - In answer to the member for Jagajaga, the first thing that ought to be pointed out is that this government in its higher education policies is doing a number of things. Firstly, it is expanding the number of HECS places, including fully funding 25,000 marginally funded, overenrolled places, a policy now adopted by the Australian Labor Party. There are a further 6,500 to 7,000 additional places in the first five years. -  - In addition to that, unlike the Australian Labor Party, on this side of the parliament we believe that Australian citizens should at least have the same rights as foreign students who come to Australia. On this side of the parliament we actually believe that a student that gets 99.2 for year 12 is gifted and has done academically well, and if they do not get a HECS place then they ought to have the choice of taking up a fee-paying place, as does a student from Beijing or Jakarta. We strongly believe in that.In addition to that, the government's package includes $161 million for scholarships for 25,000 students, to support their education and their accommodation costs scholarships. The Labor Party celebrates its proposed changes to income support arrangements: $125 million. In other words, students are $35 million worse off under Labor in terms of their support when they are at university.  The last thing that ought to be pointed out is that there has been no stronger advocate of deregulating universities than the shadow Treasurer, the member for Werriwa. For example, the member for Werriwa said in The Enabling State:Our universities will never be able to realise their potential without greater freedom and diversity ... And in an address to the University of Western Sydney on 11 November 1999 he even named the universities that he thought ought to be fully deregulated with full fees.An honourable member - Name them! - I suppose I could. - He actually went through and named them all, but he said: Australia's universities can never realise their potential as network organisations without greater freedom and diversity in the sector. He said:Policy makers need to recognise the diverse means by which Australia's universities might be resourced. We need to move from a unified system to a mixed system.Then he talked about different types of universities and he talked about `a group of internationally focused institutions'. He included Sydney University, Melbourne University, Adelaide University and the University of Western Australia, and - listen to this - he said:Their fees would be deregulated, with the equity role of government pursued through publicly funded, means tested scholarships.  He mentioned Queensland, Macquarie, Monash, Adelaide, Western Australia. It is rampant hypocrisy and opportunism for the opposition now. Having had policy courage when he was on the back bench saying what he thought ought to really happen, the member for Werriwa, the shadow Treasurer, now comes onto the front bench and he is captive to the crippling ideologues of the left.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Forde for her question and her continuing interest in the health and wellbeing of her constituents and people throughout Australia generally. As she indicated in her question, based on a recommendation from the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Com-mittee the government has accepted three new listings, from 1 July this year, for drugs or medications for the treatment of serious conditions. The first drug, rilutek, is for the treatment of a form of motor neurone disease. The second listing will extend the current PBS listing for mabthera to allow treatment in patients 60 years and over who have an aggressive form of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The third drug, enbrel, is used for the treatment of children and adults with severe forms of rheumatoid arthritis.These treatments will add, over the course of some four years, an additional $250 million to the cost of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme in Australia. The cost of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme has risen from about $1 billion in 1991 to some $4.5 billion currently. Indeed, over the past four years the cost of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme in providing a range of medications and treatments to all Australians has increased by some 60 per cent. The honourable member for Forde asked me what is being done to ensure that the scheme continues to be affordable to all Australians. In this regard, the government is seeking to do two things. Firstly, it has recently made changes to ensure that the real cost of the pharmaceuticals or the medications is available on the label to the users of these products. The reasons for this are: to indicate that overall it works out that, for every dollar we pay for PBS subsidised med-icines, the Australian taxpayer pays on average some $5; to encourage in the prescription, taking and using of medications the most responsible use of these medications generally; and to let people understand what the real costs are so far as the taxpayer is concerned. Secondly, and importantly, this government has sought to ensure that the patient contribution to the cost of these medications is reasonable in the circumstances, particularly the circumstance of the increase from $1 billion to $4.5 billion in the cost of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme.As new and expensive drugs come online, there will be an increasing demand over the years from the community - appropriately - for the availability of these drugs. These three drugs which have just been listed, as I said, will cost some $250 million extra to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme over the next four years. In that regard, this government has had legislation before the Senate for some time now to make a small increase in the patient contribution towards the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. The reason that this stands in danger, and the reason that the continued sustainability and viability of reasonably priced medications being available to all Australians - not just the very wealthy, but all Australians - stands in danger, is that the Labor opposition in this place has got its head in the sand about these particular changes. It is not prepared to make changes which will make this scheme sustainable for the next 50 years and into the future.This is a Labor Party that is only interested in those that can afford to pay. It is only interested in millionaires, rather than ordinary Australians, having the availability of medications. This is a party that is simply reactionary and opportunistic, a party which has no concern for ensuring that these medications and those which will come online in future will be available to all Australians.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Petrie for her question and for the interest she shows in this important issue for Australia. In response to the honourable member for Petrie's question, I am very pleased to inform the House that the Guadalcanal militant leader Harold Keke surrender-ed into the custody of the Solomon Islands regional assistance mission on the Weathercoast of the island of Guadalcanal earlier today.The surrender of Harold Keke - and, I understand, three of his associates and some family members - results from discussions that Nick Warner, the special coordinator; Ben McDevitt, the senior Australian Federal Police officer in the Solomon Islands; and John Frewen, the lieutenant colonel, had recently with Harold Keke. As I said, three of Harold Keke's senior lieutenants have been taken into custody. Importantly, the weapons collection process in the Solomon Islands continues to work very well. In this particular case 40 weapons, including 28 high-powered weapons, were handed over subsequent to the surrender by Harold Keke. These weapons were handed over by villagers and militants from Keke's area. This opened the way to establishing a police post on the Weathercoast, which not surprisingly was an outcome very much sought by the people of the area.Harold Keke and his associates are now being transported from the Weathercoast to Honiara aboard HMAS Manoora. They will be transferred to a secure location on remand. The regional assistance mission - RAMSI, as we call it - will ensure that Harold Keke is kept securely, is protected while in custody and receives all the rights and privileges accorded to him under Solomon Islands law. Keke has been arrested on an outstanding warrant for robbery. A full investigation of the crimes, including murder, allegedly committed by Harold Keke and his group in recent times can now proceed. Keke's activities have caused a great deal of anxiety and fear for many Solomon Islanders over recent years. In early July we provided quite a lot of assistance to people from the Weathercoast in order for those people to be able to sustain their own living. The surrender by Harold Keke sends a very clear message to other militants in the Solomon Islands that there remains no excuse whatsoever for not handing in guns before the end of the current gun amnesty on 21 August. This is a very important development in the life of the Australian led mission in the Solomon Islands. It is a very great success that the mission has, in the end, been able to persuade Harold Keke and his lieutenants to surrender and that 40 weapons have been handed in, including some high-powered weapons. It is an illustration of the simply extraordinary success of the intervention mission at this stage. Today's events - which are the greatest success so far achieved by the intervention mission - lead one to conclude entirely reasonably that this mission is moving ahead much more successfully and effectively than ever we could have anticipated or hoped.</DOC>

 - In answer to the honourable member's question, I have not read that document, so I cannot tell her whether what she asserts to be a fact is a fact. But what I can tell her from my certain knowledge is a fact is that the Commonwealth has offered to increase health funding to public hospitals by 17 per cent in real terms over the next five years. That represents an increase of $10 billion. I can also tell her as a fact that, because of the introduction of our 30 per cent tax rebate for private health insurance, we have taken a massive load off the public hospital system of Australia. I can also tell her as a fact that neither the member who asked the question nor her leader can guarantee to the 45 per cent of Australians who have private health insurance that if Labor were to win the next election their tax rebate would be safe. - Good health policy in this country requires a contribution from both the public and the private sector. This government, in the 7½ years we have been in power, have not only increased support for public hospitals; in fact, over the last five years we have contributed more to the support of the states' public hospitals than they themselves have done. Despite the fact that the public hospital system of this country is owned and operated by state governments, we have been more generous than the states have in the funding of them. The reason why the states have not signed the health funding agreements that we have sent to them is that thus far the states of Australia have been unwilling to match the increase in funding that the Commonwealth has offered.There is this extraordinary situation where the Commonwealth, which does not operate the hospitals, is offering to increase its money by 17 per cent in real terms to guarantee the real-terms funding that they now receive and to give the 17 per cent if the states will match the increase. But so far not one state, not one territory, has been willing to match the increase that the Commonwealth has offered, despite the fact that it does not run these hospitals. They are not Commonwealth hospitals; they are state government hospitals. Every day that Mr Beattie, Mr Carr, Mr Bracks, Mr Bacon, Dr Gallop and Mr Rann refuse to sign those agreements, they are putting at risk the availability of hundreds of thousands - indeed, millions - of dollars extra for the patients of public hospitals. So I would say to the member for Lalor that good health policy in this country depends on having a private and a public contribution. We have made a generous public contribution. We are willing to increase our money by 17 per cent. We have brought in a private health insurance rebate. I can assure the 45 per cent of Australians who have private health insurance tax relief that it is safe under a re-elected Howard government. It would be in danger under an elected Crean government.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for La Trobe for his question. I think he has done a marvellous job in representing the electorate of La Trobe. All of us will regret very much the press release he has put out to say that he will be retiring at the next election. I am very disappointed that he has done that, because he has been a great member. He is a great bloke as well.Honourable members - Hear, hear! -  - We love quite a lot of you, by the way, because you are so completely incompetent. - Mr Speaker, to get to the serious business here, last night on the basis of new and concerning information my department amended its travel advice for Indonesia. Given the priority the government places on the safety and security of Australians travelling abroad, it is important to emphasise the key elements of this advice. I think the House generally would be quite interested in this because this is a very important issue that gets to the heart of the security of Australians who might be travelling to Indonesia or are in Indonesia. My department continues to recommend that Australians defer non-essential travel to Indonesia. The message to defer non-essential travel is a serious one contained in fewer than 20 of my department's 139 country-specific advisories. In response to this new information that terrorists continue to plan attacks, Australians should avoid international hotels in Jakarta. This advice is based on new information which has led to an assessment that any international hotel in Jakarta could well be an attractive terrorist target. I remind the House that terrorists may also target other, what are sometimes called, soft targets, including shopping centres or identifiably Western businesses.I strongly recommend that Australians in Indonesia, particularly those in Jakarta, closely heed this advice. The travel advice for Indonesia also continues to recommend to Australians that they exercise extreme caution throughout the country, especially in commercial and public places frequented by foreigners, and that caution should be exercised in particular in Jakarta, including the central business and embassy districts. Australians still planning travel to Indonesia should consider whether their travel is essential. Any Australians in Indonesia concerned for security should consider departing. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade continues to monitor closely the travel advice for Indonesia and will continue to review its advice in light of all new information about possible threats to the safety and security of Australians in that country. I would urge Australians to heed all aspects of my department's travel advice, particularly those in Jakarta at this time.</DOC>

 - What I would say in reply to the Leader of the Opposition is that I have said, and I repeat, that the issue of a particular shipment by Trafigura was not discussed and there is nothing in the question or indeed in anything that has been drawn to my attention that would contradict that. - The Leader of the Opposition is at liberty to continue asking this as long as he likes, and I will be very happy to continue to respond as long as the House pleases. What I have said repeatedly is that the context of the question, initiated by the member for Chisholm, was about a particular shipment and that was not discussed in our meeting on 1 August. As to any commercial negotiations, that is a matter that the Leader of the Opposition will need to pursue with the companies. I am not answerable for commercial negotiations of Manildra or indeed any other company. While I am on my feet on the subject, it appears that the Leader of the Opposition's question could well be sourced from the front page story of the Sydney Morning Herald this morning, which of course is a real authority when it comes to stories on ethanol. The author of this particular story was exposed as telling porkies by one of his fellow columnists. -  - He was. It took Paul Sheehan of the Sydney Morning Herald -  - That particular story, in a rather extraordinary fashion, carried the headline `PM's officials labelled as spies'. Apparently, if a government is considering a policy change which is designed to protect the interests of an Australian industry, it has become some kind of political crime to find out the facts. The reality is that this government went to the last election with a policy of increasing the use of biodiesel from domestically produced sources to 350 million litres by the year 2010. The policy context in which the decision was taken on 10 September last year and announced by me on 12 September last year was the threat to the implementation of that policy by large shipments of ethanol from a heavily subsidised industry in Brazil. That was a policy rationale. Of course, as always happens in situations like these, some companies are advantaged and some companies are dis-advantaged. It is no secret that Manildra - which has invested, I am told, something in the order of $250 million in an ethanol industry in this country - was a beneficiary. So indeed was CSR and so potentially would be other companies with the benefit of the capital subsidies that were announced at the time of the last election and reaffirmed by the Deputy Prime Minister - so would they. Before we took that decision we would have to know the facts about the importation - and of course inquiries were made. It was an entirely legitimate use of our post in Brazil to make those inquiries. To the suggestion that in the implementation of a policy like this in making those inquiries we were spying on the commercial activities of the company, as alleged by the managing director of Trafigura, could I simply say, in relation to that gentleman's complaints, that it was such a secret that he himself on 27 August - apparently two days after the inquiries were made by the Australian Embassy in Brazil - told a member of the Minister for Trade's staff of the pending importation. So it could not have been such a deep dark secret. The other observation I would make is that in the same article he indicated that he had written to me and had not received a reply. I have checked on that and I am advised that the letter he wrote to me was replied to on my behalf and fairly speedily. I also noticed that the opposition parties in the Senate are proposing to block an excise measure. I simply point out to them that if you do that you will inflict damage on Australian industries and potentially cost Australian jobs. - Yes.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Dawson for her question. We are all well aware - all too well aware - of the risks posed to aviation security by terrorist activity in both our region and more broadly across the globe. We tightened aviation security very significantly and very, very quickly after 11 September 2001 and the events of that date. We have introduced significant new measures since then, and they include tighter airport access control, enhanced passenger and baggage screening, the placing of air marshals on domestic flights, an increased Australian Protective Service presence at airports and working with the industry to introduce 100 per cent international check baggage screening by the end of December 2004, a year ahead of ICAO deadlines. We have also moved to introduce a domestic check bag screening capability by the same date. There are also proposals now being implemented for more stringent background checking for holders of aviation security identification cards - ASIC cards as they are known - including the introduction of politically motivated violence checks. The ASIC scheme is also being extended to cover all airports where passenger screening is mandated.Despite these and other significant measures that have been introduced, I want to stress - and I think this is reassuring for the public; they would expect it and I want to reassure them that we do this - that we are constantly examining, re-examining and reviewing the adequacy of the system we have in place to ensure that it is as effective as it can possibly be. Naturally, this is judged by reference to the best and the most recent intelligence that we can obtain from our security agencies. As part of the continuous review process, as the PM has indicated today, the government has asked the Secretaries Committee on National Security - or SCONS as it is known - to undertake an assessment of our aviation security sys-tem. That assessment will form the basis for advice to the National Security Committee of Cabinet. SCONS will draw on intelligence, border control, transport, policing and technology expertise from across the Commonwealth as part of its assessment process. Amongst other things, that committee will examine the latest intelligence and what its implications are, how immigration and border control and airport security arrangements contribute to an effective system, which of our existing arrangements we might need to change or augment or make less predictable to meet the emerging threats, what new technologies - and they are rapidly emerging and evolving - might be appropriate for us to consider and whether we need to expand our existing system, and if so how. I do want to stress that this is an absolutely high priority for the government. The work will proceed promptly and we will respond as quickly as possible and take whatever action is deemed necessary to ensure that our aviation security arrangements are as tight and as effective as we can humanly make them.</DOC>

 - The shipment of Trafigura was not discussed. There was a general discussion about many aspects of ethanol policy. The position of domestic ethanol producers would have been part of the discussions. I think there are matters relating to a takeover that is unrelated to this particular issue, and they were discussed. Certainly there were various competitors in the market, but at that time I had absolutely no knowledge of a pending shipment from Brazil of ethanol. What is more, I have been informed that at the time that the government first became aware that there was going to be a shipment from Brazil it was, in the knowledge of the officials to whom I have spoken, the first occasion that imports of ethanol had ever come into the calculations so far as Australia was concerned. And that is the significance of the policy that I quoted to you in answer to the first question. You see, we did go to the last election with a policy to boost the amount of ethanol and other biofuels. In our policy, Biofuels for Cleaner Transport, there is the following paragraph:The Coalition will set an objective that fuel ethanol and biodiesel produced in Australia - not produced in Brazil, not produced in China, not produced in America, but produced in Australia - from renewable sources will contribute at least 350 million litres to the total fuel supply by 2010.That was the driving policy reason for the action taken by the government. That is the reason. That is the reason we took the decision. But the Leader of the Opposition, as I said in answer to the first question, can ask as many questions as he likes. The pending shipment from Brazil was not discussed, because I did not know about it, and to the best of my understanding - but you would have to ask Mr Honan - neither did Mr Honan.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Sturt for his question on such a significant day in the parliamentary year. I can inform him that the recent NAB business conditions index, which was released yesterday, rose six points to a reading of plus 14, the highest since November of last year, which the NAB noted was consistent with the ongoing strength of the local non-farm economy - growing, they said, at four to 4½ per cent.In addition to that we had released today, on this significant day in the parliamentary calendar, the Westpac consumer sentiment index. Although it showed that there had been a fall of around 3.4 per cent - and that was coming off nine-year highs - the consumer sentiment index was at a high of 112.5 per cent, about 12 per cent above its long run average. As Westpac noted, part of the fall could be due to a correction from previous months, partly it could be due to reaction to employment figures and partly it could be due to reaction to the bombing at the Marriott hotel in Jakarta.These indications of the strength of consumer sentiment are consistent with ongoing retail strength and, indeed, record motor vehicle sales in Australia. I would just like to underline this point. Last year there was an all-time record for motor vehicle sales in Australia, and the sales of motor vehicles for July 2003 were higher than for July 2002, when we had the all-time record. So it could well be that Australia is now coming up for a second all-time record in relation to motor vehicle sales. What has underpinned that? The fact that one million additional jobs have been created means that people are in work and can afford to buy motor cars. Secondly, of course, lower interest rates make it easier to buy motor cars. But thirdly - and let us not understate this - the tax reform which this government implemented was one of the biggest benefits to the motor vehicle industry that there has ever been in this country. We abolished a 22 per cent wholesale sales tax and replaced it with a 10 per cent GST - and in relation to fleet sales the tax rate is zero, because business gets all GST reimbursed. So for fleet sales you came from a situation where Australian producers were paying 22 per cent tax to a situation where they are paying zero. No wonder fleet sales for Australian manufacturers have been so strong and the motor vehicle industry has been running so strongly. Of course, all tax reform in this country was opposed by the Labor Party. If the Labor Party had had its way the Australian motor vehicle industry would not have had the benefit of tax reform. I was asked what other policies have underpinned our strong results. - Yes, taking taxes off exports was also part of it, and if the Labor Party had been successful we would still be taxing exports in Australia today. A big part of the story was -  - The member for Swan defies logic, Mr Speaker, not just the chair, if I may say so. A big part of it was also the way in which this government underwrote a fiscal policy. I said earlier that Saturday week ago Paul Kelly had a piece quoting the new shadow Treasurer as `discovering fiscal rigour'. Unlike the Howard government, Labor was the party of the budget surplus, not the deficit. Poor old Paul; his hands must have been shaking as he tried to type those words. This is a Labor Party that had $80 billion worth of deficit, and this government has turned it around and reduced Commonwealth debt to GDP to five per cent. I want to explain to the House that, notwithstanding all those changes, Labor has not discovered fiscal rigour - not for a moment. If you want any evidence of that, look at the questions that were asked here in question time. What were they about? They were about more spending on health care agreements. Where is the fiscal rigour in that? This is a government which has increased spending by $10 billion - a 17 per cent real increase. The shadow minister says that it is not enough and Labor is going to be the party of fiscal rigour. We have a situation where all the Labor Party - the frontbench and the backbench -  -  - with the shadow minister now intervening - want more spending and the shadow Treasurer wants to criticise the government over fiscal rigour. It is schizophrenic. Two spaces up the frontbench and we are into the height of schizophrenia in a political policy. You can either be for fiscal rigour and support the government's moves on health care funding, or you can be for health care funding, in which case you do not stand for fiscal rigour. But please let us know which side of the street the Labor Party want to walk, because we will meet them on either and we will do them on either, because there is only one side that stands for decent economic policy in this country and it is the coalition government. </DOC>

 - The position is that on 1 August, when I met Mr Honan, we did not discuss pending imports of Brazilian ethanol either generically or the specific Trafigura shipment. That is my recollection and that is what the record shows. - The record does not show that. The record that has been released says that the Manildra Group has engaged Ernst and Young to develop a model for the introduction of a renewable fuel policy and it seeks particular policies designed to help producers in relation to competition with the cheaper Brazilian product. That does not of itself -  - I do not for a moment suggest that there was any reference in that meeting to pending imports, either generically or the Trafigura import. I did not suggest that. The reference I made in an earlier answer to the advice that I received -  - I repeat what I have said from the beginning of this series of questions. Importations of ethanol from Brazil, either the particular importation with Trafigura, which was the starting point of the questions, or indeed generically, were not discussed. That is the case. - The note does not mention imports.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Corangamite for his question. I regret to inform the House that the Labor Party's dishonest anti-ethanol campaign, a campaign which has nothing whatsoever to do with good policy and everything to do with grubby politics, has now claimed its first victims - not the Prime Minister; the victims are 50 innocent workers who are losing their jobs because of the pressure that this industry has been placed under by the Leader of the Opposition. In this parliament the Labor Party think that they are putting pressure on the Prime Minister, but out in the real world they are hurting the ordinary workers whom they say they are pledged to defend. I ask members opposite: what really counts - hairsplitting about who met whom or protecting the jobs of Australian workers and supporting a good Australian industry? I have a letter here from the Manildra Group which says:I write to inform you that as a consequence of the Australian Labor Party's continuing attacks on the biofuel industry, in particular ethanol, and the anti-ethanol campaign being waged by the four big oil companies, the Manildra Group has reluctantly made the decision of severely reducing the operations of its Melbourne Altona production facility. As a consequence of this reduction, some 50 people will be made redundant over the next several weeks. The reduction in production output at this plant and the loss of so many jobs, with the potential of further redundancies, can be laid squarely at the feet of the federal opposition and, in particular, the honourable Simon Crean.It was not always thus. Back on 2 November 2001, Dick Honan had a secret meeting with the Leader of the Opposition at which the Leader of the Opposition pledged to support the ethanol industry. I note that in that year Manildra gave $55,000 to the Australian Labor Party. Not only that, but in 1993 the Leader of the Opposition, the then minister for primary industries, had several secret meetings with Dick Honan and the Manildra Group. As a result of those secret meetings, he agreed to provide the ethanol industry with the highest level of support it has ever enjoyed - an 18c a litre ethanol bounty. I call on the Leader of the Opposition to come clean about his dealings with Manildra and to release all documents and all communications between him and the Manildra Group and, in particular, to reveal all financial donations from Manildra to the Australian Labor Party, including recent financial donations. This is not just about the 50 jobs in Lalor, about which the member for Lalor has been conspicuously and cowardly silent; this is about 900 jobs around Australia - 900 jobs that are being sacrificed on the altar of the political expediency of the Leader of the Opposition. Nine hundred jobs, $143 million a year in exports and a $350 million investment are all being sacrificed because of an unholy alliance between the Leader of the Opposition and big oil. What else can we expect from the Leader of the Opposition, who will betray any friend, sacrifice any principle and destroy any job if it helps him to keep his own job? - Let me say that the member for Werriwa should be catching a taxi for that. The fact is that this is a Labor Party utterly without principle and utterly without commitment to jobs. This is a Labor Party which puts politics first, jobs second and principle last.</DOC>

 - That was a legislative restriction that was demanded by the federal opposition. In support of that 10 per cent cap, members opposite -  -  - It was a legislative restriction demanded by members opposite and supported by a series of lies peddled by members opposite, including the lie that engines have been damaged by ethanol-additive petrol when in fact it was kerosene, as the member for Fraser well knows. In fact, if anyone in this parliament has misled it, it is the member for Fraser. I ask the member for Gellibrand, who will represent the 50 workers at the Altona plant who will soon lose their jobs - she will represent those workers after the next redistribution - what does she say to those workers who have lost their jobs because of the insane political campaign being run by the Leader of the Opposition?</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and again acknowledge his very real interest in the reopened and unnecessary furore of interest around the Sydney area, inside and outside the basin, about the ALP's desire to find a second airport site. Despite the fact that it is obvious that it will not be needed in the foreseeable future and, indeed, may never be needed, the opposition is still pressing on with its search.One option that I am concerned about, I would have to say, is that they might be considering expanding the Richmond Air Force base. The existing runway there is not long enough to handle a Boeing 747 aircraft, so the airport would be of little use in its current form. It could be extended, the member for Batman, I am sure, will be interested to know. He is feigning non-interest now in a second airport facility - it has gone a bit wrong. It could be extended. However, that would involve demolishing part of Richmond or Windsor. You could move it another way. There is a minor obstacle to the west of the airport, which would make it unsafe for passenger aircraft operations, and that is the Blue Mountains. You could move them, or part of them. The other option would be to build a new runway extending south-west across the Richmond-Windsor road, and aircraft landing on the new runway from the south would fly directly over Penrith at 3,000 feet. That, too, presents some technical problems.In short, I want to say that there are very good reasons for rejecting Richmond, along with the sites that I nominated yesterday - there are a few to work through. Richmond, I want to note today, ought to be rejected, but I fear - and the residents of Richmond fear - that the Labor Party's new site selection committee, site selection committee No. 6, will want to look at it closely. My fears, I think, are well founded, because Labor's policy process here is exactly in line with the six stages that pundits say badly managed projects are sometimes said to go through. The first is wild enthusiasm; the second is total confusion; the third is utter despair; the fourth is the search for the guilty; the fifth is the persecution of the innocent; and the sixth is the promotion of the incompetent.Labor is currently at stage 4, which is the search for the guilty. That is where they are at the moment. We have already seen the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Batman in a wild state of excitement and enthusiasm. They had identified the greatest electoral winner of all times for the Sydney basin. So there was great, wild enthusiasm at first. That was immediately followed by total confusion for the member for Grayndler because, as he pointed out, Labor's policy was, in his words, `an example of a bad policy process leading to bad policy'. He said: The fact is that people such as myself and other members around Sydney airport were not consulted about this policy. And neither, astonishingly, it emerged, was the elder statesman of the ALP, the Premier of New South Wales. He went on radio after the decision and said that he had not spoken about it to the federal Labor Party either. That produced the next stage. On Monday we heard utter despair in the voice of the member for Sydney, who said:... I think it was the wrong decision to make. I have been open about the fact that I thought all along it's the wrong decision to make but, you know, all I can deal with is what I've got in front of me ...The opposition has now moved on to stage 4 - that is, the search for the guilty. The member for Batman, having made a complete mess of advising his leader not only on transport policy but on the politics of the Sydney region, is now claiming that it is all Bob Carr's fault. In the Sydney Morning Herald this morning he said:Having succeeded in removing Badgerys Creek from consideration, the Carr Government must now accept its responsibilities in helping to find and protect a new site.So the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Batman decided they wanted to look for a new second airport, even though Sydney does not need one. They did not consult their colleagues; they did not consult the New South Wales Labor government. The Leader of the Opposition did not consult Labor's elder statesman, Bob Carr, which is just amazing when you stop and think about it. At least the Leader of the Opposition now knows that his adviser on transport is not up to it in either policy terms or political terms, and we hope he will take notice of that. But now we suddenly find that it is all Bob Carr's fault. All I can say is that we will be waiting with very great interest for the remaining two stages of the Labor Party's site selection process, which I remind the House are the persecution of the innocent and then the promotion of the incompetent. But you would have to say that it is very obvious that they have already started promoting the incompetent.</DOC>

 - I stand by what I have said before - that there was no discussion of generic imports or indeed specific imports, meaning particularly the Trafigura shipment. I would simply add that the reason I did not disclose that meeting in September of last year was that the series of questions was asked in relation to a pending shipment by Trafigura. I remind the Leader of the Opposition and I remind those who are disagreeing with what I am saying that, after that meeting took place - indeed, about three weeks after that meeting took place - the character of this issue was changed when, amongst other things, a representative of the Biofuels Association got in touch with various ministers and got in touch with my office and the managing director of Trafigura spoke to Mr Vaile's staffer, and all of them said, `There's a shipment coming from Brazil.' It was knowledge of that which provoked Mr Honan to write to me on 28 August. If Mr Honan's discussion with me on 1 August had surrounded this shipment from Brazil, why would he have written to me in the terms that he did almost four weeks later drawing attention to this? The reality is that Mr Honan had been lobbying for a lot of things. Some of the things that Mr Honan had been lobbying for the government agreed with. He obviously lobbied us after he heard about the Trafigura shipment for something along the lines of the policy change that was made - there is no secret about that - and his company was clearly a beneficiary. Because the excise exemption was removed for everybody and a producer's subsidy confined to the domestic producer, Trafigura suffered and Manildra benefited, just as in relation to the 10 per cent cap on ethanol Manildra has suffered. That is obviously the case.But that does not alter the fundamental assertion I make, which is the gravamen of the whole debate that is going on around this. The reason I assert that I did not mislead the parliament is that, when I was answering those questions in September of last year, I had in mind the trigger for the whole series of questions - and that was the reference to the Trafigura shipment. I can understand why the opposition would want to pursue this. It is a perfectly legitimate thing to do, and I do not seek any quarter in relation to that.But let me assert very firmly to this place and to the Leader of the Opposition and to all members of the House: I have never set out in my parliamentary life to mislead this parliament. I have never set out to mislead this parliament. I believed, when I was answering those questions, that I was answering questions relating to a decision that we took on 12 September to remove the fuel excise exemption and to bring in a production subsidy. That is why I answered as I did. That is why I repeat to this parliament that, when I saw Mr Honan on 1 August, we talked about a whole range of matters; we did not talk about pending shipments by Trafigura from Brazil, because we did not know about them. That remains the case and nothing the opposition has produced in any way disturbs that defence of mine. I stand by what I have said.</DOC>

 - Thank you to the member for Paterson, himself a former small businessman. Like so many on the coalition side, he has real experience in small business. We still lament the passing from the Senate of Barney Cooney, the last remaining Labor member ever to have worked in a small business. This side of the parliament, the coalition, is committed to reducing or abolishing taxes on small business. That is why we reduced company tax from 36 per cent to 30 per cent. That is why we abolished the debits tax. That is why are abolishing FID. That is why we abolished provisional tax. That is why now, as a result of our tax reforms, nearly 80 per cent of Australians pay no more than 30c in the dollar in income tax. That is why we halved capital gains tax. These are all big wins for small business, and that is because on this side of the House we believe in lower tax for small business. In contrast, you have to judge the Labor Party not on what it says but on what it does. Only yesterday we saw Bob Carr try to make political gain out of some tort law reform in relation to public liability insurance. The truth of the matter is he did nothing about the state taxes on insurance. All he did was mouth off about some initiatives in public liability that are not going to make an ounce of difference. I challenge Bob Carr to go and speak to the small businesses in Port Stephens or in Newcastle or in Sydney, or to go and speak to the owner of the Big Banana in Coffs Harbour and ask him how he has had to try and cope with the challenges of high public liability insurance. - The member for Hotham talks about the Big Banana. Around the world and around Australia there are some big icons - there is a Big Pineapple, a Big Prawn, a Big Banana, and a Big Mistake. The Big Mistake is in the Labor Party. No amount of public liability insurance purchased by the backbench of the Labor Party is going to cover the accidents of the Leader of the Opposition. In the lead-up to the small business ministers' meeting, I thought I should find out a bit more about state taxes and charges on insurance. I commissioned a report from Trow-bridge Deloitte and I asked them to tell me the 18 jurisdictions with the highest taxes in the world on insurance. They came back and they said that, coming in at No. 1, with up to 78 per cent tax on insurance, is Victoria. No. 2 is New South Wales, No. 3 is Tasmania, No. 4 is France, No. 5 is South Australia, No. 6 is the ACT, No. 7 is the Northern Territory, No. 8 is Queensland and No. 9 is Western Australia, followed by South Africa, Germany, the United Kingdom, Canada, the United States, Ireland, Singapore, Hong Kong and Japan. Australian states are charging up to 78c in the dollar in tax on insurance premiums. They are collecting up to 78c in every dollar. So, for any small business in regional Victoria that is paying $1,000 in insurance premiums, $780 is going to Steve Bracks in tax. You would think that a state leader would be apologising to small business. I can tell you what Jon Stanhope, the Chief Minister of the ACT, has said. Get a load of this. His response to the claim that Australian states are charging more tax than anyone else is:While Australia's insurance taxes are high compared to the world, within Australia, the Territory's general insurance rate is competitive with other jurisdictions.He says we have got the highest tax rates in the world but, sure, we are competitive with other jurisdictions! I am happy to table that and I am happy to table my press release warning the Chief Minister of the ACT that someone has stolen his letterhead and put out a hoax press release.</DOC>

 - The decision to remove the excise exemption was taken on or about 10 September. It was a cabinet decision and it was taken on the basis of papers presented to cabinet. The Leader of the Opposition shakes his head. I did not notice the Leader of the Opposition at the cabinet meeting. The reality is that the decision was taken on 10 September. The Leader of the Opposition asserts that Mr Honan knew on or about 28 August. What is the basis of the Leader of the Opposition's assertion? The Leader of the Opposition makes assertions. In his question, the Leader of the Opposition said Mr Honan knew on 28 August. How does he know that? No decision had been taken. - Oh, I see; because he writes me a letter, that is automatically a decision. We took the decision on 10 September. It was taken by cabinet and, I repeat, it was taken against the background of our policy that we took to the 2001 election. Self-evidently, if we had allowed a flood of imports from Brazil we would never have been able to achieve that policy. We may have got the consumption of ethanol and other biofuels up to 350 million litres, but we would never have been able to achieve any gains for the local industry. The reason, fundamentally, in policy terms, why this decision was taken was to ensure that if we were to move towards 350 million litres it would be the local Australian industry that would benefit. That plainly included Manildra, included CSR and in time would have included a large number of other small organisations that were to get the benefit of our capital subsidies.Was Mr Honan lobbying? Yes. Do other business men and women lobby? Yes. Were Trafigura and Neumann disappointed with the decision? Yes. Were they economically affected by the decision? Yes. Were other companies economically helped by the decision? Yes. Every time a government takes a decision that alters the normal flow of the market and affects barriers and impediments you will get some winners and some losers. We had a policy objective which was the background for the decision that was taken. I find the unwillingness of the Leader of the Opposition to accept the value of a policy that helps a local Australian industry quite extraordinary.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Cook for his question. I acknowledge his interest in - and, of course, his very strong support for - our ambitions in our negotiations with the US for a free trade agreement. I am aware of some comments, reported in today's media, made by Undersecretary Grant Aldonas with regard to the PBS. I have had a discussion today with Undersecretary Aldonas. He has, in fact, been on ABC radio today clarifying his position and that of the US in this regard and indicating that that particular story, which was printed this morning, was partially a misrepresentation of his intentions and what he had to say. He has said that the US is not trying to rewrite the Australian health policy and that both the US and Australia need to be sure the existing arrangements deliver the goods for our citizens. We certainly agree with that. He also acknowledges that many of the issues associated with the PBS are not in the scope of the free trade agreement. For the information of the member for Cook, throughout the year we have had lengthy discussions with US negotiators and explained the structure of the PBS and the way it works. That included a number of meetings that I have had with the USTR, Ambassador Bob Zoellick - most recently about two or three weeks ago in Washington - explaining exactly how the system works in Australia. As part of those discussions, I have spent a fair bit of time drawing a comparison between the structure here and the formulatories that work in the US. The US negotiators have a much better understanding of how the system works. To that effect, US chief negotiator Ralph Ives earlier this year said publicly that the US `is in no way going after the PBS'. He went on to say:Let me stress ... that the FTA will in no way affect the basic framework of the PBS or the way medicines are delivered to Australians.Our government's position is very clear, and we have enunciated it on many occasions. Our position is that, whatever proposals the US may put in the FTA negotiations, our government is not going to negotiate away our ability to provide good public policy for the Australian people - and that includes in the area of health. The PBS is recognised internationally as a model system for formulatory management. It provides subsidised access for individuals to a wide range of high-quality, cost-effective medicines at a cost that both individuals and the community can afford.Given that Undersecretary Aldonas is in Australia for the Australia-America leadership dialogue, I will take the opportunity of having further discussions with him in Melbourne on Saturday. Those discussions will include issues surrounding the FTA negotiations and the WTO negotiations. Again, I will reiterate our position on this particular issue, as I have outlined it to both Ralph Ives and Bob Zoellick.I think it is important that the House note that, if there is any threat to the PBS system that operates in Australia today, and the sustainability of the PBS system in Australia today, it does not come from the United States or our proposed free trade agreement but from the Australian Labor Party, which will not pass in the Senate the government's legislation that will ensure the sustainability of the PBS system. That responsibility lies with the Labor Party. If they pass our legislation we can ensure the sustainability of the PBS system. The threat does not come from our negotiations on the FTA.</DOC>

Let me repeat: I am not disguising the fact that we sought information about this shipment. I am not disguising that fact at all. I am not disguising the fact that I like to protect local industry. I like jobs for Australians - I am not disguising that fact. There are a few on your front bench who would secretly agree with me on that.</DOC>

 - It has been a longstanding policy not just of this government but of the previous Australian government that, where we are aware of known people being involved in partner militaries - and I refer in particular to what used to be ABRI and is now TNI - we endeavour not to be involved in any activities jointly with those people. That is the policy of this government, it was the policy, as I understand it, of the last government and we will continue to maintain that policy. Our view, as I expressed it two days ago, is that, where we are aware of TNI members, be they in Kopassus or in other units of TNI with which we may have, through necessity, some degree of cooperation, and where those people have been involved in egregious human rights abuses of one kind or another, then we will not be participating in activities with those people.I make another point: this government believe that it is fundamentally important that we at least do all that we possibly can to protect the security of Australians. We make no apology for the fact that we are prepared to work with those elements in Indonesia -  - that have the greatest capacity to help release Australians who may be taken hostage in that country or who may be part of some hijacking drama -  - We make no apology for working with those organisations to help Australians because, on this side of the House, we are unapologetic about standing up for our national security and the safety of our people. One of the most ironic interjections I think I have heard in a very long time from the rather anti-American Labor Party is the interjection of the member for Griffith, who says, `What about the Americans?' No, sir, we do not take our instructions on this matter from the Americans.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Ryan for his question and for the interest he shows in this issue, which, of course, has been very much in the news in the last 24 hours. The threat from man-portable air defence systems, or MANPADS as they are known in jargon, to civil aviation is real. I think we need to understand that it is a threat which is growing. That is shown clearly in the arrest two days ago of a British citizen allegedly trying to sell MANPADS to terrorists. Also, I think it was very clearly demonstrated when, I think towards the end of last year, an Israeli passenger jet, on taking off from Mombasa in Kenya, was attacked using a MANPAD system. The missile barely missed the aircraft. Mercifully, it did miss it. Between 1996 and 2001, I am advised, 24 aircraft are suspected of being downed or damaged in-flight by MANPADS. I understand that the bulk of these were military aircraft, not passenger aircraft. Nevertheless, it is quite a dramatic statistic. These weapons are capable of shooting down aircraft at ranges of around five kilometres and altitudes of 3,500 metres or around 10,000 feet, but they can be effective at greater distances. Some are resistant to all but the most sophisticated countermeasures. Furthermore, these weapons, which weigh only about 15 kilos when loaded, are relatively easy to use as long as the user has the appropriate training.Stopping the proliferation of these weapons - and especially, of course, stopping these weapons falling into the hands of terrorists - has been a priority for this government and is also a priority for our friends and allies internationally. I acknowledge the presence in the gallery of the British Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs - he and I have been talking about security and terrorist issues over the last day. I know that the British government is particularly forthright in its endeavours to try to stop systems like the MANPAD systems.We are not just working with the British government. Consistent with the strong support on this side of the House for the American alliance, we are working especially closely with the United States in key international arms control fora to control the production, transfer and trade in MANPADs. We have extended our support to a comprehensive G-8 initiative, which took place in June of this year, which includes the adoption of best practice export controls and a ban on transfers to non-state actors. We are also working together to strengthen guidelines on MANPAD controls through what is called the Wassenaar agreement, which is the principal international conventional weapons export control regime. Domestically, Australia applies strict and comprehensive national controls and licence procedures to regulate the import and export of MANPADs and similar weapons. These controls regulate the legal trade, which in turn helps to prevent diversion to non-state actors and terrorist groups.In concluding my answer to the honourable member for Ryan's question, let me say that there is no intelligence to suggest that MANPADs pose an immediate threat to aviation in Australia. But the government and the airline industry - and I know the Deputy Prime Minister, as Minister for Transport and Regional Services, is particularly focused on this - do take this issue very seriously. We have a robust aviation security framework in place in Australia that is comparable to systems in the United Kingdom and the United States. This problem of MANPADs will be assessed as part of a continuous review process to ensure Australia continues to meet emerging threats.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question, which was canvassed yesterday on Ballarat radio. I am sure that your staff were listening in. - Not yours, Mr Speaker. I apologise. I mean the honourable member opposite. This particular woman went to see a Job Network member and placed her resume onto the AJS. On the AJS she said she was interested in defence jobs. She was interested in administrative jobs. Each and every night, the AJS is matching some 60,000 Australians with new jobs and sending them job opportunities - opportunities they would not otherwise know about. Mr Speaker, I can tell you and those opposite that there are literally hundreds, and sometimes thousands, of Australians getting jobs each and every day as a result of the AJS - jobs that they would not have known about. Let us clarify the point about the lady from Ballarat. The fact is that no-one was compelling this woman to go for this job; they were informing her of an opportunity that may have been of some use to her. - I hear the Leader of the Opposition crowing on, as he does, and harping on about age. The fact is that this government do not actually discriminate against age. The fact is that we put the job up and if they want to apply for it they may do so. Clearly, in this instance the woman was not able to -   - The fact is that this system is working well. We have reduced unemployment from over a million Australians to 600,000. We have more jobs on the AJS, creating more opportunities for Australians. It is putting those opportunities into the hands of Australians where they live. We make no apologies for a system that is helping Australians.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and for the way in which he is representing the constituents in the western part of Sydney and the great contribution that he is making, unlike some other members in the western part of Sydney. The government introduced from 1 July 2000 the First Home Owners Scheme, which gives a grant of $7,000 to every person who is buying their first home. Since it was introduced, 482,000 individuals and families have benefited from it and it has paid out something like $3.8 billion.We on this side of the House have been concerned that a large part of that first home owners grant is being soaked up by state governments increasing stamp duties on properties. Since 1996 the increase in stamp duty on the median home in Sydney has been from $6,000 to $16,000, so it has more than soaked up the $7,000 first home owners grant. On this side of the House we have had no difficulty in pointing out this tax slug in all of the Labor states, notwithstanding the extreme discomfort it causes to members opposite. That is why I was very interested by an alternative policy that was apparently announced this morning. My authority is the Sydney Morning Herald, which is always a strong authority on these matters. It reports:While most homebuyers continue to shoulder hefty stamp duty bills, the State Government has granted a big increase in relief from the payment to more than 50,000 public servants.Under this plan, if you are a public servant and you are moved into or out of Sydney, the New South Wales Labor government is going to relieve you of the obligation of paying stamp duty. Under this plan - if it were to come to fruition - you could have two people in the one street with houses worth the same value, where one person who works in the private sector pays stamp duty of $16,000 and the next-door neighbour on the same income pays nothing. This is some kind of new ALP plan to give stamp duty relief to friends of the New South Wales government in the public service of New South Wales. - The member for Werriwa interjects because, of all the schemes I have heard on this, the only one more bizarre is the one he has announced on behalf of the federal Australian Labor Party. He has announced on behalf of the Labor Party that in Sydney you will be eligible for a grant of $12,000. If you happen to be the member for Jagajaga, your constituents will be eligible for $7,000. If you happen to be the member for Gellibrand, your constituents will be eligible for $7,000. If you happen to be the member for Lilley, your constituents will be eligible for $7,000. Under the Australian Labor Party, one class of person - a resident of Sydney - will be singled out for a differential benefit which is denied to the rest of Australia. I say to every one of those Australian Labor Party members, and I am not talking about the dozen deadwood here, outside of Sydney: how are you going to go back this weekend and explain to your constituents that they are worth $7,000 for their grants whereas, because the member for Werriwa comes from Sydney - not Newcastle, not Corio, not Geelong - those constituents are going to be eligible for $12,000? That sounds pretty fair to the rest of Australia, doesn't it! But not only has he put a residential qualification on this, it is only available for specific classifications - what he calls `essential workers'. If you live in Sydney and, he says, if you are a fireman, a policeman or a teacher, you will get $12,000 because you are an essential worker.What about other essential workers? What about the taxidrivers of Sydney? How are they going to afford homes so they can bring people home late at night? The member for Lalor is laughing, Mr Speaker - laughing very loudly. Try and contain it if you can! I will be finished in a moment. What about the other essential service workers? This is discriminatory on the grounds of place and discriminatory on the grounds of occupation. This is another unfunded promise worth $50 million to $100 million, depending on how many essential workers there are. And this is the party of fiscal rigour. Well, the fiscal rigour of the Labor Party is fiscal rigor mortis, going nowhere!</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question and acknowledge her very real interest in the Australian biofuels industry and, for that matter, the very real interest of a lot of the good, honest, decent workers who work in it in her electorate. Our approach to biofuels is aimed at developing ethanol and biodiesel industries in Australia that are commercially sustainable. There are two major aspects to that. The first is to maintain the effective excise free status of ethanol and biodiesel for a period of slightly less than five years now until the end of July 2008 by a production subsidy that equals excise. From 2008 that subsidy will be wound back so that from 2012 ethanol and biodiesel will be subject to the full rate of excise. The second aspect is to provide initial start-up assistance for that industry through capital grants for new plants and new production capacity of ethanol and biodiesel to the tune of a maximum of $37 million. This, plus the requirement that proponents seeking access to that assistance must have their case assessed by Invest Australia and must be able to demonstrate commercial viability in a full excise imposed regime from 2012, sets pretty tough hurdles for the ethanol and biofuels industries. Most proponents, I think it is fair to say, think it is too tough; existing ethanol producers, CSR and Manildra, might say the same. But the underlying aim is that these industries, which many of us believe can make a contribution to a range of things, such as extending Australia's fuel supplies, investment in regional areas and achieving better environmental outcomes, ought to be given a fair stab at establishing themselves in Australia, but on a commercial basis. They are common in other countries; they are often undergirded by mandating and other measures which we are not proposing in Australia.I am asked whether I am aware of alternative policies. I am. I am aware of two very different approaches from the ALP in particular. It ought to be remembered that, in the days of the Keating government, when the present Leader of the Opposition was the minister for agriculture, Labor gave existing ethanol producers, which of course mainly meant the Manildra operation in the electorate of the member for Gilmore, not only full excise relief but also an 18c a litre production subsidy - a very substantial direct cash subsidy. It did not worry the Labor Party then that Dick Honan's ethanol was being sold on the Sydney market in blends, in some cases well in excess of 10 per cent. It did not worry them. Why was that? It was because there were no complaints; in fact they were sold there for about 11 years.Suddenly, in December, just before Christmas, in this place we had a new policy from the Labor Party. Suddenly ethanol was a dangerous fuel. Suddenly blends over 10 per cent had to be banned. Suddenly Labor had found a rash of engine failures being caused by ethanol. So what changed in the Labor Party? We now know that what changed was that they decided to use the Manildra Group and ethanol to launch a political attack on the Prime Minister. That is what happened. That is what changed. We now know, thanks to a seminal story in the Sydney Morning Herald by Paul Sheehan, that the Labor Party set out to find cases where ethanol had caused damage to car engines. We know that Labor deliberately misrepresented those cases to the media. That is what they did. None of those reports could be substantiated, I say to the member for Fraser, and he knows that. You know it but you do not have the courage to apologise. You do not have the courage to set the record straight. Media organisations had the good grace to correct the story. That ought to be acknowledged, but the Labor Party and the member for Fraser have not. Even today - even yesterday - they were intent on carrying forward the falsehood. I note that the member for Fraser made a personal explanation yesterday. He said that every allegation that he raised came to him `bona fides from constituents concerned'. He forgot to say that on 18 December last year he called on the Prime Minister to apologise to Ms Turner and to the hundreds and thousands of other motorists in Sydney who are paying hundreds and, in some cases, thousands of dollars to repair their cars because of what he said was damage caused by ethanol. We remember that Ms Turner, the woman who was mentioned in that doorstop, was at the centre of the most infamous case of misreporting about ethanol - the specific case that was later denied by the Sydney Morning Herald. The repairer, it was confirmed, was a Labor Party plant. Of course, the reference to hundreds of thousands of other cases was totally false, it was ridiculous and it has not been substantiated. The member for Fraser has displayed an appalling lack of courage in this case. He ought to come clean, because they call themselves the champions of the workers. Their attack is putting real jobs in rural and regional areas, where those jobs are needed, at risk - existing jobs and potential jobs in the future. They are not displaying the necessary courage, integrity or decency to acknowledge that the whole scare campaign they sparked off in this place has no legs whatsoever.Labor knows that there is nothing wrong with ethanol. In fact, the Queensland Labor government, as I understand it, is planning to make E10 the standard fuel for its government fleet. Some parts of Labor do not have a problem with Manildra. I know that the New South Wales government has just given the company a 12-month deferral of payroll tax, but the federal ALP in this place continues to scaremonger, its objective being to try to somehow or other finger the Prime Minister with absolutely cavalier disregard for the jobs of decent working Australian men and women.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. I can inform the House that in the days when it was a responsible political party federal Labor certainly did support the ethanol industry, including ethanol blended fuels. For instance, I have a press release from the then minister for resources dated 31 August 1995, boasting that $4.32 million had been given to ethanol producers, including the Manildra Group. Giving money to ethanol producers was so successful, and ethanol blends were so successful, that the then Labor minister boasted:The success of the scheme is indicated by the fact that throughout New South Wales there are over 50 petrol stations selling a fuel-ethanol blend.That is what Labor thought in 1995. There is more: in a speech about alternative energy when he was the minister for primary industry, no less a person than the Leader of the Opposition said: I recently came across a good example from the Manildra Group. In response to environmental pressures, they commissioned a $23 million ethanol plant to use this waste for the production of alcohol for the domestic chemical market. The Manildra Group are currently using a 15 per cent ethanol blend in their diesel engine fleet.The Leader of the Opposition continued:This example demonstrates what can be achieved by finding the right technological solutions to a problem.So, when he was the relevant minister, he thought a 15 per cent ethanol blend was the right technological solution to a problem.Successful Labor leaders, such as Premier Carr and Premier Beattie, still support the ethanol industry. But not federal Labor. Federal Labor will not even accept donations from ethanol producers because, it says, they are dirty money. In 1996 Manildra gave the ALP $25,000, in 1999 Manildra gave the ALP $15,000, in 2001 Manildra gave the ALP $11,000, and in 2002 Manildra gave the ALP $55,000. If Manildra donated in 1996, 1999, 2001 and 2002 how can a donation in 2003 possibly be `out of the blue' as the member for Werriwa says? If the latest $50,000 donation is somehow dirty money which should be returned, when will the Labor Party return the $106,000 it got from the Manildra Group over the previous six years? If Labor now has a policy of returning dirty money, when is it going to give back the $9,880 it got from Mr Dante Tan? If the Labor Party does not accept donations in return for influence, when will it stop taking $5 million a year from the trade union movement?It is quite clear what the Labor Party's anti-ethanol campaign shows: it shows that the Leader of the Opposition will smear any friend, betray any principle and sacrifice any job to score a political point. What it reveals is that the Australian Labor Party is about politics first, jobs second and principles last. I table documents detailing the Labor Party's relationship with the Manildra Group.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, no doubt the member for Werriwa thinks he can obtain political advantage from an article which appeared in the Australian Financial Reviewtoday under the headline `ASIC chief's former partner in sales tax scandal'. The article says that Mr Collie was obviously engaged in tax avoidance activity, back in around 1979, 1980 and 1981. The article says quite clearly:BRW does not suggest that Knott was directly or indirectly involved in the sales tax scheme, nor that he advised on it, took any benefit under it or was aware of Collie's activities in relation to it.It is saying that he worked in a two-man partnership with a partner who was involved in the scheme. There is no allegation of impropriety against Mr Knott and the BRW goes to great -  - There is no allegation of impropriety made against Mr Knott in this article. The BRW, as printed in the Australian Financial Review, goes to great lengths to say that. The allegation against Mr Knott is, at its highest, that he was guilty by association, not that he did anything wrong. BRW says quite explicitly that he did not, but that he came into a partnership with a man after that man had been engaged in the activity. Notwithstanding the grubby attempt by the member for Werriwa to push guilt by association on Mr Knott, I would like to refer the House to some other statements which have been made by Labor Party members in the last couple of days.  -  - Oh, we do not want to hear them? - Senator Stephen Conroy, the shadow minister for financial services, took the opportunity to put out a press release when Mr Knott announced he would be standing down at the end of the year. This is what Senator Stephen Conroy, the spokesman for the Labor Party said:Mr Knott has been an outstanding leader and a dedicated Chairman of ASIC since his appointment, first as Deputy Chairman ... and then as chairman in November 2000. - Senator Stephen Conroy went on to say:Under his stewardship, ASIC has become a world leader in financial services regulation and corporate enforcement. He has steered ASIC through a difficult period in corporate regulation and has had many successes.This is a press release of 12 August 2003. It goes on:Above all, he has fulfilled ASIC's mandate of protecting consumers, investors and creditors, with efficiency and fairness. That was the official statement from the shadow minister responsible in the Labor Party in relation to Mr Knott. Another statement from Senator Stephen Conroy was:He has turned ASIC from a toothless tiger into an effective regulator. I have only ever heard one person attack Mr Knott in this parliament and he attacked Mr Knott because ASIC had the temerity to bring an action against one Nicholas Whitlam. That person was the member for Werriwa. If there was ever any criticism in this place of Mr Knott, it was that under his administration ASIC had been vigilant in bringing legal proceedings. While Senator Stephen Conroy has always supported such vigilance, there is one person in this parliament for whom there is nothing too low to stoop to, and it is the member for Werriwa - as has been proved by this muckraking.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Moncrieff for his question and recognise that he represents a large number of small businesses on the Gold Coast. He is a real fighter for small businesses, as are so many people in the coalition because so many of them actually have experience in small business, unlike the Labor Party, where it was left to Barney Cooney to carry the torch. We miss Barney Cooney over here.As members of the parliament will be aware, the coalition has done a lot to reduce the taxes on small business: reducing company tax from 36 per cent to 30 per cent, abolishing financial institutions duty, abolishing stamp duty on the transfer of shares, reducing the tax on motor vehicles, reducing income tax - and so many small businesses are sole traders - so nearly 80 per cent of Australians pay no more than 30c in the dollar. We have abolished provisional tax - some of us remember provisional tax; many people might have forgotten about that - and a range of other taxes. We are reducing taxes, whereas the Labor Party, unfortunately, tragically, is the party of higher taxes.As I said in the parliament yesterday, the Trowbridge Deloitte report on state insurance taxes indicates that the Australian states have the highest insurance taxes in the world, with regional Victoria collecting up to 78 per cent tax on insurance premiums. The second highest jurisdiction in Australia is New South Wales. In the last couple of days, Bob Carr has said he has beaten public liability premium increases. He should ask the Jillamatong Mountain Muster in the Snowy Mountains, in Eden-Monaro, why it is not in business anymore. He should ask the backpacker hostel at Nambucca Heads in the electorate of Cowper why it is not in business anymore. He says he has beaten public liability insurance premiums. The fact of the matter is that he has not.Labor governments could halve tomorrow every insurance premium in the country if they were serious about doing something about state taxes. It might be the Treasurer's birthday today - and happy birthday to the Treasurer! - but it is state Labor treasurers' birthdays every day. It is Michael Egan's birthday every day, because - get a load of this - just last year New South Wales collected $1 billion more in stamp duty than it expected. This year it is collecting $100 million more in land tax and $200 million more in payroll tax.When it comes to payroll tax, the states are swimming in it. According to the New South Wales State Chamber of Commerce, if a small business with 12 employees employed one more person it would be hit with a payroll tax charge of $36,000 straightaway. So you employ one more person in New South Wales and you can pay up to $36,000 in payroll tax. That is even before Bob Carr extended payroll tax to include extra items such as a superannuation guarantee, and it does not take into account the fact that real wages are increasing but the New South Wales payroll tax thresholds are not increasing at the same time. For the states, this is like a pokie machine that just keeps on paying. At the same time as all these businesses around the country are going out of business because they cannot afford insurance premiums, the states are collecting up to 78c in the dollar in taxes on insurance. Bob Carr and all the state Labor premiers are increasing their tax hike. It is no wonder that small business is abandoning the Labor Party.</DOC>

 - When an appointment is made to a Commonwealth government post, one gets advice from a department, normally one gets advice from the outgoing regulator and, in cases such as ASIC, one consults the states. Can I say that in all of my dealings with the department, with the previous regulator and with the states, not only have they never raised any objections to Mr Knott; in fact they have been very laudatory. - They have not raised any objections, as I have said - none whatsoever. No objections have been raised by either the states or the previous regulator - or indeed by the federal opposition. In fact, quite the contrary: the view has always been and still is, to my knowledge, that Mr Knott was eminently suitable for the job. Not only was he eminently suitable for the job but he performed a first-class job. Senator Stephen Conroy is of that view. Henry Bosch is of that view; he is a former chairman of the NCSC and was quoted in the paper today as saying Knott has done `a great job'; Knott has been `very successful'. Alan Cameron, and I am talking about the checks, Mr Speaker -  - Mr Speaker, as I said, one makes checks with the department, one makes checks with previous regulators. In all of the checks that I have made, Mr Knott has always been warmly endorsed - and warmly endorsed as recently as two days ago by the federal opposition. Can I say I am not aware if it is now opposition policy to believe that Mr Knott is not suitable, because up until the questions were asked by the member for Werriwa the tributes to Mr Knott were flowing from the Australian Labor Party. Now we have the official spokesman of the Australian Labor Party, who believes that Knott has done an outstanding job, and we have the member for Werriwa, who has already risen in this House to complain about proceedings against Mr Nicholas Whitlam now going to the High Court. The Labor Party can make up its mind whether it wants to side with Senator Conroy or the member for Werriwa. If I were a member looking at this, I would think Senator Conroy had a lot more understanding of this particular issue than the member for Werriwa, who may well lead you into a blind alley. I talked about checks with previous regulators. What does the previous regulator, Mr Cameron, say? Mr Cameron, who spent eight years as ASIC chairman, described Mr Knott as a `highly effective' chairman. The President of the Australian Shareholders Association praised him as `heightening awareness of the regulator' and `successfully pushing the corporate governance issue'. Dick Humphrey, the CEO of the Australian Stock Exchange, said:He has held up remarkably well compared with those overseas. Aided by its high reputation for integrity, ASIC under Mr Knott's leadership has contributed significantly to this outcome.Catherine Wolthuizen, the Finance Policy Officer of the Australian Consumers Association, said:Mr Knott has been a very effective regulator at a particularly difficult time for ASIC.Professor Ian Ramsay knows a little bit about the area, Mr Speaker. As I said earlier, what is the allegation that the FinancialReview story makes? They say it themselves in the article; I read it out earlier. They make no allegation against Mr Knott other than that a previous partner of his had been involved in tax avoidance activity, and if a previous partner of his had been involved in tax avoidance activity then that previous partner should bear the full weight of the law. But what is the allegation against David Knott? Guilt by association. Who would you expect in this parliament to run hardest on the issue of guilt by association? The grub that has come to the dispatch box and raised these issues.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Fadden for his question and commend him on his continuing role as Chairman of the Joint Statutory Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD. I am aware that this week's Bulletin cited claims by the opposition's alternative leader, the member for Brand, that Australia's extra investment in intelligence in recent years has been relatively modest. The member for Brand, Labor's alternative leader -  - alleged that Australia's extra investment in intelligence in recent years has been relatively modest. This was apparently backed up by ASIO staffing figures obtained from a research paper obtained by the Parliamentary Library. But the member for Brand's claims are simply wrong. The figures included in the research paper are out of date. The figures do not come close to ASIO's current staffing levels.Let us first look at the astounding claim that this government's funding of intelligence has been modest. The government takes its responsibilities for security very seriously and has significantly increased funding for intelligence and security agencies since 11 September 2001. Since that time, we have increased funding for national security and border protection measures by nearly $2 billion over a five-year period. Two billion dollars on top of existing funding can hardly be described as modest.  - We will get to that point. In fact, the Director-General of ASIO, Mr Dennis Richardson, said on 30 April this year that, since September 11, ASIO has received all the additional funds it has sought. It is true that, in the early to mid-1990s, ASIO's resources were decreased. This downsizing between 1991 and 1995 was of course a result of decisions of the Labor government. Over that period, staff numbers decreased from 727 to 585. The fact that ASIO was downsized in that way, as a result of Labor decisions, seems to have escaped the memory of the member for Brand. But that is not an issue for scoring cheap political points on. The decision to downsize in the 1990s followed the end of the Cold War and was consistent with the downsizing of similar organisations in the United Kingdom and Canada. However, the staff of ASIO, both temporary and permanent, has been growing since 1998. ASIO currently has around 670 staff. Clearly there have been significant changes in the world security environment in recent times, and the pace of recruitment within ASIO has increased. ASIO continues to grow as quickly as its capacity to recruit and train new staff will allow. It is commonsense that you just cannot pull effective intelligence officers out of the air. They need to have appropriate selection processes and training, and that takes time.ASIO anticipates that, over the next two years, the number of staff will grow to about 780 or 790. Contrary to the claims made by the member for Brand, this will bring ASIO back to its size of the mid-1980s. ASIO has received a significant increase in its funding to support the challenges of this new security environment. ASIO's budget - the question that was raised by interjections earlier - has increased by more than 50 per cent since September 11. For the record, it should be noted that the government also increased funding for ASIO in the 2000-01 budget before September 11. The government takes its responsibilities for the safety and security of Australians very seriously. The Howard government's record on security speaks for itself. The member for Brand's latest attempt at relevance is transparent and it is wrong.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, can I come to the last part of the question first. What action will I take to ensure full disclosure of a matter which is on the front page of the Financial Review? I would have thought that was full disclosure enough. It only happens to be on the front page of the Financial Review, which says -  - What is the disclosure about? As the Financial Review says:BRW does not suggest that Knott was directly or indirectly involved in the sales tax scheme, nor that he advised on it, took any benefit under it or was aware of [his partner's involvement in it.]That is the matter. Mr Knott no doubt can defend himself. - Why won't he answer questions? I am sure that if the member for Werriwa wants to make his allegations outside the House he will answer questions - I am sure he will. As it turns out, Mr Knott, before he was the Deputy Chairman of ASIC, worked for APRA as its chief operating officer. Before that, he worked for an executive search company in Melbourne. Before that, he was the CEO of the Commonwealth Funds Management company. He was appointed in 1995. Which government would that have been under in 1995? Before that, he was director of the Australian Financial Institutions Commission in Brisbane, appointed by the states to run their financial regulatory thing. Before that, he worked for Capel Court Investment Bank in Melbourne from 1986 to 1992. Before that, he worked for CIBC in Victoria as a state manager. Before that, he was in Collie Knott and Co. solicitors from 1982 to 1983. Before that, he worked for Arthur Robinson and Co. That is his history. There is no allegation that he has been involved in any sales tax matters. That is his full CV. He was appointed in 1995 to run the Commonwealth Funds Management. I know that this government did not come to office until 1996, so, if there is something particularly heinous about Mr Knott and what he did in 1982 and 1983, wouldn't the people in 1995 have been interested in that? Or, if there were something heinous, wouldn't the states that appointed him to be head of AFIC have been interested in that? Or, if there were something heinous, wouldn't it have been relevant when he went on to APRA? Or, if it were heinous when he went on to ASIC, wouldn't somebody have twigged to all of this - perhaps one of the states that was consulted? Maybe they took the view that the Financial Review did: that he was not involved and did not profit, and that guilt by association is still no longer a disqualification in this country. Maybe they took that view. Guilt by association has never been a ground for disqualification.This is where I really get puzzled, because two days ago the position of the official spokesman of the Australian Labor Party was that Mr Knott had been doing a brilliant job and it regretted that he will be standing down. Today we have the slur from the member for Werriwa. Just put me out of my misery: is it Labor policy that Mr Knott is unfit for office or that he has done a good job? Perhaps we can ask Catherine Wolthuizen from the Australian Consumers Association - she seems to think he has done a good job. But it is not enough for the member for Werriwa, because back in 1982 and 1983, long before Mr Knott held any of these Commonwealth positions or state positions, there was a partner who engaged in tax avoidance. As I said earlier, if he engaged in tax avoidance, he deserves the full force of the law. But there is another principle of our law, which is that, if Mr Knott did not, he is not guilty by association.By the end of the day the Australian Labor Party can make up its mind and issue an official statement, whether it is the Conroy position or whether it is the Latham position, but we are not going to let the Australian Labor Party walk two sides of the street on all of these issues - on the one hand, slur around and then, on the other hand, have their official spokesman talk about what a wonderful job people are doing. We will hold Labor accountable on this.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dawson for her question. I can affirm that this government is committed to the diesel fuel rebate in full - no qualifications. - No new taxes. I know how important that is to the member for Dawson, because the mining industry represents about $1,600 million to the Mackay economy every year - that is, nearly one-third of the regional economy. With the new mine at Hail Creek, employing 90 people, it is only too obvious how crucial mining is not just to that region but, importantly, to the whole of Australia. We know what sort of pressure the mining industry is under - global competition and currency volatility are having an impact - and yet, as a $32 billion exporter and an employer of 83,000 very hardworking people right across Australia, it is the bread and butter of many regional centres. - Is the member for Hotham suggesting they are not educated? Is that what he is suggesting? - That is why many members on this side of the House, in the coalition, are horrified at the Labor Party's proposal to cut the diesel fuel rebate by nearly half a billion dollars to pay for the universities policy they have come up with. That is a new minerals tax of nearly half a billion dollars on mining workers and their families, and it is going to have a real impact on regional communities. - As one example, I want to know how the member for Hunter is going to explain Labor's -  - I do not think he knew. I think he was fighting for preselection. The member for Hunter only won his preselection because I gave him an endorsement. I had to give him a reference to get him over the line.Honourable member - Why did you do that? - I do not know why I did it. It was a flight of fancy; I was crazy at the time. Now that the member for Hunter has won preselection and now that he has got a battle with the CFMEU, I want to know how he is going to explain to the 7,000 people employed in the Hunter region in the coalmining industry how they are going to have to cope with this half a billion dollar mining tax slug from the Labor Party. I wonder how he is going to explain to the 1,500 workers at the Coal and Allied Hunter Valley operations why they have to pay for the education of lawyers and accountants at Sydney University, under Labor's new education policy. And I wonder what the member for Hunter is going to be saying to the 575 Hunter Valley businesses that rely on mining. What is he going to say to them when they are slugged with Labor's new mining tax? Why do they have to pay for a fine arts education or an architect's education, through the Labor Party's new policy? It is an obvious truth that the Labor Party has no regard for the real battlers out there. The Labor Party is not batting for the workers of Australia and it is not batting for regional Australia, and that might explain why the Labor Party holds only six out of 45 rural electorates across Australia.</DOC>

 - On the first point that the Leader of the Opposition raised: I would not describe my contact or the contact of my office as `regular'. Obviously the Leader of the Opposition has a copy of the letter that was released under FOI - which I think is dated 23 August - that was directed to me. Yes, that did alert me to the proposed or alleged or possible importation of ethanol. The government and government officers at that stage were already aware of this proposed shipment. As the Leader of the Opposition is also aware, that was a Friday evening. On Monday the 26th, DFAT, at the request of PM&amp;C, made some inquiries in regard to this allegation about a possible shipment of ethanol from Brazil through the Australian Embassy in Brasilia. - It was not detailed in the letter to me. That detail was there. - It is a matter of the public record. -  - There is no extensive detail, other than the allegation of a possible shipment, in that letter. Obviously, the government was going to make it its business to try to substantiate those allegations that had been made by way of emails and in that correspondence. Of course it is now a matter of the public record. That matter of public record started in a Senate estimates inquiry where information was handed over at the end of last year, my recollection is, in regard to inquiries that were made.In regard to the second point that the Leader of the Opposition has indicated with regard to Neumann's - and I am aware of some comments that have been made about Neumann's - in the discussions or information that was forthcoming, the government ultimately became aware that the shipment belonged to Trafigura. I think the Prime Minister indicated yesterday that one of my staff was actually talking to an executive from Trafigura the following week.In regard to Neumann's, I would like to clarify the time frame of this. I think the Leader of the Opposition indicated I was travelling overseas with a representative from Neumann Petroleum. That is indeed correct. On 7 September, I left Australia leading a business delegation to the Middle East. There were a number of companies involved in that delegation: AWB Ltd, BHP, Santos, Woodside and Neumann's, to name just a few. I was actually in a meeting with the minister for, I think, oil and gas in Teheran on 10 September when cabinet was meeting here in Australia. I was not at the cabinet meeting that took the decision. We departed Iran on 12 September. I think that was the day the announcement was made by the Prime Minister here in Australia. Mr Morton, during the course of that delegation, made no attempt to talk to me about this issue. Obviously, I did not make any attempt to talk to him about a cabinet decision that I was not privy to. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Kalgoorlie for his question and note that I was able to spend some time with him recently in the Kimberley region of the vast state that he represents. The House will be broadly aware that COAG decided and agreed to trial an Indigenous whole-of-government approach where we will seek to work more effectively with the state governments and with local Indigenous communities in a spirit of shared responsibility to address some of the extraordinary challenges that Indigenous communities, especially those in more remote areas, do face. Eight regions thus far have been selected and named. They include Cape York - the Prime Minister has just been up there; Shepparton; East Kimberley, where I have just been; the Pitjantjatjara lands in South Australia; and the Wadeye in the Northern Territory.The objective in some ways might be most neatly summarised by saying that what we are trying to do is to end what could perhaps sometimes be described as a patronising `Canberra/Brisbane/Sydney/Perth/ wherever knows best' attitude: `We have the solutions for you, and you do what we say in the delivery of services and programs and in the development of better ways forward for some of these communities.' We are particularly keen to draw alongside local communities to honour and respect their leadership and the insights and the priorities of those leaders. We want to jointly develop solutions. We want to make certain that we then flexibly and cooperatively deliver programs and services. I feel very strongly that those are worthwhile objectives. So it was that, given that my department is responsible for the coordination of the East Kimberley approach, I found my way up there to a range of places including Halls Creek and Billiluna, which has a very small population of only around 250 people. I do not know how many hours flight in a small plane it is south of Halls Creek, but it is a long way. That is a very big electorate that you represent.We were working with not only the Western Australia government but also local government in a joint approach. We were able to literally sit down together and talk at length in a spirit of cooperation - which is very welcome and represents a tremendous step forward - about some of the issues concerning them: alcohol, substance abuse, health, education for their children and employment opportunities. That great first step of having developed a spirit of cooperation gives us a real sense that, as we are able to progress some of the issues that are concerning them, we really might be able to achieve a lot more than has been achieved in the past. I wish those people well. I know that, as a member, you are committed to them. They face very real challenges. This is an area that rises above politics and is one in which we can and, indeed, must make better progress than we have in the past.</DOC>

I have received correspondence directly from Neumann - from Mr Morton - and I have responded.

 - I thank the honourable member for Indi for her question and acknowledge the effort that she has put in to ensuring that the farmers in her area receive proper assistance during this difficult drought. It has been good to hear reports of significant rainfall around Australia over the last week or two, and that is encouraging. But there are still significant areas of Australia that are facing serious drought. Indeed, around 65 per cent of all agricultural land in Australia is currently receiving federal exceptional circumstances or interim assistance. Since the House last met, there have been a number of new declarations of exceptional circumstances, including central and south-east Victoria; Forbes, Armidale and northern New England; the southern Murweh shire in Queensland; for beef, cattle and sheep producers in the greater Shepparton area; the Campaspe and Moira regions of northern Victoria; and the central north-east and other parts of the Western Australia wheat belt. The addition of those areas to the EC-declared areas has added close to another 10,000 farm families and businesses who can now apply for exceptional circumstances aid.Currently, more than 20,000 Australian farm families have received Commonwealth exceptional circumstances assistance - some 20,600 applications for income support have been approved and a further almost 6,000 approved for interest rate subsidy. This represents a very significant effort. The Commonwealth's commitment to drought would now exceed a billion dollars of real and practical assistance to farmers. I might add that that is actual payments to farmers. It is not a kind of drought aid or bureaucrat salaries dressed up as drought aid - the types of things that some of the states have been endeavouring to demonstrate as their drought aid.In the last 10 months, the Commonwealth has received 53 applications for exceptional circumstances and 42 of those have been processed; the other 11 are at an advanced stage of consideration. Therefore, it is obvious that the Commonwealth is taking this drought seriously and is providing meaningful assistance to farmers in need. Indeed, the effort of the Commonwealth really contrasts markedly with the appalling performance of Labor state governments during this drought. For every $1 that the states are providing for drought assistance, the Commonwealth is providing at least $10 and probably $20. We have got states jointly complaining about the way in which they have been treated but who are doing nothing themselves. In New South Wales, Minister Macdonald has regular press conferences to tell everybody about how serious the drought is. But whilst he is telling everybody about the drought, he is secretly withdrawing the state declarations. In fact, on 4 July in New South Wales the state government revoked drought eligibility for Walgett, Nyngan and Coonamble and the rural lands protection boards. That followed earlier revoking in the areas of Tweed Heads, Lismore, Tamworth, Gloucester, Kempsey, Moree, the northern slopes, Maitland and Narrabri. He revokes the assistance and it is perhaps ironic that, for some of those areas for which he is revoking assistance, he is now demanding the Commonwealth provide exceptional assistance.There is a bit of hypocrisy in that the states think the drought is over and yet they demand that the Commonwealth provides more aid. Of course, in Victoria, which had quite a generous and good scheme for farmers, they axed it immediately the state election was over. From their perspective, once you have not got an election you no longer have a drought. They have got the hypocrisy to be running around demanding again and again that, in electorates like Indi and other places, the Commonwealth provides assistance where the states do absolutely nothing. Shame on Labor for its unwillingness to provide any assistance to farmers in need. We will stand by farmers. We hope the rain continues to spread across the country and provide the best possible relief but, in the interim, we will be there to work with them to ensure that they are able to respond positively and rebuild their businesses after the drought breaks.</DOC>

 - I refute any allegation that public servants did anything to damage any Australian or any Australian business. The public servants involved, as the opposition is well aware -  - were asked to seek information, and they did. Certainly, it is obviously the responsibility of the Public Service and any Australian government to work on the full facts when developing policy, and that has been the case. But, certainly, to make an allegation that public servants set out to damage an Australian business is, I think, a bit outrageous.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. I point out to her, and to members of the House, that in the last five years this government has released 52,700 additional aged care places in Australia. I say two things to her: firstly, when we came to government an independent report of the Auditor-General indicated that there was a shortage of 10,000 aged care beds in Australia - 10,000 left by the Labor Party when in government - and, secondly, we have established for ourselves a target of 200,000 aged care places by 2006, something the Labor Party in government was incapable of doing. We are well on track to reach that target.We hear a lot from state premiers about age and health matters at the present time. Let us contrast the increase in aged care places with the responsibility of the states around Australia to provide public hospital beds. In the last 12 years, the state government of New South Wales, the largest state in Australia, has slashed 6,291 beds from the public hospital system. Let us talk about the record of the current Labor government in New South Wales. Since Mr Carr has been Premier his government has slashed 4,158 beds. In less time than that, we have allocated 13,756 aged care places. If the Labor Party want to compare our record with theirs when in opposition, our record is good. If they want to compare the record in terms of the health care system, perhaps they should go back to their Labor state premiers and health ministers and ask them why they are slashing public hospital beds at the current rate.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Curtin for her question and acknowledge her very real and ongoing interest in these matters, which she raises frequently and with a real passion. There is no doubt that the 34th Pacific Islands Forum was a notable success for the region and quite a watershed in the organisation's history. Regional countries have taken and embraced the opportunity to respond with concrete action to some very real security, economic and governance challenges. This is very welcome and is a significant achievement for the region as well as, I believe, for Australia and for the Prime Minister's leadership.In particular I would note four things. Firstly, forum countries warmly welcome and endorse the Australian led regional intervention in the Solomons. I think that is important. Secondly, there was strong support for the $17 million joint regional policing initiative presented by Australia, Fiji and New Zealand to strengthen police training at all levels in the Pacific. Thirdly, there was an endorsement of the broader objectives of reform and good governance, including a review of the forum secretariat to make it a more effective instrument in the region's affairs. Fourthly, there was agreement to two Australian funded scoping studies into regional aviation and shipping, designed to help the development of regional services on a more economically sustainable basis - very important indeed.There was also a willingness to address other issues such as the increasing threat of AIDS, a discussion in which we were able to announce that Australia would make a contribution of $12½ million over the next five years to the region. In addition to that, as has received quite wide coverage, Australia's candidate, Mr Greg Irwin, was elected to the position of secretary-general of the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat, which I think will prove in time to be a particularly valuable move indeed. That gentleman will bring real expertise, real professionalism and great drive to the position. It was decided, of course, on the basis of merit and in a democratic process. I think the Pacific leaders' support for Mr Irwin represents recognition by forum countries of the significant security and governance challenges facing the region and for the need for the forum and its secretariat to play a stronger role in helping to address these challenges. Commonwealth Pacific leaders issued a statement condemning Zimbabwe in the strongest possible terms. I think what also ought to be acknowledged is that these outcomes are the culmination of real and concerted and long-term efforts by the Prime Minister, by the Foreign Minister, who has worked tirelessly on this, and by senior officials over the last few years to really bring to a high level our effective engagement in the region. They vindicate our strong leadership on regional policy. They provide the forum with new authority, new clout, new relevance and a sound new basis for moving forward, and they also reflect the strong support that the government has been prepared to give in assisting our neighbours to confront and overcome the undoubted challenges that are before them.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question and I notice the very narrow focus of the evidence brought forward to bolster the case - which I think is a very flimsy pack of cards indeed - that the states have been pulling their weight. There is no doubt that we are not going to allow the states and territories to reduce their contributions relative to ours for another five years because, in aggregate, that is plainly what they have done over the last five years. That is what they have been up to. The latest figures from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare confirm that the states' and territories' share in total hospital funding fell by almost four percentage points in the early years of the last agreement.You can only go on for so long pretending that black is white. The reality is that the Commonwealth has offered an increase of 17 per cent in real terms over the five-year term of the upcoming agreements. That translates into an increase of $10 billion - from $32 billion to $42 billion. In anyone's language that is an increase. This is predictable - at this time of the negotiations it is not altogether unexpected for the state and territory leaders to mount this sort of campaign. It is almost a sort of old sport. But I think the Australian people are pretty cynical about the states' ploys in these negotiations. They happen every time, and I think it is time that the state premiers and the territory chief ministers put an end to this ridiculous posturing and get on with what is a very substantial agreement. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Farrer for her question. As she knows, this government has put in place a number of measures to improve Australia's taxation system. This is the government that took taxes off exports, which is of enormous benefit to the farmers of the Riverina district that she represents; and, of course, this is the government which cut fuel excise for transport, which again was of enormous benefit to the farmers of the Riverina and the area of New South Wales that she represents. By abolishing wholesale sales tax, by abolishing bed tax, by abolishing stamp duty on shares, by abolishing financial institutions duty and replacing them with the goods and services tax this government modernised the tax system. But in addition to that, this is the government which cut company tax from 36c to 30c, this is the government that halved capital gains tax, this is the government which cut income tax on 1 July by reducing the 34 per cent and 43 per cent marginal tax rates to 30 per cent and again cut taxes on 1 July this year with this year's budget.This is where we come to the interesting part. There are some days when the Labor Party appears to suggest that taxes are too high in Australia. There are some days on which the Labor Party likes to pretend that budget surpluses are too wafer thin in Australia. And there are other days when the Labor Party likes to complain that the Commonwealth is not spending enough. Let us try to reconcile these propositions: you should take less in by way of tax, you should spend more by way of expenditure and you should have more left over at the end of the process. That is the Labor Party plan: tax less, spend more and have more left over at the end of the process. We have already had two questions today complaining that expenditures are not great enough. You are going to hear a campaign from the Australian Labor Party about how the Commonwealth should be spending more on health because a $10 billion increase - a 17 per cent real increase - is not enough; a $42 billion contract is not enough!Let me try to reconcile these propositions in my mind: spend more and have more left over. What is the real Labor plan on taxes? I will tell you what it is: it is to increase taxes. We heard from the member for Perth, who wanted to increase the Medicare levy earlier on. We have seen how Hawker Britton are pumping out surveys which purportedly show that Australians want higher taxes and want an increase in the Medicare levy. Now we have the ACTU, which is belling the cat, calling a press conference on the weekend saying that Australians want higher taxes. The ACTU just happens to control 50 per cent of the votes at ALP conferences. So we have the ACTU, the member for Perth and Hawker Britton all coming together to demand that the Labor Party increase taxes. We would not mind this proposition if Labor were honest about it. If Labor were honest enough to say, `We want increased spending and we'll pay for it with increased taxes,' that would be a proposition which would be defensible and which we could argue out. But this nonsense that Labor believes taxes are too high, wants to spend more and have more left over at the end of the whole process is a piece of nonsense which ought to be exploded by the press in this country. When the Labor Party was campaigning against the budget, suggesting that it thought taxes were too high, the chartered accountant newsletter of August 2003 had this to say:The Labor Party's attack on the government taxation policy sounds hollow, however, when you learn that it admits it has no intention of cutting taxes were it to regain power. `We want to announce new spending plans and no net reduction in taxes,' a Labor spokesman said.The chartered accountants know it. Everybody who reads Hawker Britton knows it. The ACTU knows it. The only thing is: we want the Labor Party to tell the truth to the Australian public. We want the Labor Party to tell the Australian public that when it goes out and campaigns for increased spending, behind it is an agenda for increased taxes. If the Labor Party does not have the decency to tell the Australian people the truth in relation to that, it cannot be believed on any other issue.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I am not aware of those claims, and I am not going to take them at face value. Unconscionable or unethical behaviour by medical practitioners would never be condoned by the government nor, I would imagine, would it be condoned by the profession. - The Leader of the Opposition interjects, as he is prone to do all the time. He says, `What are we going to do to stop them?' I have not accepted the premise of the question and, until we see some good evidence that such practices are likely to be engaged in, I do not think I would be prepared to do so. I make it quite plain that we believe that A Fairer Medicare is a good and robust package. We want to see its implementation. We are about trying to preserve something that we believe is important to Australians. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Page for his question. I recognise the interest he shows in this issue in asking the question. As both the Prime Minister and I said at the end of last week, we warmly welcome the arrest of Hambali. Prime Minister Thaksin of Thailand has now confirmed that Hambali was captured in Thailand in a joint operation with the United States. I want to take the opportunity to congratulate the United States, in particular the Central Intelligence Agency, as well as the various Thai authorities for the excellent work they have done. The success of the Thais working with the CIA illustrates a very good point - that is, the importance of the United States remaining heavily engaged in the region. The CIA plays a very important role, if not the central role, in the war against terrorism in our part of the world. We are grateful for that. We are not ashamed to say so.It also illustrates a point that in South-East Asia there is no such thing as a safe haven for terrorists anymore. Hambali is now being held by the Americans and is being interviewed. As honourable members may have read in the newspapers this morning, his wife, who is a Malaysian national, has been handed back to Malaysian authorities. We are already in discussion with the United States on the interviews they are conducting with Hambali, and we will have the opportunity to direct questions to Hambali. Obviously, details of the interrogation are not the sort of thing that we are going to make public, and I think the House would understand that only too well.Hambali was Jemaah Islamiah's operations head as well as being the key figure for al-Qaeda in South-East Asia. He has had a direct hand in many terrorist atrocities and Australian deaths. We believe he is the architect of the Bali bombing, which killed 88 Australians and a total of 202 people. We believe he met with two of the September 11 hijackers, whose activity resulted in 10 Australian deaths and total confirmed deaths of 2,948 people. We suspect his involvement in the recent bombing of the Marriott hotel in Jakarta. He is blamed for around 19 deaths on Christmas Eve 2000, when 20 bombs went off simultaneously in churches in Indonesia. He is believed to have directed a bomb attack on a train station in Manila in December 2000, which killed 22 people.The most important thing at the moment is getting as much information as possible from Hambali about any terrorist operations that he may have planned for the future. It is obvious why that is our immediate priority. Suggestions that Hambali was targeting the APEC leaders summit in October are to be taken seriously. It is easy to envisage that a major meeting of leaders would be an attractive target for Jemaah Islamiah. The Prime Minister, the trade minister and I are looking forward to attending APEC in Bangkok in October, and we are pleased with the actions taken thus far by the Thai government to ensure the safety and the security of the meeting.Delighted as we and our neighbours are with the arrest of Hambali, and as important as that is, we must not become complacent and think that the fight against Jemaah Islamiah, against this Islamic fundamentalist extremist terrorism in our region, is over. There is still a long way to go despite the progress that has been made. Hambali's arrest will have a very significant impact but it has not removed the terrorist threat. There are still other people in South-East Asia who can do the job. There are people who can replace him, and we are working with our partners and friends in the region to contribute as best we can to efforts to try to track down these people and bring them to justice. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. No, I do not accept that that is the case at all. Seven out of 10 services provided to Australians are provided on the basis of no cost to the patient. So the very large bulk of Australians are indeed able to access a doctor at no cost to themselves for the services that they require.But, recognising the difficulties faced here, we have moved to improve the access and affordability of these services with the A Fairer Medicare package. That is what we have been done at very considerable expense. We will through the General Practice Access Scheme be paying financial incentives to GPs in return for their guarantee to bulk-bill patients covered by Commonwealth concession cards. That is well known, but I repeat it here because it bears repeating.Those payments, at their various rates, have been calculated at a level to ensure that they are financially beneficial to the vast majority of GPs across Australia, that they provide them with a rationale, a reason, for providing better services. We are improving, too, the affordability of GP services for those patients not covered by a concession card by reducing their up-front and out-of-pocket costs. Doctors can still bulk-bill anyone they choose. That will not change. But we are ensuring, too, that patients with chronic health needs or families with large medical expenses are given greater protection through the introduction of two comprehensive safety nets. - Our approach to the needs of people looking for health care in this country has been very reasonable. I would add to that some raw figures. We have increased spending on Medicare by $2 billion - it is up from $6 billion to $8 billion. We are investing $560 million in the Rural Health Strategy. There is more than $80 million going to an outer metropolitan program to encourage more GPs into those areas. Indeed, total Commonwealth expenditure on general practice has increased by more than 27 per cent since we came to office. That is a pretty good record.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and his interest in these issues. Honourable members on this side of the House at least know only too well that this government has been in the forefront of trying to bring a peaceful resolution to the North Korean nuclear issue and to the stand-off between countries in the region and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, North Korea. Last Wednesday I called into my office the North Korean ambassador and told him that the government welcomed the six-party talks and that we see this as a real opportunity for North Korea to allow for the establishment of a complete, verifiable and irreversible dismantling of its nuclear weapons program. I explained to the ambassador that that for us was the core issue. I also went on to say that it was in North Korea's interests to abandon its nuclear program. After all, if North Korea is going to make a contribution to nuclear proliferation in North Asia it obviously opens up the risk that there could be further incentive for others to follow down that path. Naturally enough, that is something that we do not want.One of the great achievements of the non-proliferation regime has been to keep nuclear weapons out of North-East Asia, with the exception of China. But since China obtained nuclear capability nuclear weapons have been kept out of that region - until the current impasse with North Korea. I made it clear to the ambassador that our relations with North Korea would be on hold until such a time as North Korea were prepared to move forward with constructive initiatives in order to resolve this problem.I also discussed this issue with the United States Deputy Secretary of State, Rich Armitage, who has been here during the course of the last week. I had lunch with him last Tuesday and we focussed very much on this issue in our discussions. We agreed that the nuclear verification regime must be on the table from the outset in the six-party talks. I also did make it clear that Australia would lend expertise in the verification process.Honourable members would be aware that the Prime Minister will be discussing this issue of the six-party talks and the future of North Korea during his visit to China. I take this opportunity to say that we very much appreciate the role that China has played in encouraging North Korea to participate in these six-party talks. In fact, it is an interesting illustration of the closeness of the Chinese and American relationship that they have been able to work together to encourage this round of talks. Let us hope for the best in those Beijing talks. Honourable members would also be aware that during his recent visits to North-East Asia - to Japan and South Korea - the Prime Minister also focussed very much on the question of North Korea.In conclusion to my answer to the honourable member's question, over and above the extremely effective efforts of China in encouraging the six-party talks, initiatives that Australia has been involved in have been important as well. First of all, the so-called proliferation security initiative - and we hosted in Brisbane the second round of talks under that initiative - has applied additional pressure to North Korea.Interestingly enough, the interception by Australia of the Pong Su, the North Korean ship which had been delivering heroin into Victoria - some $60 million worth at least - has been important. Assuming that this heroin originally came from North Korea or the money from it was to go to North Korea, North Korea now know that that source of revenue is being attacked internationally and they will not be able to raise money as easily through those methods as may have been the case in the past. We have played a very significant role in helping to move this process forward. It is a credit to Australia that we are such a responsible player in regional affairs. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for New England for his question. I indicate to him that the process I outlined last week in reply to a question from the member for Calare involves essentially modelling the formula according to different age groups and doing that over a period of some 20 to 30 years. We are trying to plan in a way that makes sure that we meet the aged care needs of people right throughout Australia into the future.The basis of that formula is to provide equitable distribution of aged care places, regardless of where people live. There are special provisions for those in rural and regional parts of Australia. For example, there is weighting in favour of them in terms of capital funding and also in relation to some of the places that are allocated to regional and rural parts of Australia. That interest in those regions of Australia will continue to be in the mind of the government when making these decisions.I indicate for the benefit of the House that since 1999 some 279 additional aged care places have been allocated to the New England planning region, worth some $3.4 million in annual recurrent funding. Aged care providers in the region have also received some $2.3 million in capital funding. A little while ago, I was able to visit aged care providers in the honourable member for New England's electorate and had a well attended forum of aged care providers, which the honourable member was present at, and I was able to participate with him in the opening of a new home at Uralla in the New England electorate. The provision of aged care services in rural parts of Australia is done in a flexible way, particularly through multipurpose services. Currently there are four MPSs operating in New England, at Urbenville, Boggabri, Vegetable Creek and Barraba. - I am advised by the Acting Prime Minister that they are also in Gwydir. There are also plans to expand in that region generally the MPS programs at Bingara, Walcha, Warialda and Guyra. This is a commitment on the part of the government towards the provision of aged care and health services generally to the residents of the New England region of Australia, like we attempt to do in a fair way for residents and people who live in all parts of Australia.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Forde for her question. I can refer her to the IMD World Competitiveness Yearbook, which was recently released, measuring the competitiveness of 59 of the world's economies against 321 criteria. Australia was measured in that group of countries which had a population of 20 million or more. I can report to the House that, according to this international survey, the IMD World Competitiveness Yearbook for 2003, Australia was ranked as the second most competitive nation in the world in 2003. Australia rated second on business efficiency to the United States. We rated second on infrastructure to the United States - although, of course, that was taken before the recent blackouts. We would not wish any ill on anybody, but that was taken before the recent blackouts in the United States. On the other indicator, government efficiency - the extent to which government policies are conducive to competitiveness - Australia was ranked as number one in the world. Of course, we would be growing faster than any of the other developed nations of the world. We certainly have the strongest budget position, because we are running a surplus whereas other countries, such as the United States, are running deficits at four per cent of GDP. We have an active competition policy and we have an active privatisation policy. But think how much more we could do in this country if the opponents of economic reform would get out of the way in the Australian Senate. Think what we could do for small business if we reformed those unfair dismissal laws. Think what we could do for our labour markets if the dead hand of the trade union bureaucracy was removed from the Australian Labor Party. Think what we could do in relation to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. Think how we could reform the welfare scheme in this country. There is so much more work to be done, and the greatest obstacle to economic reform in this country today is, as it has been for the last 7½ years, the dead hand of the Australian Labor Party.What could the Australian Labor Party do for the country? It could move aside and get out of the way - that would be the best contribution that the Australian Labor Party could make. In addition to that, the other contribution it could make is it could get rid of its leader. But, for political reasons, we would be against that, I must say. It could get rid of its economics spokesman too, but for political reasons we would be against that as well. Given the fact that the dead hand of the Australian Labor Party lies heavily in the Australian Senate, the fact that Australia is judged to be the second most competitive country in the world is a testament to the economic reform and the hard work of the government over the last 7½ years - work that we intend to keep going in the interests of all Australians.</DOC>

 - By coincidence, just as the honourable member got up to ask his question I was reading a transcript of a debate on the Sunrise program this morning that he had with our excellent Minister for Small Business and Tourism. I notice that the member for Griffith was making the argument that the government exaggerates the threat of terrorism. On the one hand, part of his argument is that the government is running a scare campaign on terrorism: be alarmed not alert - which according to him is some sort of glib line with which the government frightens people over terrorism - but on the other hand he makes the argument that the government understates the threat of terrorism. I know the Treasurer has pointed out the incoherence of the Labor Party's fiscal policy, but that incoherence seems to extend to the Labor Party's security policy. If you want to convince the public that you are ready for government, you must convince people that you are strong against terrorism and you are strong on national security issues.During the course of last week - and the honourable member asked about this - there were media reports of a Jemaah Islamiah hit list. The so-called target hit list mentioned in last week's media was in fact a list, prepared by the Indonesian police, of locations in Jakarta that will receive enhanced protective security; it was not a JI target list. The list appeared to draw on information which had come to hand from recent raids on terrorist hideouts and other sources. It included some places which Indonesian police guessed would be likely targets. It was very sensible of them and it is pleasing to see that the Indonesian authorities are taking such precautionary action. We have very close cooperation with the Indonesian police. I know it comes as a disappointment to the member for Griffith, but we had a joint operation investigating the Bali bombings, which has been the absolutely pivotal event in drawing to the Indonesian's attention the threat of Jemaah Islamiah.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Herbert for his question, and of course the workers in the sugar industry in his electorate - and cane growers in all the electorates in Far North Queensland - are very strong supporters of the government's position as far as the negotiations for the free trade agreement are concerned. - There is broad support for the position the government have taken in pursuing these negotiations. Every government member supports what we are trying to achieve for Australia's exporters. There is strong support from the United States government and there is strong support both from the private sector within Australia and the private sector within the United States. I became aware from reports in the media this morning of some further support that may be coming our way; and that support may be from the Labor Party. `Labor rethink on FTA is welcome' said the editorial in the Australianthis morning. If the move is in that direction, we certainly welcome that, because there is no doubt that the pursuit of the FTA is in the national interest and will deliver benefits to all exporters in Australia. I am sure that the workers in the agricultural industries, the manufacturing industries and the service industries in Australia would welcome this news - as would the six Labor state premiers, who are also supportive of our pursuits as far as the free trade agreement is concerned. Yesterday, the opposition leader on the Insiders program raised a number of questions. He said: If the bilateral approach, the FTA, is consistent with an outcome in Doha that advantages a broader outcome, then we do support it.I take that at face value. As we have said all along on this, our bilateral negotiations are aimed at achieving a quality free trade agreement between Australia and the United States. They are also aimed at boosting momentum for the WTO talks that are currently underway in the Doha round. The opposition leader also raised several concerns about the FTA talks and accused the government of hiding the negotiations from the public.It was interesting to read the Australian editorial today because it managed to answer most of those queries raised on the Insiders program yesterday, such as the questions about WTO consistency. We have always said that any agreement we sign off on will be consistent with our responsibilities under the WTO. The Leader of the Opposition raised issues about the FTA delivering a fair deal for farmers. Of course we are not going to do a deal unless there are advantages and benefits for the farmers; a key reason for our pursuit of this agreement is to improve market access opportunities. This is of particular interest to the member for Herbert because it is about access for sugar producers as well as beef producers, dairy producers and others.The Leader of the Opposition raised concerns about the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. There has been a lot of public debate about this, and we have been very open and frank about the position we have taken in terms of the PBS. There have been comments made on the public record by US negotiators. US negotiator Ralph Ives has said that they are not going after the PBS scheme. There is a lot of information out there. We have been broadly consulting with industry. I think a lot of the questions raised by Leader of the Opposition yesterday have been answered, and they were certainly answered in that editorial in the Australian today. I noticed in the media today another article, titled `ALP and unions at odds over free trade'. This article raises the issue that there are conflicting signals being sent by the labour movement in Australia. The Australian com-mented on that. - The newspaper articles I have been referring to reinforce the position of the government. - The point that was made in the Australian editorial this morning is:Labor is still sending out some confusing signals on the FTA, but that is better than the negative signals we were getting three months ago. So now it is time for Mr Crean to assert his authority and get the whole ship moving in the direction of economic common sense. My point is that presumably that also means moving the ship of the ACTU, who have said they are going to campaign in Washington against this proposal. The ACTU are going to Washington to get Congress to oppose what is in the national interest of Australia. The challenge, therefore, before the Leader of the Opposition is to get the whole labour movement to move towards supporting something that is in the national interest.</DOC>

 - With regard to the issue of contact between the Manildra Group and officers in my department that the Leader of the Opposition refers to, a meeting did take place on 30 May last year. I have been advised by my department that that was the case and that Mr Honan followed up on this meeting with a letter to the official that attached publicly available material with regard to ethanol programs in the United States. Obviously, I think some of these materials have been -  - No, the documents have been subject to FOI, and they have been made publicly available. I point out that prior to that meeting with Mr Gosper the government had announced on 10 May that it would conduct a two-year study to address market barriers to the increased use of biofuels in transport. Presumably, that is some of the background that Mr Honan was discussing with the DFAT official with regard to those issues. My department advised me that DFAT did not provide any advice to Mr Honan following that meeting.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Macquarie for his question, for his leadership of the education and training committee of the parliament and for his great representation for everyday Australians, like Greg and Jean Fletcher and those who want choice and standards in education.Last year, some 80,000 school-age Australian children - the equivalent of the entire school-age population of the state of Tasmania - moved interstate, and frequently they and their parents could be forgiven for thinking that they had moved, in an educational sense, to a different country. We have six different starting ages for year 1. In four states and territories we have six years of primary school and in the other four we have seven years. At the moment, only in Western Australia, the Northern Territory and the ACT do parents receive the results of national benchmark testing for reading, writing and numeracy skills, and only recently have the other states and territories agreed to come on board. For example, in the state of New South Wales, one in 12 students in years 3 and 5 cannot pass a basic - and I mean basic - year 3 reading test, yet the only people in the state who do not seem to know are their parents, because those results are not reported to them. In the state of Queensland, one in five boys cannot pass a basic year 5 reading test, yet today their parents do not receive those results against the national benchmark. Compounding this, at the other end of the education system the Australian curriculum authority web site advises students not to move interstate in year 12 because of variations in completion requirements. The Commonwealth government is doing a number of things in this regard. One thing is that, on behalf of the Australian government, I announced several weeks ago that $10 million will be committed to establish the National Institute for Quality Teaching and School Leadership. The purpose of this is to see that we provide national leadership in ensuring that the professionalism of Australia's teachers is maintained and is nationally consistent. As parents, we want to make sure that the teachers teaching our children, whether in Bunbury, Hobart, Darwin or indeed the electorate of Macquarie, are all keeping up with the same standards, to ensure the highest standard of teaching are being provided to our children.At the ministerial council meeting involving myself and state and territory ministers in mid-July, the state and territory ministers and the Australian government agreed to a number of things. The first is that we will now have national reporting against benchmarks in reading, writing and numeracy - for which the member for Goldstein should take great credit - with reporting to parents beginning next year, 2004. The second is that all of the states and territories have now agreed to a common starting age for school by 2010. That may not mean a great deal to some Australians, but I have had a parent tearfully telling me that she had to explain to her five-year-old child why that child was required repeat year 1 when they moved interstate.In addition, the Commonwealth, state and territory governments have agreed to look specifically at initiatives that will ensure national standards in education right across Australia. I think that our greatest challenge in school education is to ensure that we raise the respect that this society has for teaching as a profession. Apart from parents it is teachers that most influence the lives of our children, and for that reason in particular the Commonwealth will be driving hard, with teacher professional organisations, to ensure that the national institute for teacher quality and leadership in schools works cooperatively with all state and territory governments, provides leadership and prepares the next generation for the 21st century.</DOC>

I was not at the meeting between the Prime Minister and Mr Honan on 1 August. With regard to the insinuation that the Leader of the Opposition is making, which is implicit in his question, my comment last week was that at the time of the cabinet decision on 10 September I was in Iran representing Australia. - I was in Iran -  - What I said last week was that when the cabinet decision was taken on 10 September I was in Iran. I was not at that cabinet meeting, and that is what I put on the public record last week. I was not privy to that discussion.

 - I thank the member for Blair for his question. I know he shares the government's commitment to try to give all Australians a fair go and to try to encourage Australians to have a go. In last year's bud-get the government announced a series of changes to try to encourage people with disabilities to stay in the work force. As well as changing the criteria for people to access the disability support pension rather than the unemployment benefit, the government announced $278 million in new programs to help people with disabilities to find work. I would have thought that helping people with disabilities to find work would be bipartisan policy but apparently it is not. Mr Speaker, I am now quoting: Something also needs to be done about the outrageous growth in the DSP, which is now paid to more than 550,000 Australians.That was not Senator Amanda Vanstone; that was in fact the shadow Treasurer, back in the days when he was interested in good policy rather than muscling up to the government. The shadow Treasurer went on to say:The DSP is being used as a way to shift people off the dole and artificially lowering the unemployment rate.The shadow Treasurer went on to say:Incredibly, one in every 13 Australians aged between 40 and 65 has been classified as disabled and given the DSP.It is incredible, isn't it? Because one of those people - formerly in the work force, now a long-term benefit recipient - is apparently a certain Sydney taxi driver who made the acquaintance of the member for Werriwa. Given the shadow Treasurer's views, it is even more incredible that the opposition in the Senate has rejected the government's changes not once but twice.On the subject of the disability support pension, either the shadow Treasurer believed it then and does not believe it now, in which case he needs to explain why he has changed his mind, or he believed it then and still believes it now, and so he has to explain why he has not had the intelligence and the wit to be able to persuade his colleagues to support sensible and moderate changes that will help more people get work. </DOC>

 - The Leader of the Opposition refers to and comments on coordination comments. Coordination comments are that; they are not the result of a decision. It is information at hand with regard to the sugar industry. -  - The government has never made a secret -  - of its support of a biofuels industry in Australia. - In fact, going back to the last election, we had a stated policy of establishing a biofuels industry in Australia and seeing it grow. Reading from the policy at the time: The Coalition will set an objective that fuel ethanol and biodiesel produced in Australia from renewable sources will contribute at least 350 million litres to the total fuel supply by 2010.We made no secret of the fact, from the election in 2001, that we supported the development of a biofuels industry in Australia. At all times decisions have been taken in conjunction with that policy objective for the entire biofuels industry, not just an individual company.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Aston for his question. This month marks the announcement some six years ago by the member for Goldstein of the first Work for the Dole applications, about 579 of them being introduced some six years ago. Since that time, I am sure every member of the House would be pleased to learn, there have been over 14,000 projects delivering work experience to over 240,000 unemployed Australians, who have all contributed in a fantastic way to their local community.What is clear from this program is that more and more Australians are getting on board and supporting Work for the Dole initiatives, because they see what a positive impact they can have on their local communities. We know that the member for Bowman, the member for Franklin and the member for Werriwa have all in the past expressed their positive sentiments towards the Work for the Dole program, as has every member on this side of the House and as have many state members of parliament on both sides of the political divide.Very few though have gone as far as the member for Bayswater, who I am sure is known to the member for Aston. Peter Lockwood is the member for Bayswater in the Victorian state parliament, and I have a wonderful photograph of him here. This Labor member of a state parliament has gone so far as to put a Work for the Dole logo on his front window. He has it up there constantly for everyone to see - a beautification of his district. It is a great mural put together by Work for the Dole. I congratulate him; I say well done. He is putting the ideology of the Labor Party to one side, and I just hope he is not frightened by those opposite into removing this piece of beautification.I am asked about new initiatives. I think everyone in this House will be aware of the devastation of the bushfires in this region. After those bushfires I was approached by the member for Indi and the member for Eden-Monaro and also the member for Gippsland to see what we could do with Work for the Dole to assist some of the farmers. The member for Indi brought to my attention an editorial that appeared in the Border Mail on 13 August just last week. I think this is worth reading to the House to show what a positive impact Work for the Dole is having. It says:The success of the work-for-the-dole project linked to the bushfire recovery work in the Beechworth area and the Ovens Valley is an absolute credit to everyone involved. The elements of commonsense, commitment and caring is so evident in the success of the project. This project has been special because it has been an Australian first borne out of the terror and the heartbreak of last summer's bush fires ... Most importantly, the work-for-the-dole project has given the participants skills and the knowledge that the work that they are doing is not only important, it is appreciated. And it is appreciated. In a subsequent article in the same newspaper - and this was very interesting to see, because everyone in this House will realise that, if you are over 40, you are not required to do Work for the Dole but you can volunteer - a 54-year-old female participant said that she had enjoyed helping victims of the fires `get back on their feet at a most difficult time', which is a very Australian sentiment. Everyone on this side of the House fully supports Work for the Dole. Clearly, many people on the other side do. It is only up to the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Grayndler now to get on board and make it universally supported.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Lilley for my promotion. The Minister for Family and Community Services is Amanda Vanstone. Just for the benefit of the member for Lilley, I am the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs. I must admit that Wayne is back. I am surprised. He has resurrected himself and, emerging from the train crash, he has come back to his standard stock phrase. - I have to look round. I am not quite sure whether you are still Leader of the Opposition. - Thank you, Mr Speaker. The stock standard response from the member for Lilley is to try and scare the Australian public, particularly about the issue of the family tax benefit. I want to reiterate to the parliament that when the family tax benefit was introduced - we collapsed about 12 payments into three - in the year 2000 it went to two million families - to 3½ million children. In that particular year we increased payments by over 20 per cent. That means that the average Australian family is now getting around $4,700 from family tax benefit part A and, if they are receiving family tax benefit part B, about $1,900. Therefore, the average Australian family is getting around $6,600 from the federal government through the family tax benefit. We have a policy that you should receive what you are entitled to - not more, not less. It is reconciled every year through the taxation system.In the last few days the member for Lilley has been trying to rehabilitate himself, ducking and weaving wherever he can find a camera or a microphone. He may be Swan by name but we know he is called `the rooster' over there by his colleagues. We know over on this side he is just a big chicken - a little chicken.But to address the question, the inference he is making is that people who are receiving the family tax benefit and who earn over $100,000 are rorting the system. One of the main reasons why people earning over $100,000 receive the family tax benefit is that they have about four or six children. Are you saying that we should be disadvantaging large families? Is the member for Lilley suggesting that the families in his electorate who are receiving income - perhaps both parents are working - of around $100,000 should be denied the family tax benefit even though they have children under the age of two and between the ages of 18 and 24?Now the member for Lilley wants to try and promote the issue that we have a number of people on higher incomes who should not be entitled to this benefit. Clearly, if people on very high incomes are not entitled to it they will have to repay it. We went and had a bit of a look at what the member for Lilley has been saying just recently - ducking and weaving, trying to make himself relevant again.  - I am not a little chicken like you over there. There are a lot of roosters over there, aren't there? - I am sorry, Mr Speaker. We are getting overly enthusiastic here. We went back and we had a bit of a look at these cases. - You are really relevant, aren't you, Mr Badgerys? We decided to look at the income levels, and rightly so. If people on very high incomes are receiving the family tax benefit then they should not be. People earning between $400,000 and $1 million should clearly not be receiving the family tax benefit, but we found that a third of those on very high incomes were getting the family tax benefit because of CDA saved cases - carer disability allowance cases. That was done back in 1992-93. Who was in government then?A third of those cases were families who have been receiving the family tax benefit because they had disabled children. Isn't it interesting? Last week, you found it quite fashionable to beat up on people receiving carer allowance and now you are saying it should be taken away from them because you grandfathered a lot of these people - one third of them. That is hypocritical.The second point is that we have gone back and had a look at these individuals - Senator Amanda Vanstone has. Half receive income tested FTBA and have debts raised against them. They will have to pay it back. There are 14 cases out of about 60 which we are further investigating to ensure that those individuals who -  - Yes, thank you, Mr Speaker.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Fairfax for his question. Obviously the member for Fairfax takes a great deal of interest in these matters given the number of small to medium size enterprises that are operating out of his electorate and exporting particularly within our region and into South-East Asia and the markets in North Asia.The government's trade policy is working extremely well in strengthening our economic relations within the region. In fact, I had a meeting over lunch today with representatives from the ASEAN countries with whom we have a very strong trading relationship. They were the first organisation that we negotiated an economic relationship with in the current form of trade policy where we have a very strong focus on the WTO and the multilateral system. We believe that meaningful reform in the global trade negotiations is very important for Australian jobs and the Australian economy. We are in the middle of that exercise at the moment and pursuing that in the WTO, and of course the meeting in Cancun in Mexico in a couple of weeks time is going to be crucial to that. We have also been negotiating and pursuing bilateral agreements with a number of countries, the first of which was the CEP agreement - the closer economic partnership agreement - that we negotiated, signed off and put into place with the 10 ASEAN countries in their AFTA grouping. As I said, I had lunch with representatives of those countries today, and we are having a meeting in a couple of weeks time - the annual dialogue between Australia, New Zealand and the 10 ASEAN countries - which will take place in Cambodia.A part of that policy pursuit has been to negotiate free trade agreements with other countries that are willing to move at the same pace as Australia, where opportunities are going to be provided faster - better opportunities, deeper opportunities - for Australian exporters. It is no secret that we have now concluded the free trade agreement with Singapore. We are on track with the free trade agreement negotiations with Thailand, to be concluded in October this year. Of course, there are also the all-important negotiations with the United States of America, which we are targeting to conclude by the end of this year. Those negotiations are the first that we have embarked upon for 20 years in this country - since we concluded the CER agreement in 1983. That has been recognised as the best and purest free trade agreement in existence in the world.But this policy pursuit has been criticised by some commentators. Obviously the government has refuted those arguments and has continued to point to the advantages and the benefits that will flow from these negotiations. A couple of former Hawke advisers - namely, Ross Garnaut and Craig Emerson - have been very vocal in their opposition to the bilateral negotiations that we have been engaged in. They have been saying that these negotiations with the United States will cause our North Asian trading partners to pull away from the relationship with Australia. Those arguments that they have been putting forward are plainly wrong.Following Singapore and Thailand, China is now seriously considering an FTA study with Australia. Following the Prime Minister's visit to Beijing yesterday it was announced that we wanted to pursue this, and the Chinese have agreed, as part of the economic framework agreement that we are currently negotiating. It should be recognised that China is one of our fastest growing markets, particularly in North Asia. I have been saying for at least the last couple of years that Australia has an enormous opportunity to take advantage of the opportunities presented in terms of resourcing the industrialisation of China, and we have to continue to refine that relationship.As I say, we are focusing on the multilateral agenda and at the same time expanding the bilateral negotiations within our region and outside our region. - And it is not damaging our relationships within our region within East Asia. - As I laid down the challenge yesterday, I lay down the challenge again today to the Leader of the Opposition to get the whole labour movement - the Australian Labor Party and the union movement - behind these moves in relation to both the current negotiations and those in prospect because they are in the national interest. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Lilley for his second question, which is all part of his rehabilitation. What a comeback! In his question the member for Lilley again made the inference that, if you are earning over $100,000, you should not be entitled to the family tax benefit. You said that in your question a few moments ago. I am surprised that the member for Lilley has got it in for Australian families, with four or more children, earning a high income. He is stating, either implicitly or not implicitly, that they should not be receiving the family tax benefit. I explained in my previous question, and I am happy to go through it again for the member for Lilley, that if you are receiving the family tax benefit and you are not entitled to it then you have to repay it; it is a very simple principle. - The innuendo is that all people earning over $100,000 are receiving foreign income. The majority of people earning over $100,000 are receiving family tax benefits because they have large families or are receiving these benefits because they have been grandfathered through the CDA saved cases. Of course there is a very high proportion who will have to pay it back. Under the old ALP system, there would have been 500,000 families in the 2001-02 tax year who would not have received a top-up. Under this particular system, if people overestimate their income then they receive a top-up payment. They would never have received this under the old system. We have put in place a number of measures over the last 12 months to give families the choice to try and more accurately ascertain their income at reconciliation, whether this is splitting family tax benefit part B or family benefit part A or whether it is from childcare benefits.As far as those people who might be receiving foreign income go, if they are paying tax in other jurisdictions then it obviously comes down to a ruling by the tax office. There are a few cases which I know Senator Vanstone is investigating. The central point which I want to stress is a quote by Mike Seccombe in the Sydney Morning Herald - it is important to quote this to the parliament because it underlines the member for Lilley's engagement on this topic - which I would like to share with all members of the House. I am sure there are many people in the Labor Party who would agree with this: If there is one example of anything that is wrong with the modern Labor Party it is Wayne Swan. I mean anodyne, unimaginative, poll driven. I mean he is a shocker.He is a shocker because he is scaring the vast majority of Australians.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Dunkley for his question. I can inform him that yesterday the Commissioner of Taxation released the tax office compliance program for 2003-04. This year the tax office will undertake over 70,000 compliance reviews to deal with businesses operating in the cash economy, which will be 25,000 more than last year. More than 30,000 businesses can expect to be visited by 660 tax officers specialising in the cash economy, and there will be another 2,400 officers in the field enforcing compliance generally. In his press release when he announced this yesterday the commissioner said: ... industries to be scrutinised include restaurants, cafes, takeaways, taxis, hairdressers -  - The member for Werriwa said, `About time.' It is about time that we look at the taxi industry in Sydney. They have a lot of bad debts. There are people who get intoxicated, get into taxis and do not pay their bills. It is hard to believe, but it is true. The commissioner continued: ... hairdressers, cleaning services, scrap metal dealers, computer retailers ... As the commissioner noted in his press release yesterday, the ANAO audited the performance of the tax office in relation to the cash economy and found that there had been a compliance dividend of $3.5 billion over three years of additional tax raised because of the new tax system. Let me say that again: the new tax system, as found by an ANAO audit, has produced a compliance dividend of $3.5 billion in excess of what the government said would be the case when it brought the new tax system into effect from 1 July 2000.In addition to that, the Commissioner of Taxation notes in his release - and I will table this release - that the tools which were introduced with the new tax system have given him additional measures to be used to clamp down on the cash economy. He notes that the Australian business number, which has to be quoted for suppliers, has raised over $127 million in payments withheld. He also notes that the new tax system provides real-time information and gives the ability to crossmatch income tax and GST information. From the government's point of view, those tools should be used in relation to the cash economy - and they are powerful tools, which the tax commissioner notes. This increased program comes about because not in this year's budget but in last year's budget the government allocated an extra $1.5 billion over four years to employ more inspectors to lift the number of businesses to be visited and compliance reviews. That was a decision which the government put in place in the May 2002 budget and which is now starting to pay dividends. I want to finish by correcting one thing. The member for Werriwa has falsely claimed today that the tax commissioner has estimated the black economy at 15 per cent of GDP. This is what he did: he walked up to a group of cameras and he said, `The tax commissioner, Mr Carmody, has estimated the black economy has blown out to 15 per cent of GDP.' As usual, that was false and a verballing of the tax commissioner. -  - Yes, a verballing of the tax commissioner. -  - I will tell you what he said - the member for Werriwa said, `What did he say?' He went on The World Today and he said:I understand it has been claimed by Mr Latham that I have confirmed a figure of the black economy of 15 per cent of GDP. I've done no such thing. I place no weight at all in the sort of macro analysis that produces that sort of figure, and with good reason.The OECD has referred to that sort of analysis as being only good to produce spectacularly high measures, but with no sound scientific base.I think the tax commissioner is owed an apology from the member for Werriwa today.</DOC>

I've done no such thing.The member for Werriwa, not content last week with attempting to slur the chairman of ASIC, was out there today misrepresenting the tax commissioner, who very directly repudiated the claim of the member for Werriwa at 12 o'clock today on The World Today. The tax commissioner - and I table this media release - says that the ANAO has found a:... compliance dividend of $3.5 billion over three years of additional tax estimated to be raised as a result of the New Tax System ...Not only does the commissioner say he has raised $3.5 billion, but the ANAO has done a compliance report and confirmed it. What did the government say? The government estimated that there would be a dividend from the black economy of $2 billion to $3 billion. A figure of $3.5 billion is what the tax commissioner estimates, and the ANAO confirms it.In addition to that, what does the tax commissioner say his tools are going to be as he lifts the pressure on the cash economy? There is the Australian business number, which has a withholding system if you do not have a number - which has already raised $127 million - and there are real-time efforts to match GST returns to the cash economy. Of course, if Labor had had their way, there would be no Australian business number. Labor opposed this tax system. If Labor had had their way, there would be no GST to get real-time matching. So it is a little rich, is it not, for the Australian Labor Party to now come along and say, `You should be more active in enforcing the GST'?  -  - `That's right,' they say - a GST which they said should never be introduced. I should not say that, because it is not entirely true to say that the member for Werriwa said a GST should never be introduced. He has had a position on practically every policy, like a child in a lolly shop - you know: `I'll have one of them and one of them and one of them and one of them.' Writing in the Australian Left Review in September 1990, the member for Werriwa said - and I ask people to listen to this carefully; this is a statement -  - As it turns out, I was the member for Higgins in 1990. As it turns out, I was actually in this place. Writing in September 1990, the would-be economic spokesman of the Labor Party said:The federal government should shed part of its funding role for basic services by encouraging the states to raise income and consumption taxes.Income taxes! Not only did he want a state GST; he wanted a state income tax. Of course, that was the point at which the Liberal Party was putting forward Fightback for the 1993 election. The moment Fightback was put forward and it became Liberal policy to have a GST, the member for Werriwa, having been a supporter of a GST, then became an opponent of it and, as we now know, advocated instead of the GST the PET - the progressive expenditure tax; another one of the tax policies of the member for Werriwa. I have to say that going through the policies of the member for Werriwa is just a mine of unbearable riches. It never comes to an end. We have been anti-GST, pro-GST and pro state GST. Today we want an enforceable federal GST. In 1998 we had the progressive expenditure tax. I await with great interest - and I say to the backbench of the Labor Party: wait for the progressive expenditure tax, because you ain't seen nothing yet!</DOC>

 - First, I thank the honourable member for Wannon for his question and for the interest he shows in these issues - in this case, in Australia's relationship with Asia. It is only from this side of the House that I get questions about our relationship with Asia. The Prime Minister has just completed his fourth visit to China. One of the observations the Chinese made was that this is the largest number of visits to China by any serving Australian Prime Minister. As has been the case with his previous visits to China, it has been a very great success. I am very pleased that President Hu Jintao, during the visit of the Prime Minister, made it clear that he, President Hu Jintao, will be visiting Australia later this year. This of course will be the second visit by a Chinese President to Australia; the first visit was by President Jiang Zemin in September 1999. Again, it was no coincidence that this was during the term of the Howard government. There is no doubt that the Chinese government - and I think, more broadly, many key people in China - assess the relationship with Australia as being a very important and very strategic relationship. As the Minister for Trade has pointed out, the Prime Minister's visit did include very successful discussions about a comprehensive bilateral framework agreement on trade and investment, and I think the future is very bright for our economic relationship with China. But our bilateral relationship with China is of course one of our key overall relationships with Asia. I do not think anyone in this House who knows anything about Asia would underestimate the enormous historic importance of the rise of the Chinese economy and the rise of China's strategic influence. Obviously, a good relationship between Australia and China is very substantially not just in the economic interests of Australians but in the strategic interests of Australians. During the Prime Minister's visit he was also able to discuss the issue of North Korea, which has been a major preoccupation for the region, including this government, and to thank the Chinese leaders for the role they have played in helping to piece together the six-party talks about which I was asked yesterday.The honourable member for Wannon asked whether there were any alternative views. The answer to that is: there are a lot of alternative views. There are those who say that we are too bombastic on the issue of North Korea. There are those who say that we use Rambo rhetoric. There are those who say that we are too soft on North Korea - that we are too soft on security issues. But the extraordinary thing about this is that if you take all of those views they are expressed by just one person, and that is the member for Griffith. The member for Griffith, who is accusing the government of being engaged in Rambo rhetoric on North Korea, said in January that North Korea had done some `mad things' in the past and they were capable of `mad things' in the future. He went on, during January, to talk about how North Korea had missiles that were capable of reaching Australia. Now he accuses the government of Rambo rhetoric as he himself goes soft and takes the soft line on North Korea.The member for Griffith, who is the opposition spokesman on foreign affairs, has all positions on all issues - except in one case. He has one constant position, and his one constant position is in front of a microphone. When the member for Wannon, who I understand is very fond of the member for Griffith; I understand there is a real bond there - the member for Werriwa, rather -  - The member for Werriwa, at a caucus briefing, apparently said in response to some questions about the member for Griffith going to Baghdad: `I am sure he will supply his itinerary so interviews can be coordinated.' Apparently in saying this - according to the press - he sneered. He sneered at the member for Griffith.  -  - I know. How bad is that, Mr Speaker? To the member for Griffith, two words of advice: say less.</DOC>

 - The answer to the question is that the reference to a constituent inquiry concerns a constituent inquiry. Two people who drove a truck into South Australia did not know that they had to have a logbook because logbooks are not required in Western Australia. The safety of their travel was guaranteed by having two drivers and not one. When they were fined, I wrote to the minister saying that I thought a warning should be appropriate. I did not press the matter any further. I would do it, and I think I have done it, for other people in my electorate. I do not see that the only person my son could go to in this matter being me should deny my request that a warning was appropriate. I did not ask that it be changed. The fact is that I said it was a constituent inquiry, and I find that no different -  -  - No. Anyway, I have explained that it is a matter that I put forward on his behalf. At no time did I do anything that was to influence the outcome other than to ask that it be considered as a warning.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Eden-Monaro for his question. As he would know, this government abolished wholesale sales tax, financial institutions duty, bed tax and stamp duty on shares and introduced GST. We cut petrol excise - and for the trucking industry we cut it to 20c a litre from 44c at the time. We reduced income taxes, halved capital gains, reduced company tax and gave rollover relief to small business. As a consequence, we have made Australia a pretty competitive place to do business. As I informed the House yesterday, on the IMD world competitiveness scale, Australia was considered to be the second most competitive business environment of countries of 20 million people or more around the world.Last night on the ABC Lateline program, Mr Greg Combet - I believe he is Secretary of the ACTU - was explaining to Tony Jones his criticism of the government's tax policy. Essentially the ACTU criticism of the government's tax policy is that Australia is a low-taxing jurisdiction. But halfway through the interview Tony Jones reminded Mr Combet that Labor's attack on the government is that it is a high-taxing government. So Mr Combet was last night reconciling the Labor attack on the coalition being a high-taxing government with the ACTU campaign to expose Australia as a low-taxing jurisdiction. When the ABC advertises its comedy programming, it ought to include Lateline in the future. Last night Tony Jones said this -   - It was actually last night on Lateline. Tony Jones said to Greg Combet - and remember that this is the industrial wing of the Labor Party, the ACTU, which owns 50 per cent of the votes at the national convention:Yet, the first line of your tax sheet says OEC data says Australia is a low tax country. Is that the case?GREG COMBET: Well, relative to the other OECD countries, that's the case.TONY JONES: According to your document, relative to all the other OECD countries and, indeed, the average is six points higher on the percentage scale.GREG COMBET: And that's quite right.	...	...	...TONY JONES: But isn't this document more or less pointing out that Australia is a very low tax country by comparison to other OECD countries, and therefore it would be possible, in fact, to raise taxes here and still be in conformity with other OECD countries?GREG COMBET: Well, it is a statement of fact that relative to other OECD countries, Australia is not a highly taxing country.	...	...	...TONY JONES: I raise it because this is in your facts sheet about tax and I'm just trying to get to the point here of what you mean by saying Australia is a low taxing country relative to other OECD countries.It seems to be suggesting we could have higher taxes here.GREG COMBET: Well, we're stating the facts.So what are the facts? The ACTU knows what the facts are: Australia is a low-taxing jurisdiction by the standards of the developed world. From the OECD table, I think the United States and Korea and not too many others are actually lower. The reason the ACTU is raising this is that the ACTU believes taxes should be higher. We know that the overwhelming majority of the Labor backbench also believe that taxes should be higher; the Australian candidate survey at the last election established this. So why do we have this nonsense from the frontbench of the Australian Labor Party attacking the government for being too high taxing when we know that the Australian Labor Party believes taxes should go higher and the ACTU believes that the tax take is too low?The ex-ACTU president, the now member for Hotham, will be going to the ACTU congress and, presumably, when he gets there he will be telling the ACTU, `No, Australia is not a low-tax jurisdiction; it's a high-tax jurisdiction.' Presumably, when he gets there he will be saying, `Labor's policy is not to increase taxes but to cut them,' and, presumably, he will be naming those areas where Labor proposes to cut taxes. We await.One of the things that has always intrigued me, as we have been raising the question of stamp duty in the parliament over recent days, is why no member of the ALP has ever joined us in criticising state governments for having stamp duty that is too high. - I was intrigued - I had to be told, and I was told - to find that Labor has a shadow minister for housing. Whilst the shadow Treasurer has been announcing increased grants for people buying houses in Sydney, it turns out that Labor's spokesman on housing has not been announcing anything at all. Labor has a shadow minister for housing who apparently has not been consulted about the shadow Treasurer's policy. It would not be the case that Labor's shadow minister for housing would come from an area which is going to be penalised because it is only Sydney that is getting a $12,000 grant? What about the people of Geelong?Labor has a shadow minister for housing who represents Geelong. Let him go to the people of Geelong and explain why if you live in Geelong your grant is $7,000 but if you live in Sydney it is $12,000. Talk about a local member looking after the local area! The intriguing thing here is that, although the shadow Treasurer has announced the increase in the first home owners grant, it has not been endorsed nor has a word been uttered about it by the shadow minister for housing. Rather intriguing. But why is it that nobody in the Labor Party has ever criticised the state governments for high stamp duty? The answer came today in the Herald Sun, which said:Victoria's peak union boss yesterday called for -  - So why is it that no member of the Labor Party has criticised the state governments for their stamp duty policies? The answer came today in the Herald Sun. Listen to this:Victoria's peak union boss yesterday called for state government taxes, including stamp duty, to be increased ...	...	...	...'The Government does need to raise taxes such as payroll tax, gambling tax and stamp duty for some buyers ...That was Leigh Hubbard, `Brother Hubbard'. Old Brother Hubbard went to the cupboard to find the ALP a bone. But when he got there, the cupboard was bare and the poor ALP had none!</DOC>

 - I really anticipated that, having the opportunity to ask me questions today, the shadow minister for local government was going to follow up on his press releases where he keeps urging me to break a law written by the Keating government in 1995 about local government distribution in Queensland. - I am more than prepared to answer the question, because anybody who reads those letters will find the bit that the member for Corio has left out. I made representations stating they were about my son, as he has confirmed. - I referred to it as a constituent matter, but I said it was about my son. We are not saying that I wrote about a constituent without mentioning who it was. I did not receive a reply from the minister for an extensive period. In the interim my son, I thought, had the expectation of my advice on that reply before he was actually prosecuted, in his absence and without a summons, in the South Australian court. I wrote back to the minister and said I thought that was pretty poor form. That is all that has ever been done. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Moore for his question. While members opposite are crawling around in the gutter looking endlessly for scandal, this government is getting on with the job of delivering better conditions to the ordinary people of Australia. This government has delivered to the working people of Australia more jobs, higher pay, greater protection -  - and, very importantly, fewer strikes. Since March 1996 there have been more than one million new jobs. There has been a 14 per cent real increase in full-time average weekly earnings. We have put in place the first comprehensive system of protection of worker entitlements in this country's history, and strikes are at the lowest level since records were first kept in 1913. The latest Australian Bureau of Statistics figures show that in the 12 months to May just 30 working days were lost per 1,000 employees due to strikes. This is one-third of the strike rate in 1996 and one-thirtieth of the strike rate in the early 1980s, and it is the lowest 12-month result since the current ABS series began in 1981. - I do have to say to the member for Moore that there was a sharp jump in disputes in May, mostly because of the AMWU's campaign against the motor industry and the CFMEU's typical campaign of disruption of the building industry in Victoria. Today the comrades are meeting in Melbourne, exercising their controlling interest over the Australian Labor Party and summoning the Leader of the Opposition to give him his instructions for the coming 12 months. I have a clear message for the ACTU. I quote:Trade unionism in this country is in crisis.I wonder who said that.Government member - Who? Was it someone who knew? - Yes, it was someone who knew the union movement very well. This was from someone in his Dr Jekyll mode, before he became Mr Hyde. The quote continues:How can unions survive if they fail to appeal to people in newly created enterprises and workplaces?I am quoting the member for Werriwa, funnily enough. He continued:The union movement needs to find a way of becoming relevant to smaller, leaner workplaces. Otherwise it runs the risk of becoming yet another dinosaur from the industrial age.The shadow Treasurer, the member for Werriwa, needs to show a bit of intellectual integrity. The union movement is either an industrial dinosaur or the rightful owner and operator of the Australian Labor Party. It cannot be both, and the shadow Treasurer needs to explain whether he has changed his mind or sold out his principles. On his form so far, you would have to say that he is the biggest sell-out since Richard Butler. </DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, the only advice I have given to this House is in response to the questions I have received today. In no way have I misled the House in any response to that question. - The code of conduct says something about `private'. If your own children are not entitled to the same representations from a member of parliament as somebody else, if it is suggested that I should have rung up a Senate colleague or something and said, `Please write the letter,' then the members of the opposition have a very funny view of family. My family is entitled to my representations. I put a position that I thought was credible, as the letters explain. Furthermore, when I got no response, why did the member for Corio not table the letters of response from the minister in South Australia? Because there would only have been one letter, if he had replied, saying that he did not want to do anything. He did not reply; he allowed a prosecution to proceed without summons, and that is when I complained. - </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Herbert for his question. I also thank him for the tone and substance of the question, which stands in stark contrast to questions being asked by the opposition because it is about policy. The Commonwealth has made an offer of $42 billion over five years for the next Commonwealth-state health care agreement - $42 billion being a $10 billion increase in Commonwealth funds to assist the states in running and conducting their public hospital system. This is a 17 per cent increase on the current agreement. For the state of Queensland, where the honourable member for Herbert resides, this means that instead of receiving $5.9 billion over the course of this agreement there is an additional $2.1 billion. This is a time when, in terms of hospital trends, there has been a massive slashing of the number of public hospital beds in the states and territories of Australia. Indeed, in just over a decade some 15,000 public hospital beds have been slashed from the system by state and territory governments. The honourable member asked me why the states and territories will not put the interests of patients first. We are asking the states to sign up to a number of provisions in this agreement to declare their investment in the public hospital system, to recommit themselves to the Medicare principle of free access to public hospitals and to agree to improve performance reporting as well as match the additional growth funds which the Commonwealth is putting into this agreement.It is interesting that, in relation to the principle of free access to public hospitals, a proposition has been advanced recently by the states that somehow the frail and the elderly in our society have no right to public hospital care. That is the proposition being advanced by the states. That is what Mr Carr is saying in relation to elderly people making use of -  - The member for Lalor interjects. Last week the member for Lalor came in here and asked a question of the Prime Minister of which the clear implication was that veterans in Australian communities have no right - that is what you were saying - to go to public hospitals in Australia. So far as the ALP is concerned - and this is the only implication that can be drawn from what the member for Lalor said - if you are a veteran in Australia and you have a fall or suffer a stroke, do not bother turning up to the accident and emergency room of a public hospital. That is how the member for Lalor was putting the proposition in her question.In addition to that we have Mr Carr, the Premier of New South Wales, wandering around like the other premiers in Australia complaining, for example, about aged care places. In relation to aged care, Mr Carr himself - his government - is proposing to close nine CADE facilities in New South Wales, one of them in Queanbeyan in the member for Eden-Monaro's electorate. These are facilities which have been run by the state government in New South Wales for elderly people with behavioural problems. Again this is an instance of the New South Wales Labor government, in particular, saying, `If you're elderly and you're frail, we don't want to know you.' That is what Mr Carr is saying at the present time.In terms of aged care, the New South Wales government and the New South Wales health department cannot even bother to make a submission like other governments have made to the pricing inquiry into aged care. No wonder we have state premiers and state health ministers and state officials talking about the elderly, using dehumanising terminology such as `granny dumping' and `bed blocking'. This is what the states are putting out there in relation to the elderly at a time when they have a record offer in front of them for the health care funding in this system. The ALP want more expenditure on health care, and of course they also want to raise taxes in order to pay for it. We have had the ALP, through former shadow spokesman for health Mr Smith, creating the headline, `Medicare levy rise proposed by Labor', as reported by Samantha Maiden in the Adelaide Advertiser on 28 February this year. It was suggesting that the Medicare levy be raised again - a rise in taxes by the ALP. And of course we have had the Labor Party through the state premiers saying that the 30 per cent private health insurance rebate should be slashed. In other words, there should be another increase in taxes for ordinary Australian families.We consistently hear propositions from the Labor Party that there should be a cost-shifting exercise between the states and the Commonwealth, something identified by the president of the AMA this week. We had the chair of Catholic Health Australia saying, `State and territory governments chant reform but remain coy about whether they'll simply take the money and run.' Take the money and run is what they will do. They will do it in relation to the Commonwealth, and the federal Labor Party will do it in relation to taxes for ordinary Australians.</DOC>

 - The honourable member bases his question upon a premise which is false. There is no intention on the part of the government to restrict bulk-billing. That was the premise in your question. But, more than that, there is before the parliament legislation which will actually aid the access of people, including your constituent - the honourable member's constituent - to health care in Australia. You talk about your constituent - the honourable member's constituent  - being out of pocket. The legislation which relates to the changes which this government is proposing - which is being blocked by the opposition, by the Australian Labor Party in the Senate - includes a proposal for GP access so that people such as the constituent referred to by the honourable member can actually go to their doctor and have their Medicare rebate payment processed there and then.Which party is standing in the way of ordinary Australians having access to this sort of proposal so that they do not have to line up and wait in Medicare offices? People who live in rural areas of Australia will not have to wait days and drive kilometres and kilometres to get to a Medicare office. Who is standing in front of this proposal? Nobody other than the party of which you are a member. If you are concerned about your constituent, then you ought to be talking to your colleagues in the Senate and ask them to pass this legislation.</DOC>

 - Thank you very much, Mr Speaker, and thank you to the member for Hinkler for asking me a question about his electorate, and about mining in his electorate, of which the member for Hinkler, along with many people on this side of the House, is a great defender. In the central region of Queensland, which covers Gladstone, Rockhampton and Mackay, in the member for Dawson's electorate, there are more than 25,000 Australians employed in the mining industry. That represents over 22 per cent of all jobs in the region. In that region of central Queensland alone, mining represents over $7,000 million in income per annum - so it is a huge industry.Comalco are, as I understand it, now building a $1.3 billion refinery near Gladstone in the member for Hinkler's electorate, and that refinery represents 250 jobs and contributes to employment in 350 businesses. They have already spent $300 million there. Overall, one in four jobs in central Queensland relies on the mining sector, and that is why the member for Hinkler asked me, `What are the threats to the mining industry?' There is no greater threat to the mining industry in central Queensland than the Australian Labor Party. The Australian Labor Party has decided to impose on the Australian mining industry a half a billion dollar tax slug to pay for its university policy. That is a new tax slug on mine workers -  - The Australian Labor Party want to impose on the Australian mining industry a half a billion dollar tax slug to pay for their university policy. I want to know what the member for Capricornia is going to say to the people in her electorate, to the businesses at Moranbah, Dysart and Collinsville, when they have to pay the workers over there - the honest workers, the coal workers and miners - who are going to have to pay for the university fees of people studying law and medicine. What is she going to say to the workers in her electorate who will have to pay for some landmark university courses such as golf course management, surfboard riding, aromatherapy -   - I want to know what members of the Labor Party and the people who are right behind the university policy of the Labor Party, such as the member for Capricornia, are going to say to the miners who now have to pay an extra half a billion dollars for the Labor Party's universities policy. Who is defending the workers in the mines such as Peak Downs mine, Norwich Park mine, German Creek mine or South Walker Creek mine? We know it is not the shadow minister for resources because the member for Hunter is not even defending the miners in the Hunter, let alone defending the miners anywhere else in Australia. The Labor Party are the biggest threat to the workers in mines right around Australia. With a half a billion dollar tax slug, they ought to start apologising before the next election.</DOC>

 - No, member for Grayndler, the premise of the question is absolutely incorrect. The IT system that you are referring to is conducting about 3.5 million transactions a day in an average time of about half of second. The $30 million payment that the member for Grayndler refers to is not a bailout in any way, shape or form. As has been widely reported in the press, for the first time in this nation's history over 700,000 unemployed Australians have had a letter sent to them with a time, a date and a place to attend an interview where they can have their resume recorded and put on an automated database so they can be matched with jobs. The unfortunate reality is that many of those job seekers have not turned up to those interviews.Rather than be draconian, the government paid Job Network members extra funds to make additional phone calls to unemployed people so that they would receive not only a letter informing them of the time, date and place of their appointment but also a minimum of two contact points from the Job Net-work member. This was to encourage people to turn up for what is, after all, assistance paid for by the taxpayer. I ask the member for Grayndler and those sitting opposite who ridicule this: do you believe that Job Network members should be doing something they are not paid for? We are asking them to make additional contacts with job seekers in order to assist them. This government stands by Job Network. It is not in imminent collapse. In fact, there is currently a NESA conference being held, which I am aware that the member opposite will be addressing tomorrow, as I will be on Friday. I look forward to a robust Job Network that continues to drive unemployment down in this country. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Flinders for his question. The recent meeting of the Pacific Island Forum was certainly far and away the best, most productive and most engaged meeting of that body that I have attended as Prime Minister. A new urgency and sense of relevance has been, I think, injected into that body. The very successful and united cooperative intervention in the Solomon Islands is seen by the smaller countries in the forum as being evidence that the body can work, that help is at hand and that different countries of different sizes can play a very constructive role.The forum went a considerable distance towards endorsing the Australian government's proposals for what I have described as pooled regional governance. In particular, it adopted a regional police training initiative and has also agreed to Australian proposals to fund scoping studies in relation to both transport and aviation services, with a view to establishing whether or not they can be better extended or entrenched on a regional basis. The regional policing initiative will see 900 police from the region trained in an expanded regional police training centre based in Fiji. Honest, reliable, well-trained, efficient police are fundamental to the maintenance of basic law and order, and it should be remembered that it was the near collapse of the Royal Solomon Islands Police Force that was the trigger, as it were, for the request coming to Australia and other countries for the Solomon Islands intervention.We have also agreed to the establishment of an eminent persons group to examine reform of the forum secretariat. In that connection, I am delighted to say that, for the first time in the history of the forum, an Australian has been elected to the position of secretary-general. He is Mr Greg Urwin, who is well known to many on both sides of the House. He is a former high commissioner in the region, he is married to a citizen of Samoa and he has had years and years of experience in the region. He will come to this position not in any way as a delegate or representative of Australia but, rather, as somebody who believes very passionately in the common interests of the countries of the Pacific.I announced at the forum an Australian initiative on HIV-AIDS, worth $12½ million, and that is in addition to the $60 million program we currently provide for Papua New Guinea.Another issue was raised which I know is of interest to many in this House, and that is some of the rules that affect rugby players of various countries from the region. As a result of the representations made by the smaller countries, the forum secretariat will take up, with the ARU and the New Zealand Rugby Union, some of the nationality and representation rules that they believe unfairly work against players originating from Fiji, Samoa and Tonga. I had the opportunity of raising this matter directly, after the rather unfortunate rugby match at Eden Park on Saturday night, with the Chief Executive of the Australian Rugby Union, and I think we will have a very constructive understanding and response from the Australian Rugby Union on this issue.My visit to China, for a period of about 36 hours, enabled me to meet for the first time the new Chinese leadership. It is very clear that the determination of the former Chinese leadership to maintain a close relationship with Australia has been transferred to the new leadership. On every issue, there was a seeking of common ground. The President of China, Mr Hu Jintao, has agreed to visit Australia later this year. It will be among his very first bilateral visits since becoming president, and it underlines yet again the very high priority placed on the very close working relationship between the leadership of the Australian government and the leadership of China. I also had the opportunity of meeting the new premier, the new Chairman of the National People's Congress and also former president Jiang Zemin, who is now the Chairman of the Central Military Commission. I can report to the House that relations between Australia and the People's Republic of China are in excellent shape. We remain two nations with vastly different histories and vastly different cultural backgrounds but led by governments determined to find common ground, determined to focus on points of agreement, determined to work together - particularly in relation to matters such as North Korea - to achieve effective outcomes.I conclude by complimenting the government of China on the very constructive role it has played in bringing about the six-power talks on North Korea that will take place in Beijing next week. I believe that the role played by China has been very much in line with its commitment to be a constructive international citizen in the region. It is something that Australia has urged, and it is something that all members of the House should welcome.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Moore for his question; he gave a lifetime of service to health as a medical practitioner before coming into federal parliament. Today is a day where we recognise a disease which is affecting at least one million Australians, and possibly many more - particularly those with type 2 diabetes who are living with it but who do not yet realise that they have it. In particular today, we focus on some 100,000 Australians, mainly young people, who are suffering from type 1 diabetes, or insulin dependent diabetes. Today, 100 young people, their carers and families have come to the federal parliament. On behalf of all of us in this parliament, we welcome you and thank you for your advocacy and your concern for a better understanding and focus upon type 1, insulin dependent, diabetes. Every three hours of the day, an Australian dies from the complications of insulin dependent diabetes - from diseases which affect the brain, the heart, the kidney, the eye and from a variety of other disorders throughout the body. Apart from the members for Pearce and Lyons, there would be few of us in this parliament who could really understand what it is like to suffer from, and live with, diabetes. The Commonwealth, in working with medical authorities and state and territory governments, is doing three things: firstly, focusing on research; secondly, focusing on the management of diabetes; and, thirdly, promoting an awareness throughout the rest of the community - for those of us who are not directly affected by diabetes - to understand the importance of diabetes and the importance of supporting people, including children and their families, who live with this disease.This year the Commonwealth government will commit $20 million specifically for research into diabetes. It will include the National Health and Medical Research Council working with the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation. The Diabetes Vaccine Development Centre will be supported by the Commonwealth government, as will program specific research initiatives into type 1, insulin dependent, diabetes. This year the government has committed $2.3 million for the National Diabetes Strategy, to which all of the state and territories have signed up. That will focus in particular on making sure that the doctors and the nurses of this country provide the best and most up-to-date care to young people who have diabetes and their families. The government has also supported the national diabetes register. For the first time, we can now track though their lives the long-term progress of people in this country who suffer from diabetes and the impact that diabetes has on their health.The other important initiative which the Commonwealth has undertaken is to establish in Australia the Cochran collaboration. This is based in practices where doctors and specialists work with people with diabetes to make sure that we have treatment which is based on good evidence, to make sure that Australia's doctors are treating people effectively and appropriately. In July, Australia's Minister for Health and Ageing, Senator Kay Patterson, announced $800,000 for community projects, which are in part a buddy system, so that older children in particular can support younger children who are learning to live with their diabetes.Finally, the Commonwealth government is doing everything it possibly can to ensure that Australia's Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme is on a long-term, sound footing for the future. While this parliament respects the legitimacy of the people who disagree with it, this parliament did support and does support stem cell research. That will play an important role in making sure that we understand not only the basis of the disease but how we might best prevent it well into the future.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Barker for his question. I can inform him that the Westpac-Melbourne Institute survey was released this morning and it showed that the annualised growth rate of the leading index of economic activity was 5.5 per cent in June, well above the long-term trend of 3.3 per cent. Westpac said that the index for June points to solid growth recovery in the Australian economy in the first half of 2004. That is a leading index which is designed to try and get some fix on prospects in some time to come.The Australian economy through the course of 2003 has been under pressure from global downturn and of course the worst drought in Australia's recorded history. That has weakened exports and that has detracted from growth. It is welcome that the leading indicators point to the fact that growth will be picking up in 2004.How does that compare to international forecasts? As TheEconomist records in its most recent edition, Australia is expected to lead the world in 2004 after leading the world in 2003. In TheEconomist poll of forecasters the August average has Australia forecast to grow at 2.8 per cent in 2003, leading all of the developed countries, and to grow at 3.5 per cent in 2004, again leading all of the developed countries. In 2004 we expect - indeed, we hope - that the US economy will begin its recovery.One of the reasons why Australia has led the world, notwithstanding the drought and notwithstanding the global downturn, is the amount of reform that has been accomplished in this economy. As the OECD said:Dogged pursuit of structural reform across a very broad front and prudent economic policies firmly set in a medium-term framework, have combined to make Australia one of the best performing economies in the OECD and also notably resilient to shocks, both internal and external. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Mallee for his question. The member for Mallee knows only too well the importance - particularly in his electorate - of exports going out of Australia in terms of creating jobs in the local community. In Mallee, the dried fruit industry, the citrus industry, the wheat industry and the wool industry have been affected by the ravages of drought in recent times. They have been ably represented in terms of their case being argued.During the period that we have been in office we have seen over a million new jobs created in the economy. It is a well-known fact that one in five jobs in our economy relies for its existence on exporting out of this country - selling something we grow or produce to the rest of the world. Arguably, in our time in office 200,000 new jobs have been generated in exporting industries in Australia. They have been created as a result of the strong economic performance that the Treasurer just spoke about and the strong trade performance of our export efforts.The government's No. 1 trade policy objective still remains to be a successful outcome in the WTO in the current Doha round of negotiations, in particular with regard to those agricultural industries that are represented in his electorate by the member for Mallee. Agriculture negotiations are still, and always will remain, a tough challenge. Last week in Geneva the US and the EU negotiators produced a paper that may be a road map to progress the negotiations at the Cancun meeting coming up in three weeks time. We welcome the moves that have been made by the US and the EU but they do not go far enough and Australia and the Cairns Group are not satisfied with some of the suggestions in that paper for reform.For example, it does not deliver enough, in our view, with regard to market access for agriculture. The EU is still not agreeing to eliminate export subsidies. It proposes the abolition of single desk arrangements - so-called STEs - which we believe is totally unacceptable. So in three weeks time the Australian negotiating team will go to Cancun advocating a very strong position as far as Australia's agricultural producers are concerned. Farmers in Australia have been waiting a long time for reform in agricultural trade globally. We will not be agreeing to any outcome in the multilateral negotiations that does not substantially improve the trading circumstances for Australia's farmers.</DOC>

 - In the time that I have been back in Australia, I have not examined all of the material on this issue, and I am continuing to do so. When I have completed that examination, I will finalise my response. - Having had the opportunity of discussing this matter with the minister, I want to say at the outset that I thought the minister was quite foolish and wrong to use his ministerial letterhead to make these representations. Having thought about the matter and having consulted a number of people whose views I respect, I think the point has to be made that it is open to any citizen to seek representations to be made on their behalf in relation to even the imposition of a fine. We frequently as members of parliament get representations in relation to the conduct of people over whom we have absolutely no control. - I frequently get people writing to me saying that they think the Commissioner of Taxation charges too much. I duly send the representations on to the Treasurer -  - I send them on to the Treasurer, the Treasurer duly deals with them and they write back again and say, `I haven't got the right response from the Treasurer.' Let us establish at the beginning that there is nothing inherently wrong in a citizen having representations made in relation to what was, at the time the first representation was made, as I understand it, the issuing of what is quaintly called an expiation notice - in other words, an on-the-spot fine, not a court imposed fine. As I understand it, when the first letter was written by the minister that is all that had been issued. But I do think, as I indicated to the minister privately - and I have no reluctance in saying it publicly - that he was very foolish indeed to have written this on his ministerial letterhead. In fact, I take the opportunity while I am on my feet to suggest that if any other ministers are in that sort of situation they should recommend that the person in question approach somebody else to have the representation made on their behalf. I think the most interesting thing about this whole issue -  - is that, as the Leader of the Opposition said, it is true that the police minister indicated that it would be improper and illegal for him to interfere in the court process. But he did not, when he got the representation, write back and say to the minister, `It is wrong and outrageous of you to make representations to me.' He did not say that, nor indeed -  -  - I was just waiting for the noise to subside. The minister has not broken the law in what he has done. The question that arises is whether the totality of his conduct -  - represents a failure of proper ministerial standards. On the information that I have thus far seen I am not persuaded that it does and, in those circumstances, I do not intend to accede to the Leader of the Opposition's request.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Eden-Monaro for his question. I regret to inform the House that last week the Senate rejected the termination of employment bill which the government had put before it. This bill had two objectives: firstly, to improve the operation of the federal unfair dismissal law system and, secondly - and very importantly - to extend federal coverage to some 85 per cent of the Australian work force. This bill would have been a major step forward, a major step towards the goal of a more unified national system of workplace relations. A more unified national system of workplace relations has been a long-term goal of people on both sides of this House. For instance, the important union official Bill Shorten, National Secretary of the Australian Workers Union, argued last year:Variations in state laws are time-consuming and frustrating for employees.The former shadow minister, the member for Barton said last year:Labor supports the idea of a more coherent national industrial relations system.The member for Werriwa - I know he would not like to be passed over - said a couple of years back that the New South Wales government should give up its workplace relations powers to the Commonwealth. The Leader of the Opposition himself, when he was president of the ACTU, said: There is a substantial view within the ACTU - to which he made his 28th annual pilgrimage yesterday - that there should be a movement towards the development of a national industrial relations system.I would ask that members opposite consult their principles when this bill is reintroduced into this parliament in three months time. Even the current shadow minister, the member for Rankin, said last year:By opposing for the sake of opposing, Labor will have let Australia down badly.I would like to think that this statement of his made last year - and not his more recent statements - reflects his true approach. The member for Rankin and his colleagues will have an opportunity to be true to their principles when this bill is reintroduced into the House in three months time.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Farrer for her advocacy for small businesses in her electorate and for representing one of the award winners from the Telstra and Australian government small business awards, which were held in Melbourne last week. The winner from the member for Farrer's electorate was Descend Underwater Training Centre, which is a great small business. It won the microbusiness award for a business with fewer than five full-time employees. This business trains scuba divers working in irrigation, water supply, hydro power generation and offshore oil industries. It is a great story because this little business is based in Albury, which of course is a regional centre, yet it undertakes work throughout the country. One of the sadder tasks the award winner talked about was how they work closely with the police in searching for bodies in dams and a range of other places. It is a reminder of how important these small businesses are to help many communities through fairly difficult circumstances.One of the other award winners was Rural Directions from South Australia, which is an agribusiness that offers consulting, grain marketing, and research and development services. The winner of the Panasonic Australian business award was Microforte from the ACT, which has been engaged by Bill Gates to work on a new game for Xbox. This is a great step forward for the ACT, which has become one of the leading centres for IT in Australia. From Tasmania - and this will probably please the member for Lyons - Telstra Country Wide's regional incentive award went to Tas-Saff, which is a commercial saffron grower. Most significantly, the national award winner this year was Footwear Industries from Western Australia. They stood up on the stage - this great bunch of hardworking Australians - and said, `Some people said that the textile, clothing and footwear industry was dead, but let us tell you that it has never been more alive.' This business, established in 1995, designs and manufactures industrial safety footwear under the premium brand `Steel Blue' and the budget brand `Howler'. Footwear Industries thanked the federal government for its support and noted that it now sells more than 350,000 pairs of safety boots in Australia and around the world. This is a clear indication not only of how small business is important to the Australian economy and to regional economies but, significantly, that it is a growing exporter.  All of the measures that we put in place - such as lowering company tax from 36 per cent to 30 per cent, abolishing FID, reducing fuel excise, abolishing wholesale sales tax, abolishing provisional tax and removing capital gains for those people who are retiring on the proceeds of the sale of their small business - are about helping small business to grow. Everything we are doing is about helping small businesses, particularly in regional Australia, to go on to win national awards such as these. The Australian government is proud to support national awards because they recognise excellence in small business.</DOC>

 - As I have made entirely clear, the draft bill which the government has prepared in relation to charities codifies the current common law. I would have thought the member for Werriwa, if he had not understood that previously, would have understood that by reading what I wrote in the Financial Review on the subject yesterday. - He interjects that he did not read it. I would recommend to him that he read what I had to say in the Financial Review yesterday, which is this: `As the commissioner's charities pack currently provides, in order to be a charity at common law, one needs to have a charitable purpose. One can engage in lobbying activity, if that is incidental to the charitable purpose.' The instructions which were given to the parliamentary draftsman were in fact to produce a bill which codified that position, and the bill does in fact do that. As I have also indicated, this is the reason why the government is in no great rush to pass the bill because, whether the bill passes or not, the law on this point does not change: to be a charity one must have a charitable purpose. One can engage in lobbying activity, if that is incidental to the charitable purpose. But a lobby group - that is, a group which exists for a predominant or dominant purpose of lobbying - does not qualify under the common law, nor would it qualify under the draft bill.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Forde for the interest she shows in these important bilateral relationships. Today we have visiting us here in Canberra the foreign minister of Indonesia, Hassan Wirajuda, and I have had a very enjoyable part of the morning with him. I know the Prime Minister has seen him this morning and I think the Treasurer and other ministers either have seen him or are to see him. Amongst other topics that the foreign minister and I discussed, we agreed that Australia and Indonesia would co-host a regional ministerial conference on counter-terrorism early next year. We have been able to work through some of the broad details of who will be invited to that conference and the nature of it. I would just say that both Hassan Wirajuda and I believe that the more we can do to contribute to strengthening regional cooperation on counter-terrorism the better. Our two countries have worked extraordinarily well together on counter-terrorism since the Bali bombing and this will be a very major step forward, I believe, in enhancing regional cooperation right across the region into the future.Both of us agreed that our bilateral relationship is in good shape. The Minister for Trade can take some credit for the fact that we have never in Australia's history had more trade with Indonesia than we had during last calendar year. We have been able to discuss in a constructive way issues of mutual concern such as Papua and Aceh and also the very important and significant issue for the ASEAN region, and that is the current situation in Burma. On Monday Hassan Wirajuda is coming to the Adelaide Hills, as is Jose Ramos-Horta, the foreign minister of East Timor. We will all meet together in the electorate of Mayo and we will hold the second trilateral dialogue at the ministerial level between Australia, Indonesia and East Timor. I know those two foreign ministers will be warmly welcomed in Mayo, and they are warmly welcomed, more generally of course, in Australia. That trilateral dialogue worked very well the last time it was held in Indonesia. I think it provides a valuable opportunity for the three of us to talk in an informal setting part-icularly about security developments in the region, and obviously the issue of terrorism, but importantly the future of United Nations involvement in East Timor now that East Timorese independence is well and truly under way. So I think our relationship with Indonesia, as well as with East Timor, is in very good shape and is a very strong relationship. It is built partly on the strong people-to-people links we have and our commercial links, but I think the work we have been doing together on counter-terrorism, through our military, our police, our intelligence services and our diplomats, has really thrown our two countries together in a way that we have not worked together in the past.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Moncrieff for the interest he shows in Operation Helpem Fren, the Australian led operation to help restore law and order and economic prosperity in the Solomon Islands. The weapons amnesty which was imposed after the arrival of the intervention force comes to an end at midnight tonight. The leaders of the Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands expect that over 3,000 weapons will have been collected by the conclusion of the amnesty at midnight tonight. Final details are going to take a few days to complete, given the very large number of weapons that have been collected. Latest reports indicate that well over 300 of these weapons were high-powered ex-police guns. Other weapons collected include light machine guns, grenade launchers and numerous shotguns, rifles and hand guns. Also, interestingly, 300,000 rounds of ammunition have been collected.Many weapon handovers have been accompanied by community peace ceremonies and on-the-spot destruction of weapons. This means that these terrible weapons are no longer a threat to the lives of ordinary Solomon Islanders. After a very few weeks, I think it has to be accepted that the intervention force has been enormously successful in taking a very large number of guns out of the Solomon Islands. Every day during the amnesty weapons were handed in, but we have to understand that from tonight there will be no amnesty and accept that, nevertheless, there will still be some guns out there in the Solomon Islands. The regional assistance mission will be going after those guns, and people found with those guns will have to face the Solomon Islands justice system. I have great confidence that the regional assistance mission will be able to find those weapons, because it is able to use advanced technology, sophisticated and well-trained police and other resources. It is also able to get the assistance of the local community to find, take and ultimately destroy the weapons.Work on one of the very central issues that we have to address - budget stabilisation - has now commenced in earnest. Senior public servants are able to work properly in ministries like the finance department because they are no longer subject to harassment or intimidation from gunmen in the community. Australian experts are now taking up in-line positions to assist the rebuilding of the government administration. Our immediate priorities are to ensure that public servants such as schoolteachers get paid on time and that government departments can deliver basic services such as health to the people of the Solomon Islands. Australia can be well proud of the role we have played in leading the regional intervention force, and we should pay great tribute to those who are in that force for the excellent work they have done so far. </DOC>

 - I am aware that, when the minister's son wrote, there was a reply sent which said something substantially to the effect of what the Leader of the Opposition has suggested. I am aware of that. I am not aware, without checking, of any other advice from the police. That may be the police advice to which the Leader of the Opposition is referring. It is my recollection, without looking at the papers - and I could be wrong; I may have to correct this - that this reply from the police was in fact appended to the minister's first letter to the South Australian minister. That is my recollection.It remains the case that the minister made representations. Whether the minister was across the detail of South Australian law when he wrote, I do not know. In fact I doubt if he was aware of the provisions of the South Australian law. -  - Mr Speaker, if members of the opposition want an answer they will stop interjecting; otherwise I will sit down. - It remains the case that any citizen is entitled to make representations. Effectively what the Leader of the Opposition is alleging is that every time somebody writes to a minister or to the Treasurer complaining about their taxation assessment they are asking -  -  - No - the Treasurer to break the law, because the Leader of the Opposition knows full well that the Commissioner of Taxation has full statutory independence and it would be a breach of the law for the Treasurer to try and interfere with it. So any suggestion to that effect is absolute nonsense. It is an absurd proposition and it is an attempt to justify this flailing effort by the opposition to impugn the legality of what the minister did, as distinct from what I have made very plain was the lack of commonsense he displayed.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Macarthur for his question and for the work that he does for the people of Macarthur. It is good to have good representation out there in the western suburbs of Sydney from a good member. Today I signed, with the British High Commissioner, Sir Alastair Goodlad, a new Australia-United Kingdom double taxation treaty. This follows on from the successful renegotiation of the Australia-United States double taxation agreement. It acts according to the recommendation that was given to the government by the Ralph Review of Business Taxation to modernise our tax treatment network. It reduces withholding taxes on interest, royalties and dividends. It gives Australian businesses that are expanding overseas a better opportunity to grow their markets - to find new markets and new profit centres so that they can bring income back to Australia. It will also help British companies that want to come and invest here in Australia - Britain being the second largest investor in Australia. We have to recognise that in the modern world, as our companies want to go and become world size, we have to give them a fair go out there growing job opportunities for Australians. I commend the Australia-UK double tax agreement to the parliament and to the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit - I know the member for Curtin, as chair of the committee, will be looking at it shortly - for their consideration.This is part of this government's proposals to cut tax, to reduce tax on business and to create jobs. What is the benefit of a successful business sector in this country? It is this: since the government has been elected, one million new jobs have been created in the Australian economy. You cannot create new jobs without having successful businesses. There is no employee without an employer. Unless you have a business that can make a profit, there is not a person who can actually offer a job - and we want to offer jobs to people in Macarthur and elsewhere.One thing we know of the Labor Party, of course, is the Labor Party wants taxes in this country to be higher. I have remarked already on the ominous silence we get when we raise the question of stamp duty in this parliament - not a whimper over stamp duty from the Australian Labor Party. I have alerted the House to the heinous campaign of the ACTU, which is complaining that tax is too low in this country and that we are the sixth lowest-taxing country in the OECD. I have alerted the House to the fact that they want to put up a Medicare surcharge. But do you know that the Australian Labor Party has announced a tax increase of $470 million on the mining sector in Australia? That is an increase of 2c a litre on every mining company that operates in Australia. So who is going to lose out? Those people who work in mining companies - the kinds of people that the Labor Party used to pretend it looked after: people who were miners, who went down the mines and wanted to know that they had a job at the end of the day. And yet we find the federal Labor Party is proposing to increase tax in this country. What does the member for Hunter say about that? The Hunter used to be a proud mining area. We say to the miners of the Hunter, `This member no longer represents you.' He does not represent the miners of the Hunter anymore - $470 million in diesel fuel rebates.Mr Speaker, I can inform the House that not all Labor is as stupid as federal Labor. The mining minister in the Tasmanian government was asked today about how his concern for the mining industry sits with federal Labor's policy to reduce the diesel fuel rebate by 10 per cent. In the Tasmanian parliament today, Mr Lennon said - and I commend him to his comrades, the minister for mining down in Tasmania: On the issue of the Diesel Fuel Rebate let there be no doubt at all the Tasmanian government does not support the position being advanced by Federal Labor on this issue.One-nil Tasmanian Labor over federal Labor.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Cook for his question, and I can assure him that the government is committed to driving workplace relations best practice, particularly in the way Commonwealth government agencies operate. I am pleased that the level of industrial disputes in the Commonwealth Public Service has dropped significantly over the last few years, and that managers are making much better use of the freedoms and flexibilities available under the Workplace Relations Act, such as non-union certified agreements and Australian workplace agreements.There is a right and a wrong way to drive workplace relations change. When he first went onto Liverpool council, the member for Werriwa described local government as `a sheltered workshop'. As soon as he became mayor, the member for Werriwa tried to double the mayoral salary and to introduce a new $60 allowance for every meeting he attended. He then put the senior staff on individual contracts and, according to the local paper, set up a hit list of senior officers who did not meet with mayoral approval. This was so popular that council workers passed a resolution of no confidence in Mayor Latham by a margin of 243 votes to two! In response, Mayor Latham accused council staff - this is the respect he has for the working people of Liverpool - of sleeping under trees during work hours, rorting RDOs and having a featherbedding and jobs-for-life mentality.The member for Werriwa says that he is against crony capitalism, and he has been particularly agitated about people making representations on behalf of family members. When he was on the council, one councillor asked: `Is it true that Mr Latham's sister was employed by council? If it is, was political influence used to get her a job?' That was the question put. According to the local paper, the member for Werriwa almost started a fist fight over this question - until the then mayor, Craig Knowles, intervened. In 1992, when the member for Werriwa was the mayor -   - I can understand the member for Werriwa's consternation, but at the close of this answer I will table documents and that will put the member for Werriwa's mind at rest. In 1992, when the member for Werriwa was the mayor, Liverpool council gave the member for Werriwa's sister a job as a caretaker, including rent-free accommodation in a historic council property. - The job was given to the member for Werriwa's sister without proper disclosure and without advertising the position. - Let me say this: if the member for Werriwa is against crony capitalism, what has he been practising? Crony socialism? In fact, he is not so much a crony socialist as a phoney socialist! - Mr Speaker, let me bring this answer to a close. In one of his books, the member for Werriwa said, `The ALP has always been an ideologically confused party.' It is not so much that the Labor Party is ideologically confused but that the member for Werriwa is a socialist failure. That is what he is; he is a socialist failure. I table the relevant documents.</DOC>

 - There is clearly a misapprehension as to my position on these matters, as was just demonstrated. Accordingly, I want to deal with those issues raised to date. First, as I indicated to the House, I made it plain in my letter to the then South Australian state police minister that I was writing on behalf of my son. Second, I referred to it as a constituent inquiry. In any representations I make on behalf of others, wherever they reside, I have always treated such letters as a constituent matter to differentiate them from other official business. During my time as a member of parliament and a minister, I have received numerous requests from many parts of Australia, and WA in particular, from people seeking my representations. Many of these people reside in Labor electorates - as does my son, in the electorate of Swan. My policy has always been to make such representations wherever possible, and I have always categorised such representations as constituent work, irrespective of the address of the individual involved.However, as indicated in my statement to the House yesterday morning, I want to make it clear that, if my words were construed as indicating my son is an elector in the seat of O'Connor, then I wish to again make it clear he is not a resident in the electorate of O'Connor. Third, as I also advised the House yesterday, I wrote two letters to the South Australian state police minister on ministerial letterhead. The third was written on my electorate stationery. I have apologised for the use of the ministerial letterhead and do so again now. I deal directly with claims of misleading the House that have been raised by the opposition. In my answer to the member for Corio on Tuesday, my reference to not pressing the matter any further was a reference to the three letters he mentioned in his question. I can understand why some people might put a different construction on the Hansardrecord, and perhaps I should have made myself more clear. I am sorry that in the swirl and fog of question time I did not do so.With respect to the allegation that I misled the House when I said, `I did not ask that it be changed,' my initial letter makes it clear that I asked for the matter to be reconsidered, not changed. Subsequently, I called for the minister to reconsider the additional costs imposed. This is clear from my letter of 16 January 2003. All I could do, and all I did, was to make a representation. It was a matter for the South Australian authorities to examine the matters put to them and come to a conclusion. I sought to have the matters examined and to be advised of the outcome, which the South Australian minister eventually did after referring the matter to the police department in the way representations of this sort are, I presume, normally handled. The two subsequent letters were about the way the matter was handled, rather than the initial infringement. Indeed - and this may be of some interest to the opposition - the South Australian authorities have remedies available to them to have the matter reconsidered. My son was advised by letter on 15 May 2003 that he could lodge an application to have the enforcement order revoked. This letter came from the Courts Administration Authority of South Australia. In the letter from the Courts Administration Authority he is advised that once the application - the application they sent to him - had been completed and lodged he would be notified of the hearing date to attend court and, if successful in his application, the enforcement order would be removed and the fine reinstated to the original amount.While I acknowledge that I should have handled aspects of the matter differently in terms of the letterhead, I have tried at all times to be frank and honest with the parliament and hope this answer and earlier statements resolve any misunderstanding or lack of clarity. In my almost 23 years in the House of Representatives I have never sought to mislead the House and I did not intentionally do so in dealing with these matters. - I am happy to table it.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for McPherson for her question. Obviously, increased trade and investment flows as the Iraqi people take control of their country, and the resources in their country will play a crucial role in the ongoing development of Iraq for the benefit of the Iraqi people.This morning I had the opportunity of meeting with the Hon. Jalal Talabani, the member of the Iraqi Governing Council who was here in the chamber a short while ago, to have a discussion on these issues with regard to the sorts of things that the Australian government and Australia as a nation trading in the region can do with Iraq and the future administration of Iraq. This was the first visit to Australia by an Iraqi political leader since the fall of Saddam Hussein's regime.During our discussions this morning, Mr Talabani thanked me and the Australian government and people for their participation in the liberation of Iraq. I made it clear to him that the deplorable terrorist attack earlier this week in Baghdad will not deter the coalition or the international community from our shared commitment to help the Iraqi people achieve peace, democracy and economic development. Australia is continuing to work together with the Iraqi people to assist with Iraq's rehabilitation.We agreed in those discussions that trade and investment will in fact be key drivers in the rebuilding of the Iraqi economy. Mr Talabani said to me that he is keen to see Australian companies build closer ties with their Iraqi counterparts. That is already happening. There are a number of Australian companies that are active in the region that have sought out joint venture arrangements to participate in the rebuilding of Iraq - companies like AWB, Worley, Sagric, GRM, Multiplex and APW have already made contact with their counterparts in Iraq. As far as the government is concerned, we are providing an Australian expert to act as an adviser in the establishment of an Iraqi trading bank. We are helping to rebuild the Iraqi ministry of trade and are providing agricultural experts, led by Trevor Flugge, to the Iraqi Governing Council to rehabilitate Iraq's agricultural sector. It is well known that we have established a mission headed up by Ambassador Neil Mules in Baghdad. We have a senior trade commissioner at the moment in Kuwait working with Iraqi companies looking to make contact with Australian business. It is interesting to note that Australia has helped feed the people of Iraq by delivering 400,000 tonnes of wheat since hostilities ended.What we want to see is Iraq governed by Iraqis in a manner that upholds the basic principles of democracy and leads to sustained economic development. We will continue to work on behalf of Australian companies and with Iraqi authorities to see this achieved.</DOC>

 - I would like to thank the member for La Trobe, himself an experienced small businessman. He set up his own business as a carpenter and built it into a very large building company. Now he has built up a great Liberal seat in La Trobe, and we look forward to his Liberal successor building on that hard work. There is a consistent message from Australia's 3.3 million small business -  - That message is for governments to get out of the way and for there to be less regulation - `Please do not restrict us; please do not overtax us.' - I was alarmed when I recently heard that the President of the ACTU, Sharan Burrow, wants to introduce a cap on working hours - more regulation and more red tape for small business. I thought I had heard of this idea somewhere. I married it with the fact that I know that the Leader of the Opposition has a great fondness for Bordeaux. So one plus one equals -  - One plus one - it had better add up. One plus one equals a French example of the Labor Party's policy being put into practice. A simple search of the Internet found headlines such as `French workaholics beware: the law is moving in', `Making hard work illegal' and `Only in France: Government fines companies for overtime'. Small businesses in France say that labour inspectors are hiding in bushes on stake-out looking for lights on in offices, counting cars in company parking lots and photographing licence plates.So you can imagine: Sharan Burrow at five past seven at night, holding a clock at the window - tap, tap, tap, `Out; all out!' Or how about Craig Johnston, the AMWU boss - we remember him; Skilled Engineering fame - using some of his riot, affray and criminal damage and aggravated burglary skills to get people out of the office at five past five? How about some of the ETU boys asking staff to take a trip down to Trades Hall for some questioning about just how long they might be working? How about the CFMEU? They have a history of entering buildings. We remember them entering Parliament House a few years ago. They do not need excuses such as this. So how are the small businesses in France coping with this?Get a load of this - this is the red tape the Labor Party wants for small business. According to the French media, employees are smuggling laptops and cellular phones under their raincoats to get past the labour inspectors; businesses are renting hotel rooms for staff to work in secret; and small businesses are reintroducing punch cards. Of course, all of this costs money. So to pay for it, the French government will have to raise more than $5 billion in new taxes next year. We know the Labor Party is very fond of taxes - very fond of higher taxes. Well, here is an excuse. As one French business operator put it, `If we're obligated to go to 35 hours, it would be like requiring French athletes to run the 100 metres wearing flippers.' If the member for Hotham and his friends in the ACTU keep attacking small business, they are going to put all of Australia's 1.1 million small businesses in a decompression chamber. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Dickson for his very substantial question. The government believes that Australia has a quite remarkable heritage. We have places of triumph and tragedy, buildings that have witnessed great events, machines that led the world in their day and an Indigenous heritage important in the whole human story. It is a heritage of which Australians are very proud. It underpins our national identity as a democratic, confident, inventive nation. Today the Senate has passed the Howard government's landmark heritage legislation that will establish, for the first time, a truly national scheme for the identification and preservation of our nationally important heritage. On the basis of this legislation, the government will be engaging the Australian people in a national effort to identify our most significant national heritage. Every major heritage organisation in Australia supported this legislation, which was negotiated, in the end, between the government and Senator Meg Lees's Australian Progressive Alliance. The Australian Council of National Trusts has called this legislation a major step forward for heritage.  - There is only one organisation which has consistently opposed this legislation, and that is the Australian Labor Party. The Australian Labor Party was deaf throughout this process to the pleas and support of Australia's heritage organisations. I think the problem is that many in the Australian Labor Party have a completely different view of our national heritage: they think that our national heritage is a cause not for pride and celebration but a cause for shame. The member for Melbourne has been good enough to put his views on national heritage on the public record in his book Open Australia. What does he think about national heritage? He thinks that our national identity is `laden with uncertainty, doubt and inferiority'. In a speech to a Young Labor conference the member for Jagajaga opined this opinion:Australia, a nation that once embraced people in distress, has become a captive of encouraged prejudice.The Left of the Labor Party meet every Saturday morning in their wine bars and coffee shops and tell each other how prejudiced the rest of Australia is and how ashamed they ought to be of their national heritage. - This is a problem that the Labor Party face: they have a left wing which believes that this country should be ashamed of its heritage and its history, and we have members who are putting this on the public record. They are even out of touch with their own grassroots, and indeed with some of the state premiers. I had a letter from the Tasmanian Premier Jim Bacon urging me to include the historic Port Arthur site on the new national list under this legislation. He made his request based on the fact that this legislation would release some $13.4 million of new funding for the preservation of Australian heritage. So while we have state premiers supporting the legislation, we have the federal Labor Party opposing it right down to the wire because they do not have that pride in Australia which most Australians have and which the government has. Mr Speaker, Labor's opposition to these bills and to the distinctively Australian program just shows how out of touch they are. They are opposed to it. - This government is proud of Australia. Crean Labor have no understanding of Australia's past, no idea of where we are now and no idea about where they want to go in the future.</DOC>

 - The answer to the Leader of the Opposition's question is the same as the answer that I have given persistently, and that is that I do not believe that I have misled the House. I simply repeat to the Leader of the Opposition that the context in which I answered questions, the context set by the member for Chisholm when she asked the question, clearly indicates that I did not mislead the House. I therefore will not be acceding to the invitation so graciously extended to me by the Leader of the Opposition.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Maranoa for the question. I know he will be pleased to know that the farmers in the Stanthorpe and Inglewood area in his own electorate are amongst those who have recently been declared eligible for exceptional circumstances. He has lobbied long and hard on behalf of those farmers. He has had to battle, like many other Queensland farmers, with state applications from a government that could not care less about the plight of farmers.In fact, the Queensland government was not even prepared to involve itself in the preparation of applications up until it was shamed into it a few months ago. The agricultural organisations in that state have had to take the task upon themselves and people like AgForce have had to do the work. But at last these farmers are now to receive benefits along with quite a large number of other Australian farmers. In fact, 65 per cent of the landmass of Australia - the agricultural areas - is now covered by exceptional circumstances or interim assistance. So the Commonwealth is making a deep and significant commitment to drought assistance. As I mentioned to the House earlier in the week, around $1 billion is committed to provide support for farmers at the present time.That contrasts very sharply with the efforts of the state governments. I have noticed lately, on a number of occasions, state governments telling everybody about their achievements. The Queensland minister boasted about having provided $4.8 million in assistance to Queensland farmers through the state subsidy scheme - a mere $4.8 million. The Commonwealth takes only three days to provide that amount of assistance to Australian farmers, and that is all that the Queensland government has been able to manage for its producers for the drought. Its effort is indeed shameful. In the Victorian rural press, there was boasting from the Victorian government that it is giving close to $50 million worth of assistance. I have often given credit to the Victorian government for doing more than other states. Indeed, Victoria has spent more than all the other states put together. However, as far as the Victorian state Labor government is concerned, the drought was over as soon as the election was over. So this amount is also its total expenditure, because it does not believe there is any drought in Victoria any more - except that it keeps lodging applications with the Commonwealth for exceptional circumstances. There is not a drought there that is bad enough for the Victorian government to offer any assistance, but it keeps demanding that the Commonwealth do more and more. Frankly, that kind of hypocritical approach brings no credit on that government whatsoever.But it is worse than that. Many of these state governments are not only providing paltry help to farmers in need and withdrawing what little assistance they have got but also, in most instances, imposing new taxes and charges on drought stricken farmers - at a time when they can least afford it. The Treasurer has often spoken about the 300 increased taxes in the last Victorian state budget; many of those fall heavily on farmers. A recent report in Queensland has spoken about over 800 new taxes and tax rises that the Queensland government has introduced since the arrival of Premier Beattie on the scene, and many of those are particularly targeted at farmers. Now the state government has introduced a new charge for farmers moving their cattle from one property to another, and so drought stricken farmers are affected by a new tax when they want to move their stock. There are increased freight rates for moving precious hay and fodder to drought stricken areas. What about their incredible new tax on farm dams? Farm dams, many of which are stone empty in the drought, are now subject to a new Queensland government tax. Not only are they providing no assistance; they are eroding the value of the billion dollars worth of assistance that the Commonwealth is providing to farmers. That is not the kind of partnership we need in these sorts of circumstances. Never once have I heard a member opposite bring to task their state government for the lousy performance it has put up in this drought.If that has not added insult to injury, a real shudder went around the farms of Australia when farmers heard that Labor was going to abolish the excise rebate, the diesel fuel rebate, for the mining industry - abolishing the rebate for miners. The real concern is that, if they can do it to miners, the next call will be farmers; next time there is a spending spree by Labor, farmers will lose the diesel fuel rebate as well. Labor has no commitment to farmers; Labor in state governments has demonstrated it - and here in the federal House it has been just as bad.</DOC>

 - Was that a rephrased question? - I will answer the first one; I did not catch the rephrased one. Let me say to the Leader of the Opposition: nothing has changed my view about the context in which I made those answers in September 2002. I do not believe that I misled the House. In the time that I have been in this place I have always set out to be truthful and candid with this parliament. As to the position of the minister for regional services, I have already indicated my view of the wisdom of the action that he took, but he has endeavoured to cover the matters in a detailed answer to a question. I indicated to the House yesterday that in the material I had studied I was unpersuaded that the circumstances warranted my withdrawing his commission, and thus far I have not heard or seen anything to alter that provisional view.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question and recognise the interest the member shows in these issues. During the intervening two weeks when the House has not been sitting, I have had the opportunity to sign counter-terrorism arrangements with the East Timorese foreign minister, Jose Ramos Horta, on 25 August, and on 28 August, just three days later, a counter-terrorism agreement with the foreign minister of India. These two memoranda of understanding on counter-terrorism bring to eight the number of bilateral counter-terrorism memoranda of understanding that the government has concluded over the past 18 months. The first of these was signed with Indonesia by the Prime Minister in February of last year. These arrangements do provide a very important framework for practical cooperation on intelligence, security and defence relations between Australia and countries in the region - and cooperation at the regional level, as well as more broadly, is absolutely fundamental to ensuring that we are successful in the war against terrorism. During the recent visit to Australia by the Indonesian foreign minister, Hassan Wirajuda, the foreign minister and I agreed that we would conjointly host a regional ministerial summit on counter-terrorism in the early part of next year. The countries invited to this summit will be predominantly of course countries from the Asia-Pacific region but clearly the United States of America will be invited and possibly one or two others.The honourable member asked whether there are any alternative views, and I note that the member for Griffith, the opposition spokesman on foreign affairs, has talked about the need to address the issue of education in Indonesia. I welcome the comments that the honourable member has made because I too think that it is very important that this issue of pesantren be addressed and that is why - although not the only reason why; it is one of the reasons why - there has been a 25 per cent increase in Australia's aid to Indonesia this year. It explains why I have been talking about a focus on education aid to Indonesia in my discussions with the Americans and with the European Union during the course of this year.  So all I can say is that I think there is a growing recognition across the parliament that we have to do all we can in working with our partners and friends in Indonesia and in other countries of the region, but I particularly want to say how much I welcome the very rapidly improving relationship we have with India. I notice that the Premier of New South Wales, Mr Bob Carr - who, Mr Speaker, we understand is going to join us here in the House of Representatives before too long and possibly sit in your seat -  - Mr Speaker, I welcome the fact that he has said -  - Mayo is fine, I can tell you, and in Mayo we welcome the redistribution. -  - My heart goes out to you, Mr Speaker. I welcome the fact that the Premier of New South Wales, Mr Carr, is quoted in a newspaper headline: `PM has not hurt Asia ties, says Carr'. I could not agree more; I think the Prime Minister has done a great job in strengthening yet ever further our relations with Asia. But Mr Carr did say that Australia has neglected India - that of course is not true - and he said that several days after I had hosted the Indian foreign minister's visit and the third foreign ministers framework dialogue talks and signed the counter-terrorism memoranda of understanding. But Mr Carr does show a lot of knowledge of foreign affairs - more, if I may say with the greatest of respect, than the Leader of the Opposition shows.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Mackellar for her question. I can report to the House that since the House last sat we had the June quarter national account showing growth in the economy as a whole at 0.1 per cent and through the year at two per cent - in year average terms, 2.7 per cent. Whilst the domestic economy continues very strongly contributing in the expenditure measure about 1.5 percentage points to GDP, nearly all of that was wiped out by the net export position, with exports falling 4.7 per cent. Travel services were down in the June quarter by 16.6 per cent and agricultural incomes fell during the year by over 71.6 per cent. As I said at the time, coming together in the June quarter we had the worst drought in 100 years, we had the SARS virus and we had the downturn in the global economy. Australia has been affected by all of these events quite significantly, and in East Asia countries have been affected too - of course not by drought but by the other factors. Korea contracted by one per cent in the first half of 2003. In the June quarter Taiwan contracted by 2.5 per cent, Singapore contracted by three per cent and Hong Kong contracted by 3.7 per cent. Four of the G7 economies contracted in the June quarter and two of them - Germany and Italy - are in recession.The key to the changing global outlook is the US economy. There are tentative signs of recovery in the US, although one would not want to overstate them. There is enormous stimulus going to the US economy through official interest rates at one per cent, and the budget deficit in the US is now estimated to be around 4.3 per cent. Just to put that in context, a 4.3 per cent budget deficit in Australia would be a budget deficit of $32 billion, which is even greater than Labor's record of $17 billion in the mid-1990s. Although the June quarter result was very disappointing in the export sense, there are tentative signs of recovery in relation to the US economy and of improvement in relation to the drought, and we hope that the SARS virus is over. That is partly testimony to the resilience of the Australian economy.I too have been looking very carefully at the economic policies of the New South Wales Premier, anticipating his contribution to national economic life. He said after the last election that the electorate hesitated to vote for federal Labor because of concerns about economic management. - One of the reasons Australia is comparing well, notwithstanding the difficulties, is economic policy. What would ruin Australia more is Labor economic policy. We have the progressive expenditure tax, the PET theory of the member for Werriwa. He has supported state income taxes. He supports differential GSTs. He has supported capital gains tax on the family home, and for 12 hours he supported the abolition of negative gearing. - One of the reasons for the strength is that we avoid the more extreme lunacy of Labor Party prognostications on the economy, as represented by some of those policies. Somebody did say to me, `What would happen if the Leader of the Opposition were run over by a truck?' To which I said that he would not be run over by truck; if he is run over it will be by a Carr. I can assure you of that. Bob Carr was right in saying that federal Labor was a hesitation -   - The important thing is not to overreact, old son! Pretend that it does not worry you! - This government is committed to good economic policies, and we will continue to deliver them.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. Yesterday I was pleased to launch a major public awareness campaign called smartraveller.gov.au. It is a must-see destination on safe travel for Australians abroad. The simple message of this campaign to all Australians planning to travel overseas is to consult the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade travel advice as part of routine preparations for travel. The campaign also makes the point that we do not want to discourage Australians from travelling. Australians are encouraged to travel - to get out, see the world and broaden their horizons - but, at the same time, they should make sure that they consult the department's travel advice.Travel advisories provide important up-to-date information on overseas security conditions. They also provide practical advice on consular issues affecting Australians overseas. Since 11 September 2001, the department's web site has had an increase in use from 20,000 hits to 100,000 hits per month. But we want Australians to continue to use it, even more than they currently do, remembering that about three million Australians travel overseas every year, which is quite a sizeable proportion of the population.Yesterday I also launched the new consular touch-screen kiosk at Adelaide airport. There will be one of these kiosks in a number of the international airport terminals of our capital cities. This campaign facilitates access to travel advisories for people as they come in or go out of the country - particularly, of course, as they go out. It is true that they have booked their tickets and they are on their way out; nevertheless, they are now able to have a last look at the travel advisory before they get on the plane to ensure that their security is properly taken into account and that they are familiar with cultural issues in the countries they are going to.This is just another measure that the government has taken to underwrite the security of Australians, as best a government ever can, when they travel outside the country. But, as I said, we do not discourage Australians from travelling abroad. What we do say is that, when Australians travel abroad, they should take note of the Smartraveller service. It is a very good way of making sure that they are as secure as they can possibly be. </DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for the question. The connection between the Spanish person referred to by the Leader of the Opposition and people in Australia has been known for some considerable time. In fact, it first surfaced in about the year 2000. In 2000-01, the Australian intelligence authorities had close contact with the Spanish authorities on this particular issue. In June of this year, the government moved from what had been an intelligence gathering exercise to a criminal investigation exercise. I am advised that the AFP approached the Spanish authorities in June on a police-to-police basis to seek information concerning Abu Dahdah, or Yarkas, and Mr Bilal Khazal. The transmission of the formal request for mutual assistance occurred some time later.It is important, I think, to see this Spanish link in perspective. It is a peripheral part of a wider investigation of links between al-Qaeda and Australia. It is peripheral and it is not the most significant issue in this context. The fact that this came to light because documents were publicised in Spain, in the Spanish court, in the middle of this year does not mean that the authorities have not been fully aware of it for some considerable time. They have, and they have acted on it.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. I also thank her for the hospitality she showed to me and quite a few others in her electorate last week. The driest inhabited continent on earth - which sees Australians using 30 per cent more water on average than other equivalent OECD countries - does, in my view, need a national water plan. We have taken a historic and very welcome step towards that. I particularly acknowledge the Prime Minister's leadership in securing that with the premiers, who then went off to play a game of poker and get dressed up outside Mark Vaile's office -  - Yes, that was a prearranged stunt. But on this one they got it right and they responded to the Prime Minister's lead, and I am very thankful for it. We need a national water plan to ensure sustainable use of our resources in a way that maximises the economic and job productivity of water, especially in regional Australia. So the national water initiative, which I must say - and this is very important - stands separate to the Living Murray process, will provide a proper blueprint for getting the Living Murray right. The national water initiative provides, firstly, for the provision of sound and agreed science and also for proper stakeholder consultation, because if people own and identify an agreed problem they will own a solution, where it is necessary to find one. It provides then for fair transitional arrangements, and those are very important in many cases. Fourthly, having got the sustainability, it then restores the certainty that is so critically needed. Certainty is the driver of and the prerequisite for investment certainty, and investment of course is what produces jobs, prosperity and, as we now know - it has been I think widely acknowledged and that is very welcome - investment is also the key to better environmental outcomes, because the investment that will be needed in better technology will be expensive and you cannot make that investment if you are operating in an environment of uncertainty. This very important work will now be taken forward. I acknowledge the role of the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Dr David Kemp, and the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Warren Truss, in pulling all of this together and now taking it forward. They will be oversighting - with a lot of interest I must say from yours truly - four task teams. One of those will be working on trading rules, one will be working on a national register, one will be working on transitional arrangements and one will be working on what the plan means for urban water users - because all Australians have to be involved in this plan. I reckon that is very widely welcomed.I should also say that this will provide a proper process in my view for taking forward the Living Murray process. I touched on that a moment ago. Australians want to know that water is used properly. They want to know that the major river systems are in good health, but they also want to use them productively. This process will ensure sound science, proper consultation and fair transitional arrangements. None of that can be rushed, but you will get there faster if you do it properly. That is what we now have a framework to do. So it is that we signed off on a funded plan to progress water reform, with the Commonwealth contributing 40 per cent of the $500 million towards ensuring that water reform really does take place in the Murray-Darling Basin, which I think is a very important thing for all Australians.Last week I visited the centres of Griffith, Deniliquin, Moama, Shepparton, Mildura, Moree, Dirranbandi and Bourke. I would like to thank variously the member for Riverina, Kay Hull, the member for Farrar, Sussan Ley, the member for Murray, Sharman Stone, the member for Mallee, John Forrest, and the member for Maranoa for their work in pulling all of this together. I can say that we are getting on with this. The task forces will be formed today. The first working party meeting is actually happening today, so we are getting on with it. In conclusion, because there are times when you have to rise above politics I do freely acknowledge the very valuable leadership provided by the New South Wales minister, Craig Knowles, in this regard. I think all Australians welcome this. This makes the proposal, put up by the Leader of the Opposition in his speech in reply to the budget, to fix it overnight, as though by magic, without any consideration for proper science, transitional arrangements, how to deal with the stakeholders or how to look after the productive base of the people who feed and clothe us look pathetic, which is what it is.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Griffith for his question. I have already explained that the Australian authorities were well aware of the links between Abu Dahdah and al-Qaeda on the one hand and citizens of Australia on the other. These were very thoroughly investigated from an intelligence point of view in the year 2000-01. I can mention that there were visits made by intelligence officers from Australia to Spain. The cooperation with the Spanish authorities over that time was very good. It is only in recent times that the decision has been taken by the AFP to move into a criminal investigation. There has been close contact between the AFP and ASIO throughout. The criminal investigation makes it a different proposition. Intelligence gathering is one thing; investigation for criminal purpose is another. It is on that basis that there was direct police-to-police contact in recent times, resulting in the Spanish authorities requesting that there be a formal mutual assistance request, and that has been provided recently. As far as contacts with the particular individual are concerned, it is true that the individual named Bilal Khazal worked for Qantas as a baggage handler. He worked for them from mid-1989 until March 2000. He was known in a security context for part of that period and appropriate steps were taken to address security issues at the time.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Mallee for his question and I acknowledge his longstanding concern for finding effective solutions to the problem of salinity which, as a consulting engineer, he was involved with even before he came into this parliament. It has been a long-time personal interest of and commitment from the member for Mallee. I also congratulate the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister on their great achievement in securing national agreement on the national water initiative and for putting in place the national cooperative effort that will make an effective action against salinity practicable in the years ahead.This great initiative stands in addition to the government's $2.7 billion Natural Heritage Trust and the $1.4 billion national action plan against salinity. These remarkable initiatives together constitute, without question, the greatest environmental rescue effort in Australian history. Reducing the threat of salinity is a very key target of this government. The developments of recent days have come on top of very substantial investments by this government in the Murray-Darling Basin of some $500 million, principally from the trust and the national action plan, since 1996. These developments also come on top of the $150 million package provided under the Living Murray plan to improve the management of the river for environmental outcomes and in addition to around $35 million per annum that will come into the basin from the ongoing investments under the Natural Heritage Trust and the national action plan. The Howard government's unprecedented and ongoing commitment to deal with salinity in the basin, and indeed the cumulative effort to improve the management of salinity in the basin over the decades, have shown a significant positive impact. This can be seen, for example, in the decline of salinity levels at Morgan. The salinity interception schemes in the irrigation districts of the Murray have reduced salinity at the reference point of Morgan in South Australia by some 200 ECs. At present, salinity at Morgan is at low levels because of the impact of factors such as these interception schemes and also because of the impact of the drought on inflows from the Menindee Lakes and Lake Victoria, and the fact that the major inflows have come from the upper catchment, particularly from Dartmouth Dam, which holds some of the freshest water within the basin. The reduction of salinity at Morgan is therefore a great achievement, but it has to be seen in the context that salinity remains a very insidious environmental challenge.The Australian dryland salinity assessment conducted in 2000 estimated that the area of farmlands in the Murray-Darling Basin with a high potential to develop salinity is likely to grow from just over 660,000 hectares in 2000 to 3.4 million hectares by 2050. The science indicates that this is a very serious and ongoing threat. We should not be confused by the fact that the drought and the releases from Dartmouth have currently reduced salinity at Morgan to low levels. The effects of the salinity reduction schemes could be nullified within 20 to 30 years and medium salinity levels in the Murray at Morgan could exceed the safe drinking limit 50 percent of the time within 20 years, according to the salinity audit of the Murray-Darling Basin undertaken by the commission in 1999.These estimates signify that the battle against salinity is achieving results but they also signify that the effort has to be ongoing. This is a commitment which the Howard government has shown that it is prepared to meet and which it has been prepared to meet with practical and unprecedented action since 1996.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Barton for his question. I am advised that two file servers were reported missing from Customs premises in Mascot on 27 August. Customs reported the apparent theft to the Australian Federal Police and to other relevant authorities. The AFP is conducting an investigation into the theft. It is recognised that this was a serious breach of what had been tightened security procedures and that it should not have occurred. A full investigation of the breach is under way and arrangements are being put in place to further tighten security access to Customs premises and facilities nationally. The AFP is receiving full cooperation from Customs. There have been a number of inaccuracies in the media reports but, it being an ongoing investigation, I do not propose to say anything in detail. The servers did not, as one media report alleged, contain thousands of confidential files, nor are they used for top secret communications between Customs and other law enforcement security organisations. The servers did not contain personal, business related or national security information.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Deakin for his question and acknowledge his interest in the whole of the great state of Victoria and what is going on there. Governance is one of the key issues facing Indigenous communities. Indigenous communities are typically dealing with up to 40 separate governmental agencies, and dealing with so many governmental agencies can impose great strains on small communities that are often without a well-developed civic culture. The whole-of-government initiative, which flows from an agreement at COAG last year, is designed to tackle this problem of the fragmentation of service delivery. In areas where the whole-of-government initiative is operating, one federal portfolio is coordinating the delivery of all federal services to Indigenous people in that area and it is working in close partnership with one state portfolio which is similarly coordinating the delivery of all state services to Indigenous people.This whole-of-government initiative is designed to ensure that, as far as humanly possible, government speaks with one voice to the Indigenous people of that area. The initiative is being trialled in areas where the local Indigenous people are prepared, for their part, to put their differences behind them and to try to speak, as far as is humanly possible, with one voice. Last Thursday, the Premier of Victoria and I, along with the Mayor of Shepparton and the chairman of the local ATSIC regional council, with the strong support of the member for Murray, announced the launch of the whole-of-government initiative in the Shepparton area. As part of this initiative my department has committed $800,000 towards the provision of 100 additional jobs for Indigenous people in the Shepparton area. I am pleased to say that 20 local Indigenous people have already been employed under this initiative.Noel Pearson has been saying - rightly and repeatedly - over the last few years that Aboriginal people have a right to take responsibility. Conversely, governments have a duty to take responsibility to end the fragmentation and the buck-passing which have bedevilled this area for too long. I am delighted that this government is constructively, creatively and cooperatively working with Indigenous communities to try to ensure a real difference for the better in the lives of ordinary Indigenous Australians. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dobell for his question and for his very strong support of training and apprenticeships - Central Coast Group Training in particular, and Casey Lovelock, Rotary apprentice of the year for 2003. Under this government the number of apprentices training in Australia has increased from 140,000 in 1995 to 391,000 as at the end of March this year. That represents a 15 per cent increase on last year alone. At the moment, most Australians would have seen the government's strong advertising and marketing campaign promoting New Apprenticeships in traditional trades. I am pleased to report to the House that, since that campaign has been undertaken, we have received record inquiries from young people and their families interested in careers in building and construction, hairdressing and a range of traditional trades.I am asked about alternative policies or statements. I can report that on 24 June this year the New South Wales government delivered its state budget. That budget included an increase in TAFE fees. Fees at TAFE, unlike those at university, have to be paid at the front gate. It does not matter whether you are rich or poor - whatever the TAFE fee is, you have to pay it. There is no loan to support you so that you start paying it back - as you do with university fees - once you have finished and you are earning an income.The New South Wales government increased fees for TAFE by up to 300 per cent, affecting 170,000 young people in the state of New South Wales trying to get training in things like meat processing, IT, telecommunications, plumbing and traditional trades. To put that into perspective: a quarter of the students who attend TAFE come from the poorest families in the country. On behalf of the Howard government, I wrote to the Premier on 8 July, setting out this government's concerns and the significant detrimental impact that this will have on training opportunities for young people in the state of New South Wales. I table that letter.It is interesting that, on 21 August this year, two events occurred on the one day. The first was a protest in Bega. This protest was reported by the ABC, which said: Beth Hart, the Bega TAFE teachers federation representative, along with several others, including students, held a protest in Ayres Walkway asking residents to sign a petition to go to education minister Dr Andrew Refshauge objecting to what they see as massive increases in fees for courses. Ms Hart said a survey of students enrolled in the Certificate IV Welfare course at Bega indicated that more than half could not afford to go on to diploma level due to financial hardship due to increased fee increases.You would have to ask yourself: where would the federal Australian Labor Party be on this? Would the member for Jagajaga or the Leader of the Opposition be attending the protest in Bega? No. On the same day, the member for Jagajaga delivered the Labor Party's education manifesto to the congress of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the ACTU. It has 1,150 words, 23 references to universities, six references to TAFE and two references to training - and the word `apprentice' does not occur once. I challenge the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Jagajaga to table the letter or any public comments that they have made to the New South Wales government opposing the 300 per cent increase in up-front fees to TAFE in the state of New South Wales. I challenge them to come in here this afternoon and table those letters.As far as the Daily Telegraph's `deadwood' is concerned, at least when you put a match under deadwood it lights up. It is not deadwood; it is wet wood. All you do is get a university smokescreen to try to detract from the real issues worrying real Australians - that is, the opportunity for the 70 per cent of kids who do not go directly from school to university and who need opportunities in training, apprenticeships and trades.</DOC>

In view of this as an ongoing criminal investigation being conducted by the Australian Federal Police and the Defence Signals Directorate, I am not proposing to go into a great deal of detail about what was there. I can assure the member for Barton that there was no national security information on them. Arrangements were made after the thefts were discovered to change all the staff passwords as a precautionary measure. The two servers facilitated effective administration of communication across the Customs network. They did not store or retain documents or similar information. As an added precaution, all staff have been asked to report any irregularities in their access arrangements.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Canning, who represents with great enthusiasm numerous builders in his electorate, particularly in the new housing estates. The builders collective are telling me about a looming crisis in the building industry. The master builders are telling me the same thing. Builders just cannot get builders warranty insurance in a number of states across Australia. The member for Canning has asked me: what is the biggest challenge for small business in the building industry? I say it is the state Labor governments. The state Labor governments are the ones who are responsible for introducing the legislation governing builders warranty insurance. The biggest impediment to the building industry in New South Wales is Bob Carr. Take the example of Hugh Webster, a builder in Sydney. In March he applied for insurance to cover his annual turnover of $4 million. The maximum insurance cover he could get was for $2.8 million. He had to put up capital of nearly $600,000 or a bank guarantee of over $1 million. He has been waiting months to get this deal. In the interim, he has had to lay off staff and reduce hours because he cannot get insurance - because under Bob Carr's builders warranty insurance legislation, there is just one insurer in the whole world that is offering builders warranty insurance in New South Wales. Even then, the insurer is not prepared to cover many builders, particularly in Western Sydney.Whose fault is it? It is Bob Carr's fault, because Bob Carr is responsible for the legislation governing builders warranty insurance. Bob Carr is responsible for the building laws. Bob Carr is also responsible for the highest taxing state government in Australia. Bob Carr is responsible for the highest stamp duty on insurance in the world. At the same time, Bob Carr is responsible for the highest stamp duty on transfer of property in Australia. That is why he would not be out of place on the Labor Party front bench - because Bob Carr believes in higher taxes. Bob Carr believes in more regulation. Therefore he would be well placed to sit alongside all his colleagues on the front bench of the Labor Party in Canberra.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Forrest for his question. He is obviously an employer in his own right and has been for many years. It is very good news that the Job Network in the first two months of operation has placed more than 50,000 Australians into work - 50,000 Australians over the network - and people from all works of life have come into the Job Network and been assisted. It was interesting to hear laughter and a bit of derision from the opposition as I came to the dispatch box because I often wonder who in the opposition has not actually opened one of the new Job Network offices. We know the member for Werriwa has, we know the member for Grayndler has, we know the member for Newcastle has and then, of course, the member for Lilley was with me on Friday when we opened a Job Network office. The stories that you hear from unemployed Australians are heart-warming. When we were in Nundah last week, it was interesting to hear that, in the member for Lilley's electorate, unemployment in the last 12 months has come down 20 per cent. Isn't that fantastic? I must say, it raised the eyebrows of the member for Lilley. There was an unemployed fellow there who was attending Job Search training. The local Job Network tells me that, of the 20-odd participants who had started just two weeks ago, 12 of those long-term unemployed have got work. This fellow said, `I just want to pass something on to you.' This unemployed gentleman - he is mature aged - said, `I put in 100 resumes over the last six months and I only had three interviews. I was a bit disappointed with that so I came in here. I've been trained, I've put in four resumes, I've had four interviews and I expect to start work next week.' That is the Job Network working. Every day of the week, we have nearly 60,000 Australians receiving automatching of jobs that they can get into. We are having people now being able to access more than 60,000 vacancies. They are real jobs for real people and the Howard-Anderson government stands well and truly behind the Job Network.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Rankin for his question. My recollection is that I did meet with Ted Briggs, along with Terry Sharples, in the offices of Minter Ellison solicitors in Brisbane on or about 7 July 1998. My recollection - and I have to say it is somewhat hazy five years later - is that at that meeting Ted Briggs did volunteer to produce various lists. No-one should be particularly surprised that he would volunteer this because he was the treasurer, after all, of the One Nation organisation. He would have access to these things. My further recollection, which is even hazier, is that I subsequently met with Ted Briggs in my office in Manly on 7 September. It may well be that at that meeting he gave me material, although I cannot distinctly recall receiving material from him.I would just make the point that there were many One Nation dissidents at that time, many of them handing around various bits of information. I was very happy to receive that information because I thought then, as I think now, that the One Nation Party was invalidly registered. My view has been confirmed by judgments of the Supreme Court of Queensland.I would like to make this comment about the opposition's pursuit of this matter. I would refer the opposition to a very distinguished former Labor member of this parliament - former senator Graham Richardson - who, on the Today program last Friday, said:Tony Abbott was very open about it when he did it and no-one cared. No-one cared five years ago when this was in the paper. No-one in the gallery followed it up and no-one in the Labor Party followed it up. Everyone read it, but when you read that and you say to yourself, `I don't care because it is a good thing,' then how can you then five years on suddenly turn around and say, `Isn't this shocking?'  - Let me simply conclude by returning to what ex Senator Richardson said last Friday. He said:The amount of hypocrisy being shown in the press gallery and in some sections of the Labor Party on this is breathtaking. I have not seen a greater load of it in a long, long time.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Eden-Monaro for his question and indicate to the House that the most important health care outcome of the meeting of the Council of Australian Governments last August was the states and territories signing the record $42 billion Australian health care agreement. It is a major achievement for the states and territories to sign up to this Commonwealth offer, and one which will bring enormous benefits so far as the health of Australians is concerned, because in signing this agreement the states and territories will get $10 billion additional funding over and above the last agreement, which equates to 17 per cent real growth in funding to run their public hospitals.Importantly, this agreement has two major aspects. Firstly, it recommits the states to the Medicare principles, including that of free and universal access to the public hospitals run by the states and territories. Secondly, it requires the states and territories to match the Commonwealth's increased growth funding, something which they did not do under the previous health care agreement. One of the important features of the agreement is the $253 million Pathways Home program, which will help patients leaving hospital to return home with adequate community and medical support.In the end it was no surprise that the states signed - after posturing about this issue for a number of weeks - because this was for the benefit of the people of all the states and territories. When the shadow health spokesperson was asked on the Sunday Sunrise program whether or not the federal Labor Party would commit to what the states were asking for - an additional billion dollars - the member for Lalor said, `No, I'm not committing to an extra billion dollars ... surprise, surprise.' It was no surprise, because the states were simply posturing, and what the health care agreement will deliver is better health and welfare outcomes for all Australians. </DOC>

 - I would have to check the record on that, particularly in relation to whether it has been drawn to the attention of people on my staff. While I am on my feet, I will take the opportunity of commenting upon a matter I left unresolved yesterday - that is, the question of an inquiry into the so-called Macdonald part of this issue. After answering that question, I ascertained that the ONA off its own bat had asked the AFP to investigate an article written by a Melbourne journalist on broadly the same subject matter. I have been informed this morning that the ONA has asked the AFP to add the latest issue to that inquiry, and that is as it should be.I will make two other comments. Firstly, I observe that there is a remarkable similarity, to say the least, between the material that was the subject matter of Senator Macdonald's question and the material in the interview with Mr Wilkie in the Bulletin on 18 March. The other information I can provide to the House is that, in its request to the AFP, the Office of National Assessments has stated that the Bolt article - that is, the Melbourne Herald Sun article - does not contain any specific comment on any intelligence material.</DOC>

 - Firstly, I thank the honourable member for Ryan and say what a sterling job he does not just in representing his constituents but in making sure that he is on top of international relations issues. He asks serious questions about serious issues. -  - That seems to have got the Labor Party stirred up. At one stage I thought they might be asleep! Australia is one of 11 countries - which, by the way, includes not just the United States but also Great Britain, France, Germany and Japan - that took part in the latest meeting of what is called the proliferation security initiative. This was between 3 and 4 September in Paris. The meeting did agree on some significant steps to strengthen cooperation against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and I do believe that this is an extremely important initiative.This country has regarded the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction as one of the great challenges of the international community. We for our part very much welcome the more decisive role that the international community is taking to address this problem. The key outcome was agreement on an intensive series of interdiction training exercises in the coming months to test the capabilities and procedures of the various countries involved. I am very pleased to say that Australia will lead the first exercise, which will be called Pacific Protector, in the Coral Sea from 12 to 14 September. The exercise will involve military and law enforcement assets of Australia, the United States, France and Japan, and other proliferation security initiative countries will be sending observers. It will simulate interdiction of a cargo vessel suspected of carrying weapons of mass destruction and will include aerial search and surveillance, maritime pursuit and boarding of the vessel.The Paris meeting that I refer to also issued a statement of interdiction principles identifying concrete means of impeding trade in weapons of mass destruction and their delivery systems. I want to make a point just to ensure that nobody is confused about this - that is, the proliferation security initiative will be pursued in the context of current international law; it will not be pursued on an extra legal basis.There obviously is a great deal of emphasis being given to make sure other countries are properly informed about what the PSI is about. When the Indian foreign minister was here last week, I took the opportunity of briefing him on the proliferation security initiative, and his response was positive. An Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade senior official, Paul O'Sullivan, a deputy secretary of my department, was in Beijing yesterday briefing Chinese officials about the PSI exercises and interdictions, and I think the Chinese very much appreciate this contact as well.In conclusion, for many years on this side of the House - probably on both sides of the House - we have passionately believed in Australia taking action to counter the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Some steps have been effective; some have not. Adding the proliferation security initiative to our armoury is going to be a very important development, and I congratulate all those Australians who have shown such leadership on this issue.</DOC>

 - As the Leader of the Opposition knows only too well, Senator Macdonald issued a statement on this matter yesterday. In his statement he correctly made it clear he was not provided with any classified material from the Prime Minister or from ministers or their offices. I personally have had no contact with Senator Macdonald and, having raised this question with my staff, I can confirm that they did not provide Senator Macdonald with any classified material or information. Let me make this point about the beat-up by the opposition on this issue. I choose my words carefully because this is a massive beat-up. When I looked at the Bulletin of 18 March - and this is absolutely germane to this issue - I noticed that Mr Wilkie, whose information of course came from the period he spent working in the Office of National Assessments, had made the following comments:There is no doubt they - Being the Iraqis - have chemical and biological weapons.Mr Wilkie said that Saddam could create a humanitarian disaster and he could do it with weapons of mass destruction. He said that the Iraqis could overwhelm the coalition forces with hundreds of thousands of refugees. Apparently the Labor Party thinks it is all right if Mr Wilkie briefs the Bulletin, and we raise no objection to that, but, when the same or almost identical points are used by Senator Macdonald, this is some sort of extraordinary scandal. Anybody can tell that Mr Wilkie's understanding of these issues came from his time working in the Office of National Assessments. It is obvious. What Mr Wilkie said to the Bulletin on 18 March was certainly not damaging to our national interests. - The Leader of the Opposition now asks what was in the ONA report. I thought this was meant to be a deathly secret and nobody was to know what was in the ONA report. Actually, Mr Wilkie made it pretty clear in his 18 March interview what he thought about the humanitarian risks of war against Iraq. Mr Wilkie came out on 18 March, which, by the way, was one day before the start of the war against Iraq. Senator Macdonald asked two or three or four - or whatever it was - questions which do not add any new information, as far as I have been able to ascertain, and Senator Macdonald was not provided with a copy of the report.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Wentworth for his question. I can inform the House that the NAB released its monthly business survey for August, which reinforces a picture of a domestic economy which is remaining very resilient in very difficult international conditions. The NAB said:Whichever way you look at the National's Business Survey results for August, the core findings are of underlying domestic strength and, in recent months, an accelerating growth momentum.All of the components of the business condition index rose. Employment is up seven points, trading conditions are up two and profitability is up three. The NAB said in its report that the current level of the business conditions index is consistent with non-farm growth of five per cent or more. Business confidence, like consumer confidence, is very strong in Australia at the moment, notwithstanding the fact that in the June quarter, as I informed the House yesterday, trading conditions were very difficult. We have not fully recovered from the worst drought in our history with farm incomes down 71 per cent in the year to June.In the June quarter we were affected by the SARS epidemic, which dropped arrivals in Australia by nearly 17 per cent. If I could interpose there, we certainly hope that authorities remain vigilant in relation to SARS because there has been a little disturbing news even today. In addition to that, we have a weak world economy with the United States possibly recovering but with four of the G7 countries recording negative quarters and two of them being in recession. In East Asia in the June quarter, in places like Hong Kong and Singapore, economic growth contracted by 3.7 per cent and three per cent. That is enormous contraction.Notwithstanding that, business conditions in Australia as reported by the NAB show underlying strength. Why? They are supported by low interest rates. They are supported by confident consumers. We reduced corporate tax to 30 per cent. We introduced a new tax system which has taken taxes off Australia's exports. We cut capital gains tax for small business to give small business owners the opportunity to keep a bit more of the nest egg that they have built up in their businesses. These are difficult trading conditions. I said earlier that I think the trading conditions in the September quarter will be quite difficult as well. But we welcome the fact that, as the NAB survey shows, Australian businesses remain confident, as do our consumers, in the face of a very difficult and threatening international environment.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Barton for his question. He well knows that there is an ongoing investigation. It is being conducted, as I said yesterday, by the Australian Federal Police assisted by the Defence Signals Directorate. I can inform him that the Defence Signals Directorate is acting in an information security role under the Intelligence Services Act. As part of its role, DSD is assisting the Australian Customs Service and the AFP in that investigation.It does not assist sensitive investigations to be parading information in public when the AFP are seeking to capture those who were responsible and, on that basis, I do not propose to be confirming details of assertions made by the member for Barton or anybody else for that matter. I informed the House yesterday of the nature of the information, the nature of the purpose of the servers, and I have nothing to add to that.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Gilmore for her question. I take this opportunity to advise the House that Australia's current immigration arrangements are delivering significant economic, social and budgetary benefits to Australia. I was very interested in what Chris Richardson of Access Economics had to say back in August. He said that skilled migrants are the closest thing to a free lunch that any economy will ever get. I thought that was a very perceptive comment. It is a matter of which I think it is important that Australians are frequently reminded.Given our below replacement fertility rate and the increasing importance of skilled people to Australia's international competitiveness, it is essential that our immigration arrangements are maintained. The government has taken a number of initiatives to encourage skilled migrants and business migrants to settle in regional Australia and to give state and territory governments an ability to influence the decisions that are taken in relation to those settlement patterns. We have achieved some quite important results. In the year 200203, 7,940 visas were granted under these initiatives, and that was a 92 per cent increase on the year 200102. Victoria took some 52.2 per cent of those visa grants and South Australia 16.2 per cent. New South Wales by contrast had only 7.8 per cent of the visas granted to assist people to settle regionally.This outcome of course means that the approaches we have taken are working. There are a range of initiatives that are available to the states, and it is up to those governments to apply the resources to get a better and dispersed outcome. I was recently approached by the Premier of Victoria, Mr Bracks, to discuss ways in which Victoria can attract more migrants and get a better dispersal. I have had an indication that the Premier of Queensland wants to have some discussions with me as well, and I look forward to those consultations. But what of New South Wales? Mr Carr decided that he does not want migrants. In fact we have demonstrated a willingness to work -  - Let me just say that he does want to talk to me. We have demonstrated a willingness to work with New South Wales to help get a better dispersal, but he knows of course to discourage people from settling in Sydney would require some fairly tough decisions on his part which he would have to buy on to - he certainly knows that. - If you wanted to put restrictions on aspects of family reunion if people wanted to settle in Sydney rather than elsewhere or if you wanted to deny regional corporations that want to establish their offices in Sydney the opportunity to do so -  - of course you could come along with some proposals that would deal with that. But the only point I make is that, when it comes to making tough decisions of that sort, Mr Carr does not want to buy on to them; he just wants to stop the migration program generally benefiting other parts of Australia. But I dare say he is in a far better position than Labor federally, because I noticed at the weekend that the shadow minister, in commenting about these matters, said, `It's not something we have a fixed view on at this stage.' `We might have a discussion paper shortly,' she went on to say. It appears to me that they have not woken up from the seven years that we have been in government dealing with these issues and the failure when they were in office to be able to direct any attention to getting a better dispersal of the migration program. - In fact, I might say that Labor could not even present an immigration policy in the lead-up to the last election. So, while Labor has been talking about these issues, we have been getting runs on the board.</DOC>

 - Let us deal with the first proposition. In July there were 8,431 first home buyers, and the longterm average since the series began is 8,900. So it is well within the longterm average. - I thank the member for Lalor for her interjection. I read a profile on her on the weekend; it included comments from the member for Werriwa. He said, `Don't listen to the critics; Julia is smart, articulate, feisty and, unlike me, cool under pressure.' Not so cool under pressure is the member for Werriwa if a taxicab driver should ask him for a fare. - The member for Lalor interjected. The longterm average is 8,900. One of the reasons in relation to the proportion is that there are two variables, which are the number of financing and refinancing and first home buyers as a proportion. One of the reasons is that a lot of people are refinancing their houses. There are a lot of reasons for that, one of which is that interest rates are so low. But let us just deal with that canard at the beginning. The July figure was 8,431 and the longterm average is 8,900.I am then asked this question: what is the government going to do to help people with housing? I will tell you one thing that this government will not be doing: it will not be introducing 17 per cent mortgage interest rates, which is what the Labor Party did in 1988 and 1989. I remember it well because I was a first home buyer in 1988 and 1989, when we were paying 17 per cent. One of the things that this government has done in giving home buyers an opportunity has been to give them an interest rate which gives them the capacity to pay a mortgage after they have earned their income. And there is another thing: there are now one million more Australians in work than were in work under the Labor Party. That is one million Australians who have an income to be able to service a mortgage - young families that have an opportunity.There is one other thing that we have raised, and that is that the states could actually help with some of the windfall in relation to stamp duty. Do you know, Mr Speaker, I have not heard one Labor federal member utter one word of criticism about state Labor governments and their stamp duty policies - not one word. I have been wondering about this; I have been wondering why there is no criticism of state stamp duties. Where do you think the stamp duties are running the highest? New South Wales. Why would there be no word of criticism of the New South Wales government coming out of the federal opposition? It had been intriguing until the puzzle was fixed on the weekend. They cannot criticise state Labor governments for their stamp duty policies because they are hoping that they will come down to Canberra and lead them out of the wilderness. That is why they are not criticising them. On this side of the parliament we welcome the fact that all state Liberal oppositions have committed themselves to reducing stamp duties if the public should elect them. That would be a positive thing to help first home buyers, and we look forward to the day when they can deliver on their promises.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I did have the privilege of visiting Beijing for a couple of days at the end of last week. Travelling with me was a group of Australian agribusiness leaders, including a citrus producer from the honourable member's electorate. There is a lot of interest amongst Australian farmers in supplying the growing Chinese market - a market of about 1.3 billion people. China is already our third most important trading partner and our fastest growing one. There is obviously enormous potential for Australian food and fibre to flow to that market: about one-fifth of our trade is already made up of agricultural products. I think there is great potential for us to be a significant supplier to the growing needs of Chinese consumers.It is particularly important in developing these markets that we have available to us smooth and reliable arrangements to enable the free flow of products between our countries. From time to time there are market access issues raised and unexpected impediments to the trade which undermine public confidence in the capacity of this market to grow. In my meetings with my Chinese counterparts, in particular the minister for quarantine, we were able to discuss a range of these issues and, I believe, satisfactorily resolve many of the points of concern. We have agreed that we will work towards the signing of a protocol to establish a regime under which these kinds of issues can be resolved in the future.The Chinese president, President Hu, will be visiting Australia next month. It will be our objective to have the protocol ready for signature during that visit. It will establish a quarantine working group to help deal with various issues when they arise. In addition we expect during that visit to sign a protocol to help smooth Australian grain exports to China, particularly wheat and barley, because Australian barley is a major feed source for the growing Chinese beer industry. We have also agreed to work on technical aspects of the live animal trade and in particular to look at the regionalisation issue for blue tongue, which has restricted a number of exports of Australian livestock, particularly dairy cattle, to China.We have also agreed that Chinese experts and authorities should visit Australia prompt-ly to undertake the necessary inspections of meat establishments to bring into practice the protocol that was signed just recently for exports of beef, sheep and goat meat from Australia to China. This is potentially a huge new market for the Australian meat industry, and over 140 Australian establishments have expressed their interest in being involved in this trade. They will also be inspecting the cattle embryo situation in Australia to enable embryo trade to commence between our two countries.Whilst in China I also took the opportunity to provide to my Chinese counterparts the technical information to enable the commencement of assessments for exports of Australian table grapes and cherries to China. We are already working on access for citrus, lychees, bananas and mangoes and on improved access for Tasmanian apples. So there is a lot of work already being done in this field. I believe that there is now a renewed spirit of cooperation and a determination to smooth through many of these access issues that have been of concern and have hindered the trade. The visit by our Prime Minister to China was an important impetus in that regard. President Hu's visit to Australia will further strengthen and cement the very strong relationship that is developing between Australia and China and the enormous trading opportunities which that relationship offers.</DOC>

 - Firstly, we do not think it is a shameful thing to have been a real estate agent before coming into parliament. This may come as a surprise to the Labor Party, but on this side of the parliament numbers of people worked in the private sector before coming into the parliament. I know that is a very unusual thing for the Labor Party, but on this side lots of people have earned their spurs in the private sector and held down jobs in competitive situations. Secondly, we totally reject the suggestion that the member for Werriwa is always putting around that somehow Senator Ian Campbell is doing something improper in relation to real estate because he used to be a real estate agent. We only wish that the member for Werriwa applied the same high standards to people he associates with that he likes to apply to others.Thirdly, do I back Governor Ian Macfarlane? Well, I appointed Governor Ian Macfarlane the first time. I reappointed him. I think Governor Ian Macfarlane has done an outstanding job as Governor of the Reserve Bank. Thanks to the two people who have been most involved with economic policy over the last 7½ years there are a lot of improvements that have taken place in the Australian economy. You do not have to take my word for that. I think that is broadly recognised around the world. Could we have done more? Yes. We would have liked to have deregulated labour markets. We would have liked to have based the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme on a sustainable basis. We would like to reform the welfare system. But you can only go as far -  - We would like to privatise Telstra - absolutely. That has been there. The only thing that has stopped economic reform in this country is the Australian Senate. So if the Labor Party wants to turn over a new leaf and now say that it wants to be economically responsible, let me say what the test is: Labor will be economically responsible the day it starts voting for this government's program in the Senate. Until it does that, Labor's economic irresponsibility is clear for all to see.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kalgoorlie for his question. Let me say from the outset that, unlike the opposition, this government stands unambiguously behind investment, exports and jobs in the resources sector in Australia. That comes from sound economic management which has created a climate where companies really do want to invest here. According to ABARE, we have some 166 major minerals and energy development projects under way in Australia right now. The member for Kalgoorlie - in fact, all Australians - celebrated the announcement yesterday that the Gorgon gas field has received in-principle support from the Western Australian government. This $11 billion project could be one of the biggest industrial projects in Australia to go ahead, employing some 3,000 people in the construction of it - that is, 400 permanent places and 6,000 indirect jobs. Obviously, the job now is to go overseas and market and sell these reserves, and turn this money into the $2.5 billion a year that it has the potential to earn this country. There are some people sitting up in the gallery from the tourism industry - some 120 industry leaders - who should swap notes with the Gorgon proponents, as they are well experienced in selling Australia and its products overseas.I was asked if there are alternative policies. Prime Minister, you are going to be amazed to know that in this case there is an alternative policy on Gorgon, and let me read it to you. The shadow minister for resources, the member for Hunter, has said that exporting gas from Barrow Island is not in Australia's best interest. - At least they have a policy. Those comments by the member for Hunter were described by APEA as wrong-headed and economically dangerous. I could not agree more, Mr Speaker. The Labor Party has shown its contempt for the resources sector on more than one occasion, and recently announced a half billion dollar tax slug for the resources sector were it to be elected to office. The appointment of Senator Carr as the shadow minister for industry has caused a great deal of concern amongst -  -  - Mr Speaker, it is pretty hard when those behind you steal your punchline. It is worth noting the reaction of the business community to the appointment of Senator Carr. One of them was quoted in the Age as saying:The guy's got a reputation for trying to create Albania in Victoria ...As the good gentlemen behind me have said, as the minister for the automotive industry I am waiting to see if Labor in Canberra does become a `two-Carr' family. - Yes.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kennedy. In relation to that last bit, if I claimed it, it must be right, so I agree with myself in relation to that! The member for Kennedy will appreciate that. He does not always agree with himself, but I usually agree with myself - and when you disagree with yourself you are invariably right, member for Kennedy. Can I go on to say that my recollection is - and I am going from recollection - that after dairy deregulation the price of milk to consumers fell. That is certainly my recollection. - And that was not withstanding, you will recall, that the government put in place a levy to cushion against the price fall, and the proceeds of the levy were applied to farmers who wanted restructuring compensation to get out of the industry. So I am not sure I would agree with you on that one.In relation to pharmacies, my recollection is we had an inquiry look at that, I believe, by Warwick Wilkinson and he made a number of recommendations in relation to that which, from recollection, the government accepted. We believe that will put pharmacies on a sustainable basis. If after checking that report I have any further information, I will get back to the member for Kennedy.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Paterson for his question and for the tremendous visit we had to the Tuncurry campus of TAFE - the future in co-locating a senior secondary college with a TAFE. There are today some 391,000 apprentices and trainees in Australia - 15 per cent growth on last year. Those apprentices and trainees now account for one-third of teenage full-time employment in Australia and more than half of them are under the age of 25, providing futures for young people and confidence for their families and parents. I am asked about alternative policies, and there are a number of things happening in Australia at the moment which are actually reducing the training and apprenticeship opportunities for young people. In the state of New South Wales, the New South Wales government, in its state budget on 24 June this year, increased TAFE fees for 170,000 young New South Wales men and women by up to 300 per cent - a 300 per cent increase in up-front TAFE fees and what have we heard from the Australian Labor Party here in Canberra? Not a word. In the state of Victoria, the Victorian government has introduced full fee paying degrees in TAFE -  - We have just had the introduction of full fee paying degrees in TAFE of between $8,000 and $14,000 -  - Up to $14,000 for full fee paying degrees, and what have we heard from the Australian Labor Party in relation to that? Absolutely nothing but support. In the state of South Australia, fees for apprentices have been increased by 50 per cent by the South Australian government. It may not mean much for the Labor Party here in Canberra, but I can tell you that when the cousins in South Australia increase fees for apprentices - second-year plumbers - from $280 to $420 that has a heck of an impact on working families. What do we hear from the Labor Party here? Not a word. I can give the House a bit of an insight into the way the Labor Party are thinking on some of these issues and introduce them to a caller to Steve Price on 2UE on 24 July this year, a caller named Andrew. The member for Jagajaga was in the studio on this particular day when Andrew called in to 2UE and said:Look, I've just got a concern. I'm currently enrolled at a TAFE in western Sydney. Our fees at the moment are $710 a year. Now I'm doing an advanced diploma. We've been told yesterday those fees are going to go up to $1,200 next year and, you know, I'm pretty concerned.  - Anyway, Andrew was having the same experience that I am now having in trying to talk about apprenticeships and training. Andrew said:We've been told yesterday that the fees are going to go up to $1,200 next year and I'm pretty concerned. You know, that's an 83 per cent increase in one year. How can we afford that?Then the member for Jagajaga, the Deputy Leader of the Australian Labor Party, said:I agree with you. We do have to make sure that TAFE is affordable, just like we do with universities. I mean, the University of Sydney has just decided to put their fees up. So I agree with you. We have to make sure that TAFE is affordable. But I think you'd have to say that university students are paying a very, very substantial debt.So Andrew rings in about TAFE fees increasing, in his case by 83 per cent and by up to 300 per cent across the state, and all the member for Jagajaga wants to talk about is universities. But with all of the persistence of a Bankstown brickie, Andrew soldiers on. He says -  - So with all the persistence of a Bankstown brickie, Andrew persisted. He wanted to get back to talking about TAFE. He said:They've got HECS, you know. They can sort of tap into HECS. I understand that's a fair bit they've got to repay, but $1,200 to me is an up-front cost. Like, I've - Then the member for Jagajaga cut him off. She would not even let him finish the sentence. She said:I agree with you, Andrew. That's really important we don't get those fees at TAFE, making people avoid going to TAFE. I couldn't agree with you more. We have to make sure it's affordable. But equally, we've got to make sure that the fees at university, if they go up to those sorts of figures - And on she went about universities. Yesterday I pointed out to the House that the member for Jagajaga, the Deputy Leader of the Australian Labor Party, in her address presenting the Labor Party manifesto on education and training to the Australian Council of Trade Unions congress, mentioned universities 23 times, TAFE on six occasions and training twice. The one word that does not appear in the Labor lexicon is `apprentice'. But we have found a break-out. Very late last night, sneaking into this chamber, one of the Labor members said:For too long apprentices have been ignored. - The member Batman is trying to give a message to the member for Jagajaga that apprentices really count. - </DOC>

 - My recollection is that the answer I gave was that I did not assert that; I asserted that that was the judgment of the Office of National Assessments. - The Leader of the Opposition -  - The Leader of the Opposition has asserted that I claimed something. I have not checked the transcript of my answer and I will stand corrected by the transcript if I should be, but I am saying in answer to the Leader of the Opposition that my recollection of what I said was that I had been informed by the Office of National Assessments that in its communication with the Australian Federal Police, it - that is, the Office of National Assessments, not me - had made the judgment that the report quoted by Bolt did not specifically quote any intelligence material.They are the precise words of the communication as conveyed to me by the Office of National Assessments. It is the judgment of the Office of National Assessments that the Bolt article did not specifically quote. Bear in mind that we are talking purportedly about an ONA report. I would have thought that the judgment of the ONA on the quality and character of that report is a judgment we should all take more notice of than any other judgment. As I said, I will stand corrected by looking at the transcript, but my recollection of what I said at the beginning of question time is that the ONA told the AFP that Bolt did not specifically quote any intelligence material.That particular judgment goes to the very heart of this issue. We are talking here about a claim that sensitive intelligence material may have been leaked, yet the judgment made by the ONA as communicated to me was that the report did not specifically quote any intelligence material. That is not my judgment; it is the judgment of the ONA. Frankly, I think the judgment of the ONA on this matter is more relevant than the judgment of anybody else. - The Leader of the Opposition asks about the Wilkie letter to me. Yes, he did write to me. I referred his letter to the Director-General of the ONA. I will check the record - I do not claim to have a chronologically perfect memory; none of us do - but my understanding is that the Director-General of the ONA had already initiated action with the Australian Federal Police before I received the letter from Mr Wilkie. - I will check that too. I will say one other thing about this. Mr Wilkie has been extremely critical of this government, as is his democratic right. At no stage have I or anybody else, to my recollection, made any allegations of impropriety against Mr Wilkie. I do not now make any allegations of impropriety. I disagree with his assessments. I reject completely his claims that we lied about Iraq intelligence assessments and I stand by all of the statements that I have made about the intelligence assessments that I received prior to the commencement of the war against Iraq. Mr Wilkie has a right to criticise the government and to resign from ONA. If he calls any member of this government a liar, any member of the government has a right to retaliate. Like anybody else in a democracy, we have a right to repudiate his assessments. - The other document is the letter from Mr Wilkie to the Prime Minister.Leave granted.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kooyong for his question. I appreciate his concerns about the state of the Melbourne construction industry. Like me, he is very concerned about the fact that 20 per cent of the total of days lost through strikes in Australia last year occurred in the Melbourne construction industry alone.The government established the interim building industry task force as a result of the Cole royal commission's first report. This task force had the aim of securing zero tolerance of law breaking in the construction industry. So far nearly 900 reports of possible law breaking have been prepared by the task force. Fourteen matters have been referred to other agencies for possible prosecution. The task force has six prosecutions currently before the courts, four involving unions and, I am advised, two involving employers. Currently there are 50 investigations actively under way and 10 briefs of evidence are in preparation, with court action imminent. As a result of the task force's work, the Chief Executive Officer of the Master Builders Association has said:Even with limited powers, the task force is already making a difference, causing those who operate on a basis of intimidation and standover tactics to realise that this sort of behaviour won't go unpunished.That is very good work by the interim building industry task force. But it is not the only watchdog active in the industry. Last week the Office of the Employment Advocate concluded a prosecution in Queensland against the Builders Labourers Federation for breaches of freedom of association laws at the Museum of Tropical Queensland. As a result of that prosecution, a fine of $5,000 was imposed on the union and a fine of $750 was imposed on the union organiser. This government is committed to upholding the rule of law in the construction industry. We are determined to ensure that honest workers and honest businesses enjoy the clean industry they deserve.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Werriwa for his question. The member for Werriwa raises an issue which has been well and truly traversed in various forums over the last few weeks, as indeed it was traversed in various forums five years ago and at various points in between. I think there is a fundamental difference between organising pro bono lawyers and organising for someone to not be further out of pocket in the contingency that a costs order is made. There is a world of difference between that and offering them money up front. I was perfectly entitled to give the ABC question the answer that I did, and I stand by the answer that I gave the ABC all those years ago.Members opposite are very eager to rework all of this material. They are the same people who five years ago were screaming - were hysterical - for someone to take some action against the Hanson juggernaut that was then rolling around Australia. I did take action. It was necessary, it was right, it was important and I did it. But not all decent supporters of the Labor Party are as hypocritical on this as the members opposite; not all are as eager to revive Pauline Hanson as some members of the opposition frontbench now are. Let me quote from someone who has been a great servant of the Labor Party and a fine Australian over many years. Bob Hogg, the former national secretary of the Labor Party, said:Tony Abbott believed the party was not validly registered under Queensland law and helped initiate civil proceedings. He was correct in his view and would have been morally irresponsible had he not acted. For that he should be applauded.</DOC>

 - I would like to thank the member for Dobell for his question, and I note that he is one of many small business people - only on the coalition side - who have come into the parliament. So many people on this side of the House have done the hard yards in small business and are now great representatives, like the member for Dobell. The member for Dobell asked me about the threats to Australia's 1.1 million small businesses. One of the most significant threats is the state governments. As the member for Dobell - who represents a seat in New South Wales - knows, the high taxes from the Carr Labor government are having a real impact on small business. There is high stamp duty, high land tax and high payroll tax - all are at record levels of collection. But they are not only from the existing sources. Yesterday I had not even sat down when news came out that Bob Carr wants to introduce a new CBD employee tax - a new tax in New South Wales. Bob Carr wants to introduce a tax that is going to pay for his new transport plan. He says that every small business in the CBD in New South Wales with more than 10 employees will have to pay this tax. Can you believe that? It is a new tax on employees. How is that going to affect a business like Integrated Asset Management, which is a small George Street business with 10 employees who all travel from the outer suburbs - probably from the member for Dobell's electorate - on public transport each day to work in Sydney? They already pay a fare and now their business is going to be asked to pay an extra tax to pay for Bob Carr's already outrageous expenditure.After all this, it is somewhat ironic that September is Small Business Month in New South Wales. If September is Small Business Month, and Bob Carr is trying to help the small businesses in New South Wales, God help them if he ever disagrees with small business. Bob Carr has shown his record as one of the great tax collectors in Australia. He is doing something that no other state government can do: he is collecting more tax. The good news for the member for Hotham is that, the more we look at Bob Carr, the more the member for Hotham starts to look good.</DOC>

 - I think I fully answered that question yesterday. The point I thought I had well and truly made to the member for Rankin yesterday was that I had only the haziest recollection of that meeting five years ago, although I did check my diary and it said that I had met with this gentleman on 7 September. The point I made was that he may well have given me some material, because my office files certainly do contain some lists that appear to be One Nation lists from that period. The fact is that Mr Briggs was the former treasurer of One Nation and, as the former treasurer of One Nation, he could be expected to have had access to those lists. Let me make the point that it was right and necessary that something be done to stop the Hanson juggernaut back in 1998. I did something. In this respect, I stand by my actions now and since.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question and for her ongoing interest in the young unemployed and the youth in her area. She has made a personal commitment to them and to making sure that they have a fulfilling life in employment. The job seeker account is one of the innovations that this government brought in with the ESC3 which is already proving to be a big winner in allowing a flexible delivery of services at the local level and in helping unemployed people into work. In fact, in the first two months there has been over $2 million expended on the unemployed in this area, which is $2 million out of a pool of almost $200 million which is available each year. I bring two examples to the House of the innovative use of this fund and how it can make a practical difference in unemployed people's lives. The first example is of a 58-year-old mature age worker in Queensland - and we all know the barriers that mature age workers do face, unfortunately, in the work force. This gentleman was an experienced fitter, welder and marine engineer and unfortunately he had been unemployed for five years. But with the use of the job seeker account, brought in by this government on 1 July, and his local Job Network organisation NETO in Cairns George found full-time employment as a boilermaker because they purchased for him the mandatory working clothes that he needed. This did not take any particular bureaucratic effort. It was able to be done locally by a local employment consultant using the job seeker account.The other example was out in the western part of New South Wales, in Broken Hill, through Sureway employment. The very first person - a chap called Robert - who came in to do his Job Search plan was actually purchased an explosive tool licence so that he could operate such tools in the workplace. The Sureway organisation went out and canvassed a job for him as a carpenter's assistant, but what he actually needed was not only that; he needed safety boots and a power tool. They produced these bits of equipment so he could go out and do the job.Here we have the opposition continually deriding the efforts of the Job Network and of unemployed people who are getting themselves back into work. I can inform everyone in this House that today, like every other day, more than 1,000 Australians will actually find work through the Job Network - that is, 1,000 Australians will find independence again and no longer require welfare. There are those on the other side that do not appreciate what the Job Network is doing, and maybe that is because they do not understand. The shadow minister - who has already been shown up by the minister for education today as being wanting in many areas - put out a press release saying that the Job Network is not working, yet we have the member for Fowler, the member for Rankin, the member for Grayndler, the member for Werriwa, the member for Prospect and the member for Bass all out there having their photos taken and putting stories in the paper as they open Job Network offices.Whilst the senior minister says it is not working, the junior minister went on radio in South Australia and, when asked the very pertinent question, `So are you going to get rid of the Job Network?' this is what the member for Grayndler had to say:No, certainly not ... We don't argue at all we're going to move backwards.No, you are not going to move backwards. You have got a confused idea of employment services. It is like every other policy: whether it be the health care rebate - which the then shadow health minister was totally opposed to - whether it be roll-back or whether it be Job Network, it is a confused story. Get your act together, send a complete story to the Australian public and support the Job Network. </DOC>

 - To put the member for Rankin's mind at ease, let me simply assure him that I never, ever knowingly received any stolen material from anyone. - I am not responsible for what people give me. If someone comes into my office and they say, `By the way, here is some stolen material,' or `Here is some illegally obtained material,' of course I am not going to accept it. Let me make it very, very clear: it was right and proper to challenge the validity of the registration of the One Nation party in Queensland. - I did what had to be done. I stand by what I did then. I stand by everything I have done in this matter since.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Robertson for his question and for his interest in the care for the elderly in his constituency and more broadly. I inform the House that the government is well on track to meet its commitment for 200,000 places in aged care throughout Australia by 2006. When we came to government in 1996 about 148,000 places had been allocated. As of June this year more than 197,000 places have been allocated, including 52,700 since 1999. Indeed, there are now more than three times as many aged care places as there are acute care beds in Australia.There is an alternative approach to providing care to the frail elderly, and this is epitomised by the actions of the state governments around Australia, one of which of course is that of New South Wales. Frail elderly Australians have a right to be treated in acute care facilities in every state of Australia. If we consider that frailty increases with age and that 47 per cent of patient days in public hospitals were taken up by people over the age of 65, then this is to be expected. But under Mr Carr's watch in New South Wales in fact public hospitals have been cut, despite almost $20 billion extra in GST revenue. The Premier of New South Wales, Mr Carr, has presided over a regime of slashing 5,330 acute care beds from the public hospital system in New South Wales - not five or 50 or 500 but 5,330 beds. If you compare that to the other state Labor premiers and chief ministers around Australia, between them, under their regimes with Labor in government, all the other states and territories of Australia have slashed 779 beds, but New South Wales have taken 5,330 beds.Mr Carr said he would do something about waiting lists. Waiting lists have increased by 20.3 per cent since 1995, with 53,700 people waiting for elective surgery in New South Wales. Indeed, waiting lists of more than 12 months have increased by 127 per cent in New South Wales. In terms of aged care, half the delays in getting aged care places on line in New South Wales are because of red tape and town planning and land requirements which are overseen by the New South Wales state government - again, an indication of what Labor and Mr Carr have done. In relation to confused and elderly people in New South Wales, we have a current situation, well known by the member for Eden-Monaro and the member for Hume, where the New South Wales government wants to abolish, to cut out, two homes - one in Queanbeyan, in the member for Eden-Monaro's electorate, and one in Goulburn, in the member for Hume's electorate - which cater for confused and disturbed elderly people. That is another example of health policy under a Labor government in New South Wales.Beyond that, we have the Labor premiers, including Mr Carr, and their health ministers saying that the private health insurance rebate should be slashed - the 30 per cent rebate which makes private health insurance affordable and available to so many Australians. Finally, just as an indication of the record of Mr Carr's stewardship of health in New South Wales, New South Wales has been the most intransigent state in expanding the scope of practice for enrolled nurses, despite the fact that Premier Carr has explicitly recognised that there is an international shortage of nurses. In contrast, the Australian government is providing an additional $211 million for aged care nurses and another $50 million in aged care nursing scholarships and training for aged care nurses. No wonder Bob Carr does not want to come here until the ALP is in government, because he would not want to be judged on New South Wales Labor's health policy.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Batman for his question. I would like to take the opportunity to reveal to the House some details about the incident to which he referred. - Yes, it was such a frightful cover-up that it was reported immediately to the police, who are investigating it right now and have been since it happened. - In the early morning -  -  - Mr Speaker, if this is a serious matter, I would like to address the House on it.  - I would appreciate the chance to be able to put the answer over, because there might actually be people who would like to know the answer. We purport to take security seriously. Give me the opportunity to explain what really happened and to then come to the wildly exaggerated claims of the member opposite, who only recently in this place gave a lecture about raising false concerns. -  - Mr Speaker, is the matter raised by the opposition serious or is it not?

 - I thank the member for Mitchell for his question. I can inform him and the House that the outcome of the discussions at COAG on 29 August, regarding cooperation on antiterrorism measures, was a big fat zero due to the walkout led by the New South Wales Premier, Mr Carr. When Mr Carr led the other premiers out so that they could don their football garb, play a game of poker and generally engage in a publicity stunt, they turned their backs on a discussion of Indigenous child protection, they turned their backs on a discussion of a national bushfire inquiry and, importantly for the purposes of the member for Mitchell's question, they turned their backs on further cooperation between the governments of this country on counter-terrorism measures. They regarded a photo opportunity for the tabloids of Australia as being more important than a cooperative discussion on counter-terrorism measures.That is a measure of the priorities of the New South Wales Premier - a man who, when it suited him, was prepared to say that fighting terrorism was above party politics and that we all had to work together. I remember that, as he got up to walk out, I said, `Bob, what about the discussion on counter-terrorism?' He said, `You know my position.' I knew his position. Frankly, I do not think he would know a position on the field of the football game he claimed to represent after he got into the guernsey, but I will put that to one side.In the absence of having a proper discussion about this matter, I can inform the parliament that I have today written again to the premiers and chief ministers asking them to urgently reconsider their opposition to the Criminal Code Amendment Bill. Under the existing provisions of the Criminal Code, which was in part based on a reference of power from the states to the Commonwealth, the agreement of the states is required to make amendments to the process for listing terrorist organisations or entities.The bill, now before another place, would allow the Attorney-General, on advice from our security agencies, to list a terrorist organisation without the need for that organisation to be also proscribed by the United Nations Security Council. The United Nations Security Council currently can only list organisations that are related to al-Qaeda, the Taliban or bin Laden. The United Kingdom, Canada, New Zealand and the United States all provide for a listing process which is independent of the United Nations. I repeat: the United Kingdom, the United States, New Zealand and Canada all provide for a listing process which is independent of the Security Council of the United Nations.The stance of the opposition in this place is, apparently, the same as the premiers, although at the COAG meeting they did not pay me the courtesy of telling me - and I do not express that in any personal sense - and telling the national government of Australia where they stood before they got up off their chairs and walked out to don their football guernseys. Apparently that was more important to these eight leaders than the counter-terrorism measures. They did not tell me precisely what their views are but, as best as I can divine from correspondence, their position is apparently the same - surprise, surprise - as the view of the federal Labor opposition. What they are saying is that you have to have a separate piece of legislation every time you want to list another organisation. We regard that as impractical. We regard that as being out of step with a process which is supported by the Blair government in the United Kingdom, the Chretien government in Canada, the Clark government in New Zealand and, of course, the Bush administration in the United States.What we want and what we ask the states to consent to, in accordance with the agreement that I signed on behalf of the Commonwealth, is a regulation making power on behalf of the Attorney-General which includes very extensive safeguards: judicial review, disallowance by either house of parliament and a two-year sunset clause. So anybody who says that this is an irresponsible grab for power ignores the fact that what we want is a bill whereby, instead of a new piece of legislation having to be passed each time you get a terrorist organisation that should be banned, the Attorney-General puts down a regulation, it is subject to disallowance, there is a two-year sunset clause and it is also subject to judicial review.That represents a belts-and-braces protection of civil liberties. People who oppose that kind of measure are not serious about a legislative framework for dealing with terrorism. That is why I say to the federal opposition: why don't you reverse the tables for a change, and why don't you tell the Labor states what to do on this issue? Why doesn't the Leader of the Opposition show a bit of leadership? Why doesn't he ring up Bob Carr and say to Bob Carr: `You get behind the federal government. You give them a bit of support'? I say to the Leader of the Opposition: you should show the New South Wales Premier what you are made of. That is what I say to the Leader of the Opposition: you tell the New South Wales Premier to get into line, to get behind the national interest and to support the government's legislation.</DOC>

 - This is an important issue and I think that people would like to hear the detail of it. In the early morning of 22 August there was a break-in at 111 Alinga Street in Canberra. My department is a tenant in the building. The thieves accessed the external doors of the building using a stolen building entry pass. The entry pass belonged to a cleaning contractor working for the building owner. Using that stolen pass, the thieves then tried, unsuccessfully, to gain access to my department's area of that building. The thieves, being unable to use the card, physically forced their way through a set of secure doors to the general use area - not the security sensitive areas - of the department. That action triggered the building's silent alarm system. It appears that the thieves hastily took a number of personal items, a bottle of scotch, some coins and some departmental property, including an electronic projector and a laptop computer. By the time the security guards arrived in response to the alarm, the thieves had fled the premises.Far from being covered up or in some way obscured, this matter was reported to the Australian Federal Police and is currently being investigated by the ACT policing arm of the Australian Federal Police. The department has, I have to say, a very strict policy - as people in the public would expect - on the secure storage of sensitive information, and it is very important to note that the thieves did not have access to any secure material or information. They did not have access to it and they had no opportunity to gain access to the specially secured areas of the department where sensitive information is held. They did not get to it.The stolen computer was not used - and this is very important - to prepare or store either sensitive or classified information. It would not have been in that general use area of the department's offices if it had been. I can tell you what was on that laptop computer. It was publicly available information put together for a presentation on transport security - maritime security, not aviation security - which has been circulated to hundreds of members of the public and will shortly be available on the department's web site for all Australians to view.Let me come to the words of the member who asked the question. He has made a number of highly emotive suggestions here about us running a lax - `open door' were his words - approach to security and a cover-up. It was such a cover-up that the burglary was not even reported to the police, if you are to believe his line. On 8 September in this very place, the member for Batman made these comments:Politicians, academics and the media therefore have a responsibility to bear this in mind when commenting on security issues. All pressure must be put on the government and industry to ensure -  - You pretend to be concerned about the security of the Australian people, but you do not want the answer and you particularly do not want the member for Batman to be exposed! - I will, Mr Speaker. The member for Batman was actually very responsible in this place and I want to get this clearly on the record. The galleries are full and people ought to hear what he himself said about the stupid raising of security issues. Through you, Mr Speaker, to members of the gallery and the public, the member for Batman said:All pressure must be put on the government and industry to ensure the safest possible travelling environment ...I agree with that. He went on to say:... the issues should be raised in a responsible, constructive manner that does not blow risk out of proportion. We must be alert to the fact that not only terrorist acts but also self-serving, exaggerated threats can undo the proud history of achievement in aviation. - If that is the standard that the member for Batman applies to security issues in this nation, why did he make outrageous claims about open door approaches to security without even having the decency of ascertaining from us whether we would make a briefing available to him before he went public and said these things?</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Sturt for his question. I know he has a particular interest in the Middle East and I know that the Jewish community in Australia especially appreciates the work the honourable member does. The Australian government condemns in the strongest possible terms what I call the suicide-homicide bombings in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. At least 15 people have died, almost all of them civilians, and many more have been wounded. I have been advised that three Australian women are among those who have been wounded, and one of those Australians remains hospitalised.The Jerusalem bombing took place in a crowded cafe. There can be no doubt that innocent people have very deliberately been targeted. Witnesses have described the horrifying scenes of the dead and wounded. There is absolutely no justification - there is no political justification at all - for such murderous and vile acts. They are condemned in the strongest possible terms by the Australian government.It is no coincidence that the attacks took place as efforts are under way to try to shore up the internationally endorsed road map to peace in the Middle East. Obviously, the perpetrators do not have the interests of the Palestinian people at heart. Their barbaric actions do untold damage to the Palestinian cause and to the cause of peace in the Middle East. No doubt these acts and the resignation a few days ago of Palestinian Prime Minister Abbas are severe blows to the road map. There is just no question of that. I note that the speaker of the Palestinian legislative council, Abu Ala, whom I met in my office recently - and I think the Leader of the Opposition may have met the dominated prime minister as well when he was here the other day - has been nominated to replace Mr Abbas as prime minister. He has not yet accepted, but I think all of us who met him during his visit here know that he is a good man and he is committed to a peaceful solution to the problems of the Middle East.There is no doubt that whoever becomes the Palestinian prime minister must have full control of the Palestinian security forces and must take decisive action against terrorists. I just repeat that, in this country, the government - and I think the opposition as well - strongly endorse the road map and we urge both sides to do what they can to ensure that extremists are not allowed to derail this chance to reach a peaceful settlement.</DOC>

 - We see in that question the extraordinary hypocrisy of the Australian Labor Party which, on the one hand, asks for labelling of ethanol blends so that consumers can be properly informed and, on the other hand, moves in the Senate to delay the passage of the legislation that will make this labelling possible. - The Labor Party claims in this House to want the Australian public to have accurate information about the ethanol blends that they are purchasing and at the same time in the Senate it is deliberately taking action to delay any introduction of national labelling of ethanol blends. This is an example of the extraordinary hypocrisy that we see from the Labor Party, which since last year has set out to damage and undermine public confidence in the ethanol industry. We have a party which has done an enormous amount of damage to consumer confidence in ethanol and in the impact of ethanol on motor vehicles. Yet it does not want this information to be published for the Australian public. - The ethanol confidence working group asked the Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries to obtain advice from car manufacturers on the suitability of petrol containing up to 10 per cent ethanol for their vehicles. I remind the House that the 10 per cent cap was endorsed by the FCAI on behalf of all Australian manufacturers and importers of automobiles. What we are dealing with at this moment is a matter of consumer information.I understand the FCAI have produced a list for this working group. Manufacturers who have provided the information have not authorised the release of this list in its current form. It was very much a working document for the committee. I am advised the advice in this document does not align with advice currently in the marketplace and with advice on similar vehicles in other countries. The working group took the view that further discussions with manufacturers were needed. I understand that the working group is also recommending that point-of-sale information on ethanol blends should refer consumers to their manufacturers for advice.Although there have been many inaccurate comments about this in the media and from the Labor Party in the last 24 hours, there is no label currently before the federal government for decision. Indeed the legislation, as I said, is currently being held up by the Labor Party, and until this legislation is passed there will be no decision on a label to inform consumers. No such decision will be possible, because of the delays that the Labor Party is bringing about. But I can assure the House and the public that I am committed to taking action, as soon as parliament passes the bill, to require labelling of ethanol blends that will provide motorists with the information they need to make a properly informed choice about their fuels. I think the Australian public must be very sick and tired of the hypocrisy that the Labor Party is showing in this matter.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Wannon for his question. I can inform him that Westpac and the Melbourne Institute released their survey of consumer sentiment for September today showing that sentiment improved 3.2 per cent in the month and the index stands around 16 per cent above its long-run average. When you look at the difficulty in the world economy, SARS and the drought, it is really extraordinary that the Australian consumer is so confident.Today's confidence numbers are consistent with other data showing that Australians are confident about economic prospects. Retail turnover increased 0.8 per cent in July, and data from the Chamber of Automotive Industries last week showed total vehicle sales of 76,173 in August, a record sales figure for the Australian car industry. So the car industry is doing very well. The Victorian and South Australian car industry is doing very well. In New South Wales the car industry is doing quite well too.Why is confidence strong? We had tax cuts on 1 July, we have low interest rates and we have confidence in the government's economic policy. One has a very busy time these days trying to find out what the alternative policy put forward on behalf of the Labor Party is. We have the member for Hotham's economic policy; that is, the Creanite policy. We have the member for Werriwa, who is, as I said, a veritable Aladdin's cave, a treasure-trove - a Treasurer's trove! - of economic inconsistency. And of course one has to keep an eye on the putative Labor leader for his economic policy coming out of Sydney. Today Mr Carr said that, before any party can pitch to the voters, it has got to persuade the voters on:... the capacity to offer fiscally sound policies that guarantee on low interest rates and its capacity to protect the country's security ... That's the direction Simon Crean has been veering in ...What an endorsement! Who knows where he has been coming from, but he has started veering in the direction of fiscally sound policies. The Carr industry from New South Wales finds that he has been veering in the direction -  - The Premier of New South Wales is congratulating the Leader of the Opposition for veering in the direction of fiscally sound policies. Mr Speaker, can we recommend that veer take a larger turn and look a bit more like a U-turn in relation to economic policies? At the moment we have $1.5 billion of budget measures which are held up in the Senate. These measures are designed to base Australia's Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and to reform the welfare system, and they have a $1.5 billion price tag attached to them.When the member for Werriwa said he was going to become the spokesman on the economy for the Labor Party, he promised fiscal rigour. He said Labor would become the party of surplus rather than deficit. But in the time that he has been the spokesman for the Labor Party he has not changed their policy on one issue - not on the PBS, not on disability, not on labour market reform and not on Telstra. We heard a lot of talk from the member for Werriwa when he was on the backbench, when it looked like he wanted to endorse coalition policy on all of these things. But the moment he became the spokesman he forgot all of that rhetoric.It is important for Australia's future that these matters clear the Senate. This is not this year's budget; this is last year's budget. I recommend to the Leader of the Opposition that he pull out the transcript from Premier Carr, look at the importance of fiscal responsibility and turn that veer into a U-turn so that Australia can have better policy.</DOC>

 - In answer to the Leader of the Opposition, there is a police inquiry, and the police will of course do what they think fit. I will not be telling the Australian Federal Police how to conduct an inquiry. They operate quite independently. - In relation to the question of confidentiality, the point I made yesterday in answer to the Leader of the Opposition's question was that the Office of National Assessments, in transmitting a request to the Australian Federal Police, had expressed a view that the newspaper report did not specifically quote any intelligence material. - The question of what is covered by particular classifications is a matter for the Office of National Assessments. The Leader of the Opposition inquired about the distribution. I understand that the distribution of this document was in the order of 300. That is not to suggest that it is not an important document. I am not in any way trying to trivialise the importance of the document - I do not do that. But I make the point that the distribution was about 300.I also repeat two points I made yesterday. The ONA expressed the view to the AFP that the Melbourne newspaper article did not specifically quote any intelligence material. I note, incidentally, on going back over the transcript of my answer that I did not misquote the Leader of the Opposition. In fact, in one spot I find that I misquoted myself. I take the opportunity in defence of myself to correct that misquotation, where I mistakenly in one of the answers said that the Office of National Assessments had made the judgment that the report quoted by Bolt did not specifically quote any intelligence material, although in other places I correctly said that Bolt himself did not specifically quote any intelligence material. The matter is in the hands of the police. I frankly do not have anything to add beyond what I have said.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Solomon for his question. It is an important question, and I appreciate the interest the honourable member always shows in these issues and has particularly shown in the disaster of the Bali bombing. The government welcomes Indonesia's commitment to bring to justice the perpetrators of the Bali bombing and the manner in which the trials into the bombing are being conducted. We appreciate the excellent work of the Indonesian police and the outstanding cooperation between the Indonesian police and our own Australian Federal Police in this investigation. That has led to the rapid dismantling of the cell that carried out the attack.Over 30 people have been arrested in relation to the Bali bombing, of which around 24 have been formally charged in connection with the bombing. To date, four have been convicted. As the House will know, Amrozi received the death sentence on 7 August. Two days ago on 8 September, three others received lengthy jail sentences of between 15 and 16 years for their involvement in a robbery which helped to partly fund the bombings. It is for the Indonesian legal system to determine the appropriate sentence for those found guilty of the Bali terrorist attack. As the House knows, we have a long-standing position of opposition to the death penalty. However, given the horror of the Bali bombings and the outrage caused in Australia, the government has not protested to the Indonesian government over the imposition of the death sentence under Indonesian law in the Amrozi case. I note that the verdict in the trial of Imam Samudra will be handed down during the course of today - probably this evening. If Samudra is found guilty and receives the death penalty for his part in the Bali atrocity, the government again will not raise any objections. The verdict in the Mukhlas trial will be delivered at the end of September or possibly in early October. The verdict in the Ali Imron trial will be handed down in early October.The government continues to work closely and cooperatively with Indonesian authorities in our joint efforts to eradicate terrorists from our region. The House would be aware of the $10 million package of assistance for counter-terrorism capability building, including a police component, that we have in place. In conclusion, it is also significant to note the cooperation between the Australian Federal Police and the Indonesians over the investigation into the Marriott bombing. At one stage, 23 Australian Federal Police officers were assisting Indonesian police at that site. I think the Indonesians have done an excellent job in terms of following up after the Bali bombing. On this day, we particularly await the verdict in the Imam Samudra case.</DOC>

I am not going to give an answer on the run without talking to them. - I have already indicated to the House that I have not provided any document or information to Senator Macdonald or indeed, in this context, to the Melbourne Herald Sun newspaper - nor, on inquiry, I am assured, have any of my staff. As to the movement of the documents between my office and the Office of National Assessments, I would have to check on that. I do not carry a recollection of that. Yesterday, the Leader of the Opposition asked me - and I think he interjected by reference to it again a moment ago - the following question:At any time since June this year has the Office of National Assessments or any other Commonwealth government agency drawn to the Prime Minister's or his staff's attention the fact that national security information has been leaked to the media?In response to that, I can inform the parliament that shortly after its publication the director-general of ONA contacted my office advising of his intention to refer the matter of the Melbourne Herald Sun article to the Federal Police. The Director-General indicated that he had taken this decision after consultation with ASIO and the Federal Police. The formal letter from the ONA to the AFP was sent on 4 July, and this was before Mr Wilkie wrote to me on 9 July concerning an AFP investigation into the article. As to the conduct of the inquiry, it is in the hands of the Federal Police and, as I have said, I do not intend to tell the Federal Police how to conduct an inquiry. That is a matter for them. I do not have any comment further, therefore, to make about the inquiry.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Corangamite for his question and commend him on his continuing interest in the subject of national security. I was very pleased this morning to have the opportunity to open Emergency Management Australia's Safer Sustainable Communities Conference in Canberra. Some 700 people are attending that conference. It is a conference on disaster management and brings together Australian and international experts to share their experience and the lessons learned from past disasters, both natural ones and those caused by human hands. It is just one of the many examples of the Australian government's commitment to close and effective cooperation with the states and territories and our international counterparts on national security issues.Another example of that is our program to strengthen Australia's ability to deal with chemical, biological and radiological incidents - so-called CBR incidents. Whilst the states and territories have front-line responsibility for emergency response, we must all work together to protect the Australian community. It is in this spirit that in the 2002-03 budget the government committed $17.8 million over four years to enhance the capacity of all states and territories to deal with CBR incidents and their consequences. In order to ensure that the appropriate equipment is provided and to ensure consistency of capability across Australia, the government has established a national CBR working group, which is chaired by Emergency Management Australia and includes representatives from all states and territories. The recommendations of this working group have guided the program.I am pleased to announce that the first tranche of specialist equipment is now being distributed to all states and territories. In the last financial year, a total of $8.36 million was used to purchase equipment and conduct training. Each jurisdiction will receive equipment to a value of about $900,000. This includes chemical protection suits, specialist breathing systems, equipment to detect chemicals and radiation and units to detect bioterrorism agents through DNA analysis. Other support includes high-resolution digital still and video cameras for forensic investigation.The next stage of the CBR enhancement program, to be completed by June 2004, will focus on mobile large-scale decontamination systems, decontamination foam, casualty extraction equipment such as stretchers and sleds, chemical agent antidotes, first aid equipment, forensic sampling kits and hazard prediction software and hardware. All states and territories have signed memoranda of understanding with the government regarding long-term provision of the equipment. The equipment remains the property of the Australian government, and we will provide $30,000 annually to assist with maintenance and repair of the equipment. A review of the program will be conducted by the end of 2005-06. This is significant practical support for the states and territories and ensures that Australia is in the best possible position to respond to a CBR attack or an inadvertent CBR incident.This program is just one of a range of government measures to protect the Australian community against terrorism, funded by nearly $2 billion in extra funding, which has been provided since 11 September 2001. We have comprehensive counter-terrorism legislation. We conduct regular exercises to test the effectiveness and cooperation of counter-terrorism and emergency management agencies at all levels and across all jurisdictions.As the Prime Minister pointed out earlier in question time, the performance of the states and territories on counter-terrorism is far from perfect. On this occasion, however, I can congratulate the states and territories on their cooperation with the government on this significant measure. Like the Prime Minister, I look forward to cooperation on other valuable counter-terrorism actions. I hope that in relation to national security those opposite take the advice of their state colleagues, like the New South Wales Premier, and recognise that it is time for federal Labor to demonstrate a commitment to national security and stop political point scoring.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Makin for her question. As I indicated to the House yesterday, since 1999 the Australian government has released some 52,700 beds for nursing homes and hostels in Australia. Under the aged care legislation, there is a provision for these beds and places to be brought on line generally within two years. According to data which has recently been supplied by the Department of Health and Ageing, some 58 per cent of the delays in making provisional allocations operational are due to planning issues or site problems. Indeed, delays in obtaining council planning permits and delays due to resident objections and appeals are key factors in approved providers failing to bring provisionally allocated residential care places on line in a timely manner.In order to seek to address this, I have written not only to all the state and territory planning ministers but also to the local government and municipal associations in each of the states and territories, asking if there is some way in which we can cooperate to overcome this major cause of delays. I am pleased to indicate that the minister for health in Tasmania, Mr Llewellyn, has agreed to a process; indeed, a protocol has been signed between the Commonwealth, the state of Tasmania and local government in Tasmania, in order to overcome these delays in Tasmania so that we can get the aged care places in a timely manner.There are delays elsewhere. In Victoria, an innovative pool project which would have the effect of moving some 450 to 470 elderly people out of acute public hospitals into rehabilitation has effectively been delayed for 12 months because of town planning delays on the part of the Victorian government itself. This is a cooperative project between the Commonwealth and the state. Getting the planning approval done is in the state's hands, and it has effectively been delayed for 12 months. Just today, I have been made aware of the fact that a major provider in Sydney intends to hand 50 beds back to the Commonwealth because of delays occasioned by the south-eastern health authority in the Sutherland region of New South Wales.So these are real examples of delays in getting aged care beds on line because of the failure to streamline the town planning process in the states around Australia. I am pleased to say that the governments in Victoria and New South Wales have now agreed to a forum to address these issues so that we can bring these beds on line in a timely manner. The only state now that remains outside this process in failing to do so is South Australia. I am informed that in South Australia 52 per cent of all the operational delays are due to planning issues in that state. I urge those members representing South Australian constituencies here to encourage the South Australian government to cooperate in this process so we can get the beds built.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Canberra for her question. I had a very cordial and productive meeting with the New South Wales Nurses Association for about an hour this morning. - If you listen, I might tell you. I can indicate to the House a number of the things that were discussed in relation to that. For example, the New South Wales Nurses Association acknowledged the 100 per cent increase in funding which this government has provided to aged care - from some $3 billion when we came to government in 1996 to some $6 billion in terms of total funding for aged care this year. In addition to that, they acknowledged the fact that in last year's budget an additional $211 million was provided in funding towards a subsidy specifically in order to address the issue of the increased costs of nurses' wages. So these were matters which we had a cordial discussion about. In addition to that, the New South Wales Nurses Association, their General Secretary - Mr Holmes - and other members of that association with whom I had this meeting talked about some of the processes and the possible outcomes of the pricing inquiry currently being conducted by Professor Hogan. The New South Wales Nurses Association and the Australian Nursing Federation more generally have an input into that inquiry, because the Federal Secretary of the Australian Nursing Federation, Ms Jill Iliffe, is a member of the expert reference sector committee which is advising Professor Hogan in relation to that.Two other matters which we discussed are worth recounting to the House. One is that, as one of the nurses present said to me, even if the wages were exactly the same as they are in public hospitals, that would not be the end of the issue, because there are some structural issues that need to be addressed - which we are in the process of addressing. One of these is to reduce the amount of paperwork for aged care nurses: relating to that there are three trials currently under way which will conclude at the end of this month. The other matter is in relation to expanding the scope of practice for nurses because, as the New South Wales Premier Mr Carr himself conceded, there is a national and international shortage of nurses. One of the ways in which we can do that is to expand the scope of practice of enrolled nurses in New South Wales.It is a curious fact that for 41 years in Western Australia enrolled nurses have had a scope of practice which has enabled them to give medication to the residents of aged care homes. Today in New South Wales that ability is not available to enrolled nurses. So someone who might have been practising as an enrolled nurse in Western Australia for the past 25 years and be competent in administering medications could come to New South Wales and be precluded from doing that. - As the nurses from the New South Wales Nurses Association agreed today, this is a structural barrier to improving the care of the elderly in New South Wales. I call upon those members from New South Wales in this place to take up this issue with the Premier of New South Wales, Mr Carr - and with the state health minister in New South Wales - because it is under his legislation and his regulations that these structural impediments to improving aged care exist. Another example of what happens with health and aged care in New South Wales is that, as I said yesterday, 5,330 beds have been slashed from the public hospital system in New South Wales. If you lined up end to end the beds that have been slashed from the public hospital system in New South Wales under Bob Carr, they would stretch from Macquarie Street to the airport - of course, that is where he wants to go.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Eden-Monaro for his question and for his important and valuable work as Chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Science and Innovation. He is a popular and credible figure in the science constituency - at times more so than the minister himself, I hasten to add. In fact, some in the science media have speculated that he is a future science minister, and I am more than happy to dip my lid to this outstanding champion for science. - I hasten to add that there is one person that the science media never speculate about becoming science minister and that is the opposition's spokesman for science, and I challenge anyone to name him or her. - Returning to the matter at hand, last night was an opportunity to celebrate the outstanding work of all Australian scientists and particularly that of three exceptionally gifted scientists. The Prime Minister presented the Prime Minister's Prize for Science to Emeritus Professor Jacques Miller. Professor Miller is known as the modern father of immunology. His work underpins modern medicine's understanding of how the immune system operates. His work forms the basis for new vaccine development, preventing organ graft rejection and enhancing cancer cell death. Professor Miller's award acknowledges a lifetime commitment to the quest for knowledge and his outstanding medical breakthroughs which have improved the quality of life for countless Australians.Prizes were also awarded to two exceptional Australian scientists who, although at a relatively early stage in their careers, have already made significant achievements in their areas of research. The Malcolm McIntosh Prize for the Physical Scientist of the Year was awarded to Dr Howard Wiseman. Dr Wiseman's work as a senior research fellow at Griffith University is expanding our understanding of the quantum world. His work focuses on what is known as the quantum measurement problem - a problem that baffled even Einstein. The winner of the Science Minister's Prize for Life Scientist of the Year was Dr Christopher Helliwell, a senior research scientist with the CSIRO Division of Plant Industry. Dr Helliwell has isolated the genes that control the biosynthesis of one of the most important hormones in plants. This discovery will help shape the future of agriculture and horticulture in Australia. These two young scientists represent the face and future of science in Australia. The awards reflect the government's commitment to encouraging our best talent to pursue careers in research.Whilst I am sure the House joins me in congratulating all the prize winners on their achievements, I also wish to congratulate their support teams who are leading the way in so many areas of science and innovation in Australia. The medal recipients are representative of the research teams who collectively make Australian science the basis of the nation's prosperity. We are indebted to them and their colleagues.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Indi for her question and for her obvious concern not only for the welfare of the unemployed but particularly for those who were devastated by the natural disasters in her own area. The government expanded its Work for the Dole program to take into account some of the tragedies that have occurred around Australia in recent years. Some examples include Yeppoon in North Queensland where unemployed people assisted as part of a CAG - a community action group - team to help clean up after floods. They got in quickly to assist their fellow Australians at a time of difficulty and to do something positive for themselves.Here in Canberra and the surrounds, and in Queanbeyan, as the member for Eden-Monaro would no doubt be well aware, unemployed Australians played a very important role after the firestorms in assisting those families affected during that tragic time. Also, up at Wowan, which is 100 kilometres west of Rocky, when Cyclone Betty came through in February this year, once again unemployed Australians, using the benefit of the Work for the Dole program, and community work coordinators were able to make a positive contribution. Tremendous work was done in the Indi electorate after the fires, and I have informed the House before of that work, but it is worth noting what the Border Mail said in its editorial. It said that the Work for the Dole project has been a tangible exercise in realistic bushfire recovery work.The government is very much committed to this broader program of not only helping our communities but also providing this assistance when nature does its worst in our communities. I remind everybody that the Prime Minister's Work for the Dole awards are about to open for nominations again as of next week. I know that the member for Franklin has in the past commented favourably upon the communities and thanked them for the work they have done by putting them up. I thank him for that. I say to other members of the opposition and to all members of this House: take the opportunity to show your thanks to those people who, in being unemployed, are less fortunate than ourselves at the moment for the fine work that they are doing in their communities and recommend them for a Prime Minister's Work for the Dole Achievement Award - show them that you care.</DOC>

 - In relation to the claims made about intelligence going to Senator Macdonald and to Mr Bolt of the Herald Sun newspaper, these matters have been referred to the Australian Federal Police. I have instructed my office to cooperate fully with the Australian Federal Police, which I know they are perfectly willing to do. They will obviously deal with the Federal Police as the Federal Police conduct the investigation. Let me make a couple of other points about this. The first is that I have, during the course of this week, had a look at the material raised by both Mr Bolt and Senator Macdonald. I note that that material had already been discussed by Mr Wilkie in the media before the beginning of the war in Iraq.  - Yes, but I read nothing in Mr Bolt's article or indeed in Senator Macdonald's questions that seemed to me to be substantially different from anything that Mr Wilkie had been saying in the media, including in an article in the Bulletin on 18 March. So I do find it a rather curious thing that this is such a preoccupation for the opposition. I also think it is a very ironic line of questioning from the opposition, bearing in mind their liberal use of top-secret documents during the East Timor crisis when the member for Kingsford-Smith was wandering around the press gallery with Defence Intelligence Organisation documents and was even talking about these documents in a speech at a Labor Party fundraiser.Finally, there is one other point I would like to make about this. I am struck by comments the opposition have been making during the course of this last week. I have reflected on this. They referred to a top-secret AUSTEO code word document. If the opposition have not seen the document or been briefed on the document, how would they know that it was a top-secret AUSTEO and code word document? The hypocrisy of this, the suggestion that somebody has given the document to Andrew Bolt while the opposition do not know anything about the document, is I think just a little too transparent.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for McPherson for this question. Today is a great day for the workers of Australia. Today we have seen the lowest unemployment rate for 13 years. Today the Bureau of Statistics told us that unemployment in Australia had fallen to 5.8 per cent, and this is despite a rise in the participation rate. As the Treasurer pointed out earlier, it is despite the fact that there has been a significant fall in exports due to the combined effect of the drought and the sluggishness in the world economy. But the thing that is really significant about this golden figure for the workers of Australia is that getting Australians into jobs is what good economic policy is all about. We have this number because of the courage of the government's economic policies over the last 7½ years. We have it despite the attempts of the Australian Labor Party, year after year, to prevent us from implementing good economic policy. They stood in the way of industrial relations reform. They stood in the way of tax reform. They even, through the current Leader of the Opposition, said that tax reform would drive up unemployment in Australia. That is what they said. They warned that inflation would go up. They warned that economic growth would stagnate. They warned that unemployment would get worse. They taunted us about it. The Leader of the Opposition's predecessor said that he was going to surf to victory not on the back of good policy but on the back of the public's discontent with the new tax system. But, as is typical of the character of the Australian nation, it took tax reform in its stride, despite the drought. And let me take the opportunity of saying, through the parliament, to the Australian people that, although there have been some good rains in recent weeks, we should not pretend that the drought is over. There are many country people all around our nation who are still very severely affected by the drought and, unless there are good follow-up rains, some of those harsh conditions could return. We must preserve a sense of perspective.  But I repeat that this is a wonderful number. The unemployment rate was last below six per cent in March 1990. Unemployment reached 10.9 per cent in December 1992 as a consequence of `the recession we had to have'. In getting ready for question time, I recalled the fact that the Leader of the Opposition was once the Minister for Employment, Education and Training. He was the Minister for Employment, Education and Training for no fewer than 26 months in the Keating government. I wonder what unemployment in Australia averaged over this period. Was it five per cent?Government members - No! - Was it six per cent?Government members - No! - Was it seven per cent?Government members - No! - No, it averaged 8.8 per cent, which is a full three percentage points above the present figure. This is the former president of the ACTU, and the unemployment rate was three percentage points above the present figure. In my quick research, I just happened to come across an answer to a question without notice on 10 February 1994 by the then employment minister, now Leader of the Opposition. He started off - and they are really wonderful words - by saying:The labour force statistics that have been released today are very good news for job seekers. He then went on to say:The unemployment rate has fallen to 10.6 per cent ...In a phrase, that says it all. To Labor, it is good news if unemployment is at 10.6 per cent. To us, any unemployment rate is too high. I do not pretend that there is not volatility and I do not pretend that the numbers will not bounce around in the months ahead, but I do remind those opposite that we have created 1.2 million new jobs since we came to office. We created 365,000 new jobs in our first term and 500,000 in our second term, and we have created 334,000 so far in the current term, with more to come.The final thing I would say is that we can have even lower unemployment in this country if we get off the back of small business, if the Labor Party summons the courage to tell the trade union movement to get lost and allows the unfair dismissal laws to pass through the Senate. If we could get those laws passed through the Senate, we could, on private sector assessments, add 50,000 to 80,000 more jobs a year to the Australian work force, and that would drive our unemployment rate down even further. Good economic policy has its reward, and the greatest reward for this government is to have 1.2 million more Australians in work over the last 7½ years.</DOC>

 - It is the case that a remark made by a member of my staff without my authority, which subsequently and immediately drew a reprimand, was interpreted by some members of the gallery - and I am quite happy to go through this - as reflecting on the character of the gentleman in question. When it happened I asked my chief of staff, Arthur Sinodinos, to contact Mr Wilkie. Mr Sinodinos had a half-hour conversation with him - and this was immediately after Mr Wilkie had resigned from the ONA - and he assured him that the remark and any interpretation placed upon it did not carry my authority, imprimatur or urging. On my behalf he conveyed an apology for any hurt that may have been occasioned. Indeed, Mr Wilkie himself acknowledged this fact in an interview on 22 July with Caroline Overington, in which he said, inter alia:... a guy called me, around midday, and said he was from the Prime Ministers office, and he talked to me for about half an hour, very apologetic, saying that Howard was personally very sorry that this story had been leaked by a junior person on his staff.They told me that they would retract the story, and to its credit, the press did not follow the story or ask me about it.That is the extent of that particular part of it. I made it very clear to my staff and colleagues that Mr Wilkie had a perfect right to resign from the ONA and there was to be absolutely no attempt to criticise him as an individual. I have no reason to believe that Mr Wilkie is acting other than in a conscientious fashion.As far as the question of the retaliation I spoke of the other day is concerned, I was talking there of the self-evident right that I and other members of the government have to argue and hit back when we are called liars and fabricators. That is what we were called by Mr Wilkie at the inquiry being conducted by the member for Fadden's committee. That was the language that was used. No man or woman in this parliament is going to stand by silently when somebody falsely accuses them of telling lies and fabricating intelligence. - Mr Speaker, the question has been asked. These are legitimate matters for discussion and I am quite happy to discuss them. But I want to get into context what I have said about Mr Wilkie. Whenever anybody, particularly somebody who claims the sanction and authority of having been an intelligence officer, makes claims about me and my colleagues that I believe are wrong, I will argue back and criticise that person. I will deny the allegations and I will do so very vehemently.Let us understand this: he had a right to resign. I have never accused him of behaving improperly and I have not accused him of leaking any intelligence information. I accept fully that he has a right as a citizen of this country to have a go at me, but I do not give him the right to call me a liar or a fabricator without rebuke. That is essentially it. We will go on rebuking, attacking and criticising him in defending our own reputations. As far as the remarks of my colleague in the Senate are concerned, they were made off his own bat. As soon as I heard about them I sent a message to him that they should not be repeated. They are not views that I hold and they are not views that I endorse. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Forde and I appreciate the interest she shows in international relations. As the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition have pointed out, this is the anniversary of the terrible and evil events of September 11, 2001. That day did not so much change the world as change the way we view it. Issues such as the threat of terrorism, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the problem of failed states had all been issues before September 11, 2001. But, after that terrible day, a lot of us around the world understood that those issues needed to be dealt with more decisively and effectively than had been the case in the past.Two years after September 11, Australia is at the forefront in the global fight against terrorism. No fewer than 100 Australians have been killed in acts of terror in the last two years. Our resolve is firm. Terrorists hate all we stand for, they have no respect for the religion they purport to uphold and they have no respect for moderate Islamic governments. In the two years since that fateful day, over 3,000 al-Qaeda suspects have been detained in 90 countries. In excess of $A220 million in terrorist assets have been frozen. In Afghanistan, Australia has helped to remove the Taliban from power, destroying terrorist bases and disrupting al-Qaeda operations. In Iraq we helped to ensure that the brutal regime of Saddam Hussein would never again be able to use weapons of mass destruction against its neighbours and its people. The threat of weapons of mass destruction falling into the hands of terrorists is greatly diminished without Saddam Hussein.Australia responded very strongly to the threat of terrorism in our region. We were instrumental in listing Jemaah Islamiah with the United Nations. That has led to the freezing of Jemaah Islamiah assets and restriction of the movement of Jemaah Islamiah members. About 200 members of Jemaah Islamiah have been arrested in the region since that time. We have established a network of bilateral counter-terrorism arrangements that have strengthened practical, operational level cooperation. This cooperation is seeing terror attacks prevented, terror networks disrupted and charges laid against 24 Jemaah Islamiah members for the Bali bombings. We have helped countries to build their capacity to fight terrorism through law enforcement, border and transport security, intelligence cooperation and antiterrorist financing.We have taken a lead role in forums like APEC, which brings together the heads of government of the countries of the Asia-Pacific region, and also a lead role in the ASEAN Regional Forum to drive the counter-terrorism agenda. Early next year we will be co-hosting with Indonesia a regional ministerial summit on counter-terrorism.Finally, I think it is important to accept that we still have a great challenge in the war against terrorism, and the Prime Minister has made that point very clearly. Of course we do have a long way to go, but my point is that we are making progress. We do not underestimate the terrorists. The audio and video footage of bin Laden and his No. 2, al-Zawahiri, shows that al-Qaeda remains intent on further terrorist attacks, although those statements do not require a change to our existing threat levels here in Australia. This is not a new struggle. This is the age-old clash between moderates and extremists; between tolerance and intolerance. It will be a long struggle but the government will sustain action with both purpose and vigour. </DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. I think we established yesterday quite clearly that what amounted to a burglary does not open us to the claim that we have an open-door approach to security. - Frankly I think it is outrageous and irresponsible - I really do - to ignore the very principles that the member for Batman put down when he indicated that irresponsibly raising these sorts of issues was inappropriate. There has been a screening breach at Melbourne airport. It happened on the ninth of this month and it involved an off-duty policeman who did the right thing and alerted crew to the fact that he had inadvertently, apparently, taken on board a limited number of rounds of ammunition.I have to say at the outset that I do not believe that this was a deliberate attempt to avoid the screening process. There was no malicious intent or any threat to the passengers or aircraft. There was no cover-up. I ordered an urgent inquiry by my department and a few matters have been established, which I put before the House. A regional manager from the aviation security regulation branch of my department was promptly in attendance at Melbourne airport as a part of this investigation. The investigation has so far included a reconstruction of the incident with Melbourne airport staff, including the screening process. The investigation is continuing, although I can establish that it appears at this stage that the screening equipment itself was functioning properly.My department wrote to Melbourne airport on 10 September, directing that compliance with department standards for screening procedures be taken up with the screening company and requesting a full brief on the incident and the measures taken by the airport to address the breach. My department is seeking legal advice on any other appropriate enforcement action. I understand that Melbourne airport has removed from duties the staff member involved for retraining and is in the process of briefing all security screening staff to remind them of the correct procedures. Similar directions have been conveyed to other airport screening authorities, and they will be discussed at the next meeting of the Aviation Security Industry Consultative Group, which is due to be held here in Canberra over 17 and 18 September. We will continue to monitor the compliance of all regulated airports, including Melbourne, with the appropriate set-out standards that we expect to be fully honoured. I understand that Victoria Police are conducting their own investigation into this incident. I find it very surprising that the Victoria Police minister would play politics with one of his serving officers before the official investigation is completed. The Victoria Police minister may well be seeking to attempt to deflect attention from a failure of the Victoria Police procedures that allowed the officer to be carrying the ammunition in the first place. - I know you are a Victorian but it ought to be properly considered. I am advised that there may have a breach of the dangerous goods regulations administered by CASA. Carriage of ammunition in an aircraft cabin is an offence under the Civil Aviation Act, and that is being investigated by CASA.</DOC>

Can I inform the honourable member for Mallee and the honourable member for Port Adelaide that the ABS today reported that, in the month of August, the number of jobs increased by 80,600 and the number of full-time jobs increased by 63,500. I thank the honourable member for Port Adelaide for his dorothy dixer! The questions tend to be more searching when they are asked from this side of the House.I believe that all Australians will welcome the fact that there was strong jobs growth in the month of August and I believe both sides of the House will welcome the fact that unemployment has now fallen below six per cent in Australia. The remarkable thing about this is that this has occurred at a time when Australia's prospects internationally have been more adverse than probably at any other period in the last 20 or 30 years. This was during a quarter when we had global weakness, negative growth in four of the G7 countries, negative growth in all of the Asian tigers, recession in two of the G7 countries, the worst drought in Australian history and the SARS epidemic. In the face of all of those factors, which I described recently in Thailand as a quarterly tsunami coming together on the export front, the Australian economy continued to grow and jobs growth increased.All Australians will welcome the fact that Australian consumers appear to be very confident, supported by low interest rates, supported by income tax cuts, which came into effect on 1 July, and now supported by strong employment outcomes. The Prime Minister has already compared these sorts of outcomes to the outcomes that Australia had to suffer during the early part of the 1990s under a Labor government. To put this in context, the last time the unemployment rate was below six per cent was for a short period of seven months in late 1989 and January 1990. To go below six per cent - to find a comparable figure - you would have to go back to October 1981. I cannot recall who was in government in 1981! In 1981, unemployment was 5.9 per cent.  - The deficit was $10 billion. That was the deficit. I thank the member for Corio for his interjection. When this government came to office, the deficit was $10 billion, Commonwealth debt was $96 billion, the home mortgage interest rate was 10.5 per cent and unemployment was 8.2 per cent. Let us come to today. The budget is in surplus, Commonwealth debt has been reduced from $96 billion to $32 billion, home mortgage rates have come down from 10½ per cent to 6.5 per cent and the unemployment rate has come down from 8.2 per cent to 5.8 per cent.The Australian Labor Party fought this government every step of the way in relation to economic reform. If the Australian Labor Party had had their way, we would have never balanced the budget. They opposed all of the measures that were required to balance the budget and said it would cause a recession. That is when they had Gareth Evans as their economic spokesman. When we reformed the tax system they opposed all of the measures, and that is when they had the member for Hotham as their shadow Treasurer - WTG. Don't you recall him saying at the time that if we reformed the taxation system then we would have a recession?There remains in the Senate $1.5 billion of measures from not this year's budget but last year's budget, which the Australian Labor Party still refuse to pass in the long-term interests of Australia. We can stop today and we can say, `A low unemployment rate is a good thing.' It will move around over forthcoming months. But the tragedy is this: things in Australia could be so much better. That is the tragedy. If the Senate passed -  - The member for Hotham - WTG. The member for Werriwa - NBTC: no better than Crean. Things in Australia could be so much better. If the Senate would pass our labour market reform we could give more jobs and we could lock in low unemployment. If the Senate would pass the PBS reforms we could put PBS on to a sustainable basis. If the Senate would pass welfare reform we could get participation up in this country. The thing that stands between better policy in this country and where we are today is the Australian Labor Party. - To the Australian Labor Party we say again: get out of the way. Let the government get on with its reform program. You tried to stop the reforms of the past. Look at the outcomes. Please do not try and stop the reforms of today because the opportunities for Australia could be so much better.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I have no recollection of a break-in six months ago of the sort that happened yesterday. I will check the records and establish whether it happened. I reiterate the point that I made yesterday: in this particular case there is no cause, basis or justification for any concern that those who broke in and removed the laptop, a bottle of scotch and some private belongings were able to gain any access to security sensitive information. - Why did we lock the door? It was because we do not actually have an open door security policy, I suppose. Let me reiterate from yesterday: so sensitive was the information contained on the laptop that I can now advise all members of the House that it is on the department's web site and they are free to go and have a look at it. We do not take these matters lightly. No-one in the transport industry who is implementing the enormous reform and the security measures that we are insisting upon as a government would say that they constituted the Australian community, the government or the private sector taking security lightly. They just would not. It would be impossible to do so.The measures that are in place now are far streng-thened compared to what they were prior to September 2001. They are increasingly being strengthened. They are ahead of ICAO international standards. In relation to maritime, we do indeed have a very big task before us. We are taking it forward cooperatively with all the state and territory Labor governments. I think that the Leader of the Opposition would do well to take a note out of the book of the Premier of New South Wales and, in an earlier guise, the member for Batman's book when they warned against making security a political football. I am more than happy to engage in serious debate about real security issues. I do not take them lightly. Again I make the offer to the member for Batman if he wants to be true to what he claimed was his sense of values on this matter in this place just last Monday, when he said:... issues should be raised in a responsible, constructive manner that does not blow risk out of proportion.Does anyone believe that they are not trying to scaremonger here? Does anyone really believe that this is not meant to heighten people's concern when they talk about an open door policy for security? Does anyone believe that the National Security Committee of cabinet has not spent hours and hours or that the Treasurer has not had to find hundreds of millions of dollars to enhance the security of the Australian population and that the private sector is not having to find hundreds of millions of dollars? Does anyone believe that it is not simply trying to frighten the Australian people to call this an open door approach to security? It is no such thing, and in the interests of a real debate about it I again say to the member for Batman that on other matters he has frequently requested briefings from my department -   - In that case I suggest that you seek a briefing from us on these security matters and we will give you one in good faith.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Cook for his question and for his interest. The government welcomes the decision by the Indonesian court to convict and sentence Imam Samudra. Samudra was found guilty of planning an act of terrorism, funding terrorism, illegal possession of firearms and explosives, and detonating explosive devices. He was sentenced to death. Samudra has been described as Jemaah Islamiah's field commander in the Bali bombing operation. He was a key figure with links to Hambali, who the House will know has recently been arrested in Thailand, and with close links to Abu Bakar Bashir. Samudra's acts were those of a violent, brutal criminal and should be condemned without qualification. His acts have nothing to do with Islam.The verdict should, I think, bring some comfort to Samudra's victims and the families of those who were killed in the attack. Samudra's was the fifth conviction to date relating to the Bali attack. I think these convictions have successfully started the process of sending a strong signal to terrorists not just in Indonesia or South-East Asia but in the world over that the international community will not sit back and allow them to strike with impunity. As I said in the House yesterday, the Australian Federal Police have cooperated very closely with their colleagues in Indonesia and they have had unprecedented cooperation in investigating the Bali bombing. I think the AFP deserve a great deal of credit for and indeed congratulations on the outstanding work that they have done in the Bali inquiry.It is not, of course, the policy of the Australian government to support the death penalty, and the government's acceptance of the sentence does not mean that we have changed our policy. But in these particular circumstances we will not be making any representations against the sentence to the Indonesian government. As the House knows, that is the position we took in relation to Amrozi and it is the position we are taking in relation to Samudra. If others are found guilty of and sentenced for the same or like offences in relation to the Bali bombing then we will take the same position in those cases as well. I welcome Samudra's conviction as another important step forward in the war against terrorism.</DOC>

I have no personal knowledge of the matters raised in that article other than the matters that were referred to, and I gained that from reading the article. In relation to the information declared on the party's return, I have not inspected the party's return.

 - I welcome the opportunity to answer the question because inferences are being drawn that are quite inappropriate and they ought to be dealt with quite clearly. I indicated earlier that I read of these matters this morning in the Sydney Morning Herald. The information was of surprise to me, but my department, obviously reading the same article, prepared for me some notes which I think I should use just to put beyond doubt any view that you might be trying to encourage people to form - that is, that these people received some special treatment from my department in relation to their running of a college in Sydney.The fact is that on 21 August, the Australian College of Technology was cancelled from the Commonwealth Register of Institutions and Courses for Overseas Students by the Department of Education, Science and Training. The college had for some time been a provider of concern to both my department and to the Department of Education, Science and Training. In 2001 the New South Wales compliance office received numerous complaints of non-attendance being condoned by the college, provided fees were paid. These allegations were supported by officers' fieldwork, resulting in the location of non-compliance students. The allegations in fieldwork findings were referred to the New South Wales Vocational Education and Training Accreditation Board, VETAB, and to the Department of Education, Science and Training, and that was to provide possible evidence for the cancellation or suspension of the college's accreditation.Early inquiries established that the principals of the college had been convicted of serious fraud matters prior to their establishment of the college. This information was referred to VETAB and to DEST, as investigators believed that that clearly breached the fit and proper person requirements of the executive college staff. In October, DIMIA officers served two production notices on the college, demanding attendance and academic details for students. The response was copied to both VETAB and DEST to provide evidence of breaches of the education legislation requirements. On 4 June investigators served a further eight production notices on them, and those responses were again copied to the relevant departments. A student investigations officer accompanied DEST and VETAB officers on a joint agency compliance visit on 17 May. The point I am making is that it is beyond doubt that the department acted properly. There was no interference in the way in which they dealt with those issues. I had no knowledge of any donations being made by particular individuals.  - My conference does take donations, as it is entitled to. It properly discloses those matters, as I said before. You trawl over that register. You have more knowledge and information -  - Well, the honourable member trawls over the register obviously, and has more information about what is on that register than I do. - I have no idea whether or not the person referred to in a newspaper article today has made donations to my party organisation. And I do not know that I would know from the information provided in the newspaper article if a Mr Yung by another name had made donations. I just do not know, and I do not think you know any more than I do in relation to that.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Grey who represents an electorate of some 900,000 square kilometres, I think, of this great nation. It is no wonder he would ask a question about Job Network because, if my figures are correct, there used to be about half a dozen CESs over that huge expanse of Australia and today there are some 22 services providing Job Network job placements and the New Enterprise Incentive Scheme to Australians throughout the electorate of Grey. I commend him on the fine job that he does out there. Of course those 22-odd sites are part of 2½ thousand sites right throughout the length and breadth of this country which provide services to Australians where they live.It was interesting today that we had an interjection from the member for Port Adelaide, which was responded to by the Treasurer, in which he asked the driving question about full-time employment - he asked how many full-time jobs there are. The Treasurer rightly pointed out that some 63,500 full-time jobs were created in the last month of the Howard-Anderson government. Do you know how many months it took the Labor Party to actually create 60,000 full-time jobs - not even 60,000, in fact the figure was 56,500 full-time jobs? Sixty thousand jobs in one month under the Howard government, and you got 56,000 jobs in 72 months under a Labor government, with the Leader of the Opposition as the employment minister. What a tremendous record! I am not suggesting that we are 72 times better than the Labor Party, but we do know that Job Network is delivering for Australians where they live. In fact, why is it delivering? It is delivering because under the star rating system, Job Network members have one goal and one goal only: that is to get real jobs for real Australians. I will read to you from our Job Network star rating and performance information. These are the words that the Job Network members know underpin their capacity to maintain contracts. It reads:In line with the objectives of Job Network, the overwhelmingly important criterion for gaining a high star rating is placing the maximum possible number of job seekers into jobs.And that is the way it should be. The greatest rewards are for those that extend the jobs for longer than 13 weeks, or for 26 weeks for disadvantaged job seekers and Indigenous people.  Today alone an additional 5,600 jobs have come onto the Australian Job Network. They are real jobs for real Australians. It is no wonder the opposition look so glum. There have been 60,000 new vacancies this month which have gone onto the Job Network, yet there were only 56,000 full-time jobs created in the last six years of the Labor government. The Job Network is playing a significant role in driving down unemployment, seeing a `5' in front of the unemployment number for the first time in 13 years. But this side of politics knows and recognises there is more to be done. We will not rest on our laurels. We will continue to drive unemployment down. We will continue to motivate job seekers and to have Job Network members focused on one thing: getting Australians into work.</DOC>

 - The duplication - the two lanes - of the Calder Highway is being funded under the Roads of National Importance program, a program which never existed under the Labor Party. So if it had not been for this government - and I am sure the member has told the Bendigo Advertiserthis - none of that would have occurred; none of the extension would have occurred because there were no roads of national importance. I think this is very important. The Commonwealth had no such program and therefore under the Labor Party there would have been no Commonwealth contribution whatsoever in relation to that. So we have been building and extending the Calder Highway under that program - and, as I indicated, under the RONI program - fifty-fifty. That provides the funding for it.I am aware that the member for Bendigo has called for the remaining duplication of the Calder Highway to be funded by the Commonwealth out of funds which have been allocated to the Scoresby Freeway. And the member for Bendigo nods, rather embarrassedly. He has said that there is now no need to fund the Scoresby Freeway -  - He nods again and says, `That's right.' I want that to be carefully noted: he said, `That's right,' and nodded. There is no need, he says, for the Commonwealth to expend any funds - the $400 million plus - on the Scoresby Freeway. In other words, it is now federal Labor policy to take funds out of the Scoresby Freeway. What does the member for Deakin think about that? What does the member for Aston think about that? What does the member for Casey think about that?  - Mr Speaker, what does the member for Dunkley think about that? If you want to talk about election commitments that have been broken, there has never been one of the dimension of Premier Bracks's in the Victorian state election. He was running around saying that Labor was committed to the Scoresby Freeway. He got himself elected and says he wants to impose tolls and completely suck out not just the state funding but the federal funding as well. We have a written agreement with the Victorian government that says Scoresby will be built -  - and will be built without tolls. This campaign by the member for Bendigo to short-change the people of the eastern suburbs of Melbourne will be repudiated. The funding of the Bendigo road will be accommodated under Roads of National Importance, a program which only this side of the parliament has put in place. I am sure that the Labor Party would acknowledge the fact that there would have been no funding if it had not been for the coalition.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Deakin for his question. I look forward to a reformed construction industry building the Scoresby Freeway. The commercial construction industry is a $40 billion industry - it is six per cent of our economy; six per cent of our GDP - and that is why, if the commercial construction industry can be improved, we can get unemployment down below 5.8 per cent. It is a very important national challenge. The respected analysts at Econtech say that if labour productivity in the commercial construction industry could reach that regularly achieved in the housing industry GDP would be one per cent higher, inflation would be one per cent lower, and Australian consumers would enjoy $2.3 billion worth of benefits every year.Because of practices in the commercial sector, such as overmanning and frequent stoppages, plastering the same wall in the same way costs 40 per cent more in a high-rise building than it does in a new Australian home. The problems identified by the Cole royal commission, including a culture of illegal and improper payments, chronic disregard of legally binding agreements, regular flouting of court and commission orders, and a culture of coercion and intimidation of the type recently witnessed at a Sydney picket line attended by CFMEU boss, John Sutton, have to be addressed if honest workers and honest businesses are to enjoy the clean industry they deserve.I can inform the House that next Thursday the government will release an exposure draft of new legislation designed to ensure the rule of law in the construction industry. Unfortunately we already know what the shadow minister for workplace relations thinks about this legislation, because he said recently to a union gathering:... my position is that, if Tony Abbott brings a bill before the Parliament, it is almost certainly a bad bill and that we will oppose it ...Last year, when he had more sense, he said:By opposing for the sake of opposing, Labor will have let Australia down badly. This year he says:... our approach will be that Tony Abbott is bad and it's anti-worker. A number of the member for Rankin's colleagues think it is high time he lifted his game. It is not just the member for Throsby and the member for Melbourne Ports who think he is Pauline Hanson's best friend. The member for Rankin was right last year; he is wrong this year. In the absence of any serious policy from the member for Rankin, I call on members opposite who understand the construction industry and know its problems to support the government's bill and get behind a clean industry.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Macarthur for being a great advocate for Western Sydney, and I congratulate him in setting up the PM's V, the Running for a Future team, which is about encouraging young runners in marathon running in Australia. -  - I am the only person here to have played in the PM's XI. - But I do not think I will ever be in the PM's V. I think that is a safe bet. - Housing - and housing affordability - is a very big issue right across Australia, and it is a very big issue in Western Sydney. Housing is vitally important for small business. All the plumbers, sparkies, tilers, roofers and brickies' labourers, and all those small business people working hard - including apprentices - to build houses for Australians mean that it is a vital part of Australia's economic activity and a vital part of the Australian economy. It is the government's view that housing should be more affordable for all people, including people in Western Sydney. That is why I was horrified to read that Liverpool City Council wants to increase a new tax on new homes in Western Sydney to $64,000. Every new home built in Western Sydney will have a new tax of $64,000, thanks to the Liverpool Labor council. That says everything. We have not heard one word from Bob Carr criticising this. And what a surprise, because Bob Carr slaps a stamp duty on top of that, so he gets a windfall. I was wondering: what would be the view of the member for Werriwa? What would the member for Werriwa think? The House will recall that the member for Werriwa has been talking up housing affordability, saying that more Australians should have access to housing. So I would have thought that when it came to a $64,000 tax slug on every new home in his electorate he would be out there belting up Liverpool City Council. I looked everywhere, but I could not find a single word of criticism. However, I am indefatigable when it comes to research, and I discovered why the member for Werriwa did not say anything about the $64,000 slug. In an article written for Australian Quarterly, the member for Werriwa said:It is not too late for the state government to use taxation policy as a disincentive for growth in Western Sydney. -  - It gets better:Other options include the extension of the federal capital gains tax to the family home and the introduction of a local government betterment tax.I could not put it down when I got to the conclusion. I could not sleep. I got to the clanger. The member for Werriwa said:It is a legitimate goal of government to lift land prices in Western Sydney.How many members of the Labor Party agree with the member for Werriwa? How many agree with him? - Mr Speaker, they just have to put up their hands and say, `We agree with the member for Werriwa.' It must be lonely for the member for Werriwa, because at this stage he is running with the hares and hunting with the hounds.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for the question. Let me inform him that I have been informed that the Joint Intelligence Committee assessment on Iraq and terrorism was received by the relevant Australian agencies on 10 February 2003. I am further advised that the JIC reports are not normally passed to ministers, and I can confirm that this particular JIC report was not brought to my attention or, so I am told, that of my office or other ministers. -  - Hang on! Don't get too excited about that at all. But even if it were, there is nothing new in the JIC report. The Australian intelligence community, as part of the government's prudent contingency planning, undertook various assessments of what could go wrong in the event of a conflict in Iraq, and in framing these assessments Australian agencies drew upon JIC reports as well as a range of other analysis and intelligence. It was the judgment of the government - and rightly so - that the longer term proliferation and terrorism risks of leaving Saddam's weapons of mass destruction in place outweighed the shorter term risks addressed in the JIC report. That was the basis of the government's decision. It is a decision that I stand by, and I stand by it unconditionally. The government was open about these risks. For example, on 24 March, in response to a question from none other than the Leader of the Opposition, I noted that threat levels against Australian interests in a number of countries, especially in the Middle East, had been raised because of the war in Iraq - that is what I told the parliament. I said then, and I repeat now: the government has been open and transparent about threats to Australian interests through the DFAT travel advisories.Also I make this very important observation to the parliament, which goes directly to what the Leader of the Opposition is trying to get at: all five of my major speeches on Iraq were checked for accuracy by the Office of National Assessments and any suggestions for changes from the Office of National Assessments were accepted by me. I am referring there to my statement to the House on 4 February, my statements on 18 March and 14 May, my National Press Club speech on 14 March and my address to the Australian people on 20 March.The government stands by its judgment that removing Iraq's weapons of mass destruction would reduce the threat posed by terrorists over the longer term by making it less likely that WMD would fall into the hands of terrorists. It was very much a judgment of the government about the medium and longer term risks of proliferation and terrorism. It is the responsibility of intelligence agencies to make assessments; it is the responsibility of governments to make decisions. And I would remind the Leader of the Opposition to understand the distinction between representations which are made by governments about the nature of intelligence assessments and judgments made by governments as to what to do consequent upon those assessments. We made an assessment. We stand by that assessment; we do not apologise for that judgment. We did not mislead the Australian people. It so happens that we made a different judgment from that of the Australian Labor Party, and apparently it remains the judgment of the Australian Labor Party that Saddam should have been left in authority. That is not the judgment of the Australian people, and it never will be.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Moore for his question. It allows me the opportunity, against the background of some criticism made by members of the medical professional over the weekend about the government's responses on this issue, to put the matter into some better perspective. I start by saying that I recognise the great contribution of the medical profession to our country, I recognise the disabilities under which many specialities are operating at the present time because of increased insurance premiums, and I recognise the particular challenges faced by many general practitioners within the Australian community. Over the last 18 months, the government has implemented a comprehensive package to make medical indemnity insurance more affordable, to put the industry on a more secure footing and to keep doctors in the work force. The government had nothing to do with creating the recent medical indemnity insurance problem. The problem is a product of two things. It is a product of an unsustainable tort law regime, which is almost exclusively the responsibility of the states and territories in this country, and it is also a product of the bad management of the largest insurer, UMP. Notwithstanding the fact that it is a product of those two forces - neither of which the federal government were in any way responsible for - we have provided a very significant and generous taxpayer funded support package. It includes a financial commitment of more than $350 million over five years in the form of subsidies for specialists with relatively high medical premiums; a high-cost claims scheme for settlements over $2 million; the IBNR indemnity scheme - a scheme to meet 100 per cent of damages above $20 million; enhanced prudential supervision of medical defence organisations; and increased monitoring of premiums through the ACCC. We also continue to work with the states and territories to bring the laws of negligence back into balance with both public expectations and opinion.In August we announced the details of the IBNR indemnity scheme to apply to UMP members only. I take this opportunity to say that it is misleading and inaccurate for any member of the medical profession to call this a tax. It is designed to shore up a situation caused in no way by decisions of the government and in no way by neglect of the government but by the operation of a tort law regime that is increasingly out of whack and also by the bad management of UMP. Without the IBNR indemnity scheme, UMP would probably have been placed into full liquidation, leaving doctors personally liable to meet claims.In response to the concerns of doctors, we have exempted retired doctors aged over 65 and earning less than $5,000 in medical income per year. That is at a cost of $120 million over 10 years. Four out of five doctors paying the levy will pay less than $1,500 per annum, and this amount on top will be tax deductible. This package is designed to ensure that key private medical services are maintained throughout Australia and to improve the safety and affordability of insurance for doctors. By any measure, far-reaching reforms have been implemented and very generous taxpayer funded assistance provided.I understand the challenges faced by the medical profession, but I ask them not to misunderstand and misrepresent to the Australian public the circumstances that led to the collapse of UMP. It was not the fault of the Commonwealth government; it was an accumulation of factors - the major ones being the mismanagement of the fund and also the faltering and increasingly out-of-date negligence laws. It is the responsibility of the Commonwealth to give leadership to the states and territories, which we have done through the Assistant Treasurer, to reform the tort law. By any measure, far-reaching reforms have been implemented and very generous taxpayer funded assistance provided. I look forward to working closely with the medical profession to implement the elements of this package.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, I have already indicated through you to the Leader of the Opposition that, although the particular JIC report was not, as is the normal custom, itself drawn to my attention, it clearly -  - The Leader of the Opposition -  - plainly misunderstands the way in which the transmission of these documents occurs. What happens is that a very large number of assessments are received from our intelligence partners, and those assessments are obviously watched and considered very closely by our intelligence agency. They clearly inform the advice that is ultimately given by our intelligence agencies to the government. But there is nothing inconsistent with that and my statement. - The Leader of the Opposition can guffaw as much as he likes, but it does not alter that fact. It remains the case that, in all of these things, there are assessments made by the intelligence agencies. Of course there were short-term risks. That is why we issued a travel advisory warning of a heightened risk to Australian interests in certain Middle East areas.On 24 March, I indicated that the threat levels had been raised. You do not raise threat levels unless there is, in the short term at least, an assessment that you ought to do so. But the Leader of the Opposition seems incapable of understanding the difference between a short-term assessment of a heightened risk because of the conflict and a longer term judgment you make about proliferation and the potential passing of weapons of mass destruction to terrorist organisations.It was our judgment that it was in Australia's interests to be associated with an effort to remove from Saddam Hussein the opportunity of passing weapons of mass destruction to terrorist organisations. That was our judgment. It was a judgment correctly based, and it was a judgment properly formed. As evidence that it was not contrary to the intelligence assessments made by the agencies, the major statements I made on this issue were in fact cleared by the Office of National Assessments. The five major statements I made were cleared by the Office of National Assessments.I again invite the Leader of the Opposition to try and understand the difference between misrepresenting the nature of intelligence assessments and having a legitimate disagreement about what you should do in the light of those assessments. It so happens that we thought getting rid of Saddam was the right thing to do. You thought leaving him there was the right thing to do. That is the difference, and that will always be the difference in the eyes of Australian people. - </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Cook for his question, and I appreciate his concern to help the former Ansett workers living in his electorate. I can assure the member for Cook and other members that this is the first government in Australia's history to put in place a strong scheme of protection of worker entitlements. If workers lose their jobs and entitlements because of the insolvency of their employers, this government guarantees that workers will receive 100 per cent of unpaid wages, 100 per cent of any pay in lieu of notice, 100 per cent of annual leave, 100 per cent of long service leave and redundancy up to the community standard of eight weeks.This government has paid $336 million to former Ansett workers. That is $336 million more than workers would have received under the policies of the former government. Nearly 13,000 former Ansett workers have received, on average, $26,000 each as a result of the government's scheme. Nearly all of those workers were paid by the end of January 2002, and not one of those workers would have yet received a single cent had they been operating under the former government's policy. I point out to the House that responsibility for paying redundancies for a period of over eight weeks is the sole business of the company and its administration, but I am advised that additional payments to Ansett workers are being held up because of a legal dispute between representatives of two groups of workers.There have been claims that the government is double-dipping. I assure the House that there is no double-dipping, and I repeat the pledge which has been given again and again by ministers in this government - that any surplus from the ticket levy will be given to the tourism industry. There are few more stressful experiences than to lose your job and entitlements. This government understands the predicament that Ansett workers have found themselves in, and this government will continue to protect the workers of Australia in their time of need.</DOC>

 - I have already indicated that the chief assessment itself was not - and this is in accordance with normal practice - itself passed to my office or to me. I understand it was not passed to other ministers, but I would have to check to be absolutely certain about that. It was certainly not passed to me, because it is not normal practice for that to occur. But it is further my understanding - and I know this to be the case - that documents such as that would have gone into the mix and would clearly have informed the advice that we received. That is the position.I repeat that it was the judgment of the government. Governments are elected to make judgments, and if they make the wrong judgments the people punish them. That is what democracy is all about. My obligation as Prime Minister was, on the basis of the information available to us but also on the basis of other assessments, to make a judgment about what was in Australia's national interest. I accept that the Labor Party reached a different conclusion. I accept that the Labor Party did not want us to join the coalition action against Saddam Hussein. I understand that. They never made any secret about it, and to this day they have not repudiated that position. I understand that, and in the great democracy that is Australia that is the right of the Australian Labor Party. I do not contest it for a moment. I assert that it is not only my right but also my responsibility as the leader of the government to make a judgment about what is in the longer term interests of this country. And it was the judgment of the government - and rightly so - that the longer term proliferation and terrorism risks of leaving Saddam's weapons in place outweighed the shorter term risks addressed in the JIC report. The JIC report added nothing particularly new to the total mix of things. The Leader of the Opposition can develop a lather as often as he likes, but it does not alter the fact that judgments were formed, assessments were made, and the JIC report obviously made a contribution to that. Can I remind the Leader of the Opposition that he asked me a question on 24 March this year - I have the full text of it. It was a question about travel advisories and, quite properly so, about appropriate warnings to the Australian people. In the course of that answer I had this to say:... threat levels against Australian interests in a number of countries overseas - especially in the Middle East - have been raised because of the war in Iraq.In other words I was saying on 24 March that, because of the war in Iraq, in the short term the threat levels had to be raised in relation to Australian interests. Is that disguising anything? - He says, `What about here?' I am glad you interjected with that - I thought you would - because I went on to say that the overall threat level in Australia has not changed. - Well, what are you asking me questions for? - The overall threat level has not changed since the beginning of the war in Iraq. That is why we did not raise the warning in Australia: because the security advice was that the threat level in Australia had not been lifted as a result in the war in Iraq but the short-term risk to Australian interests in the Middle East had. That is why we raised the travel advisories. That perhaps will help to inform the Leader of the Opposition on the difference between the short-term potential retaliatory consequences of military action and the longer term goal of preventing the proliferation of weapons and thereby reducing the possibility of a massive terrorist attack in Australia.Let me repeat again what I said at the time of the debate. I said that our view was that, if a country like Iraq were not denied weapons of mass destruction, other countries would seek also to have those weapons. And the more rogue states that had those weapons, the greater would be the opportunity for those weapons to fall into the hands of terrorists. That is the judgment the government made. I stand by that judgment. I believe it was the right judgment, and I believe it was a judgment supported by the Australian people.</DOC>

 - I know the member for Maranoa knows that no government in history has done more to assist farmers during a drought than this coalition government has during this drought. It has been a magnificent effort to provide support to farmers at a time when they need it, and I am pleased to tell the House today that another 6,500 farms around Australia will benefit from the latest announcements of exceptional circumstances assistance. Three thousand farmers, graziers, horticulturalists and intensive livestock producers in the Burnett region will be able to claim EC support. This declaration will include cattle, dairy, pig and some perennial horticultural producers, as well as croppers who can demonstrate that they have had two failed crops, and it covers the Upper Brisbane Valley, the South Burnett and the Eastern Burnett subregions. In addition, pig producers in the south-east Queensland EC area are also eligible to receive full EC assistance. This means two years of income support and interest subsidies of up to $100,000 a year for two years. I am sure that the member for Blair, the member for Hinkler and other members in that area will be very pleased that this assistance is being provided to farmers in that region.The farmers of the Darling Downs, in the electorates of the honourable member for Maranoa and the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources, have also been receiving exceptional circumstances support for the past two years. But their benefits have expired, and I am pleased to announce today that the government has accepted a recommendation from the National Rural Advisory Council that EC benefits should continue for a further 12 months in that region. There has clearly not been a full recovery in the region. Indeed, the dry weather of the last two or three weeks is adding to the concerns there. There are about 3,500 farmers in that region who will potentially benefit from these announcements.I might also add that small businesses in EC declared areas are also eligible for assistance from this government and that interest rate relief will help small businesses through the drought, because we know that they are also adversely affected in times when incomes stop flowing in to the farm sector. Over 23,000 applications for financial support under EC and the 9 December package have now been approved, and 6,700 applications for interest rate subsidies have also been approved. The federal government is currently paying out about $10 million a week in assistance to drought-stricken Australian farmers.Of course, that contrasts very markedly with the efforts of the states. Today we are announcing support for another 6,500 Queensland farmers. What has the Queensland government provided to assist these farmers over the years? Precious little. The minister, Henry Palaszczuk, has boasted that they provided $7 million in assistance over five years. So Queensland has provided $7 million over five years - it only takes the Commonwealth four days to deliver to Australian farmers what Queensland has taken five years to produce. That is a clear demonstration of the states' real lack of commitment to supporting their farmers.Across the border I am sure the members for Parkes, Riverina and Farrer and the Deputy Prime Minister would be interested to know that another group of farmers in New South Wales have had their drought assistance stripped away by the state government. Farmers who live in the areas of the Broken Hill, Brewarrina, Gloucester, Molong, Murray, Narrabri, Riverina and Wagga rural lands protection boards have all been told: `No more assistance from the state government. For you, the drought's over. The paltry aid we were providing has been ended.' It is very disappointing that the states should continue to place so little emphasis on ensuring that farmers are able to see their way through this difficult drought. The Commonwealth continues to stand by them, and today's announcements demonstrate our deep and abiding commitment to ensuring that the rural sector is able to recover from these tough times and contribute once again to our national economy. </DOC>

 - Without checking, what I can tell the Leader of the Opposition is that the Australian intelligence community, as part of the government's prudent contingency planning, undertook various assessments of what could go wrong in the event of conflict in Iraq. In framing these assessments, the Australian agencies drew upon JIC reports - to put it another way, they were part of the mix - as well as a range of other analysis and intelligence. It was the judgment of the government, and rightly so, that the longer term proliferation and terrorism risks of leaving Saddam's weapons in place outweighed the shorter term risks addressed in the JIC report. That was our judgment. The Labor Party can attack that judgment. They can say we should not have joined the Americans and the British, but it does not alter the judgment that I and the rest of my colleagues in the government made. It is a judgment that I am prepared to be assessed by the Australian people about. I have never run away from the commitment that our government made to the coalition to disarm Saddam Hussein. - I resume what I was saying. I have never run away from the judgment that was made. It was a judgment that was difficult to make at the time but one that I believed was in the longer term interests of the Australian community. On that, I remind the Leader of the Opposition of something else I said, when he asked me a question on 24 March this year. I said this:I want to make one final point, Mr Speaker, that no self-respecting country can allow its policies to be dictated by the threat of terrorism. That is not something that I believe. I believe that Australians would not want their government to fashion or dictate policy according to the threat of terrorism. The issue of terrorism and the potential threats of terrorism remain an issue in the ongoing debate about the government's decision to commit military forces to Iraq. It is the government's very strong view that Australia's involvement in Iraq is directed at reducing the threat of terrorism, and over the longer term it will do that.That is what I said on 24 March. That was our judgment then and it remains my judgment. In reaching that judgment, of course the government had before it a variety of assessments from our intelligence agency. And those assessments, as I have already said, would have been informed by reports such as that of the Joint Intelligence Committee of the British intelligence system, which was received on 10 February.  Let me remind the Leader of the Opposition that it is the role of the government to receive assessment. It is our responsibility to make judgments based on those assessments. In the end, any government worth its salt will make its own assessment, based on what it believes to be the long-term interests of this nation. It was my view then that, in the medium to longer term, the action we took would reduce the threat of terrorism and reduce the potential for a massive attack on this country. It was my view then, it remains my view, and nothing - least of all anything that the Leader of the Opposition says - is going to shake that conviction.  - I was quoting from two documents. One of them is marked `confidential' and the other is an excerpt from Hansard with a couple of underlinings by me on it. I am perfectly happy to table that, although I would like a copy back as soon as possible because I might have to quote it again.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Casey for his question and also for his very strong advocacy for automotive parts industries in Lilydale and Kilsyth in his electorate. This year the Howard government will invest $684 million specifically in support of apprentices and trainees, a 16 per cent increase on last year. It is obviously having an impact.Last week the National Centre for Vocational Education Research released the latest figures for apprentices and trainees in Australia. There are now 396,000 Australians - more than half of them young people - in apprenticeships and traineeships throughout Australia, an 11 per cent increase to the end of 30 June in the last year alone. In addition to that, 268,000 Australians commenced an apprenticeship or traineeship last year. That represents an eight per cent increase over the last year. Importantly, completions - those who finished their apprenticeship - reached 121,000, which is a 14 per cent increase. Perhaps one of the most pleasing figures is that six per cent of those who started an apprenticeship last year did so in a traditional trade. Especially important for a school system that has been obsessed with sending young people to universities, five per cent of those who begin an apprenticeship now do so in a school.I was asked about alternative policies. It has been a week since I challenged the federal Australian Labor Party to raise any kind of objection to or concern with measures announced in the New South Wales state Labor budget which will have a serious impact on the participation of young people, in particular, in apprenticeships. There has been a $47 million tax applied to employers trying to take on apprentices and trainees in New South Wales with the removal of a workers compensation exemption. Members of the Labor Party might appear to be uninterested, but I challenge any member to go and spend a little bit of time with a group training company trying to find an apprenticeship for a young person, a person with a disability, an Aboriginal person or a mature age worker. What the New South Wales government has done will impact on those looking for apprenticeships. In addition to that, not a word has been said by the Australian Labor Party about the 300 per cent increase in up-front compulsory TAFE fees being levied by the New South Wales Labor government on young people trying to get support for their apprenticeships or traineeships. This government is absolutely determined to support, with both philosophy and policy, career and training and life-changing opportunities for young Australians in apprenticeships and traineeships. These figures should be celebrated, because behind them are training, career and life-changing opportunities for young Australians.</DOC>

 - In answer to the honourable member for Calare, I can confirm that my department has commissioned consultants to do some work on the supply chain and, in particular, on the various elements between the farm gate and the supermarket shelf. This is routine work that will update some of the work that we have done in the past in those sorts of areas and also similar work that has been done by the ACCC and other industry and community organisations. The intention is to look specifically at where the costs are incurred in the supply chain and how the value adding leads to the increase between the cost at the farm gate and what is paid for by consumers. - It is not intended that that examination will look at specific irregularities. If there are irregularities, that is a matter that should be pursued under the law or, alternatively, through the ACCC. This is an information-gathering exercise, not an attempt to seek to identify irregularities with a view to some kind of prosecution or action in that regard. If this study uncovers information that requires further action, we will obviously take that action. But it is not intended to be a forensic type look at the activities of individual companies or organisations.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Blair for his question. I can assure him that the Howard government has helped to bring unemployment down to 5.8 per cent, which is a 13-year low. Also, its policies are helping to encourage record numbers of Australians to join the work force. This government believes that the best form of welfare is work and the most effective way to tackle poverty is to encourage more people into sustainable jobs.Last week, the Australian Bureau of Statistics released new figures showing that 74.2 per cent of all Australians aged between 15 and 69 had worked at some point in the 12 months to February 2003. This is the highest percentage of people in the work force ever recorded. Notwithstanding this success, there are still too many people of working age who rely on social security for the majority of their income. In particular, there are far too many people on the disability support pension with little likelihood of ever re-entering the work force. In any one year, just two per cent of disability support pensioners find full-time employment. When he was on the backbench, fixing the disability support pension was one of the member for Werriwa's big crusades. - He said then:Something ... needs to be done about the outrageous growth in the Disability Support Pension ... which is now paid to more than 550,000 Australians. It is being used as a way of shifting people off the dole and artificially lowering the unemployment rate. - He still thinks it is true. He went on to say - and I presume he still thinks this is true:I think blind Freddy out there in Australia can see that we don't have one out of eight Australian men in their fifties disabled, totally incapable of work ... Everyone knows that the system is being abused ... The whole emphasis of welfare policy should be much more on capacity than incapacity.That is what the member for Werriwa said, and he is quite right. Like the member for Werriwa, this government wants to emphasise what people can do, not what they cannot do. Incredibly, given the views of the member for Werriwa, modest changes to the disability support pension arrangements from the budget before last are still blocked in the Senate. The member for Werriwa has a serious credibility problem here - you cannot campaign for something on the back bench and then ignore it when you are on the front bench. The member for Werriwa lacks either integrity or authority. Either he did not believe what he said then or he lacks the capacity to persuade his colleagues to do what he wants. The member for Werriwa says that he wants the Labor Party to be the party of economic responsibility. There is a simple test for the member for Werriwa: persuade the Labor Party to change its views on the disability support pension. If the member for Werriwa cannot persuade his colleagues on this point, he lacks the capacity to be an effective shadow Treasurer - and he will have proven that he is much better at muscling up to Sydney taxidrivers than he is at taking on his own colleagues.</DOC>

 - In answer to the Leader of the Opposition, let me just repeat what I have previously said. I am indebted to the Leader of the Opposition for asking me to answer the question, which I will resume doing. I am advised that on 10 February the JIC assessment on Iraq and terrorism was received by the relevant Australian agencies. I am further advised that JIC reports are not normally passed to ministers, and I can confirm that this particular JIC report was not brought to my attention or that of my office. I repeat that, even if it were - I ask the Leader of the Opposition to actually listen carefully to the answer and he will realise that I am fully addressing the issue that he has raised - there is nothing new in the JIC report. The Australian intelligence community, as part of the government's prudent contingency planning, undertook various assessments of what could go wrong in the event of conflict in Iraq. In framing these assessments - and this is the bit I ask the Leader of the Opposition to listen to carefully - Australian agencies drew upon JIC reports as well as a range of other analysis and intelligence. It was the judgment of the government, and rightly so, that the longer term proliferation and terrorism risks of leaving Saddam's weapons of mass destruction in place outweighed the shorter term risks addressed in the JIC report. In other words, of course the JIC report was part of a whole paraphernalia of material that informed the assessments that we received. Those assessments canvassed risks. Indeed, one of the reasons we lifted the level of alert in the travel advisory after the war had started in Iraq was those short-term risks. We did not disguise that. I told the parliament on 24 March in answer to a question from the selfsame Leader of the Opposition. I ask the Leader of the Opposition to remember again that, in the end, it is governments that make decisions and make judgments. We make those judgments on the basis of all the assessments we receive, and inevitably in difficult situations such as Iraq there are conflicting assessments. Nothing is 100 per cent one way and nought per cent the other way. Of course there were risks assessed on both sides. We made a judgment that in the medium to longer term the cause of limiting or preventing proliferation and the cause of reducing the risk of weapons of mass destruction falling into the hands of terrorists would be aided by our joining the coalition led by the United States. That was the judgment we made then. I remain steadfast in my view that it was the right judgment in the Australian national interest.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Makin for her important question. She is a great advocate for small business in the Adelaide region. It is not often that I give a wrap to a member of the opposition. It is not a habit that we want to create. We recognise that Barney Cooney was a one-off. But I think I might have found another one and I want to give the member for Hunter a bit of a wrap. Not only is he a pretty handy half-back for the parliamentary rugby team; importantly, he occasionally calls it as he sees it. We on this side of the House will be forever grateful for this observation by the member for Hunter on The Small Business Show when he recounted a conversation he had with a small business woman. - The member for Hunter recounted a conversation he had with a small business woman. He said: ... she could afford to put on one person or would like to put on one more person, but is fearful of unfair dismissals, she is fearful of going through the barrier to another level of red tape and regulation.We recognise that the member for Hunter was telling the truth. He was being honest. He was saying that he had met a small business woman who said that, if not for the unfair dismissal provisions that exist at the moment, she would employ another person. In part in response to that, the coalition said, `We want to introduce an exemption from unfair dismissal legislation for small business.' We have put that legislation to the parliament on 18 occasions, and on a total of 36 occasions - in both the House of Representatives and the Senate - the Labor Party have voted against it.If we can exempt Australia's 1.1. million small businesses from the unfair dismissal legislation, it will, on some of the most conservative estimates, create an additional 50,000 jobs. And we believe in job creation on this side of the House. We want lower unemployment rates, we want more people in jobs and we want small business to thrive. Just as that small business woman said to the member for Hunter, it is important that we give small business the opportunity to grow. So we do not understand why the Labor Party continue to pretend to be the friend of small business. They have had the opportunity to vote in favour of small business in the Senate. When it comes to unfair dismissal legislation, on 18 separate occasions they have rejected the initiative. Labor can have all the inquiries they want in the Senate into a range of different matters, from the Trade Practices Act to late payments for small business, but when push comes to shove the only parties prepared to put the interests of small business ahead of the interests of the unions are the Liberal and National parties.</DOC>

 - What I said was that the threat to Australia as such had not increased. - That is what I said, and I have not admitted anything to the contrary. - You are misrepresenting that I have admitted something to the contrary. - What I said - and I am reading from my answer to the Leader of the Opposition - was:... threat levels against Australian interests in a number of countries overseas - especially in the Middle East - have been raised because of the war in Iraq. The government has been totally open and transparent about this through ... travel advisories. The Leader of the Opposition asked me how I informed the Australian people of this. - I would have thought that informing the Australian people is represented by the Prime Minister answering a question in the House of Representatives from the Leader of the Opposition. The Leader of the Opposition asked me a question on 24 March, and I said that threat levels against Australian interests had been raised because of the war in Iraq. You could not be more black and white, more transparent, than that. In the same answer I made it perfectly clear that we had no intelligence suggesting that the general threat level in relation to Australia needed to be raised. I ask the Leader of the Opposition to understand the difference between heightened threats to Australian interests in Middle Eastern countries because of the war in Iraq and the lack of intelligence suggesting a heightened security risk to Australia as a whole. I made that very clear.The Leader of the Opposition asked me to say how I informed the Australian people. I informed the Australian people as I am informing the Australian people now - through the national parliament. I do not know how else I can do it. Does the Leader of the Opposition suggest that somehow or other this is not a way to inform the Australian people? The reality is that the Leader of the Opposition formed a different judgment about what ought to be done about Saddam Hussein from the judgment I formed. I accept that - that was his right - and the Australian people will in due course form their judgment about the respective assessments that have been made. I remain of the view that the judgment made by the Australian government back in March was right, and nothing that I have seen or heard since alters that conviction.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Herbert for his question. I was delighted, not so long ago, to visit his electorate to meet with aged and community care providers and also visit the medical school at James Cook University. In response to the honourable member's question, the government is committed to ensuring that older Australians receive the services they need in the important transition to home after a stay in hospital. Indeed, I was pleased to announce recently that the Townsville Innovative Care Rehabilitation Service pilot in the honourable member for Herbert's electorate will provide 24 additional flexible care places over two years, worth some $1.3 million in Australian government funding.Earlier this year the Prime Minister announced the new $253 million Pathways Home program, which will help older people leaving hospital to return home. This program provides one-off funding of over a quarter of a billion dollars over a five-year period to assist the states and territories in upgrading their infrastructure for rehabilitation and step-down care. This will assist older people to return home after hospital. New South Wales is receiving $86 million; Victoria, $63 million; Queensland, $45 million; Western Australia, $23 million. There is, of course, funding to the other states as well.  In addition to these programs, the government is also meeting the needs of older Australians through the Innovative Care Rehabilitation Service pilots. This is in partnership with other stakeholders, including state and territory governments and approved age care providers. I recently announced an additional 483 flexible care places, which have been allocated to 19 pilot projects through the innovative pool for 2002-03. This is additional funding of $31 million for these projects. There are now 30 such pilots in operation throughout Australia, with 865 flexible age care places.With an ageing population, we would expect that a greater number of older patients will require acute and subacute hospital care. In contrast to these improvements in conditions and the provision of extra places and beds, the Labor state governments around Australia are closing hospital beds. The Beattie government in Queensland, where the honourable member's electorate is found, has closed 522 beds since it came to government. Premier Gallop in Western Australia has closed 115 hospital beds. Premier Bracks in Victoria has closed 92 acute care beds. Taking the cake, Premier Carr in New South Wales has closed 5,330 beds. </DOC>

 - I can only repeat what I have said earlier. Clearly, in the advice that we received from our intelligence agencies, there were assessments based on that analysis of shorter-term risks. We had to take them into account in making a judgment about the medium to longer-term prevention of the spread and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. I do not resile in any way from the judgment that I formed and that I communicated to the Australian people in that address to the nation. In the end, as the Leader of the Opposition will recall from the time that he had in government, governments receive varieties of advice from different sources. There are judgments, particularly in intelligence matters, that can be interpreted in a different fashion, depending upon the particular judgment that you make. I can only say to this House that at no stage did the government misrepresent the intelligence assessments we received. I accept it is a fact that the judgment we formed, based on those assessments, was different from what would have been the judgment of the Labor Party had it been the government. The Labor Party's view was that it should not absent another resolution from the United Nations. The House ought to be reminded that the Labor Party's view was, and remains, that absent a further resolution from the United Nations authorising action - although that was legally not necessary - no action should have been taken to remove Saddam Hussein. I think we can all conclude that, if the action taken by the coalition had not been taken, alternative action to remove Saddam would not have eventuated and that, as I speak, six months later -   - Saddam would still have been in charge of Iraq, with all of the horrors of that regime. I can only say again to the Leader of the Opposition and to this parliament that we made a judgment. That judgment was the correct judgment. It was in the long-term interests of this country. I have no doubt that the action we took has over the medium to longer term made a contribution to the prevention of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and thereby diminished over that time period the potential for those weapons to fall into the hands of terrorists. Before concluding my answer -  - I will tell the House that, contrary to what I said before, the Joint Intelligence Committee report was dated 10 February 2003, and it was received by our agencies on 18 February 2003.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Petrie for her question. As I recall, last year there was a participant in her electorate, a Mr Cameron Sharp, who was commended for his building of a web site at the Humpybong primary school. I am sure that there will be many other fine achievements out of that electorate in this coming round. - Mr Speaker, if it will help the member for Prospect the gentleman appears in this publication, Work for the Dole achievement awards 2002. He was recognised publicly not only in here but also by the Prime Minister and by his local member. He is a fine individual and we commend him for what he is doing, as does the gentleman who sits in front of the member for Prospect, the member for Franklin, who understands the importance of recognising the work that is being done by those people who are helping in the community. The Work for the Dole awards open today. I would say to the member for Prospect: get in there, have a look around your electorate, go and visit some of those Work for the Dole projects. I am sure the Speaker has visited, and I can confidently say that every member on this side of the House has visited, Work for the Dole projects and has complimented those individuals involved and the community on the work they are doing. I know there are a few closet Work for the Dole devotees on that side. I encourage them to come out of the closet, to put their names forward and to recommend the community groups.   - The member for Ballarat will no doubt tell you about the fine work done by the local Work for the Dole project that built a house and then donated $100,000 to charity as a result of that fantastic work.The Prime Minister's Work for the Dole awards are about acknowledging individuals and communities, and they have been launched today. We are encouraging anyone in the community - you do not have to be a member of parliament; you can be a member of the gallery or anyone anywhere in this country - that if you see a fine piece of work done as a Work for the Dole project, get onto www.workplace.gov.au, have a look and recommend someone. Show them that you are interested and you are positive about what they are doing. Last year the member for Solomon had a Work for the Dole project in Darwin - learning all about the aspects of child care, and giving participants a worthwhile experience - as did the member for McPherson. Hopefully the member for McPherson is here at the moment. Her Work for the Dole project is helping people with disabilities. All of these local members understand the significance of Work for the Dole and the role it has played in the life of 250,000 Australians as they have participated in more than 14,000 wonderful community activities right around this country.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, in answer to the Leader of the Opposition, it is true that in my speech on 4 February I made reference to the Joint Intelligence Committee. It does not automatically follow from that -  - It does not follow from that that I had read and seen all of that report. It is perfectly possible that I had been advised by my intelligence agencies, the Australian ones, that the British had made certain conclusions. That was included in the speech of 4 February on that basis and certified as accurate by the Office of National Assessments, so the whole basis of the Leader of the Opposition's question, as usual, is insubstantial. </DOC>

 - I observe, as my colleagues on this side of the House will observe, that this question has come from a man whose policies, if followed by others, would have left Saddam Hussein in power in Baghdad. Let us understand the context of this questioning. If the advice of the Australian Labor Party had been adopted by this government, by the American administration, by the British government and by others, then inevitably Saddam Hussein would still be in power in Iraq with all of the implications of that for the Iraqi people. The Leader of the Opposition may not like being reminded of this, but it is the cold, brutal reality. The Leader of the Opposition chose to hide behind the seeking of another United Nations resolution, instead of having the courage to declare as a matter of principle where the Australian Labor Party stood. I repeat to the Leader of the Opposition, as I did yesterday, that governments receive many intelligence assessments. In the end, it is governments and not intelligence agencies that make judgments. It is not intelligence agencies that make judgments; it is in fact governments. Let me refer to some words uttered not by the Chairman of the Joint Intelligence Committee of the United Kingdom and not by some agency of another country but by somebody who is well known and well respected on both sides of the parliament in Australia - that is, the Director-General of ASIO, Mr Dennis Richardson. He is a man whose advice on security matters should be listened to by this government and, indeed, by any serving Australian government - more than the views of any other person. In a speech that he gave to the Security in Government Conference on 30 April 2003, Dennis Richardson, the Director-General of ASIO, said:It is still too early to judge what, if any, interplay there might be between the war in Iraq and terrorism.Let me repeat that; he said:It is still too early to judge what, if any, interplay there might be between the war in Iraq and terrorism. But we can be certain that, apart from adding to its rhetoric of justification, the war will be irrelevant to the intent and purpose of the al-Qa'ida network. They killed innocent civilians before the war in Iraq and will seek to do so again. Let me remind the parliament of the rationale used by the government for the decision to commit to Iraq. Our argument then, and it remains our argument now, was that if nations such as Iraq -  - Our rationale was that, if rogue states such as Iraq were allowed to retain the weapons our intelligence assessments told us they had, other rogue states would seek to do the same thing and, as more states were in that situation, the possibility of those weapons falling into the hands of terrorists would multiply. That was the rationale. Nothing in the JIC report and nothing advanced by the Leader of the Opposition has altered that judgment or altered the soundness of the decision unconditionally taken by the Australian government.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, the short answer to that question is yes. I noticed yesterday that the Leader of the Opposition moved a censure motion. I apologise to the House for not being here, but the House is aware that I was at Don Willesee's funeral. In that motion, the Leader of the Opposition said:We have before the parliament now conclusive information that the basis upon which the Prime Minister justified taking this country to war was a lie.This is an argument based on a British Joint Intelligence Committee assessment - a sort of `British is best' approach by the Australian Labor Party. The government took numerous measures to inform Australians of this risk before the war with Iraq began. I am surprised that the opposition - particularly the Leader of the Opposition - has deliberately and wantonly misled this parliament by not referring to that.The member for Moore, who is a very fine member from Perth -  - `A nice man,' says the Leader of the Opposition. He will not be putting that around at the next election if he knows you think he is a nice man. - On 10 February, the member for Moore - and this is central to the question that the member for Barker has asked - asked me a question at 2.17 p.m. I quote:My question is addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Would the minister update the House on the government's arrangements to ensure the safety and welfare of Australians in the Middle East?This was on 10 February, which was clearly over a month before the war in Iraq began. - Mal, you should listen because you might find this a little interesting. In my answer I quoted from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade's general advice to Australian travellers, which was issued on 5 February. The Leader of the Opposition knows this because he was in question time on 10 February. He knows what I said.  - You do listen to every word, I know, because you often quote them back to us. Now I am going to quote them back to you. - I said:Australians should also be aware of the possible use of chemical and biological weapons in any conflict against Iraq, and take precautions if they have concerns about their security from such threats in consultation with their employers and local authorities.The advice went on, as I explained to the House of Representatives on that date:There would also be heightened potential for terrorist activity and civil unrest in the event of conflict in Iraq.The Leader of the Opposition has spent two days trying to convince the Australian public that somehow the Prime Minister misled the public about a possible terrorist attack and an upgrading of the terrorist risk in the event of a war against Iraq. The fact is that is completely untrue. What the Leader of the Opposition said is completely untrue, and he knows it is untrue because he was sitting in the House of Representatives on that day - on 10 February - when I explained precisely that point to the House of Representatives and to the Australian people.But that was not the sole incident. On 23 February, on the Sunday program, I said:There's no doubt that Australians, as part of the broader Western community, are terrorist targets. We all know that from what happened in Bali .... But it is possible that a war against Iraq could lead to organisations like al-Qaeda adjusting the timetable of their terrorist actions.The Prime Minister has explained that the Director-General of ASIO made the same point. If you are going to come into the House of Representatives and allege that people are not telling the truth, make sure that, in doing so, you are telling the truth. The Leader of the Opposition has been quite untruthful in what he has said about government statements before the war in Iraq.</DOC>

 - The foreign minister has already taken the Leader of the Opposition apart on the basis of what he said. The Leader of the Opposition has been exposed by the foreign minister as having deliberately misled this parliament and, through this parliament -   - We are very sensitive! - Mr Speaker, I withdraw that, and I am very happy to substitute it with the claim that the Minister for Foreign Affairs has exposed the falsity of the claim made by the Leader of the Opposition. - The falsity of the claim is demonstrated by the fact that it was made perfectly clear in March last year that, although - and I will come to the specifics - there was no heightened threat to Australia, there was a heightened threat to certain Australian interests in the Middle East because of the outbreak of the war. That was spelt out in our travel advisories and it was spelt out in the answer given by the Minister for Foreign Affairs to the member for Moore. But let me quote again from the speech on 30 April of this year from Dennis Richardson. Dennis Richardson, let me remind you, is the Director-General of ASIO. He is the senior adviser to this government on matters affecting the security of this country. This is what he had to say -  - at the beginning of his speech:Against the possibility of Australia's involvement in a war in Iraq, ASIO reviewed threat levels. We made a judgment that involvement in a war in Iraq would not, in the absence of credible and specific intelligence, warrant a raising of the overall threat level here in Australia.This was the judgment of the Director-General of ASIO. It was not John Howard's judgment or Alexander Downer's judgment, but it happened to correspond with the judgment that we had made. Of course we took into account the possibility of increased threats in the Middle Eastern area, but we also made the judgment that in the medium to longer term the national security of this country would be advanced by the removal of Saddam Hussein. That was a judgment that was different from the judgment of the Labor Party. The Labor Party formed a view that unless you got another resolution from the United Nations you did nothing about Saddam. The Labor Party and the Leader of the Opposition cannot escape the ugly reality that if their advice had been followed Saddam Hussein would still be running Iraq. That is the fundamental reality that the Leader of the Opposition finds uncomfortable, and I remind the Leader of the Opposition that he will constantly be reminded of that ugly reality if he continues this line of argument. - </DOC>

 - First, I thank the honourable member for Wannon for his question. I also wish to table the answer that I gave to the question from the member for Moore on 10 February and the travel advisory of 5 February. - I am sure you do not want to see them, but you will have to now. The government welcomes the report of the British parliamentary Intelligence and Security Committee into intelligence about Iraq's weapons of mass destruction program. - I was addressing the House on the matter of the British parliamentary Intelligence and Security Committee report into intelligence about Iraq's weapons of mass destruction program. The terms of reference were to examine whether available intelligence on Iraq's weapons of mass destruction was adequately and properly assessed and whether it was accurately reflected in the British government's publications, including its September 2002 dossier. This all-party committee of the House of Commons concluded:Based on the intelligence and the [Joint Intelligence Committee] Assessments that we have seen, we accept that there was convincing intelligence that Iraq had active chemical, biological and nuclear programmes and the capability to produce chemical and biological weapons. Iraq was also continuing to develop ballistic missiles. All these activities were prohibited under [United Nations Security Council resolutions].The British House of Commons committee rejected any suggestion that intelligence was - to use the British expression - `sexed up' for public use against Iraq. The Joint Intelligence Committee, which has been the subject of discussion in this House, was found not to have been subject to political pressure. The committee also found that the September dossier in Britain on Iraq's weapons of mass destruction had not been sexed up by the British government. The Intelligence and Security Committee concluded - and this has been an important part of the debate in Australia in recent times:... [the Secret Intelligence Service] continues to believe that the Iraqis were attempting to negotiate the purchase of uranium from Niger. We - that is, the parliamentary committee - have questioned the SIS about the basis of its judgement and conclude that it is reasonable.One of the claims made by the opposition against our own Prime Minister was that he had not told the truth about the Niger claim, but here we have a British House of Commons committee confirming the assessment made by the United Kingdom's Secret Intelligence Service, saying that the claim, which was of course published in Britain and the United States, was reasonable and drawing the attention of the public to the fact that the British Secret Intelligence Service - the British intelligence community - still stand by that claim. So, here again, one of the accusations made by the Leader of the Opposition against the Prime Minister has been found to be untrue. Let me conclude by making this point, because I think it is a useful one. I assume that the Leader of the Opposition, from all of his questions and from his censure motion yesterday, believes that all of the Joint Intelligence Committee's judgments are accurate. Is that what we can conclude? - The fact is that any reasonable person listening to the Leader of the Opposition -  - would conclude that the Leader of the Opposition believes that anything the Joint Intelligence Committee says is accurate. Therefore, we must conclude that the Leader of the Opposition now believes that there was convincing intelligence that Iraq had active chemical, biological and nuclear programs and the capability to produce chemical and biological weapons and that it also continued to develop ballistic missiles. Yet the Leader of the Opposition has been going around this country saying that the Prime Minister and the government lied about Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction programs. But if anybody is not telling the truth then I am afraid it has been exposed today - it is the Leader of the Opposition. It is the Leader of the Opposition who has not been telling the truth and who has been trying in desperation to run a political line which, once put under a little bit of forensic examination, is found to be totally vacuous.</DOC>

 - The Minister for Foreign Affairs has already explained, as I did yesterday, the content of the travel advisories that warned about the potential danger in particular Middle Eastern countries. I can only repeat, as I will, what I have said on earlier occasions, and that is that, in accordance with normal practice, the Joint Intelligence Committee report was only handed to Australia's intelligence agencies. I notice that yesterday the Leader of the Opposition - and he repeated it this morning on radio - dismissed the proposition that this document did not come to ministers. I also observed a number of the newspapers this morning, including the work of a columnist in one of the national broadsheets who I think knows more about security matters than the Leader of the Opposition does. One of this particular person's previous jobs was to work for the former Leader of the Opposition when, I think, he held a ministry in the Hawke government, and so this person is clearly better informed on these matters than the Leader of the Opposition is. The truth is that this document was not itself handed to me or to ministers. But, clearly, it would have -  - The reality is that this document was handed to our intelligence agencies, and in making its decision to commit our forces to war the government had available the assessments of our intelligence agency. We also had announced and stated publicly a speech made by Mr Dennis Richardson, the Director-General of ASIO. He made this speech on 17 February 2003. This is what he had to say:A war in Iraq, with or without UN sanction, may well influence the timing of some terrorist attacks.He went on:But of one thing we can be certain; a peaceful solution to the current situation will be irrelevant to bin Laden's intent and purpose.- Al-Qa'ida will seek to follow through on whatever it may be planning at present; and- Its targets of first choice will remain innocent civilians. - Mr Speaker, I thought the whole point of this was about the impact on terrorist threats of the decision to go to war in Iraq. I thought that is what it was all about, and I thought I was quoting from the Director-General of ASIO, who was addressing that very issue. - The Director-General of ASIO said:But of one thing we can be certain; a peaceful solution to the current situation will be irrelevant to bin Laden's intent and purpose.- Al-Qa'ida will seek to follow through on whatever it may be planning at present; and- Its targets of first choice will remain innocent civilians.That was from Mr Dennis Richardson on 17 February this year. The point he was making was, very simply, that the outbreak of the war would be irrelevant to the purposes of bin Laden, and I think that is very directly relevant to this whole issue. - I was quoting from some notes. - </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Robertson for his question and for the interest he shows in this very central issue; it is certainly occupying the attention of parliament. There is no doubt that the lives of the overwhelming majority of Iraqis, and especially children, are improved thanks to the removal of Saddam Hussein's brutal regime: health care is now accessible to all, not just the elite; vaccinations to treat 4.2 million children and 700,000 pregnant women are now being made available; doctors are being paid regularly; schools and universities have reopened; nearly 600 schools will be restored anew before the new term begins; and teachers are being paid four times as much as they were paid under Saddam Hussein's regime.I think - and certainly for us on this side of the House - it is particularly significant that the Iraqi people are living without fear of persecution by Saddam Hussein's henchmen. It is quite astonishing that 150 mass graves have been found in Iraq since the end of the war in Iraq, with the bodies of 300,000 people. That is testament to Saddam Hussein's brutality. Obviously, security is still a problem, especially in the Sunni triangle, north of Baghdad, but most of the country is stable and Iraqis are taking the lead in maintaining law and order: 60,000 Iraqis are now employed in the security services, and 37,000 Iraqis are employed in the police alone.Opinion polls were not often done in Iraq during the brutal regime of Saddam Hussein, but two opinion polls have been done in Iraq since the fall of this regime. Iraqis, for all the difficulties they are going through at this time, are overwhelmingly optimistic about their future. Polling shows that over 70 per cent of Iraqis believe they will be better off as a result of what has happened. A month or two ago there was an opinion poll by a British polling organisation which asked a very pertinent question - that is, whether the Iraqis wanted Saddam Hussein back. That begs the question: what percentage of Iraqis did want Saddam Hussein back? Twenty per cent? Fifty per cent? No. So low was the number that it was below 16 per cent - it was five per cent. That should give the Leader of the Opposition some hope - still 11 per cent to go! - The Leader of the Opposition interjects, but I heard on the news this morning that he has plumbed new depths, depths that I never reached. The coalition's removal of Saddam has strengthened international security. I never claimed to be terribly popular when I was Leader of the Opposition, but I was more popular than the current Leader of the Opposition is.  - I apologise, Mr Speaker. There is such a cacophony of interjection that I thought I should respond to a percentage of it. - The coalition of the willing's removal of Saddam Hussein has strengthened international security by removing once and for all the threat of Saddam's weapons of mass destruction, a threat acknowledged by the international community in Security Council resolution 1441. - The Leader of the Opposition asks: `Where are they?' I would have thought that the Joint Intelligence Committee report - your bible, apparently, in these matters - makes it perfectly clear that they did have them. I think that the government was right to participate in the coalition of the willing to remove Saddam Hussein's brutal regime. The honourable member for Robertson asked whether there was any alternative. I can answer that question very simply and quickly: the alternative was the one put forward by the Australian Labor Party, and that was an alternative which would have left Saddam Hussein in power and the Iraqi people at his mercy.</DOC>

 - The Minister for Foreign Affairs, quite properly, interjects that he thought the Leader of the Opposition was alleging that Saddam Hussein did not have any of these weapons. The reality is that the Leader of the Opposition has changed his position on this. Before the war started, the Leader of the Opposition said that he did believe that Saddam had weapons of mass destruction. That was the position of both the Leader of the Opposition and his spokesman on foreign affairs, the member for Griffith.The point I made yesterday, and I repeat it again today, is that in relation to potential threats to Australia and Australian interests we were completely open and transparent. Our responsibility is to address Australia's security risk and Australian interests. We made it perfectly clear that there was a heightened threat to Australian interests in the Middle East as a result of the outbreak of the war. That was reflected in travel advisories. It was adverted to by me in the House on 24 March. It was explicitly adverted to by the Minister for Foreign Affairs on 10 February. Mr Dennis Richardson, the Director-General of ASIO, drew attention to the fact - and I repeated it - that there had been no credible intelligence received justifying a lifting of the terror alert in Australia. In relation to Australian interests overseas, we made it clear that, because of the outbreak of the war, there was a heightened threat, and we were open. In relation to the general security threat to Australia, where there was no credible intelligence, there was no justification to lift the alert. Nothing can absolve the Leader of the Opposition from the fact that, in the lead-up to the Iraqi war, he did not have the courage to state a position based on his own belief. The problem with the Leader of the Opposition was that he sought to hide behind the seeking of another resolution from the United Nations - and everybody knows that, if that policy had been embraced by the Americans, by the British and by us, Saddam Hussein would still be running Iraq.</DOC>

 - The member for Curtin, as many members will know, was a member of the Commonwealth observer group in Zimbabwe and therefore has a greater first-hand knowledge than most of the totally fraudulent way in which President Mugabe purported to secure re-election as President of Zimbabwe. I say in reply to the member for Curtin that I am aware of the comments that were aired on the AM program this morning by a spokesman for the South African President, claiming that Australia was engaged in `megaphone diplomacy' on Zimbabwe. Everything that Australia has said about Zimbabwe in the time that I have been Prime Minister, and most particularly since the rorted election in Zimbabwe two years ago, far from being megaphone diplomacy, has been a plain statement of the truth.It is the case that Australia, along with many other countries, takes the view that President Mugabe should not be invited to attend the Commonwealth meeting in Abuja, in Nigeria, in December this year. It is my understanding that that is also the view of the host of that conference, President Obasanjo of Nigeria. I welcome the decision that has been taken by Nigeria not to extend an invitation to President Mugabe. Zimbabwe was, rightly, suspended from the councils of the Commonwealth in March last year, for the plain reason that Mugabe had rorted and rigged his way back to power in the elections that were the subject of the Commonwealth observer group. That was the judgment not of Australia acting alone or Britain acting alone; it was the judgment of a Commonwealth observer group made up of representatives of Commonwealth nations from all around the world.Following Zimbabwe's suspension, the government of Zimbabwe has, regrettably, done absolutely nothing to redress the concerns which led to its suspension. It has even refused to engage with the Secretary-General of the Commonwealth in a proper dialogue on the steps that Zimbabwe ought to take to have its suspension lifted. In these circumstances, it would be a travesty if Zimbabwe were to be represented at the Abuja meeting. I contrast the behaviour of Zimbabwe with the behaviour of Fiji, where after the two coups that occurred in that country there was a return to a democratic process. Fiji literally had the constitutional book thrown at it. Fiji did everything it was asked to do, and it has properly and honourably returned to the councils of the Commonwealth - the contrast with Mugabe, the contrast with Zimbabwe, could not be greater. I say to the member for Curtin and to all members of the House that what is happening in Zimbabwe today is a veritable tragedy. Its people are starving; their choice of government has been denied to them; their economy is in ruins with inflation running at 425 per cent, 5.5 million people dependent on food aid and unemployment estimated at 60 per cent to 70 per cent. Most members of the Commonwealth, and certainly Australia, believe that the people of Zimbabwe deserve better. At the recent Pacific Islands Forum meeting, the 11 member countries of that body that are also members of the Commonwealth unanimously expressed the view that, until there was evident action on the part of Zimbabwe to address these issues, Zimbabwe should remain suspended from the councils of the Commonwealth and should certainly not attend the Abuja meeting in December.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and note, I have to say with some approval, his attention to some areas that are of real concern to Australians at the moment, that I think they want to see us talking about in this place. I have a snapshot of a very interesting way in which the delivery of health, education and telecommunications can be brought together to produce better service delivery outcomes at a much reduced cost for Australians, particularly in regional areas. The snapshot relates to the provision by the Australian government of $5½ million from the National Communications Fund towards a quite revolutionary project in the north-west New England area of New South Wales. If it could be taken up and spread - though that would require the cooperation of the New South Wales state Labor government - it could bring similar benefits to the member for Parkes' electorate, to vast areas of other people's electorates and to the people who live in them. Telstra has won this particular contract, which involves a project incorporating the New England Area Health Service, the New England Institute of TAFE and the University of New England. It will deliver a high-speed broadband telecommunications network to eight TAFE sites, 10 University of New England sites and 31 health sites in the region, including towns from Tenterfield to Pilliga and from Mungindi to Walcha. This was the brainchild of the previous member for New England, who worked very hard to get it up and running. I am delighted to say that it is now coming together. So no less than 33 towns across an area probably the size of many European countries will benefit from this broadband network.It is expected to save the New England Area Health Service alone more than $800,000 in communication costs and $200,000 in travel costs a year. That is a cut of 45 per cent in their telecommunications budget alone. At the same time, it brings quite astonishing new service delivery outcomes to the region. For example, it brings direct access to specialists via videoconferencing with a definition level so high that I am advised that it would be possible, at least in theory - and we trust that this will be delivered in practical outcomes shortly - for somebody in a place as remote as Mungindi, a one-doctor town, coming to the local GP with, say, a skin problem which might be related to a skin cancer and looks a bit worrying, to have that checked by a specialist as far away as Tamworth, Wagga or, potentially, Sydney or even New York and possibly cleaned up then and there. They are astonishing service outcomes that are life saving and dramatically more economical than what are currently available.It will also allow young people to gain access to educational opportunities, tutorials, lectures or whatever via high-quality video-conferencing. It will give the areas the ability to attract and retain GPs, allied health workers and specialists, because they will have the backup and support they need and the practical ability to spend a lot more time out of motor cars and communicating via video hook-ups and so forth. It means that this is quite revolutionary and ground-breaking.Despite all the obvious benefits, including to the New South Wales Treasury, guess who would not give it their full support? The New South Wales government. The New England Area Health Service had to borrow $3 million so that they could save the New South Wales government a whole lot of money. But it does exemplify this government's partnership approach to using new technologies to giving better service, better education and better health outcomes at lower cost to country people. It is an outstanding example of what can be achieved by cooperation. If we could only get for the member for Parkes the help of the New South Wales government and get it serious about a partnership approach, we could roll this out right across the nation.</DOC>

 - I am surprised that the member for Cunningham did not address that question to the Minister for Education, Science and Training, who has just done a lot to help the University of Wollongong, which is doing a great deal to boost employment in that region. Obviously I regret the fact that unemployment in the Illawarra is still high, but I point out to the member for Cunningham that unemployment in the Illawarra, while consistently in double digits from the late eighties through to the mid-nineties, has at different times in recent years been as low as about seven per cent. This government is doing the right thing by the people of the Illawarra by putting in place economic policies which are going to deliver benefits to all Australians. While, as I said, I certainly take no pleasure at all in the fact that there are still too many people unemployed in the Illawarra, I am pleased that overall we have created more than one million new jobs, we have delivered very substantial sustained increases in real full-time average weekly earnings and we have gotten strikes down to the lowest level since records were first kept in 1913. Thanks to the Job Network, we have more employment service offices in more locations than ever before. I am confident that with a combination of continued good economic management and continued good delivery of employment services through the Job Network we will, in the future, do better for the people of the Illawarra than we have so far.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Ryan for his question. I join with the Prime Minister and all members of the government and, no doubt, all members of the House in congratulating Papua New Guinea on the 28th anniversary of its independence. There is a great and abiding affection in Australia for the country and the people of Papua New Guinea, obviously reflecting our geographic ties but also our very close historical and personal links.It is worth saying - because I do not think a lot of people understand this - that, despite its daunting challenges, much has been achieved in Papua New Guinea since independence. We are proud that Australia's assistance has contributed to improvements for the people of Papua New Guinea, though of course full credit must be given to the people of Papua New Guinea themselves. Life expectancy has increased since independence. Infant mortality has fallen. Interestingly enough, primary school enrolments in Papua New Guinea have doubled over the past decade. Also, Papua New Guinea has remained throughout its independent life a robust democracy. We ourselves are a robust democracy, and so obviously we very much appreciate that.As the Prime Minister and I and other ministers have said, we are fully aware that Papua New Guinea nevertheless faces some very significant challenges. With a population of almost 5 million people, Papua New Guinea's prosperity is obviously of great importance to stability in our region. We have put, as I think honourable members know, a number of different proposals to Papua New Guinea in recent times about ways of improving our partnership, including our development cooperation partnership. This includes in areas that Papua New Guinea has itself identified as priorities, such as law and order, good government, enhanced budgetary and expenditure controls, and so on. Tomorrow morning I will be going to Papua New Guinea and I look forward to discussing these issues with the foreign minister, Sir Rabbie Namaliu, with other ministers and with the Prime Minister. Our fundamental objective over the coming period is to assist Papua New Guinea in meeting its challenges in a way that promotes sound management of its own resources. While we are happy to conduct a joint review of the development cooperation treaty, our concerns are not about the way the current aid program is managed. Our dialogue and partnership should go beyond the narrower focus of the aid relationship, and it should also deal with the major issues of governance and management that confront this diverse and growing nation. I look forward to my visit to Papua New Guinea, and I am sure all members of the House hope that we can continue to build a productive relationship with Papua New Guinea which achieves ever better outcomes for the ordinary people of that country.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Jagajaga for her question. I should not be surprised that the question is not about expressing concern for the 300 per cent increase in TAFE fees by the New South Wales government at the Blacktown TAFE. Instead we have yet another question about universities. What this government is doing is recognising that, especially for this century and for Australia as a country with a relatively small population, it is important now that we reform Australian universities to prepare this country for the international benchmarks against which it is going to be judged.Apart from putting an extra $1½ billion of public money into Australian universities in the first four years and $10.6 billion in the first 10 years, the government is moving to fund those universities - with the support of almost all of Australia's universities - on the basis of what they actually do, the services and the courses that are provided by those universities. The University of Western Sydney, over a period of 13 years during which it was funded under the same formula, has reduced the provision of high-cost courses like agricultural science by some 23 per cent. At the same time, the University of Western Sydney has put almost all of its 1,550 new places into low-cost courses. As an example, agricultural science costs seven times more to provide than business administration, and those are the kinds of courses into which the University of Western Sydney has moved. Is it fair that the University of Western Sydney receives six per cent more than the University of Ballarat for providing the same course? The University of Western Sydney receives $8,005 for providing business administration, yet the University of Ballarat receives $7,591. I ask the member for Kingston: is it fair that Flinders University receives $7,569? What is happening is that this government is increasing the funding for all universities. Over the three years of the transition, the University of Western Sydney will receive $5.4 million from this government to ensure that it receives not one single dollar less; and from 2007 it will receive considerably more money. It is critically important that the Australian Labor Party recognises that, unless Australian universities are reformed now, universities are on a collision course with mediocrity and the next generation will pay a significant price for the obstruction of the Australian Labor Party.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kooyong for his question and I appreciate his interest in boosting employment, particularly in small business. This government believes in paying people more to keep their jobs; it does not believe in paying people more to lose their jobs. This government believes in encouraging people to employ rather than in encouraging people to retrench.The ACTU does have a test case currently before the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. The test case seeks to increase the standard redundancy entitlement to 16 weeks, and it seeks to extend redundancy payments to casual workers for the first time. For the first time, it seeks to require small business to pay redundancy costs. If granted, this test case will cost small business an additional $6,100 every time it needs to let someone go. If this test case application is successful, my department estimates that a small business with seven longstanding employees will face an immediate contingent liability of nearly $50,000. If there is anything that is likely to crush the spirit of small business - and to cause the member for Hunter's legendary small business constituency even more problems - it is this kind of test case application from the ACTU. When the Queensland Council of Unions launched a similar test case, the Queensland Labor government, to its credit, strongly opposed the extension of redundancy entitlements to small business. But we know where the Queensland Labor government stands; where does the federal Labor opposition stand? When the member for Werriwa was on the back bench, he was a fierce critic of the economic irresponsibility of the ACTU. He said, `Trade unionism in this country is in crisis. How can unions survive if they fail to appeal to people in newly created enterprises and workplaces?' He said, `Given a choice between two Scotsmen, we need to follow Adam Smith, not Doug Cameron.' The member for Werriwa has a serious credibility problem. How can he preach responsibility on the back bench, when he is not actually responsible for anything, and completely forget about it when he goes onto the front bench? Can the member for Werriwa point to a single Labor policy which has moved from economic irresponsibility to responsibility since he has become the shadow Treasurer? Here is a simple test for the member for Werriwa -   - I have a simple test for the member for Werriwa. If he wants to demonstrate his credentials for economic responsibility, he should persuade the Labor Party to oppose the ACTU's job-destroying redundancy test case claim and say no to this $1.6 billion a year tax on jobs.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Sydney for her question. Before I answer it, it should be fairly obvious to the House that the preoccupation of the Australian Labor Party is universities, universities and universities. They cannot even go to the ACTU National Congress and mention the word `apprentice'. - As the government has been reviewing Australian universities for the past year, I have been pointing out on behalf of the government a whole variety of real problems that face Australian higher education. Two of those many problems are, firstly, that the sector needs access to more money and a lot more of it in the long term; and, secondly, that the way in which we regulate and administer universities is as much a part of the problem as is the level of resourcing.One of the reasons why Australian students are packed into universities likes sardines is that there are more than 25,000 students in Australian universities who are currently overenrolled. Universities receive what is called `marginal funding', which is one-quarter of the public funding they would get if they were enrolled up to the quota. What universities have been doing over the last two years is systematically reducing those levels of overenrolment which range, I might add, from 40 per cent at Charles Sturt University down to two per cent at the University -   - The Labor Party is not interested in facts. - This government is concerned to see that Australian students not only get access to universities but also receive a good, high-quality education when they get there. The government has announced in its reforms that 25,000 of those overenrolled places will be fully funded by the government at a cost of $347 million. - That means in practical terms that over the next five years there will be 31,500 additional fully funded places - including the fully funded overenrolled places - in Australian universities. The other thing that ought to be pointed out to the House is that the Labor Party is so impressed by what the government is doing in relation to overenrolled students that it has adopted the government's policy: $347 million to fully fund 25,000 overenrolled places.One of the finest intellects in the country, the former and probably the future president of the Australian Labor Party, Barry Jones, told Channel 7 on Sunday:No, I think what Jenny's doing is very valuable, but you'd have to say that as yet it hasn't caught the public imagination.He then said:I think we perhaps have not sufficiently recognised the degree of the policy vacuum that we've got ...I could not have said it better. The Australian Labor Party is entirely obsessed with universities. It is failing to address the key policy initiatives in industrial relations, in governance and in changes to the way universities are regulated in order to face Australia's future - and it cannot even mention the word `apprenticeship' in the parliament, let alone to the ACTU. No wonder it is in trouble.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Aston for his question. Members of the House will be aware that no government in Australia's history has shown a greater commitment to the economic and environmental sustainability of the Australian landscape and its biodiversity than the Howard government. At the centre of this remarkable effort is the $2.7 billion Natural Heritage Trust, which is without question the largest environmental protection and rescue effort in Australian history.One reason why the trust is having such a huge impact is that it has empowered hundreds of thousands of Australians to restore the environment in their communities. Almost 420,000 Australians have worked on some 14,000 on-ground projects to clear up beaches, reduce erosion, build up the productivity of our agricultural land and restore the environment in their communities. After the January bushfires in the Australian Capital Territory, for example, the trust provided money for a project to re-establish fences along the stream banks and to protect stream banks from erosion. Overall the trust has funded some13,000 kilometres of fencing to protect waterways. A typical project is the money provided to revegetate and protect degraded lands on Leigh Creek in South Australia. The trust has funded the planting of over 31 million trees and the replanting and protection of 789,000 hectares of native vegetation and has established agreements or covenants protecting another 727,500 hectares. The trust has come to the rescue of the Australian landscape and Australian biodiversity and has provided some $32 million to implement 146 recovery plans for 180 nationally listed species and 10 ecological communities. Members may be aware that last Saturday the trust helped to bring back 20 Tamar wallabies, which are extinct in Australia, from Kawau Island in New Zealand to South Australia. Through the trust, the national reserve system has increased by almost one-third under this government, or 18 million hectares, through the expenditure of some $76 million from the trust. The trust has empowered Landcare, has established Coastcare and is providing over $350 million to improve water quality around the nation. This country has an enormous environmental opportunity as the only nation occupying an entire continent. We have a wonderful opportunity to restore the environment of a whole continent and put it on a sustainable basis, and the Howard government's Natural Heritage Trust is a very powerful commitment to do just that.I am asked about alternative policies. It is to the lasting shame of the Labor Party that it has opposed the Natural Heritage Trust and refused to acknowledge the achievements of this remarkable program. We hear nothing about the environment from the Australian Labor Party these days. I have not had a question from the member for Wills as spokesman on the environment for nine months. That shows the policy vacuum that exists on the other side of the House. We see the member for Wills less frequently than we see Brigadoon these days - there has not been a single question in nine months. - We have a policy lazy opposition which has done nothing to restore or protect the environment. It has fought the Howard government every step of the way on the environment - as it does in all other programs. The Australian people well understand that the Labor Party has no credibility, under its current weak leadership, on the environment or anything else.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Jagajaga for the question. I should re-state that this government is reforming Australian higher education. This is a responsibility that the government is determined to discharge for the next generation. It includes $1½ billion of additional public investment in the first four years. La Trobe University will receive directly more than $15 million just in core grant funding in the first three years alone. The government is moving to fully fund more than 25,000 overenrolled places in the sector. The specific places that are overenrolled in universities that will be funded will be the product of negotiation between the Australian government, and in this case, the Victorian government, and the universities that are involved. The one thing that La Trobe University needs to understand, as should this House, is that, should the Leader of the Opposition succeed in his quest to become the Prime Minister of Australia, he and his Treasurer, the member for Werriwa - there's a thought! - will be met by the head of the Department of Finance and Administration who, having given the taxpayers' chequebook to the member for Werriwa, will then say, `The first thing you need to do is write a cheque for $300 million because that is the extent to which the Labor Party has underfunded - according to the department of finance - its own higher education policy.'La Trobe University alone will lose almost $7 million if the Labor Party gets into government unless it finds another $300 million to fill the black hole. It should be enough that Labor is taxing the mining industry and working Australians to put more money into higher education - not to mention running loan schemes for some of the poorest people in the country to send them broke. The Labor Party needs to do what the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Wollongong said - that is, support the package. If the Labor Party does not support this package - as Professor Gerard Sutton said - there will be a genuine crisis in Australian higher education.</DOC>

 - What have you got against my green tie? Why does the Labor Party hate the Irish? I thank the member for Canning for his question. - Standing here, I wish I was colourblind! I note that the member for Canning has asked me more questions about small business in one month than the Labor Party has asked me in two years. What a surprise, given the fact that every time small business comes up in this parliament the Labor Party opposes any initiative to help small business. That could not be more plainly the truth than when it comes to unlawful secondary boycotts. On four separate occasions the Labor Party has been presented with the opportunity to help small businesses have the full protection of the ACCC when they are the innocent victims of an unlawful secondary boycott. On every occasion the Labor Party has voted with its trade union mates instead of with small business. That is on top of the fact that we are trying to help small businesses get away from the unfair dismissal laws, as they stand ready to create up to 50,000 jobs immediately. The Labor Party on 18 separate occasions has voted against helping small business. People will say: `Why is this the case? Why is the Labor Party so determined to help trade unions instead of small business?' We need go no further than our old friend the member for Brand - we remember him on this side of the House - who said that Labor has never pretended to be a party for small business.Government member - Shame! - Damn right; it is a shame. But we know who pulls the strings when it comes to small business and the Labor Party, and that is their mates in the trade union movement. There were no more profound words than those from Nick Lewocki, the NSW state secretary of the public transport union. He said it all when he said:How many small business people stood on polling booths or letter-boxed for the ALP ... How many small businesses pay a percentage of their profits to the ALP? Not many. It's our party and if they don't want to be part of it, they should leave.Over the course of the last two years, there have been some lonely voices in the Labor Party that have tried to stand up for small business and have been smothered. The member for Barton said that we needed more small business people involved in the Labor Party, the member for Werriwa at one stage said we needed more small businesses involved in the Labor Party, and, of course, the member for Hunter was once an advocate for small businesses, particularly those in his electorate. But as soon as someone in the Labor Party decides to try to give small business a fair go they get a response from the trade union movement. Only recently the member for Hunter, who was challenged in his preselection, had to contend with the fact that the trade union movement was saying that the member for Hunter in some way was a defender of small business. After he won his preselection - with my personal endorsement - the CFMEU northern district vice-president Mick Watson said, `I don't think Mr Fitzgibbon should be too smug.' We believe that only the coalition parties are truly prepared to stand up for small business. Every time the Labor Party is given a chance it votes down small business in favour of its trade union mates.</DOC>

 - I will check the basis of the allegation; I do not remember to the precise paragraph everything that I have said. I take the opportunity posed by the question asked by the member for Chisholm to say something about the nature of our higher education policy. In doing that, I want to congratulate the Minister for Education, Science and Training on the outstanding job that he has done.This is a very difficult policy area and, as with all difficult policy areas, the Labor Party faced a choice. They could either do what they habitually do - that is, behave like an opportunistic rabble whenever any decent policy alternative is put forward - or actually join in trying to pass into law some improvements. If they were to win the support of the Australian people at the next election, then they would have the opportunity of reversing those changes as the government of this country. But instead of that the Labor Party are intent on the tactics of obstruction, delay and opportunism in this as they have been in so many other areas. The people who will lose as a result of this are the students of Australia. We do need more money in our universities; that is evident. The budget cannot afford to provide all of the money. It is therefore only natural and logical that some of it should be provided by the budget and some of it should come from outside the budget through a managed and sensible deregulation of the system. We make no apology for that. We are in the business of injecting more funds into our universities, but we are honest enough to say to the Australian people: `The budget cannot afford all of the resources that our universities need. They can only be afforded, they can only be provided, through higher taxation.'What we have done is say: `We will provide more fully funded places.' On top of that, we will allow the universities to have more student funded places, or full fee paying places. One of the great pieces of misrepresentation of our policy - and it is implicit in the question asked by the member for Chisholm - is that, under our policy, in future all degrees will be at a figure of some $100,000. That is the lie. That is the misrepresentation that the members of the Labor Party have endeavoured to put around. I want to take this opportunity of confirming in the parliament -  - that under our policy there will be a very significant increase in the number of government funded HECS places. Contrary to the distortions put around by the Labor Party, there will be significant increases. The only way that you can responsibly get the additional resources that our universities need is to have a combination of more money from private sources and government sources. - We are not going to indulge the fantasy. We are not going to delude the Australian people into believing that the budget is a bottomless pit when it comes to providing additional funding to universities. We are prepared to provide a lot more money to universities, but we are up front and honest enough with the Australian people to say that the private sector will have to contribute its share and make its contribution. The Labor Party, as I said, have two choices. They can respond responsibly and seek through the electoral process to win the support of the Australian public. If they win the next election, an opposition in the Senate will behave in the same responsible way that the opposition in the Senate behaved before 1996 when, on important issues - when we could have played the opportunistic game -  - I notice the member for Brand is interjecting. The member for Brand well remembers some of the conversations he had about getting our support when he knew you could not get the support of the Democrats. The reality is that, if it had not been for the responsible stance that we took, many of the very difficult issues that came up during the Hawke-Keating years would never have been passed into law. If we had played the fast and loose opportunistic game on financial deregulation, on tariff reform, on the introduction of higher education charges -   - I was asked a question about the government's plans for Australian universities -  - I was not only explaining the basis of our policy but inviting the Australian Labor Party, for once in 7½ years, to behave like a responsible opposition and look to the national interest. - I was contrasting the behaviour of Labor in opposition to the responsible behaviour of the coalition in opposition, when on important issues we put Australia first - something you have failed to do over 7½ years.</DOC>

 - I welcome this question from the Leader of the Opposition, whose spokesman on Treasury matters has a trifecta of approaches and policies towards Australian home ownership that I will come to in a moment. Yesterday, Mr Henry commented on a number of economic matters, including the escalation in house prices. We have to understand the perspective of this. The effect of the escalation in house prices has been to add to the net wealth of the overwhelming majority of Australians. I have not found any Australian coming up to me in the street and saying, `Look, Howard, I'm angry with you; the value of my most precious asset has gone up consistently since you have been Prime Minister.' I have not had many people say that to me.The reality is that we have seen an escalation in the value of houses, and it reflects a number of factors - all of them are, as we speak, under consideration by the Productivity Commission - including the impact on the cost of housing of stamp duty imposed by the states and the impact of the land release policies of local governments and state governments. - The Leader of the Opposition interjects, `What about that GST?' I might remind the Leader of the Opposition that the GST does not apply to existing dwellings - and 85 per cent of first home buyers buy existing dwellings; only 15 per cent of them buy new dwellings. We introduced a $7,000 first home owners grant and we doubled it for very good economic reasons early in 2001. I think the combination of those policies has been enormously to the benefit of a large number of Australians.But the other reason why the cost of housing has gone up - because people feel they can afford to borrow more - is that interest rates are much lower now than they were under Labor. What is the figure? I think the average loan repayment in Australia is now $450 a month. I say to the opposition that they will be hearing a great deal more of that figure over the many months ahead. Household mortgage interest rates have fallen to historically low levels of 6.5 per cent. We all remember the rates at 17 per cent back in the Hawke and Keating years.The government does recognise that the strong rise in house prices has generated significant wealth gain for approximately 70 per cent of households. Mr Speaker, let me remind you that the increase in house prices means that there have been beneficial wealth effects for 70 per cent of Australian households. With this in mind, the government recently announced a Productivity Commission inquiry into housing affordability for first home buyers. I cannot resist the opportunity of saying something about the alternative approach to housing of the member for Werriwa. The member for Werriwa, who is the Labor Party spokesman on economic matters, has three solutions - or he did have; or he might have; or he could have if he were allowed, if he were let off the leash by the Leader of the Opposition. Back in the 1990s, when the member for Werriwa spoke with the freedom of a born-again economic reformer, he was in favour of extending the capital gains tax to the family home. The last Labor Party economic spokesman who said something about that was Peter Walsh. Peter Walsh mused about extending the capital gains tax to the family home. But, not content with that, back in the 1990s the member for Werriwa thought that a 30 per cent land development tax was not a bad idea and, not content with that, he thought it ought to be extended to renovations. But then, of course, when he finally grasped the Holy Grail of the economic spokesmanship for the Australian Labor Party, the first night on television on Lateline -  - When the member for Werriwa was appointed he sort of mused about getting rid of negative gearing, but he was then dragged into line by the Leader of the Opposition. But we know that, deep down, the real member for Werriwa wants to extend the capital gains tax to the family home, to put on a 30 per cent betterment tax and he wants to get rid of negative gearing.</DOC>

 - I can report to the House the results of the fifth ministerial meeting of the WTO that just took place in Cancun. Certainly the outcome was not up to our expectations, nor to those of the majority of other members of the WTO. For a combination of reasons, it did not receive the political momentum or direction for the round that was hoped would be injected into it. But at the outset we should note that this meeting was not the beginning or end of the round; it was just a stocktake at the midpoint. It was a meeting that was supposed to inject political momentum and direction into the round, to deliver outcomes not just for Australian farmers but for the poor and undeveloped countries across the world.A lot of people expected that agriculture would be the issue that would cause this meeting to stumble but, ironically, it was not. We have made significant progress in our negotiations with the other countries with regard to agriculture and, to a large extent, that was a result of the hard work of the Cairns Group as well as the Australian delegation - not just the official government delegation, but also the broader agricultural advisory group and, indeed, the parliamentary delegation that travelled with us. I can report that both Senator Sandy Macdonald and Senator O'Brien played an active role in the lobbying effort during the week. Nonetheless, it was disappointing that there could not have been clearer direction given on the critical issues we need to deal with. This round is not set down to conclude until 1 January 2005. The chairman of the meeting, Minister Luis Derbez of Mexico, said that we should take forward the positives that we have agreed to and take them back to Geneva - delegations in Geneva work hard on taking this forward - so we can deliver the outcome that we have been pursuing. The important thing for Australia is that it was not agriculture - our core issue in this round - that caused a stumble; we made more progress on the issue of agriculture than on any other. It was the aspirations of the European Union and others for multilateral rules on investment and competition policy and government procurement and trade facilitation that about 80 underdeveloped countries could not agree with that caused this round to stumble. It did not collapse; it is a stumble. We still have high hopes of achieving an outcome by the end of next year. We saw during the Uruguay Round meetings such as that that was held in Montreal in 1998 and that that was held in Brussels in 1990 deliver similar outcomes, yet ultimately the Uruguay Round was concluded. We had the experience in Seattle. Seattle collapsed and failed. We launched a round in Doha. Cancun has stumbled. The next meeting, presumably towards the end of next year, which we think will be in Hong Kong, will hopefully deliver the outcome that the developing world needs, that the markets of the world need to liberalise and that certainly Australia's farmers and exporters need. We remain committed to pursuing that, along with the private sector from Australia, in advocating the case for opening markets across the world.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for the question. I can confirm that the standing arrangement is that, if there is a leak of a document relating to national security, it is required to be referred to ASIO. In the case of the ONA report to which the Leader of the Opposition refers, the matter was referred to ASIO. In the circumstances as assessed by ASIO, and it being the ONA wish that it be referred to the AFP, it was referred to the AFP for investigation, as has been outlined on a number of occasions. I do not think I can answer the general questions asked by the Leader of the Opposition with any particularity, because the circumstances under which a document disappears and the nature of the document will, in themselves, determine how the matter is investigated and assessed. But, where it is believed to be a leak in the ordinary course of events, I would expect it would be referred to the AFP. The AFP would assess whether an investigation is appropriate and, if it thought it was appropriate, it would conduct an investigation. The matter has been referred to the AFP. The AFP is conducting an investigation. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and note his particular interest in the Kimberley region - a far-flung part of the nation and one in which we are very actively engaged in a cooperative effort to try and ensure that it reaches its potential. At a time of pretty strong national economic growth, increasing disposable wealth, more opportunities and lower unemployment for the very great majority of Australians - all things we would rejoice in, at least on this side of the House - it is important to remember that the experience is not uniform across the nation and that there are people in some regions not enjoying the benefits of the better opportunities that are certainly very much evident in most of the nation.Seeking in the interests of national social cohesion to address this issue, we have chosen eight of the most challenged regions across the nation, as I have referred to in this place before, for a pilot scheme based on the best of our national experience and ideas, and the best ideas internationally for regional development. I am pleased to be able to tell the House that the sustainable regions program is progressing well. The program is not just about funding projects; it is particularly about building capacity and leadership in order to foster the development of strong and self-reliant local communities. It is community driven, it is community owned and it is making real contributions to economic opportunity.To date the government has approved 100 projects to the value of a little over $33 million, but the good thing is that that funding has driven close to three times that level of investment from other, mainly private sector, sources. So you really are seeing very powerful leverage here. Regions are building on their natural advantages. For example, in the Kimberleys - the area that the member for Kalgoorlie represents - the Kimberley Aquaculture Aboriginal Corporation is using its funding of around $700,000 to establish a whole new primary industry in the Kimberley based on black tiger-prawn farming. It has been predicted that that industry could well grow to be worth in excess of $100 million over the next five or six years. The number of jobs associated with it is estimated to be as high as 800, and that would include a very large number of Indigenous positions. I think that is an outstanding example of what can be achieved through the building of social and economic capital in a region like the Kimberleys.In the member for Page's electorate, funding of $843,233 for Aspect North has assisted in the establishment of a geospatial information centre in Lismore. That is bringing high-tech capacity to the area, highly paid professional positions, the potential to create 100 direct jobs and nearly 200 indirect jobs over the next few years, and a real technological edge to the benefit not just of that region but, in terms of the technology they are deploying, of a whole range of other regions as well. An amount of $300,000 or thereabouts to the Murwillumbah based The Right Food Group is enabling it to upgrade its existing food processing sectors, and the managing director has commented that the grant will make `a huge difference and allow us to accelerate the growth of the business to become a leader in the organic industry Australia wide'. Unlike the state Labor governments, we are putting resources into regions which are doing it hard. We are funding programs which will assist in identifying future strategic opportunities and really help develop local capacity. Another example is Ravenshoe Timbers in the Herberton Shire in the Atherton. The grant that it received has helped it purchase machinery to enable it to participate in the very lucrative Japanese export market. As a result there are around 30 new full-time jobs and 26 part-time jobs in a shire with one of the highest unemployment rates in Australia. The managing director of Ravenshoe has said that the state government is just not interested in creating employment - not interested in creating jobs for ordinary people.Another example, to come back to the member for Kalgoorlie's question, is of course the Broome Wharf, which is a piece of infrastructure that is badly needed. The key beneficiaries will be the pastoral industry, the offshore oil and gas industry, the Australian Navy and businesses providing services to the local region. It requires some $14 million of investment, and the state government has refused to make a worthwhile and substantial contribution. I am very disappointed in that, and I know that the people up there are disappointed and that the local member is as well, particularly given that the prime responsibility for that important piece of infrastructure belongs with the state government.It is important that, at a time when the national economy is growing strongly, we seek, as I said earlier, in the interests of national social cohesion to ensure that we build the necessary social capital and economic opportunities in regions that for various reasons, historical and otherwise, are not able to participate fully in those expanding horizons. That is what we are doing. I believe that this report to the House reflects a program that is doing well and really benefiting people in some of the areas of the nation that are still doing it relatively tough.</DOC>

 - I can certainly assure the member for Indi and other members who have a deep interest in the Murray-Darling Basin that we remain absolutely committed to working with the local communities, and all those who are affected by the Living Murray initiative, in developing proposals for consideration by the ministerial council. We want to ensure that we deliver the best possible environmental outcomes while respecting the rights of the people who live and work on the river and who use its resources. No decisions will be made without proper consultation with the community and involving those who are directly affected.I have been surprised today by some media reports which have suggested that the scientific, social and economic reports that are being developed as part of the Living Murray initiative are, somehow or other, being suppressed. I met yesterday with the commission, and they have given me some progress reports on the Living Murray initiative and the work that is currently under way. The 500-page scientific report is currently undergoing third-party scientific auditing. That is expected to take two to three weeks. During that time, an executive summary is being prepared, and it is certainly my wish and the Commonwealth's wish that, once the report is complete, it would be made available to the public, along with any of the other social and economic work that is being done in relation to the Living Murray initiative.I might add that it is not the Commonwealth alone that makes this decision. All jurisdictions have a right to a say in the direction that the Living Murray initiative might take; but, as chairman of the ministerial council, let me say that I believe it is necessary for these reports to be made public. From the Commonwealth's perspective, we will be providing whatever information we possibly can to the community so they can be well informed about what the options are and what decisions need to be made. The commission is currently doing quite a deal of work for the next November meeting of the ministerial council, where we hope to make a first-step decision on what might be able to be achieved by way of a `no regrets' first down payment on the Living Murray initiative. Four environmental priority areas have been identified and work has been done on how they can be effectively managed to deliver new benefits to those regions. We are also seeking to identify ways in which the water can be recovered for all these sorts of projects and what savings might be available on the basis of the `no regrets' benchmark that has been set for these proposals. This work is now quite advanced and I am optimistic that, with consultation with the community, some significant decisions can be made to progress this initiative at the November meeting. We are not just blindly taking a number like 1,500 gigalitres out of the air -  - The opposition just blindly draws out a number without any reference to what the water is going to do, where it is going to come from or what it is going to achieve. The shadow spokesman has been to one of the public meetings, so he knows what the public think about the Labor Party's proposals in relation to this issue. It is not simply a matter of taking numbers out of the air. What we want is a detailed program that is going to deliver real and meaningful outcomes, in consultation with the community. The federal government are committed to that outcome. We will be making all the information public when it is available so that the consideration of these issues can indeed be on the basis of the full facts and a properly informed debate. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. Regarding the medals for the veterans of Sumatra, I would have to check the records and get back to the member. It certainly is something that is not within our consideration at the moment, but I am very happy to check that for the member. Regarding the national service medal -  - As the member is aware - as, I am sure, all the members in the House are aware - more than 330,000 national servicemen were eligible to receive this medal. Of course, having applications of that magnitude received by a department is quite a considerable thing. The member would also be aware that we have moved our medals section from Melbourne up to Tuggeranong. We have streamlined our processes, we have increased our staff, we have a backlog at the moment -  - I am sorry; that is not correct. We have issued many national service medals. - Indeed, I think the number of national service medals that have been issued are evidenced by the very strong organisations of national servicemen across the nation and the very large number of national servicemen who have marched in recent Anzac Day marches. I can inform the member for Cowan and other members of this House that there is currently a backlog of 25,000 applications for national service medals waiting to be processed. - I can also inform him that it is the strong commitment of our medals section to have those delivered as soon as possible.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker -  - Thank you very much, Prime Minister.  - I thank the member for Pearce for her question. -  - It is hard to be a role model in the House. - Just in relation to fashion, of course. The member for Pearce asks a very important question because, like many, the member for Pearce and I are alarmed at a report from the Australian Society of Certified Practising Accountants that has been released this month. It indicates that one in four small businesses - some in her electorate - has suffered fraud in the last two years.Fraud is a big issue for small business. Now more than ever the chances of them getting their money back are very low. What we can do to help address this is obviously to encourage small businesses to take better precautions with staff. But one way that small business can help to recover some of the sums is to take out insurance. We want to encourage more small business people to take out insurance to cover some of the enormous costs associated with fraud.Why is it that more small businesses are not taking out insurance? You could go to the cost of insurance premiums rising right around the world. However, Australia unfortunately has the highest taxes on insurance anywhere in the world - and every dollar of tax on insurance is going to the states. In fact - and this is from a Deloitte Trowbridge report - of the 10 highest-taxing jurisdictions in the world, nine are in Australia and all of them are Labor states. The only other jurisdiction is France and they are socialist as well. State taxes and charges -  - You have a look. - Higher taxes and charges on state insurance are having a profound impact on small business. - The member for Hotham interjects again. - I wonder why the Labor Party has such a problem with trying to help small business. What has the Labor Party got against small business? - I do not want your help - nor does the Labor Party want your help. - The member for Pearce asked: who is supporting small business? The member for Pearce asked: where is the support for small business in relation to taxes? We have done a full search on the member for Werriwa and we have not found one word of complaint from him about state taxes on small business. The member for Werriwa expresses a view on everything from social capital and education to sport. Why doesn't he express a view about small business taxes?  - In rural Victoria, up to 75c in every dollar of premiums paid by small business is going in taxes to the Bracks government. In Western Australia, up to 55c in every dollar of premiums paid by small business is going to the Western Australian Labor government. In New South Wales it is the same, as it is in the ACT and the Northern Territory. If the Labor Party really does believe that it can help small business then there is a simple way forward: the member for Werriwa can pick up the phone to a state Labor leader and ask them to reduce the taxes on small business. Whether it be about capital gains tax on the family home or abolishing negative gearing, the member for Werriwa is proving himself to be a part of the Labor family that believes in higher taxes for all.</DOC>

 - As so often is the case with the member for Lilley, one is at a loss to understand quite what he is getting at, but let me say this: any suggestion that Senator Vanstone is bullying anybody I reject. Senator Vanstone is a high-quality minister and colleague in whom I have strong confidence. I can give an assurance to the House that, consistent with the commitment I made as then opposition leader in 1995, this government has preserved the social security safety net. Indeed the figures that have come out about household distribution of wealth in recent times give the lie to the argument that lies at the heart of this proposition: that we have destroyed the social security safety net. The reality is that all income groups in Australia have enjoyed increases in wealth over recent years. It happens that there has been a faster rate of increase at the top end, but any suggestion that the bottom end has not also enjoyed its share of the increase in national wealth, which would be a precondition -  - I was also asked about the social security safety net, and I am demonstrating by reference to recent economic data that the social security safety net in Australia under the coalition is alive and well and benefiting the less well-off in the Australian community. Other ways in which we have benefited the less well-off are to generate more jobs, to reduce interest rates and to provide historically preferential rates of indexation of age pensions. By tying the age pension to average weekly earnings, we have done something that former governments were unwilling to do. Yet the member for Lilley has the temerity, the audacity, the sheer hide to get up in this place and start attacking Senator Vanstone. The fact is that we have provided a better safety net than was provided by the former Labor government. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Deakin for his question and I acknowledge his extraordinary vigilance to protect the interests of Australian taxpayers. I very much regret to inform the House that 23 September is the 10th anniversary of the dodgy deal between the Keating government and the Australian Labor Party over Centenary House, which has been delivering rivers of gold into the campaign coffers of the Labor Party ever since. The Australian Labor Party is creaming $3.5 million a year from Australian taxpayers thanks to this racket, and if people like the member for Lilley were really concerned about pensioners then they would repudiate this deal so that that $3.5 million a year could go back to taxpayers or go into social services for people who need the money.On 23 September, the rent at Centenary House rises to $871 per square metre per year. This is three times typical commercial rents in Canberra. How do we know? Because the latest sub-rental deal at Centenary House itself was for just $315 per square metre per year. The rental at Centenary House is now 20 per cent more than rents in Sydney's CBD. For instance, in Grosvenor Place, which is a high-rise building with expansive views of Sydney Harbour, the rents are just $700 per square metre. But there is more. The August 2003 global market rents report from CB Richard Ellis reveals that in mid-town Manhattan, which is the most expensive district in New York, rents now average $A867 per square metre. So, thanks to this dodgy deal negotiated between the Keating Labor government and the Australian Labor Party, taxpayers are paying more in rent for a modest office in Canberra than they would for a prime CBD office in New York.I pose this question: when is an office in Canberra worth more than an office in New York? I will tell you, Mr Speaker: it is when it is an office owned by the Labor Party and paid for by the taxpayer, thanks to a shonky scheme negotiated by the former Labor government. This is nothing but a scam perpetrated by the Australian Labor Party on the taxpayers of Australia. If the Leader of the Opposition had the slightest shred of respect for the Australian people, he would repudiate this deal and say to the Labor Party, `Be content with a mere commercial rent.'</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hinkler for his question and for his strong interest in attracting investment to Australia. Unlike those opposite, the member for Hinkler is a keen advocate of attracting foreign investment into his electorate and into Australia. The sound economic management of this government has ensured that there is a climate such that countries want to invest here and we get a continuation of the growth in jobs and skills of Australian workers and in export income.The 2003 United Nations world investment report shows that, despite the fact that global investment inflows fell 21 per cent in 2002, Australia recorded a 250 per cent increase in foreign direct investment. That is a jump from $US4 billion in 2001 to $US14 billion in 2002. We are now ranked as the 14th largest recipient of foreign direct investment in the world and the second largest in the Asia-Pacific region. In addition, in 2002 Australia was the third most successful country in attracting the headquarters of foreign companies and transnational corporations, behind only the United Kingdom and the US.These figures clearly refute the comment made by the shadow manufacturing spokesman, Senator George Campbell, in a press release that there has been a failure by this government to attract investment into Australia. For the benefit of the member for Hunter and others, I am going to table that press release. Along with those facts, we are seeing a continuation of the work of Invest Australia, who in the last year attracted some 28 projects into Australia, generating some 1,400 new jobs and creating some $300 million worth of investment over the next three years.The member for Hinkler asked me about alternative proposals from the opposition. If the high inflation, high interest rates and high debt which reigned when they were in power were not enough, they are actually suggesting that we do away with the strategic investment process - the same process that took to the member for Hinkler's area near Gladstone the Comalco refinery, which saw $3.5 billion potentially invested in that region and created some 3,000 jobs. That is 3,000 jobs we would not have if the Labor Party were in power. </DOC>

 - It is not the policy of the government to achieve a particular target. There were some reviews of eligibility in relation to certain allowances put in place - I think in 1998 - and that process is continuing. But that process is being carried out in a fair and decent way. Ministers having the responsibilities that Senator Vanstone has have to balance, on the one hand, their responsibilities to the taxpayers and also their responsibilities to welfare recipients. I think Senator Vanstone does an excellent job of trying to balance those things.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for La Trobe for his question, because, as all honourable members would know, today Australia celebrates its third national Citizenship Day. This year there is an extensive program of activities right across the country to celebrate Citizenship Day, including special ceremonies for new Australian citizens. Some 2,541 people are expected to join the Australian family at 60 citizenship ceremonies right across the country, including one which we conducted just before question time right here in Parliament House. As well, there will be affirmation ceremonies for people who were born in Australia.It would be no surprise to members that the member for La Trobe was not born in this country; he chose Australia. He brought with him all the passion and energy those people who migrate here always bring to the country, and the people of the La Trobe electorate understand that well. His electorate is one of our target areas. Within La Trobe there are 2,830 eligible non-citizens, and I know the member for La Trobe is spreading the message that there has never been a better time to join the Australian family.Under the Howard government the take-up rate for Australian citizenship has increased and the momentum is being maintained. This year we will see a whole pile of new people - with some 4,000 or more this week alone - joining the Australian family. Today I participated in a special televised citizenship ceremony for Kerri-Anne Kennerley's program. In fact, her husband, John, became a national citizen on Australian television this morning. Today, in a ceremony held at Parliament House, people from Scotland, South Africa, Bangladesh and the United Kingdom were welcomed. The ceremony was hosted by Evatt Primary School, in the member for Fraser's electorate. It was also attended by students from Macgregor Primary School in my electorate. Interestingly, the United Kingdom government is starting to understand what we know: citizenship is an important unifying force in the community. It likes what we do so much that it is following our lead and introducing citizenship ceremonies for new citizens and emphasising values and history in citizenship that are similar to the `What it means to be an Australian citizen' program and the values based Adult Migrant English Program citizenship courses.Further, today I launched a pilot program in schools titled `Kids active in Australian citizenship' to introduce our youngest Australians to Australian citizenship and to the ceremony. Classes will stage a citizenship ceremony which will include an affirmation pledge and the national anthem. Yesterday, in Victoria, one school staged a ceremony - I think there is a teachers' strike there today, so they could not do it today - where talented schoolchildren translated Waltzing Matilda into Chinese. The Prime Minister might be interested in seeing those children cheering on the Wallabies in a few weeks time.There has never been a better time to take out Australian citizenship. It is all about national unity. It is all about making a commitment to your country. It is not just about enjoying the rights and privileges but also about subscribing to the responsibilities by becoming a member of the Australian family.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, I will take the opportunity to elaborate in some detail about the issues raised. I think the implications that are being drawn arise because of a fundamental misunderstanding about the nature of the minister's power when the minister intervenes -  - How about listening? - It is about the circumstances in which the power was introduced and the nature of the requests that the minister receives. Let me deal, firstly, with why the powers were introduced. The minister's power was introduced because the government wanted to restore efficacy to the immigration program, which - let me make it very clear - is a program in which substantial benefits to Australia can be derived if it is well managed. In relation to the way in which selection proceeds, there are established criteria for determining who should enter and who should not. When you were last in office -  - When your party was last in office -  -  - When the Labor Party was last in office - it is so long ago that I have difficulty in remembering! - what I do know is that when there was a power to exercise discretion broadly based, with the opportunity for tribunals and the courts to offer advice as to the way in which it should be exercised, something of the order of 8,000 visa applications - and this was revealed to the parliamentary committee, I think last Friday - were destined for approval on the basis of compelling and compassionate circumstances. The reason that Senator Ray, the then minister, sought to constrain the operation of a broadly based power -  - was to put clearly back in the hands of the government of the day, in the person of the minister responsible, the determination as to who was going to be able to have special factors considered. In relation to those matters, when the former government - when faced with the limitation it had introduced by its own measures - wanted to make special arrangements for accommodation of particular groups of people who were in Australia and were not eligible under the criteria that applied, it introduced specific criteria to enable resolution of their cases. Within the space of a year something like 49,000 people - former groups of Chinese students, rejected asylum seekers and, in the case of the measures put in place, non-rejected asylum seekers - were eligible to apply for and obtain a concessional entry. I just want to put it in perspective: 8,000 in the last year and 49,000 people who were allowed in under concessional arrangements. The Labor Party has not changed its spots in relation to this matter. It was the Labor Party arguing that there ought to be a broadly based concession for East Timorese that would have allowed every East Timorese refugee to remain in Australia, rather than the cases to be looked at on a case-by-case basis.  - That puts the 1,900 cases in which I had intervened over seven years clearly into perspective. It has been a very limited range of interventions, where I have judged on a proper case-by-case determination as to whether there was a basis for intervention.Let me deal with the question as to whether or not statistical analysis is going to help you in relation to understanding the basis upon which case-by-case determination proceeds. The fact is that if you look at Refugee Review Tribunal decisions you will find that some nationalities are more successful. For instance, Afghanistan and Iraq: 97 per cent in one case and 95 per cent of cases in another situation were successful. Why was that? Because the circumstances in those countries were very different to those in the Philippines, China and other countries where it was far less likely that well founded claims of persecution would arise. You can look and say there should be a statistical outcome, but in fact the statistical outcomes will vary because of the nature of the circumstances that are faced.Some tribunal members will make recommendations that the minister might look at particular circumstances; others make no recommendation. I make no judgment in relation to that; I simply say that in the consideration of the cases before them some come to a view that that is appropriate, some come to a view that it is not. I do not think you can look at that particular statistic as having any veracity in relation to comparisons with the way in which these issues are dealt with.There are some members of parliament who have approached me - and one in particular - as many as 100 times. There are others who have never approached me in relation to intervention. I have not yet heard about the nature of their success rates or otherwise. But what I can say is this: there are some people who come forward and bring a considered argument in relation to a case on its merits because they believe in the individual claims that are being advanced. There are others who take the view that they should put every claim before me because they think it is easier to say that they have written to the minister and asked the minister to have a look at it. I am not drawing any inferences in relation to that, but the case-by-case consideration of those matters will produce very different outcomes, as you would expect.In conclusion, I have been approached far more frequently by members opposite. If you look at where those requests come from, you will see that they are more likely to come from the sorts of electorates that they represent, and I understand that. I have taken the view that I would consider those matters on their merits, case by case, and the variations will be different, and statistical analysis will never help you in understanding the nature of the process.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Cowper for his interest in the welfare of young people. Indeed, I was in his electorate recently, meeting with a number of young students from schools in that area. The characteristics that came out were that they were passionate, well educated and had a great view on life. They were very positive, and this attitude reflected what the local member is doing for the people of Cowper. But the question asked was: what is the government doing to help young people? The best thing you can do to help young people is to give them a job, of course. Since we have been in government, 1.2 million new jobs have been created. And if you look at the area of youth unemployment, you will see that it is the lowest it has been for decades. When you look at the teenage rate of unemployment, you see that fewer than one in 20 Australian teenagers are unemployed and looking for work. This is compared to one in 10 when the opposition was last in government. Why? Because they are being employed or they are getting opportunities through education. In the area of apprenticeships and traineeships, 396,000 young Australians are in training - again the highest level for decades, an 11 per cent increase over the past 12 months - and are involved directly in that area. This is added to the good work that the Minister for Education, Science and Training is doing in higher education.But one area which stands out as a signature project for the Howard-Anderson government is Green Corps. This is a terrific program for young Australians aged between 17 and 20. It is a voluntary program where they are paid to do environmental work in their local communities for six months. Not only is it a good youth project but it is also a very good outcome for the environment.I must say that they are doing a wonderful job paving at Diggers Beach Headland, up in the member for Cowper's area - I know the local member is enthusiastic about it - and work up at Dorrigo. Recently I was in the member for Mallee's electorate and there is wonderful work being done up there by 10 young Australians in the Sunraysia remnant linkage project. This is another great example of young Australians, our greatest asset, teaming up with another great asset to Australia - our environment.The member did ask the question: are there any alternative approaches? I must say I was quite surprised by a very candid admission by none other than the shadow spokesperson for children and youth affairs, Jacinta Collins, in the Age on 22 August. She was highly complimentary about the government and of course quite damning of her own colleagues. She poses this question in the first paragraph of this article:Why are so many young people deserting the federal Labor Party in favour not only of the minor parties ... but in favour of the Liberal and National parties?That is a very good question to pose. She goes on to say:Young people want to vote for policy that has a real ability to change their lives for the better. They want to see real ideas that would make a real improvement to their standard of living.That is good. That is a fair enough comment. Then she says:Notably ... what Liberal leader John Howard and [the] Greens ... have in common is that they are not afraid to promote change that would affect the values and the beliefs of young people.Further, in a very candid admission, she says that, whether it is regulation or deregulation of the higher education sector, Howard goes out and advocates for it, inspiring people - particularly young people. I thank Senator Jacinta Collins for her frank contribution and commend her on her honesty. I am quite happy to take her into my confidence and give her a few tips about what she can do for young people.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Solomon for his question and for his obvious interest in this area of Indigenous employment. Obviously this has been a difficult issue for Australia - for our Indigenous population and for governments - for a long time. This government does not shirk its responsibilities in these challenging issues. We would all be familiar in this House with CDEP, where we have Indigenous people working in community based organisations, working in their own groups. Unfortunately, CDEP has been seen as a means to an end for a long time rather than a way of re-engaging in full-time, permanent, paid work.What this government undertook to do through the Indigenous employment centres was to actually encourage and invite CDEPs to become Indigenous employment centres, to work with the Job Network members in the wider community and to take Indigenous Australians from CDEP - where there was a viable labour market and where there was an interest from the CDEP - and put them into work. What we have found is that this has been embraced by the Indigenous communities around this country, and today we have some 29 IECs operating the length and breadth of this country. We have them in every state and territory. I am particularly keen to point out to the House that, in the member for Solomon's electorate, Indigenous employment is improving to such a degree that more than one in three Indigenous workers who are part of the Indigenous employment centre and who have gone off CDEP are now in permanent, full-time, paid work.This is a great news story and it goes against the trend in much of the mainstream media of portraying the challenges in Indigenous communities. We as a government applaud these people who are taking on individuals who have very challenging backgrounds, such as Ray, who wanted me to pass on this story of his own struggle. Ray is 35 years of age, he has been unemployed since 1989 and was on unemployment benefits. During that time he was on a disability support pension and CDEP. He now has permanent work with the local council on an environmental health plan.He wanted me to say that, without the assistance of the IEC, he would not have been able to do this. He says, `Now I look forward to a better future for my family'; that is, a better future where he is able to sustain both his own life and the life of his wife - who, he also points out, got work through the IEC - but most importantly the lives of his children, who now have role models in the Indigenous community of their family working. We hope that this positive initiative of the government's will continue to lead to more employment throughout the Indigenous community. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question; it is not one that I had not anticipated would come. I make this observation in relation to that question: I think there was a statement which the honourable member has relied upon - in relation to donations that might have come through Mr Kisrwani or been solicited by him for my conference - that they were donations that had been made on, I think, 14 October, the date of the launch of my campaign in Hornsby. That was the inference that was drawn from the answer given by Mr Kisrwani along with the relevant sections that the honourable member quoted from. I want to make the point that Mr Kisrwani's recollection was clearly defective in this respect. As I have been advised by the Treasurer of the Berowra federal electorate conference, no donations were received at all on 14 October 2001. It was the launch of my campaign on a Saturday morning in the Hornsby shopping centre, for which people were invited to come along and hear from one of my colleagues, Senator Marise Payne, as she spoke in support of my candidacy. The fact is that Mr Kisrwani's recollection was clearly defective, because the Treasurer of the Liberal Party's Berowra federal electorate conference wrote to me on 29 August:After watching the SBS program Insight on Thursday evening the 28th of August I felt that with questions being asked of you in relation to a donation by Mr Dante Tan the conference record should be examined relating to that donation, which disclosed the following: the donation was received by cheque dated 3 January 2002. A receipt, No. 51, was issued on 15 January 2002. The cheque was banked on 17 January 2002.I table that letter. It clearly demonstrates that my recollection is superior.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Farrer for her question, and I also acknowledge the very constructive contribution she makes to the development of the government's environmental policies. What has characterised this government on the environment is the taking on of the big environmental issues that have been ignored for decades, because we know that environmental sustainability underpins our social and economic prosperity.There is no doubt at all that the Howard government has led the way in highlighting the enormous threat to agricultural productivity that comes from salinity. There are many areas in this country today where land that was productive 10 years ago is now almost unusable because it is encrusted with salt crystals. According to the National Land and Water Resources Audit, 5.7 million hectares in Australia are either salt affected or at risk of becoming salt affected and 17 million hectares - the equivalent of 22 per cent of our cultivated land - faces a risk of developing salinity by 2040.Salinity already costs this country some $270 million a year in lost agricultural production, in infrastructure and in environmental degradation. The national action plan for salinity - the $1.4 billion plan put in place by the Australian government and the states and achieved through the leadership of the Prime Minister - is a massive cooperative effort to attempt to roll back this devastating problem for Australia. It is not only agricultural productivity that is undermined: there are almost 20,000 kilometres of roads, some 68 towns and 80 important wetlands that are already finding themselves affected by that salinity problem, and that problem is projected to get a great deal worse over the next few decades if we fail to take action now.To date, I am delighted to inform the House that the Commonwealth and the states have already committed some $242 million under the national action plan to fight salinity. This money is funding a very wide range of works including major salt interception works at Pyramid Hill in Victoria and, in the honourable member for Farrer's own electorate, some $9 million is being invested in better land and water management practices including surface drainage and channel seepage. Work such as this has already demonstrated its effectiveness, and in the member for Farrer's electorate the area at risk from salinity has been reduced by some 90,000 hectares over the last decade as a result of works of this kind. So we can make progress if we make the effort. In South Australia, the Australian government and the South Australian government have already committed over $49 million for a major drainage scheme in the worst salinity hotspot in the state, which is in the south-east and adjacent to the Coorong.Over the coming years, this investment in combating salinity is going to continue to grow. It is a prime example of how this government has focused on the major national issues, directed attention to those issues and made sure that effective work is under way. This is what is possible when the government works in partnership with communities to achieve practical environmental outcomes and shows the national leadership that the Australian people expect. </DOC>

 - I have not seen the context of the minister's comments; but, generally speaking, I can say to the House that it is the view of sections of the medical profession - and, in fact, of a spokesman for a group of the medical profession concerned about intensive care in public hospitals - that that claim about it being filled is wrong. I do not know whether anybody contacted somebody in my office, but the two statements are not mutually exclusive. -  - It is perfectly possible for an individual to use an emergency ward -  - without those wards being filled to overflowing.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and note his very real and localised interest in this. Today is quite a historic day for transport in Australia: it is the day the missing link in the Australian rail network has been found, delivered and put in place. As we speak, the final weld joining the two great lines is taking place, and the Alice Springs to Darwin railway - one of Australia's biggest infrastructure projects - has happened. This has come about through a very considerable leadership role exercised by this government, with a cont-ri-bution of $191 million - $178 million of which has been paid to date; $100 million of that, in turn, was a grant from the Federation Fund money.This is a pretty fitting project to mark the Centenary of Federation. I think we would all say that our forefathers got most things right, but one thing that they perhaps did not get quite right was rail. Indeed, we are making tremendous progress there, with all the capital cities right across the nation now hooked up by rail and the very real likelihood that the Commonwealth, through the Australian Rail Track Corporation, will shortly be operating a seamless interstate track network covering all of the capital cities. In addition to the financial contribution, the government donated the Tarcoola to Alice Springs line, with a replacement value of $400 million. The track, which should be finally nailed down and completed next week, links Darwin into the national grid; and, on Thursday, 25 September, the nation will see the goal of this linkage of all cities finally completed.Construction of the line has been a massive undertaking: 1,420 kilometres of earthworks and track, 146,000 tonnes of rail, and the construction of no fewer than 90 bridges. The benefits of the new railway will be enormous. It is estimated that, over the course of its life, it will boost Australia's gross domestic product by nearly $4½ billion. In the short term, it has created 1,500 direct jobs during construction, with more than $1 billion in contracts going to local companies. It creates a new trade route to the vital regions to our north, in Asia, and it has led to the development of new businesses and industries in the region already.Extensive testing will be undertaken over the next little while; and a date to note is 15 January next year, when Freight Link will operate the first train out of Adelaide, destined to arrive in Darwin on 17 January. The inaugural Ghan trip to Darwin - I understand one of my predecessors, Tim Fischer, will be on it - will leave Adelaide on 1 February 2004. That promises to be one of the great passenger links and one of the more romantic train journeys that anybody could undertake. Indeed, the member for Grey looks like he is going to be on that trip as well. We hope you have a great trip.</DOC>

 - I stand by the statements I made. I certainly do not intend to retract those statements. I am grateful that the member for Lalor has asked me a question about the veracity of claims concerning Medicare because I have in my possession the latest example of ALP push polling. It is on the subject of Medicare and bulk-billing, and this is what was said by none other than the member for Lowe, who I had always thought was a cut above in terms of candour. He nods; he really is, yes. - I think the member for Werriwa ought to be beating up on Bob Carr over stamp duty and not John Singleton. - This pamphlet, which has come out under the signature of the member for Lowe, has the heading `Medicare and bulk-billing'. It makes this assertion: `Now the federal government wants to charge a $20 fee for every time you visit your doctor.' That is downright wrong. It totally misrepresents our policy. I invite the member for Lalor to ask a few more questions and we can expose the Labor Party for having in other areas misrepresented the extent of the policy changes.The government remains strongly committed to the maintenance of Medicare. The government remains strongly committed not only to the maintenance of Medicare but also, unlike the Labor Party, we will retain in full the 30 per cent tax rebate for private health insurance. The Labor Party asked me for a guarantee. I ask the Leader of the Opposition to give a guarantee. - I ask the Leader of the Opposition to give a guarantee that if he were to become Prime Minister of this country -  - The Leader of the Opposition has had numerous opportunities to guarantee -  -  - that the existing private health insurance arrangement will be maintained in full -  - and he has repeatedly passed up those opportunities. - The Labor Party is intent on running a campaign of fear and distortion about Medicare. We remain committed to Medicare. We also remain committed to the maintenance of private health insurance. We have also massively increased money to the states for public hospitals. The package we announced a few months ago is for a fairer and an even better Medicare, which has been the result of this government's policies over the last 7½ years.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Mitchell for his question and I know -  - how seriously he takes the concerns of people in this industry, particularly the subcontractors living in his electorate. I can inform the House that today I released an exposure draft of legislation designed to implement the principal recommendations -   - of the Cole royal commission. It is important to restore the rule of law in this industry because industrial bloody-mindedness is imposing much higher costs on the Australian public than are necessary. This is a $40 billion industry. It employs 700,000 people. It is six per cent of the Australian economy and it is important that the rule of law be restored to it.Because of restrictive practices and frequent stoppages the respected analyst Econtech estimates that doing the same job in the same way costs 10 per cent more on average in the commercial construction industry than it would in the housing industry.Econtech estimates that, if labour productivity in the commercial construction industry matched that in the housing industry, our CPI would be one per cent lower, our GDP would be one per cent higher and there would be $2.3 billion a year in economic benefits to Australian consumers. If there was just a one per cent saving in the Commonwealth's $5 billion-a-year construction bill, that would liberate $50 million a year more to be spent on things like schools, roads, hospitals and national security. As the royal commission found, the industry's problems mostly stem from the insistence of some unionists on a `no ticket, no start' culture and the consequent coercion and intimidation which denies ordinary Australian workers their rights at law.Most importantly, the draft legislation establishes an Australian building and construction commission, a new industry watchdog - a cop on the beat, if you like - with powers to gather evidence, prosecute offences and enforce judgments. I want to make it very clear that this industry does not need more negotiations; what it needs are new institutional arrangements to ensure that breaking the law has serious consequences. The government will be taking public submissions on the exposure draft for the next month, and I want to assure all members of the House, on the government side and on the opposition side, that we welcome all submissions from people who are seriously trying to ensure that the honest workers and the honest businesses of Australia get the clean construction industry they deserve.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. On 1 September the Mayne Group Ltd did notify Defence of their withdrawal from negotiations as the preferred tenderer for the provision of defence health services in Victoria. This was a disappointing development. The benefits of this contract were expected to include a more rational and productive use of ADF health assets. It was expected to include some significant cost savings and, more importantly, it would release more uniformed personnel to the sharp end of our defence forces. Despite the opposition's opportunistic claims, the decision of Mayne Group Ltd does not reflect a bungled attempt to outsource health services in Victoria, nor has this process degraded the medical capacity of our services to our personnel. The government remains committed to a policy of market testing services, such as non-operational health support. This is only done where it is appropriate to do so. This policy has already seen a significant increase in the delivery of uniformed personnel to the sharp end of our defence. I also assure all Victorian based ADF personnel that they will continue to have access to the top-quality health care that they deserve. I am now considering a number of options for future health care delivery in Victoria. In the meantime, I can guarantee that the services will continue under existing arrangements. -  Yes, I was quoting from a confidential document.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I am pleased to be able to say that this morning at the annual Safeskies conference, which has become quite a notable event on the aviation calendar - it brings together the best expertise in all areas of aviation from right around the world - I was able to take the opportunity to launch the second edition of the Australian Air Traffic Management Strategic Plan, and I think this is worthy of some note. Australia has always been a leader, if not the leader, in air traffic management. Today we are finding that our expertise and our capacities are winning considerable markets internationally. Indeed, we are determined to maintain our technological leadership, and the plan launched today will help ensure that we do. I have an overview of the plan here and I will table it for anyone who is interested.The strategic plan is the result of a lot of work between government agencies and the aviation sector. It will see us take advantage of the rapid emergence of new communication, navigation and surveillance technologies. Under the plan we will, amongst other things, be able to replace the existing fixed aviation routes around the country with a system where airlines can fly directly - which they often cannot do now. For example, to get from Sydney to Brisbane, they go over Casino; that is not a direct route. Under the new arrangements, airlines will be able to fly directly to their destination with the same level of safety that they enjoy now through the use of satellite navigation technology, data links between aircraft and the air traffic management system. Over the next few years this will actually make quite a difference. It will reduce flight times on some major routes in Australia and on a lot of minor routes as well; lower operating costs; lower fuel usage, with attendant benefits in emissions and pollution outcomes; reduce aircraft maintenance requirements; and help us cope with the congestion at our airports. As an important step towards implementing the plan, I also announce today that, as part of this, Airservices will establish 20 ground stations across Australia for a new air traffic control technology. That will give complete coverage of the mainland. Conversely, we have never had air traffic control radar coverage across the whole continent, particularly in the outback and far-flung regions where not many planes fly, because of the immense cost of radar and the vast size of Australia. But under this new approach the system will cover virtually the entire continent at a fraction of the cost of installing and operating radars. Initially, particularly for flights operating at over 30,000 feet, it will enable pinpoint accuracy in tracking all aircraft movements. That will increase safety, as air traffic controllers will be able to pinpoint precisely all aircraft equipped with the system. It will reduce air traffic control delays, and it will ensure that controllers are able to space aircraft more closely, which enables better safety and better congestion management.This is another area where we can proudly say we genuinely lead the world. I think we are all proud of that. I certainly commend everyone in the Australian aviation sector who has put us into that position. With the new CASA coming on stream, with airspace reform, with liberalised skies and with the successful, or largely successful, rewrite of the nation's aviation regulations, I think we are set for a welcome and strong surge in growth in the aviation sector in this country.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. On 25 August 2003 the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence announced that the government had decided to close the Defence expression of interest for the process of recognition of the site's unique environmental and heritage values, instead of offering a strictly controlled lease for the 90-hectare portion of the site. I am unaware of the Treasurer's comments, but I am happy to inform the honourable member that on 25 August this year the government announced the Commonwealth's decision to open up and return the Defence land owned at Point Nepean to the people of Australia.The 90-hectare portion of Defence land at Portsea that includes a number of heritage buildings will be offered for lease for 40 years plus a 10-year option. Under the lease, the 90-hectare site will remain in Commonwealth government ownership, which will ensure maximum preservation of the heritage values - including, I might add, Aboriginal heritage - and protection of the environment. Land uses will be restricted to education, recreation, community and tourism. The 12 key aspects of the draft community master plan will be achieved through public ownership of the site, the exclusion of residential development, restoration of public access -   - conservation of significant habitats and the management of heritage buildings. A call for tenders for the lease will occur early this month -  - and all information will be publicly available on the Defence web site.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Mackellar for her question and I acknowledge the tenacity she has shown in nailing this long-running scam. As the House knows, taxpayers are paying more to rent an office in Barton than they would pay to rent an office in midtown New York, thanks to the dodgy deal negotiated between the Keating Labor government and the Australian Labor Party. This is a rolled gold rip-off and is costing taxpayers $3.5 million a year. I have some new information which I would like to share with the House about the so-called obstacles to renegotiating this lease. In March 2002, the Australian Audit Office wrote to John Curtin House asking for a review of the terms of the Centenary House lease. On 28 August last year, Mr Paul Wilkinson, the Secretary of John Curtin House, responded:The directors are, of course, willing to give consideration to your request.However, I must advise that the view we provided in April of last year to a similar request is likely to remain. As you would be aware, the company's mortgagee, Macquarie Bank Limited, was heavily involved in the original lease negotiations and the structure of the borrowing was based on the certainty of the future cash flow generated by the agreed fixed rental increases.Any variation to the rentals would create difficulties for the company in meeting its obligations to the mortgagee. There are three facts alleged by the Australian Labor Party: first, that they got the lease deal and then borrowed the money; second, that they needed the lease deal to repay the money; and, third, that they could not possibly renegotiate the lease because then they could not afford to meet their debt. I am now in a position to let the House know the true situation. Information revealed through the Senate estimates process shows that the mortgage was in fact taken out 18 months before the lease deal. That is lie No. 1. The Keating government signed this deal to bail the Labor Party out of serious financial trouble. The escalation clause is nine per cent and the mortgage interest is just 7.74 per cent. That is lie No. 2. They do not need the nine per cent escalation clause to survive. John Curtin House made an after-tax profit last year of nearly $3 million. It gave $2.4 million to the Australian Labor Party. That is lie No. 3. They do not need the lease deal to survive. This functionary of the Australian Labor Party, Mr Paul Wilkinson, has made the directors of John Curtin House party to a series of lies. Who are the directors of John Curtin House? They are Michael Field, the former Labor Premier of Tasmania; Gerry Hand, the former Labor federal minister; Robert Pearce, a former state Labor cabinet minister; and Geoff Walsh, a former ALP national secretary. I call on the Leader of the Opposition to make honest men of the directors of Centenary House by renegotiating this lease. If the Leader of the Opposition had the slightest shred, the merest skerrick, of respect for the taxpayers of Australia, he would be content with a commercial rent. I call on the Leader of the Opposition to give back the money. Give back the $3.5 million you are ripping off every year from the honest taxpayers of Australia! </DOC>

I think she is doing a first-class job, and during her time as minister a number of very significant reforms have been undertaken. I point out to the member for Lilley that, if you look at the movement in income support under this government, if you look at the family assistance policies of this government, you will find that in the 7½ years that we have been in office there have been significant enhancements in all areas.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Sturt for his question. The member for Sturt, coming from South Australia, would recognise that the FTA we are negotiating with the United States is of significant importance to all Australians for the future generation of economic growth and wealth in Australia, particularly in South Australia, given that a lot of Australia's auto industry is located there - up in your part of South Australia, Mr Speaker - as well as the great Australian wine industry. I understand that the United States is almost about to pass, if it has not already passed, the United Kingdom as Australia's No. 1 destination for wine exports.The question was about the importance of what we are negotiating. It gives us an opportunity to pursue bilaterally what we might not be able to achieve multilaterally. We know that historically the Australian Labor Party has preferred to have all its eggs in the one basket, and it still holds this view. It just wants to focus on the multilateral agenda and continue to pursue that. As a government, we have not been prepared to take the risk of that going on the slow track as it did last week in Cancun. Interestingly, we had a representative of the Labor Party in Cancun. We took a broad based delegation, and a representative of the Labor Party was with us. Of course, he was back in the parliament yesterday saying that it was a failure of the government's trade policy that Cancun stumbled last week. If the charge is the government looking after the national interest, then we are guilty as charged. We remember that the outcome of the Uruguay Round - and mind you, Mr Speaker, there were at least two meetings that stumbled during the Uruguay Round - was not a fantastic deal for Australian farmers.  - It was done by the Labor Party. The President of the NFF, the National Farmers Federation -  - put the cap on this when he said - and this is in response to the allegations made by the Labor Party:While we were frustrated and disappointed, at the end of the day a situation where we don't get a result is better than being faced with a bad result.That was a direct reference to what came out of the Uruguay Round of negotiations. - It was a bad result for Australia's farmers. We are not prepared to pursue a bad result just to get a result in the negotiations. If it takes more time and more energy to get a decent result out of the multilateral agenda, we will do it. But at the same time we have the ability to pursue negotiations bilaterally that will deliver early benefits to Australia's exporters.At the outset of our government's policy position on this, we did have some support from the Labor Party. The then shadow spokesman, Senator Cook, and the then Leader of the Opposition, Kim Beazley, supported the concept in principle of pursuing a free trade agreement with the United States. The member for Rankin, when he became the shadow minister, then led the Labor Party right off the field on this issue. We live in hope that the new spokesman on trade, Senator Conroy, might bring the Labor Party back on track to help deliver an outcome that will deliver benefits and jobs to many Australians.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Lilley for the question. Effective marginal tax rates is an expression that describes a combination of the impact of the withdrawal of a benefit and the actual tax paid on your taxable income. The truth is that effective marginal tax rates, as so defined, have existed under Labor governments and Liberal governments and no attempt was made by Labor in office to abolish them. The reality is that unless this country is willing to have a completely non-income tested welfare system - and I do not hear the Australian Labor Party advocating that - you will always have a situation where, as people's incomes rise and if those people are in receipt of benefits or family tax payments, once they reach certain points of income the value of those benefits will decline and ultimately disappear. That is the ordinary operation of the welfare and benefit system. It is quite dishonest of anybody in this House to try and suggest that there is some new revelation about that. When Labor was in office, it made a virtue of targeting, on an income-tested basis, welfare payments and family allowances. The reality is that that has been a policy followed by both sides of politics for a very considerable period of time.  - Because the question relates to the position of families under the Australian tax and welfare system, I would like to inform the opposition of the results of some analysis carried out by the federal Treasury of the impact of the new tax system - that is, analysis of the disposable incomes of Australians before the new tax system was introduced and a year after the introduction of the system. This analysis found that all family types - all family types, Mr Speaker - had a greater real disposable income 12 months after the introduction of tax reform. The increase in real disposable income was generally significantly higher for couples with children and for sole parents than for households without children.The analysis found - contrary to what the Labor Party is trying to allege - that couples with children in the bottom income quintile received a real increase in average disposable income of $36 a week. Couples with children in the second bottom quintile received a real increase of $51 a week. Couples with children in the top income quintile received an real increase in average disposable income of $32 a week. Sole parents across all income quintiles received an average real increase of between $34 and $46 a week. Working families in the lower income quintiles saw greater proportional increases in their disposable incomes than those in the highest income quintiles. The Treasury notes that its analysis did not include the additional benefits from improved child-care subsidies, which would significantly add to the benefits I have outlined. What those figures demonstrate conclusively is that under this government the real value of benefits, both tax and otherwise, to Australian families has increased significantly. - It is marked `confidential'.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Forde for her question. This morning I released the 2001 national greenhouse gas inventory, which shows that Australia remains on track to reach the target of 108 per cent of 1990 emissions by 2010. The inventory shows that over the last year we have actually moved closer to the target, with projections for 2008-12 coming down from 111 per cent to 110 per cent. This is a very satisfactory result. The first implication of this, of course, is that the current greenhouse gas measures - towards which the government has put almost $1 billion - are working; these measures are delivering. The latest estimate is that the existing measures will reduce Australia's emissions by some 67 million tonnes by 2010. That is up from 60 million tonnes last year and is equivalent to taking all vehicles off the road. The second major implication of these figures is that under the Howard government we have begun the process of decoupling greenhouse gas emissions from economic growth. While the economy continues to grow strongly, by the end of the decade greenhouse gas intensity is expected to be 44 per cent lower than it was in 1990. That means that for every dollar of GDP the level of greenhouse gas we emit is lower year by year. In fact, in 2001 greenhouse gas emissions were no higher than they were in 1990.This does not mean that we can relax, but it does mean that Australia has no need to go down the job-destroying, industry-destroying track that Crean Labor wants it to go down. It is no wonder that the Labor premiers have dissociated themselves from the policy of federal Labor. I remind the House that, last year in September, Peter Beattie, the Premier of Queensland, said that ratifying the Kyoto protocol would cost jobs in Queensland. When a journalist challenged Premier Beattie on this point and said, `That is what John Howard is arguing as well,' Mr Beattie replied:Well, it's true. I mean, I'm just telling what the truth is.And it was the Western Australian Premier who said:I'm not happy about the Commonwealth just signing up ...So, on such an important matter as greenhouse gas emissions, the Leader of the Opposition is not even able to carry the whole of the Labor Party with him. Even his own party does not believe the policy that he is advocating. The real difference between Labor and the coalition is that we are doing the hard policy yards, putting the resources into cutting back on greenhouse gas emissions and reducing land clearing. It is not by ratifying a flawed international agreement that you are going to solve this problem; it is by practical and effective measures, by proper community and industry partnerships, and by a global framework - and that is what Australia is working towards.</DOC>

 - I am aware that Senator Vanstone has received a question in the Senate, as she did yesterday. But my understanding is that, like many things that come from the member for Grayndler, this is somewhat distorted from what actually happened. To address one of the points that was raised, in the appropriations this government have made it quite clear that we intend to expend some $2.1 billion on helping Australians into work over the next three years. It was appropriated in the budget; it is there in the papers. The member for Grayndler and the Labor Party call this a bailout - spending the money that has been appropriated for the purpose it was designed to be spent on. There has been no bailout of the Job Network. It simply seems that the member for Grayndler and the Labor Party are fixated on trying to nitpick and not on getting to the basis of driving unemployment down, which is what this government are focused on. I will go to the specific allegations. The 60,000 people that I referred to are job seekers that in August had not attended interviews. That number was correct at the time and those figures can be substantiated. In other words, there have been 1.6 million appointments made for job seekers to come in to be helped by the Job Network, and there have been approximately 900,000 of those not taken up. This is a serious issue and one that this side of the House takes on as its responsibility - to ensure that unemployed people come in and receive the services that are payed for by the taxpayer to help them get into work.As I have informed the House in the last few weeks, since the introduction of Job Network 3 there have been some 6,000-plus jobs created for long- and short-term unemployed people - welfare recipients - by the Job Network. Centrelink will continue to work with the Department of Family and Community Services and my department, DEWR, to ensure that people who are not turning up to appointments are given every encouragement to do so and that, if they do not, the appropriate action is taken by that department. We as a government stand by that policy.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Forrest for the question. Many Landcare groups operate very successfully in his electorate and, indeed, right across Australia. The Commonwealth is supporting approximately 4,500 Landcare groups around Australia and there are about 100,000 Australians involved in the thousands of Landcare projects that are occurring around our nation. Forty per cent of farmers are involved with Landcare, and around three-quarters of farmers say that they have received advice from Landcare about the way in which they should care for their own resource base and develop improved management practices.This government has provided around $335 million to Landcare, and that is money in addition to what is provided through the Natural Heritage Trust and the national action plan. The special thing about Landcare is the way in which it is a community driven program. It involves the mobilisation of community effort towards achieving priority local initiatives. It is a model that has attracted interest around the world; many other countries are interested in setting up Landcare-type programs. Over the next three years, this government is committed to a further $122 million in Landcare funding. All of that is in addition to the $3 billion commitments that have been made towards the national action plan and the Natural Heritage Trust. Some of the specific projects that we will be funding under the Landcare initiative over the next 12 months include $1.5 million to support innovative and sustainable production practices, $25 million towards on the ground sustainable natural resource management activities, $700,000 to develop new drought and flood warning systems and also funding for 70 Landcare coordinators to support this network. The key element is that the Landcare movement has delivered a great deal to rural management over recent years. A current review of its activities reflects the enormous public support that Landcare has around Australia.In the past, Landcare has enjoyed a great deal of bipartisan support. It has been therefore somewhat unfortunate to hear all the scaremongering and negative comments by the opposition about Landcare over recent times. When it comes to new natural resource management initiatives, Labor is the driest of dry gullies; there will be no initiatives coming from it. But surely it could at least enthusiastically support what Landcare is achieving throughout rural Australia.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dobell for his question and his keen interest in representing and also listening to young people. It was not so long ago that I was at the Oasis Youth Centre in Wyong, where a very large group of young people were telling us about some of the good things the coalition are doing and we were taking on their advice of areas of improvement. As I mentioned yesterday, the best thing you can do for a young person is to give them a job, but along the way you have to give them financial incentives. That is where programs like Youth Allowance, which was introduced by the coalition government, have been extraordinarily successful.Under the old Austudy when the Labor Party was last in power, there was a positive disincentive to go on to further study. It was easier to get the dole than to go on to further study. With Youth Allowance today over 380,000 young Australians are taking up further education and training, and many of them are also eligible for rent assistance that they never had under the old Austudy proposal. Indeed, I am talking about not just students in the mainstream but also young Australians who could be at risk in programs like Reconnect. I was recently in the member for Hinkler's electorate talking to the Roseberry Youth Service and in the member for Deakin's electorate talking to Eastern Access Community Health. They were very complimentary about the Reconnect program. As the program suggests, it is all about trying to help young people in particular who may be at risk of homelessness or who are homeless to reconnect with their families or employment. A good example of how the government is listening occurred last week, when many members of the parliament attended the Youth Roundtable - and I thank those members who attended. Fifty young Australians came to Canberra and gave the parliament their wisdom and ideas, which the coalition government took on board. But the member for Dobell asked an interesting question: are there any alternatives? I am very pleased to see that the shadow minister for children and youth, Senator Jacinta Collins, had some very interesting insights into how the Labor Party has failed to listen to young people and is continuing to disregard them. I get a strong sense of dj vu, but just yesterday I was complimenting her on her praise of the Prime Minister and how he inspires young people - and of course it is the policies of this government. Her comments in the Age of 22 August are particularly interesting. In giving some interesting pieces of advice to her Labor Party colleagues, she said:The ALP needs not only the enthusiasm and hard work of young people; it needs the ideas of young people.Fair enough. She continued:It is hardly surprising that so many young people are deserting Labor in favour not only of minor parties such as the Greens but in favour of the conservatives, when the national president of the ALP, Greg Sword, will not defend the rights of young people in the ALP.I have to say that the pen is mightier than the sword! This is just a clear example again of where Senator Jacinta Collins is being upfront and honest about how the Australian Labor Party has failed to represent, let alone listen to, young people. Indeed, it is the coalition government that is acting and listening to Australia's young people.</DOC>

 - I dealt with this issue yesterday when I made it clear that, in relation to this issue, the comments that Mr Kisrwani made on television were flawed. The donation was not made at that time; it came to the conference in January. I also made it clear that, in relation to that matter, there was no inconsistency in what I have said on these issues over time. The point I have made is that I became aware of the donation when these matters were raised. I do not get people handing me a list of those people who make donations to the Berowra conference.An opposition member - You do. - I do not. The office bearers of my conference fulfil their obligations as they are required to do under the act. I neither seek information from them nor am I provided with information. I became aware of this issue when it was debated in the last session and when it was brought to my attention that this information had been included in the party's return. That is the reality. That is what happened.Mr Kisrwani offered a view. I said that his recollection must have been faulty when he spoke about the campaign launch. On the advice that I was given by the party treasurer, the matter of when a payment was made was revealed to me. He wrote after the television program to tell me that the payment was received by cheque on 2 January 2002. As I commented yesterday, the further return which the honourable member for Gellibrand tabled yesterday was a reconstruction. It was clearly a reconstruction, because the document was dated October 2002.  - I simply make the point that everybody is asked whether or not they wish to confirm that they have made a donation and information is sought by the electoral office. That was sought in that particular case and obviously tabled. It was a reconstruction then and the recollection of Mr Kisrwani was faulty on television. I think that answers the question.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Blair for his question and his ongoing interest in employment issues. Most members of this House would be aware that the OECD conducted a very extensive inquiry into the Job Network and reported on that for the benefit of not only this country but countries throughout the OECD. That report stated that the Job Network was efficient and that it actually delivers better results at a lower cost than employment services of the previous Labor government. It also made some very pertinent points about Working Nation. It said that the impact of Labor's Working Nation on employment was probably negative. Just remember that $3 billion was spent by the then employment minister, the now Leader of the Opposition, on Working Nation. Yet the OECD - not any branch of the Liberal or National parties or anything to do with the Australian government - in a totally independent report stated that the impact of Working Nation was in fact probably negative; in other words, Labor's policy of helping the unemployed actually stopped them from getting jobs. Since the OECD report -  - The Leader of the Opposition interjects, `How did we create a million jobs?' The Leader of the Opposition, when he was in government, created a million unemployed. We had 11 per cent unemployment, with over a million unemployed Australians. There have been 1.2 million Australians who have gained employment in the 7½ years since the Howard government has been in office. That is a record that we on this side of the House are proud of. What other countries are taking our lead? The Netherlands is now implementing similar programs. We have Germany expressing interest in NIES. The German employers association is very interested in workplace structural changes. I am asked: are there any alternative programs put up by the Labor Party? If you look at their web site, you see that the answer is: no, not one. On ABC radio in Adelaide on 15 August, after bagging out the Job Network and the fine job that organisations like Mission Australia and Salvation Army Employment Plus are providing each and every day - commitment to the unemployed - we had the member for Grayndler stand up and go on and on with a lot of diatribe, with a lot of baseless information about the Job Network. He was asked the pertinent question by the interviewer:  So you will take back, you will do away with the privatised network and you will bring all of these functions back into government if elected? Mr Albanese answered:No, certainly not. The interviewer asked:Oh, you're not? Mr Albanese said:Certainly not. That's not what we're arguing at all. That led the interviewer to say:That's the great Labor cop-out, Anthony Albanese. That is exactly what he is - a total cop-out. He has deserted Labor. He has no friends over there. They have no policy on the web site. Yet here we have a party that pretends to represent the worker. Our party has put 1.2 million Australians into work and we represent the workers of this country.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Paterson for his question and congratulate him on encouraging Virgin to fly from Newcastle to Melbourne direct at fares as low as $69. It is just a shame no-one in the Labor Party was lobbying Virgin. Well done to the member for Paterson!  -  - There was a great and positive announcement from the Australian government this morning: we are going to increase the duty-free allowance for every traveller to and from Australia from $400 to $900. That will be warmly welcomed by travellers - by the more than three million Australians who travel every year and the nearly five million international travellers who come to Australia every year. We are going to more than double the general concession for adults from $400 to $900 and for minors from $200 to $450. We are also going to double the alcohol allowance, so that now people can bring into Australia 2.25 litres of alcohol - that is, three bottles of wine or two 1.125 litre bottles of alcohol. It is terrific for families, because it means they can -  -  - That is a great initiative for families that travel, because now the average family of four has a duty-free allowance of up to $3,000 to spend. It will be warmly welcomed by the various parts of the tourism and transport industry. It means a significant windfall for the airports, when they have been doing it pretty tough. They rely heavily on duty-free -  - Duty-free is an important part of the revenue for airports around Australia. This is a more than doubling of the allowable duty-free expense. Therefore, they will be big beneficiaries. A number of small retailers are also going to benefit from this, and airlines are of course going to benefit, because the airlines have onboard duty-free. This is a substantial injection of cash into the Australian transport industry.There is one little catch: we need the states to sign up to the deal now, because there is a GST implication. The Assistant Treasurer has today written to the premiers, asking them under the GST agreement to sign up to this deal. We want the deal in place by the beginning of the Rugby World Cup, when so many people are going to be coming here. We want people to be able to spend more on Australian made souvenirs when they come out for the Rugby World Cup. It is important that the state Labor premiers sign up. The member for Werriwa is always keen to pass commentary. Whether it be a ringside commentary on the Carr versus Singo bout or whether it be on some other event, he is always keen to pass commentary. But, when it comes to getting Labor's mates in the states to lift their pens and do something for Australians or Australian small business, you can never rely on the Labor Party to do anything. Here is a challenge for the member for Hotham and the member for Werriwa: instead of providing a running commentary on Bob Carr, now is your chance to do something for Australian business. Get out there and get the Labor states to sign off on a deal that is going to be a significant windfall for Australian travellers and Australian small business.</DOC>

 - I will go back over the transcript of A Current Affair. - I will, because you are a serial offender. The Leader of the Opposition is a serial offender when it comes to misquoting people. Let me say this: the new health minister, I think, has got off to a remarkable start. The new health minister has engaged the medical profession. The new health minister has, quite properly, provided a circuit-breaker to the medical profession in relation to the issue of medical indemnity, and I am greatly indebted to the Leader of the Opposition for asking me about medical indemnity. It enables me to remind the House that this government has already committed some $700 million of taxpayers' money over a period of 10 years in order to address the issue of medical indemnity. The House ought to remember that the reason there is a problem with medical indemnity insurance in Australia at the present time is that the negligence laws of this country have been allowed to develop to a situation where claims are getting out of hand and premiums are rising. As even the Leader of the Opposition must know, the Commonwealth parliament has no power over the negligence laws of Australia - none whatsoever. The doctors are being asked to meet the IBNR levy for two reasons: the negligence laws got out of control due to the failure of the states to bring them up to date - not the failure of any Commonwealth government, be it Labor or Liberal - and of course there was the mismanagement of UMP.But that is the past. The present - and the future - is more relevant to this parliament. By the 18-month moratorium for any levies over and above $1,000 a year, what the minister has done is to remove the levy as a current reason for any doctor to withdraw his or her services. If doctors claim they have a reason to withdraw their services now, it cannot be because of the levy alone. The reason I say that is that by providing that circuit-breaker, by providing that moratorium, the minister, and therefore the government, has removed the levy as a reason. I say to the doctors who are considering withdrawing their services: we have made a contribution - a fair, responsive contribution - to resolving this difficult issue, and we ask them to make a contribution by suspending any plans to withdraw their services. That will not help their cause in the eyes of the Australian community. It will not help the public hospital systems of the states of Australia - over which we have no control, although we provide more money to fund the public hospitals than the states do.I say to the doctors of Australia: we are prepared to meet you halfway, we are prepared to sit down and talk about things, but understand that by providing the moratorium we have removed the levy as a justification for you to withdraw your services. I think that is a fair offer by the federal government. I think it is an offer the Australian people see as fair. I ask the doctors to come halfway and continue their discussions with the minister - who, as I say, has got off to an excellent start in his new portfolio - and together we can resolve this issue in the interests of all of the Australian people.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Makin for her question, and I can inform her and other members that over the past few days I have been familiarising myself with Australia's health system and the various challenges it faces. I can tell the House that Australia has a good health system, but it does have some significant contemporary problems. The most pressing is the medical indemnity issue, which is threatening to drive some doctors from public hospitals in Sydney. Then there is the question of ensuring affordable access to a local GP. Mr Speaker, this government cannot solve all problems, but we are determined to make a difference. One thing that I have learnt, travelling around Australia over the past few days, is that Australians do not want ministers and shadow ministers to play politics with their health, and that means telling the truth about the system and about plans to improve it. I regret to inform the House that, unfortunately, Labor is telling lies about Medicare. I regret to inform the House that at least three Labor members of this House have been distributing misinformation about Medicare - and there may be more. The members for Scullin, Lowe and Banks have said in brochures or advertisements, `The federal government wants to charge a $20 fee every time you visit your doctor.' This is simply not true. The lie is being repeated; it is simply not true, and members opposite know it. This government's position is identical to that of Neal Blewett, the original architect of Medicare: we want bulk-billing to be available but we do not think it can or should be compulsory.Not only do we have these dodgy dodges being distributed by Labor members but also we have the members for Sydney and Lowe, as well as Senator Ludwig, asking their constituents to sign petitions based on a lie. So the party that brought us push polling has now introduced push petitioning to tell lies about our Medicare system. How do we know it is a lie? We know that Labor is spreading lies because the member for Lalor has said so. She has admitted that what Labor members are spreading are lies. I quote from the Canberra Times of Friday, 19 September: A spokesman for Ms Gillard conceded the claims were not true ...Labor are quite shameless. They are quite shameless because the fact that these claims are not true has not stopped the member for Lalor from distributing in her own electorate petitions stating, `We therefore pray that the House opposes the introduction of an up-front fee for GP visits.' Mr Speaker, the only person who has ever introduced an up-front fee for GP visits is the member for Lalor's mentor, Brian Howe. He is the only person in this country who has ever tried to do this. I ask the member for Lalor to come clean. How many dodgy dodges have been distributed? How many bodgie petitions have been sent out? How many Australians have been asked to sign petitions based on a lie? I call on the member for Lalor to withdraw these petitions and apologise to those Australians whom Labor have conned.</DOC>

 - The answer to the first part of the question is no. I am not aware of Dr Wooldridge's speech -  - I repeat that I was not aware of that address. But I am aware, now that I have had the time, that again the Leader of the Opposition has deliberately misquoted something I have said. I have actually looked up the transcript of the A Current Affair interview and the question that was asked of me in which the word `crisis' was used was not asked specifically in relation to medical indemnity; it was asked in relation to the generality of the health system. I said then what I say now - that the Australian health system is a system that is superior to the health systems of most comparable countries around the world, and I do not think that the Leader of the Opposition does any service to the Australian health system in his frantic campaign to try to create a sense of crisis in relation to an important public policy issue where, clearly, there are areas of deficiency and, clearly, there are areas where improvement can be made. But let me just remind the House again that, under the constitutional arrangements in this country, state governments have responsibility for running public hospitals. Public hospitals are totally controlled and administered by state governments. Successive federal governments have had no say in the administration of state hospitals in this country. The current Medicare funding agreement will provide an increase of 17 per cent in real terms over the next five years for the running of public hospitals in Australia. It remains the case that even though the federal government does not run or administer the state hospitals in Australia the federal government puts more money into state hospitals than the state governments do.  The proposition that every time there is a difficulty in the administration of the state hospitals of this country - be they in Victoria, New South Wales or Western Australia - that every time there is a problem with a waiting list or that every time somebody is not given urgent attention it is automatically the responsibility of the federal government is an absurd proposition and one that this government will continue to reject. We will accept responsibility for the things that we have responsibility for under the constitutional arrangements in this country. I go immediately to the issue of private health insurance. We have direct responsibility for private health insurance. - I am very happy, Mr Speaker, if you like and if the opposition like, to conclude my remarks by pointing out that the Leader of the Opposition completely misrepresented what I said on the Ray Martin program.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Boothby for his question, and I appreciate his deep commitment to private heath insurance, along with that of all members of this government. This government believes that private health insurance is an important part of Australia's health system, because it takes the pressure off our public hospitals and helps to reduce waiting lists. Unfortunately, under the former government the percentage of Australians who had private health insurance plummeted to almost 30 per cent. The percentage of Australians who have access to private health insurance has now gone up to nearly 44 per cent thanks to this government's policies - in particular, the private health insurance rebate which this government has put in. That is nine million Australians who enjoy the added security and protection that private health insurance provides. Those nine million Australians know where this government stands, and they deserve to know where the alternative government of this country stands. But they do not know, because members opposite do not know what they think and do not know what they stand for. Individually they know, but collectively they do not know. When asked about the private health insurance rebate, the member for Jagajaga said: It is a huge area of expenditure and a lot of people are figuring out that it isn't worth having.So the Deputy Leader of the Opposition clearly wants to scrap the private health insurance rebate. When asked about it, the member for Fraser said:There will be more than just health about which people are complaining when they see the cuts we are prepared to make.So the macho member for Fraser and shadow finance minister certainly wants to scrap the private health insurance rebate.Then there is the shadow Treasurer. The shadow Treasurer says that he is inclined, sort of, up to a point, kind of, to support the private health insurance rebate. But can you believe him, because this is what he has said before? Talking about the private health insurance rebate, in this very parliament he mentioned the `madness'. He was not talking about anyone whom he knows well; he was talking about the private health insurance - the `madness' of this government's multibillion dollar private health insurance rebate. When speaking about the private health insurance rebate, he said:This is bad economics. It is an appalling piece of public policy.On another occasion in this parliament, when talking of the private health insurance rebate, he went on to say:This is a first-rate absurdity.So we all know what the real beliefs of the shadow Treasurer are. The one person who has not told us where he stands is, of course, the Leader of the Opposition. I call on the Leader of the Opposition to state clearly whether and in what form he supports the private health insurance rebate so that nine million Australians can plan their health future with security and confidence.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question; no doubt she has spent many days setting out that tricky little formulation. But we do get up early in the morning and we can see these tricky little questions when they are coming. We do like stepping down the crease every now and then and actually hitting them gently out towards the boundary, so I thank her. I will say in answer that Senator Coonan is a minister in her own right.  -  -  - Surprisingly enough, she is a minister in her own right and is perfectly capable of handling the indemnity issue and has very well indeed - not on my behalf but because she happens to be a very talented person in her own right. The point that Senator Coonan made was simply this: in relation to the doctors' mutual, because there had been underpricing in relation to tort law and there had been large verdicts, the mutual was not able to deal with all claims which had been incurred but not reported. As a consequence of that, the government stepped in with financial accommodation of the order of $400 million or $450 million. It gave the financial accommodation to the doctors to handle those claims, and under Senator Coonan's guidance has gone back to all of the states and argued for tort law reform to put this on a proper basis. That tort law reform, incidentally, was opposed by some of the states, in particular the Victorian Labor Party, under pressure from trade union lawyers, some of whom the honourable member may well be familiar with - over the years they have made quite a deal of money out of this particular area. In return, what the government said was that the liability, which the taxpayer had picked up, would be recovered over time on an orderly work-out through a levy for incurred but not reported claims. For those who had retired there would be an exemption in relation to those claims. For those that would have had abnormal expenses there would be financial accommodation and an equalisation.What the new minister for health announced the other day was that the incurred but not reported levy would be paid up to $1,000 but there would then be an actuarial investigation in relation to the recovery of the balance after allowance had been made for the tort law reform with the hope that it would reduce liabilities. That is what he announced. Nobody could argue with the proposition that you would do an actuarial analysis to actually see the amount that was involved. But there is one point where we would disagree with the AMA and it is this: the AMA has regularly called the IBNR levy a tax. It is no such thing. The IBNR levy is the recovery of a premium for a legal liability. Doctors are not the only profession that has professional insurance. Accountants, auditors, engineers and lawyers all have professional indemnity insurance. They all pay premiums. None of them actually call it a tax because it is a premium for an insurance - that is, a product which you get by way of indemnity.In addition to that, can I also point out that those levies are in fact tax deductible - that is, they are a necessary expenditure incurred in the course of carrying on a business and earning income. So it is a tax deduction in the hands of the doctors for an orderly work-out for a taxpayer to pick up in relation to a problem which emerged which will be addressed with tort law reform. It has been handled brilliantly by Senator Coonan, with the addition and the expertise of the latest but greatest, in the last couple of days, new minister for health. </DOC>

 - The government reported last week the final budget outcome for the budget ended 30 June 2003. After seven budgets for which we now have a final budget outcome under the Howard government, this was the fifth budget surplus. It was a surplus of $7½ billion or one per cent of GDP. That will reduce Commonwealth net debt. Since this government has been in office, Commonwealth net debt has now been reduced by a record $66 billion. The budget outcomes prior to the election of this government - and one will bear in mind that the member for Werriwa has just announced that Labor is the party of the surplus rather than the deficit, so it may well be worth reminding the House of this fact - were that, in the last Labor budget, the budget deficit was $10 billion or two per cent of GDP. In the budget before that, the deficit was $13 billion or 2.8 per cent of GDP. In the budget before that, the budget deficit was $17 billion or 3.8 per cent of GDP. In the budget before that, Labor's fourth last budget, it was $17 billion or four per cent of GDP. In the budget before that, it was $11½ billion or 2.9 per cent of GDP.  - The Commonwealth net debt under those five budgets of Labor - and I think the member for Werriwa was in the parliament for all of those budgets -  - What? He was only here for four of those budget deficits? He is absolved; he was only here for four of those budget deficits. The Commonwealth net debt under those budget deficits rocketed to $96 billion. Since the election of this government, we have now reduced that by $66 billion. As I said in the 1996 budget, the coalition had not created the problem of government debt, but the coalition would fix it.  - As a consequence of that - and this is the figure I would ask the House to bear in mind - when this government was elected, the servicing of Commonwealth debt required $8.5 billion of taxes. Because that debt has now been reduced by $66 billion, the servicing of Commonwealth debt now requires $3.6 billion. That is a built-in saving to the budget of $5 billion year after year. Because we have reduced debt, we have a recurrent annual saving of $5 billion to the budget.  - If Labor's position were still in place, we would have to raise another $5 billion of taxes to service the Labor debt. - But by getting the Labor debt down by that $66 billion, we now have a built-in saving to the Commonwealth budget of $5 billion a year. I say to the taxpayers of Australia: we can therefore have the same outcome on $5 billion of better expenditure or $5 billion of less tax.I described the member for Werriwa earlier as an Aladdin's cave of conflicting and confused economic analysis. As recently as August, he was complaining that the budget surplus was running on empty. We had a budget outcome of $7½ billion, one per cent of GDP, and the member for Werriwa had this to say on 6 August 2003: With the budget surplus running on empty, Mr Costello has abandoned responsible fiscal policy ...  Apparently it is not responsible fiscal policy to have a one per cent surplus. Apparently the member for Werriwa - who is now claiming to be the man of fiscal rigour - believes that the one per cent was not enough. What did the member for Lilley say of the member for Werriwa? `Men in tights jumping across the stage yelling slogans'.The member for Werriwa is trading on the fact that the press will not hold him responsible for his statements. At 11 o'clock at night he is against negative gearing; by 11 o'clock the next day he is in favour of it. In August he thought we were not running a strong enough fiscal policy; today they think it is too great. We will hold the Labor Party accountable. We will make sure that the member for Werriwa is accountable for his statements because the people of Australia need good economic policy, and there is only one side of Australian politics that can deliver good economic policy. It is and always has been the coalition. </DOC>

 - The member for Lalor has no credibility, and she will never have credibility until she has her colleagues withdraw the dodgy brochures and the push petitions which her staff have admitted are wrong and are based on a lie. - Welcome to the club. This government's position on bulk-billing is exactly the same as that of Neal Blewett, who was the architect of Medicare. We think bulk-billing should be available but should not be compulsory. Let me quote what Dr Blewett said:What we have mostly in this country is ... compassionate doctors using the bulk billing facility to treat pensioners, the disadvantaged and others who are not well off or who are in great need of medical services, which was always the intention. That is what Neal Blewett said and that is the position of this government. If members opposite are serious about our health care system and about extending and strengthening Medicare, they would take a much more constructive attitude to the A Fairer Medicare package now in the Senate. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Parkes for his question. At the outset, I assure him that he will be able to continue watching his favourite Australian produced programs on TV. The local content rules that are in place to ensure that we maintain an audiovisual industry in Australia certainly are not under any threat as far as the negotiations for a free trade agreement with the United States are concerned.Over the weekend or yesterday I saw some suggestions from professionals in the audiovisual industry that Australian TV programs and films would disappear as a result of the negotiation of a free trade agreement with the United States. This is simply not true. We are not going to negotiate away our ability as a nation to ensure the objectives of those policies of local content. We have made that quite clear. In fact, during wide-ranging consultations with the industry - with actors, producers, directors and writers - over the last couple of months, my colleague Senator Kemp and I have made that point to the industry and have maintained close contact with the industry as we have discussed with the United States the issues surrounding access for audiovisual product. In fact, the US chief negotiator, Ralph Ives, has stated that the US is not seeking to abolish either broadcast quotas or subsidies in Australia. Of course, we want to continue to see that we have a vibrant and viable industry in Australia so that we can provide a training ground for the many world famous actors and actresses now performing particularly in the United States and on screens across the world.The free trade agreement with the United States is comprehensive; it has to be. When we embarked on this, we said that it would be - that we would cover all areas. We are having mature and rational discussions with our counterparts in the United States about all sectors of the economy, because it is all about drawing the two economies closer together to drag out of that arrangement the best economic outcome we can. It has been forecast to be worth billions of dollars to the Australian economy, and we are not going to walk away from an opportunity of delivering that to future generations of Australians - and that goes right across the board. We have seen some of the scare tactics that have come from some in the community and certainly from some on the other side of the parliament regarding this issue of audiovisual, the issue of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and others, and at each stage we have proven those allegations and those scaremongering tactics to be without base and unfounded.So I assure the House and the broader Australian community that we will not sell out the Australian film and television industry in these negotiations and that it is simply not true that we are going to lose local content from Australian television screens. I assure the member for Parkes that he will still be able to watch his 55 per cent Australian content on free-to-air TV, his 10 per cent local content on pay TV and all the ABC programs that he watches and that will continue to get screened without any quota at all. Australian consumers, month in and month out, subscribe to the fact that they want to continue to watch Australian local content. We want to continue to see it being produced in Australia, and we want to be able to continue to export that product overseas - and not just the product but also the actors and the actresses. For the information of the Leader of the Opposition, we are fully engaged with the United States negotiators on this issue and right across the board as far as the free trade agreement is concerned because we believe it will benefit the Australian economy to the tune of billions of dollars in the future. What we want to know is what the Australian Labor Party's position is and what it is going to do in supporting those opportunities for Australian jobs in the future.</DOC>

 - I certainly do concede that it is a very serious situation when you have these medical specialists leaving their posts. I do concede that is a very serious situation, and people are entitled to be concerned about that. But I make this point: late last week they were saying that they were resigning because of the IBNR levy. If they are still resigning it is not because of the IBNR levy, because on Friday we put an 18-month moratorium in place. What that means is that if they are resigning it is not because of the policies of this government. I would respectfully appeal to those doctors: please do not leave your posts and please do not let your patients down, because this government will not let those doctors or patients down.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question and acknowledge her real interest in creating investment and jobs in regional areas, because that is a prerequisite if you are going to try and encourage migrants into those areas. There are a number of immigration programs and measures in place now to encourage migrants to settle in regional areas. The now AttorneyGeneral has certainly put a lot of work into this over time. Those programs are not only being continually enhanced but also making a real difference. A number of them would include the increasing of a number of potential skilled migrants and the number recorded on the skill-matching database, and that has led to a three-fold increase in numbers on the database. In the middle of last year we increased temporary residence visas for doctors in areas of need for up to four years, and the numbers there continue to grow strongly. We have made changes to the longterm business category to make it easier to sponsor migrants to regional areas, and from July of this year there is a bonus points scheme - one that I know the now AttorneyGeneral put a lot of work into and that we talked about at great length - for overseas students prepared to study and work in regional areas for a certain amount of time. I was asked about alternative policies, and I made the comment at the beginning that if you want to attract people into rural and regional Australia the first thing you have to do is make certain that there are some job and life opportunities there for them. I note that the Leader of the Opposition seems to have discovered this area over the weekend. While I note with approval his new found interest in the matter, I have to say that he will have to do a little more work if it is to come together for him. If he is serious, there are five areas that I can think of that he can really seek to address if he wants to see more job opportunities in regional areas. The first would be to walk away from the massive new taxes he wants to impose on the mining industry, because it is a major employer in rural and regional areas. Not only does it have a lot of existing jobs - the member for Hunter knows all about this; he understands small business and mining - it also offers the potential for a lot of new jobs.Over and above that, he could cease Labor's obstruction to the workplace relations amendment bill so that small businesses can employ his new regional migrants with confidence. He could then also acknowledge that a major new industry that regional Australia wants to support is ethanol - and who is standing in the way of that with a scare campaign? The Labor Party. He could move on to have a talk to his state colleagues - the leaders of all the states - about their utterly pitiful support for regional Australia in the worst drought for 100 years. Finally, as the member for Indi would know, nothing will destroy confidence for investment in jobs in regional areas more than the sort of ad hoc approach adopted in relation to the Living Murray that the Leader of the Opposition is outlining. Our approach, which will ensure that there is consultation, that there is science and that there is a recognition of people's property rights, will restore investment confidence in jobs - yours will undermine it. There are five areas where we will all wait with bated breath to see whether you do anything at all to secure some job and investment opportunities in regional Australia for migrants to enjoy.</DOC>

 - I certainly do accept the member for Prospect's imputation or point that a lot of doctors late last week were very angry, and they were citing the IBNR levy as a reason for potentially withdrawing services from Sydney hospitals. This government did not sit on its hands; this government acted swiftly. We put an 18-month moratorium in place on all IBNR levies over $1,000, so any doctor who is thinking of resigning or retiring because of the IBNR levy now has no reason to do so. I would call on the doctors of Western Sydney to continue to work with this government, to continue to work with the state government - which has responsibility for public hospitals - to try to ensure that all Australians continue to have access to high-quality affordable health care.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for La Trobe for his question and his great contribution to Australia and his advocacy for the Berwick campus of the Chisholm Institute of TAFE. On 27 June this year, the government announced its marketing and promotion campaign for new apprentices. This year we have 396,000 Australians - more than half of them under the age of 25 - undertaking apprenticeships and training. About 136,000 of those are in traditional trades and occupations. Not content with this, however, this government is determined to see that young people and their parents in particular see apprenticeships and training as being just as highly valued by this country as going to university or undertaking any other form of education and training.We have conducted this campaign focusing on construction and building, hospitality, the restaurant industry and hairdressing. These are bread-and-butter, core occupations for many Australians and great careers for young people in particular. In fact, when the Holden racing team takes to Mount Panorama for the Bathurst 1000 this coming weekend, its livery will include the promotion of the Howard government's New Apprenticeships program. In the last year in particular, we have had a six per cent increase in commencements for young people starting apprenticeships in traditional trades.I am asked about possible obstacles to further promoting and undertaking apprenticeships, particularly by young people. Last week the Victorian government announced that it will be increasing up-front fees in TAFE by 25 per cent. That means that students at the Berwick campus of the Chisholm Institute of TAFE, who disproportionately come from low-income families, will be met at the gates of the TAFE with a compulsory, up-front, no loan available, fee increase of 25 per cent. Further to that, in its May budget this year, the Victorian government announced it would withdraw $210 million in payroll tax exemptions for employers of apprentices over four years. This is a $210 million tax on the employment of young people as apprentices in Victoria.What have we heard from the federal Labor Party about this? While the member for Jagajaga and the Leader of the Opposition roam around the country expressing concern for double-income families graduating as lawyers and dentists and about a possible increase in HECS charges of up to 30 per cent - every dollar going into improving their education - not a single word has been said by the Australian Labor Party leadership about a 300 per cent increase in TAFE fees in New South Wales, a 25 per cent increase in TAFE fees in Victoria or full fee paying degrees of $12,000 in Victorian TAFEs - no loans available there. Not a word has been said by the Labor Party on a 50 per cent increase in TAFE fees for apprentices in South Australia. The Labor Party has absolutely no credibility in any of its arguments in relation to education and training so long as it is not prepared to stand shoulder to shoulder with the member for La Trobe, and the other members on this side, and argue against these outrageous taxes on young people who are trying to get apprenticeships and training throughout Australia.The only person on the Labor frontbench who has said anything to explain Labor's position in relation to this is the member for Grayndler. On 15 September in this House the member for Grayndler described the actions of state governments as them balancing their books. One thing the Labor Party should not do is balance the books of TAFE and apprenticeship and training opportunities with the career aspirations of young people who want to get into apprenticeships and training and with the career aspirations of their families for them. </DOC>

 - In answering this question I state that I am aware of the appointment of receivers and managers and indeed a liquidator in the case of two homes in Victoria. The department and the agency are monitoring the developments with these two aged care providers to ensure that they are complying with their responsibilities under the Aged Care Act. I am also aware that the Department of Health and Ageing has been contacted by the representatives of the former residents regarding the non-payment of the accommodation bonds. We require - and the department requires - that the payment of those bonds be taken from the proceeds of the sale which is currently under way. So the matter is in hand. This government will ensure that the people in question are not without their accommodation bonds.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Wannon for his question. He represents many of the sheep growers of Australia who have a particular interest in this trade - although, to be fair, the sheep on board the Cormo Express come from Western Australia and not from the electorate of Wannon.On 21 August the Cormo Express and its cargo of 57,000 sheep was rejected by Saudi authorities because of claims that the sheep had a high level of scabby mouth. There is a specification which allows up to five per cent of scabby mouth on sheep for this trade. The Australian vet on board the vessel is an experienced vet who has made many trips. He believes that the percentage of sheep on the vessel with scabby mouth was about 0.3 per cent. The Saudis initially claimed it was 30 per cent and then later adjusted that figure to six per cent. For whatever reason, they rejected that shipment and, since that time, the government, in cooperation with the shipper and others associated with the trade, has been seeking a satisfactory destination for the sheep. We do not fully understand the reason for the rejection, but other countries have joined in refusing to receive the sheep on the basis of the Saudi's original rejection because of scabby mouth. This is an important trade for Australia. It involves about 1.5 million sheep. Indeed, our live trade to Saudi Arabia last year was worth about $195 million. But, clearly, we cannot have this trade continue whilst there is this uncertainty about whether or not shipments will be accepted in that country. So, on 26 August, I moved to ban any further shipments to Saudi Arabia whilst these issues are unresolved. I point out that trade to other countries in that region has proceeded without incident. There have been 10 ships subsequently unloaded at other destinations in that area without any incident.Obviously our priority is to seek to find a new destination for the sheep on board the Cormo Express. The vessel is currently in Kuwait and is taking on additional provisions to enable it to go to sea again. Whilst in Kuwait there has been a small fire on board, and that has delayed the taking on of provisions. We now expect it will be Wednesday or probably Thursday before it is able to leave Kuwait. Whilst the Cormo Express has been in that port, the Australian Chief Veterinary Officer, Dr Gardner Murray, has boarded the vessel to inspect the sheep and also arranged for an international vet - Dr Ghazl Yehia, from the OIE - to inspect the sheep for an independent assessment. I think it is very important that there be this public assurance in relation to the health and quality of the sheep, and the best way to get that kind of independent assessment was through the OIE.In his official report, the OIE veterinarian confirmed that the sheep on board the Cormo Express are fit, healthy and suitable for human consumption. He has confirmed that there is no evidence of any infectious or contagious disease and there is no evidence of any disease to suggest a consignment would be unsuitable for admission to any country in the region. He has also said that there is no evidence that there has been a significant outbreak of scabby mouth aboard the vessel at any time during the voyage. This comprehensive report backs up the Australian assessment that these sheep are in good health. This report has been provided to around 25 countries in the region which originally expressed concern about the health of the sheep, with a request that they reconsider their objection to receiving the sheep.There have been any number of offers to receive the sheep - any number of potential places where the sheep could be placed - both for commercial reasons and as aid. However, to this date, none of the relevant countries have been prepared to grant an import consent. Our efforts - diplomatic, commercial and with the trade - have been directed towards seeking to obtain consent from a country to enable the sheep to be unloaded somewhere in the region. That remains our priority. It is clearly the best outcome for the sheep, and major efforts are being devoted to that purpose.In the event that something cannot be achieved in that regard, we are also naturally working on the fallback options of either slaughter somewhere else in the region or returning the sheep to Australia under very strict quarantine conditions. I emphasise that our preferred position remains that we find a destination in that region for the sheep. Our priority is the welfare of the sheep. In those circumstances, I would hope that we would have the support of all members of the House in seeking to secure a satisfactory negotiation so that a destination can be found quickly. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for her question. The fact is residents' bonds are subject to agreement between the particular resident and the particular approved provider. Approved providers are required to repay bonds within a specified period on the departure or death of the resident and in the case there has been a receiver or a manager or - as in one case - a liquidator appointed.But what the Australian government has done is establish a number of protections for the bonds of residents in aged care homes. For example, if a home is sold the purchaser is responsible for repaying the bonds and this is factored into any sale negotiation. Aged care places cannot be transferred to another provider without the approval of the department. The point is any approval would include an agreement from the purchaser to repay bonds as they fall due and the amount of resident bonds, in the event that the opposition is interested in that, is in fact protected information under the Aged Care Act 1997.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Corangamite for his question. He is a very staunch proponent of the manufacturing sector, and not only in his electorate. He was a very staunch supporter of what we did for the automotive industry, which was to give them tariff certainty. I am sure that has been a major contributor in terms of where that industry is going.Last month we saw unemployment figures reaching a new level in recent history: below six per cent. That is due in substantial part to the contribution of the manufacturing industry, and particularly the car industry. We saw in September the car industry reach a record sales level for September with a rise of 18 per cent on the 2002 figures for that month.I met this morning with Peter Sturrock from the FCAI. While of course we were both being optimistic, it is not beyond chance that next year we will see the car industry actually exceed one million new vehicle sales in Australia, based on a projection this year of some 875,000 new vehicles. Not only does that encourage the motor industry to invest in infrastructure, and we are seeing Holden spend some $408 million; it also creates new jobs in the industry - some 1,000 new jobs in the Elizabeth plant in South Australia alone.In terms of other manufacturers, Mitsubishi has announced confirmation of its expansion of some $1 billion, and we see Ford and Toyota continue in their investment. What that means is more jobs in Australia, very much as a result of the package we put in place last year in the Automotive Competitiveness and Investment Scheme. All this is happening at a time when the automotive industry is propelling itself onto the world stage, a world automotive stage which is suffering some poor global conditions. The automotive sector is not the only sector that is successful in Australia. If we look at some recent figures that were produced by the Australian Industry Group - the performance of manufacturing index - and the ACCI-Westpac survey, we see that these two surveys confirm continuing growth in the placement of new orders and a growth in expectations.I am asked how the manufacturing sector compares with other sectors in terms of its performance. It is interesting to note that the service sector is continuing to improve as well and in fact has increased its growth to the highest level in the last eight months. A lot of that growth is coming from areas which have seen some difficulty as well, again reflecting the general confidence that is out there in the industry, particularly if we look at the hospitality and hotel sectors, which have been working hard to recover.We are seeing that those industries are moving forward with confidence, have grown on the back of a strong economy and have increased the linkages between the service industry and the manufacturing industry. Not only does this mean that we as Australians have confidence in our economy; it also means that the businesses and industries associated with that growth are putting in place more jobs for more Australians.</DOC>

 - I am not a person who, out of hand, accepts or dismisses suggestions that are made. I will examine that proposal, but let me make this observation: the idea that for a class of procedures and a class of cases you totally remove any concept of insurance for professional negligence represents a very big step away from notions of personal responsibility. As the Treasurer rightly pointed out in the answer he gave earlier, doctors are not the only people in the community who must insure against professional negligence.I think what has happened is that the verdicts that have been awarded have driven premiums too high - that really is the core of the problem. On top of that there have been issues in relation to UMP, which insures about 60 per cent of doctors around Australia. You have had very careless premium setting policies - in contrast, I might say, to the policies of other medical defence organisations. I have had a number of complaints from doctors in Tasmania and Victoria who said, `Our premium policies were different.' But I think the House ought to bear in mind that there has been a significant problem with insurance generally around the world. Premiums for professional negligence have gone up. You must remember that HIH got into trouble largely because of the difficulties in its professional indemnity area rather than in other areas. As I always do with suggestions that are made in this House, I will examine it; but I would want the member for New England to bear those comments in mind because they will very heavily condition my attitude.Mr Speaker, while I am on my feet, could I add to an answer given by the Minister for Health and Ageing?  - Thank you, Mr Speaker.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Canning for his question, and I also thank the members and senators from Western Australia for the way in which they have pursued the implementation of natural resource management policies in their state and particularly for their endeavours to secure appropriate levels of funding for Western Australia. I think everyone knows that many of the salinity problems in Western Australia are perhaps more extensive than in other states, although many land-holders have of their own initiative undertaken significant salt mitigation measures. It is important that there be comprehensive and overall planning to address salinity issues in Western Australia.I am pleased to advise the House that, at long last, Western Australia has signed a bilateral agreement for the National Action Plan for Salinity and Water Quality. Some two years after the original agreement was reached, Western Australia has finally become the last of the states to sign up, so that money can start to flow to Western Australia to deliver outcomes under this very forward thinking program. Unfortunately the program in Western Australia, at least at this stage, will be only a shadow of what we had hoped. Western Australia has agreed to take up only $31 million of the $158 million that the Commonwealth was prepared to offer that state. Western Australia wanted credit to be given for past expenditure and funding for a whole range of projects which were not really developed under the concepts and philosophies of the national action plan.The Commonwealth has given Western Australia until its next budget to come up with the additional $127 million over the life of the program so that the full amount provided for Western Australia can indeed be spent in that state. Of course, if WA is unwilling to make that sort of contribution then, as the Commonwealth is anxious to get some value for its money, the Commonwealth will have to talk about other ways in which the money can be spent in other states, but it is certainly the Commonwealth's priority to have the funding flowing to Western Australia, where it can achieve obviously significant benefits.For five regions in Western Australia - the south coast, the south-west, the Avon, the Ord and the northern agricultural areas, which are amongst the 21 selected catchments under the national action plan - this funding will enable some money to at last flow to Western Australia to get the national action plan operating in every Australian state, and we hope that WA will see the benefits of this program and commit the full allocation of funding very soon.</DOC>

 - That question is as jumbled as has been the Labor Party's total response to this issue over the last three to four weeks. Initially they criticised me for banning future exports to Saudi Arabia until these issues were resolved, and a day or two later they withdrew that objection and in fact commended me on having taken such an action. That is fairly typical of their responses: full of criticism but never any constructive suggestions. As I indicated in my earlier response, the government's priority is to seek to find a destination for the sheep that is close to their current location. That is by far the best outcome from an animal welfare perspective and, indeed, from the point of view of dealing with all the other issues associated with this particular shipment.However, it would be irresponsible - particularly after 20 countries have initially spurned our responses - if we did not also look at what the fallback options might be. There are essentially two. The first would involve slaughter, either at sea or at some other location, and the second would be to return the sheep to Australia, obviously under strict quarantine conditions. There are a range of quarantine risks associated with bringing the sheep back to Australia. I would remind the House that the independent veterinary report states that the sheep are currently in good condition and disease free. They are Australian sheep and would be returning to Australia. However, they have been in a location where there are some pests and diseases which are exotic to Australia, and those are issues which we would need to deal with. Biosecurity Australia are doing an assessment of the various issues and how we would need to respond to each of those disease issues if a decision is made that, at some stage, the sheep are to be brought back to Australia.In relation to the Northern Territory's indication that it would be inappropriate for the sheep to be unloaded at Darwin, because of blue tongue disease, it is true that, in Northern Australia - particularly at this time of year - the blue tongue virus is active and can be fatal for sheep. I have indicated that, because of the potential risk of blue tongue, it is unlikely that it would be practical to bring the sheep back to any location in Northern Australia. There are still plenty of other options which might be available, but our preference remains finding a destination for the sheep close to where they currently are.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Macarthur for his question and I will be very pleased to update him on some misleading statements that have been made about Medicare. Yesterday I informed the House that at least three opposition members had been caught out telling fibs about Medicare, participating in a dishonest scare campaign and playing politics with people's health. How do we know that the petitions and brochures put out by the member for Lowe and the member for Scullin are lies? We know that they are based on lies because none other than the member for Lalor has said so.  - Let me remind members opposite, including the member for Lalor, of what was contained in the Canberra Times of 19 September. A spokesman for Ms Gillard conceded the claims were not true - that is to say, the claims made in those documents distributed by the members for Lowe and for Scullin were not true. For the benefit of members opposite, let me repeat: this government's position on bulk-billing is exactly the same as the position of Dr Neal Blewett. We think bulk-billing should be available, but we do not think doctors can be forced to bulk-bill. I regret to inform the House that I have discovered more Labor liars. There are more Labor liars. The lie at the heart of Labor's scare campaign has been propagated -  - They may not be Labor liars, and I withdraw that, but we have seen a lot of Labor liars. The lie at the heart of -  - The lack of honesty at the heart of Labor's scare campaign -  - The lack of honesty at the heart of Labor's scare campaign has been propagated by no less a person than the Leader of the Opposition. In a press release on 29 April this year, the Leader of the Opposition said:Families earning more than $32,300 a year will be denied access to bulk-billing under John Howard's plan ...That is just not true.  - That is a blatant untruth and the member for Lalor knows it is not true, because she has admitted as much to the Canberra Times. - It was not just one lie; the Leader of the Opposition repeated the untruth on 27 July, 9 July and 10 July.  -  - The want of honesty at the heart of Labor's scare campaign has been repeated by the Leader of the Opposition not once, not twice, not three times but four times. Yesterday, I called on the member for Lalor to withdraw the dodgy dodges and the bodgie petitions that her colleagues were spreading around Australia. She cannot do that without undermining her leader, so the latest casualty of his weak leadership is nothing but the concept of truth in politics. Truth in politics is now sacrificed to preserve the position of the Leader of the Opposition. Let me again quote the Leader of the Opposition, who, in the middle of propagating these blatant untruths about Medicare and telling outrageous fibs about Medicare, said:The reality is that you don't need a Newspoll to tell you that people want truth and honesty in politics and that they don't like what's happening to their health system.In one breath he proclaims the value of truth and then in the next breath he propagates the lie. If he had any respect, if he had any pride and if he had any consciousness of the concept of truth he would apologise to all those millions of Australian families whom he has so shamelessly conned.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. In answer to her question, let me point out that under the Aged Care Act 1997, an approved provider can only charge an accommodation bond in specific circumstances as set out under the act. The approved provider is required to repay the accommodation bond balance if the resident should die or leave the home, and the repayments must be within the time frame specified in the act. In circumstances where a home is sold or the aged care places are allocated, they are transferred to another provider. The responsibility to repay accommodation bond balances transfers by law to the new provider along with the places. Under the Aged Care Act, any transfer of allocated aged care places requires the approval of the department, and the department does not approve the transfer of any allocated aged care place unless liability for the accommodation bond is also assumed. So there is in place a clear and enforceable legislative prudential framework to ensure that the residents of aged care homes and their interests are protected.  Let me just put this question into context. Yesterday, the member for Canberra took one line out of a public report on the operations of the Aged Care Act - one line that said that 24 services were issued with noncompliance notices. I assume that that was to infer that this meant that accommodation bonds were at risk. This was trying to strike fear into the lives of some of the most vulnerable in the community. What didn't she tell you, Mr Speaker? She did not tell you that every single one of those 24 services is now compliant - every single one. Did she tell the House that? No, she did not. And in any instance where an accommodation bond was to be repaid, I am advised that all bonds have been repaid. I am also advised that since the Howard government came to power there has never been a default on a bond. This is just scaremongering. One of the peak industry bodies said in a press release today:Aged Care Queensland the peak industry body representing aged care providers in Queensland said today it deplored the re-emergence of scaremongering and politicisation of the aged care sector.Shame, member for Canberra, shame.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Aston for his question and for the interest he shows in these tragic events in the Middle East. Australia condemns in the strongest possible terms the sickening and evil suicide-homicide bombing in Haifa that took place on 4 October. I am sure all members of the House join the government in the condemnation of that hideous act. The attack is among the bloodiest and most vicious yet. It killed 19, including five members spanning three generations from one family. Our thoughts are with the surviving family of the victims. The attack was carried out against a restaurant which, ironically, was jointly owned by Jews and Arabs. That just reminds us of the indiscriminate evil of the terrorists. Four Israeli Arabs were slain in this attack.The terrorist Islamic Jihad organisation has claimed responsibility for the attack. Whatever an organisation such as this may claim, it is clear that they do not in the end have the interests of the Palestinian people at heart. Their action offers no hope at all to the just cause of Palestinian statehood. Australia has consistently supported Israel's right to defend itself against the threat of terror. Countries like Syria must act to cut off support for terrorism, and they must act decisively and they must act quickly. At the same time, we urge all parties to exercise restraint and we are concerned at the potential for violence in the region which could escalate. It is in no-one's interest for the violence to increase and spread. The route to peace has been set out in the internationally endorsed road map to Middle East peace - not only Israeli-Palestinian peace, but peace between Israel and all of its neighbours. For the road map to succeed, the Palestinian Authority must take firm action against terrorists. I welcome the new Palestinian Prime Minister's condemnation of this latest attack. I do urge him and other Palestinian leaders to take strong action to rein in the terrorists. We hope that regional governments will not allow extremists to destroy the hope of Middle East peace which is embodied in the road map. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Jagajaga for what is a very important question. Firstly, the government over the past year has recognised that the status quo for Australian higher education will be abrogating our responsibilities to the future. The government has announced that it will invest another $1½ billion of additional public money in Australian universities in the first four years, and $10.6 billion of extra public money in the first decade. One of the many things that the government is doing is increasing the number of HECS places, where the taxpayer pays for three-quarters of the cost of university education, by 31,500 in the first four years. Of those, 25,000 are currently overenrolled places which the government is intending to fully fund at a cost of $347 million. One of the many initiatives that the government is undertaking is to recognise that Australian citizens deserve at least the same treatment as those who are welcomed from overseas when they go into Australian universities. The Labor Party's position, as I understand it, was set out by the member for Jagajaga on 1 February 2002 when she said in a media release:Dr Nelson must stop uni queue jumpers ...	...	...	...People who don't make the grade shouldn't get special treatment ...I will just ask the Labor Party: am I correct in saying that that is the Labor Party's position? The Labor Party's position is that people should get access to university only on the basis of merit. There are a number of issues. Firstly, in Australian universities this year 40,000 students received a HECS place, a publicly funded place, on the basis of something other than merit. They got bonus points to get into those universities - that is, 40,000 students - because they had been educated in certain schools and in difficult economic circumstances. Some of those students had not even done year 12. They had not even got a tertiary entrance score, but they got a HECS place. They got in on the basis of something other than merit. This government supports giving those students who have had a tough background some extra help in getting into university. - In fact, 180 students got a place at Murdoch University this year on the basis of something other than academic merit. What the Labor Party also seems to ignore is that there are students who have never done year 12 but who go to TAFE, then get a credit transfer and a HECS place at university. It is ignoring also the students who go to a private education provider and then get access to university on something other than the basis of pure academic merit. The Labor Party is also ignoring the fact that, for example, the entry score for medicine has reduced from 99 to 90 in many universities, recognising that the cut-off has nothing to do with academic merit but has everything to do with supply and demand. This government is expanding the number of HECS places that are available for Australian students. At the same time, the government is saying that, once those HECS places have been filled, the universities can then offer enough places to every academically eligible Australian citizen who wishes to pay full fees to do their course. Murdoch University is saying to students from Joondalup, Rockingham or Armadale: `If you are academically qualified, we will allow you to pay full fees to come to this university,' in the same way that 2,500 foreign students have come to Murdoch University this year from Beijing, Jakarta, Montreal and a whole range of countries - apparently welcomed by the Labor Party. To students who miss out on one of the expanded number of HECS places, the Labor Party is saying that if you want to get into veterinary science at Murdoch University and you got 97.3, which means you miss out - and I say to the parents here: imagine if your child got 97.3 and wanted to do veterinary science and missed out - the only way that you will be a vet in this country will be to go overseas and sell your Australian passport to another country. Then you will be welcome back as a foreigner.This government is recognising Australian students who are academically qualified. This government is going to require the universities for the very first time to publish the minimum academic score before the end of the academic year. This government is saying that as an Australian citizen you should be offered the same opportunities that are offered to foreign students. For the first time, the government will support those students by offering them a loan which they will pay back only when they are working and earning more than $30,000 a year. - These changes are needed to make Australian universities internationally competitive and of a very high standard. It does not matter how many places you offer to Australian students; it is no good offering them one that is mediocre.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for La Trobe for his question, for his interest in Australia's fiscal policy and for his contribution to Australia's fiscal policy over the years. He has been an outstanding member for La Trobe, and I want to acknowledge that. Our final budget outcome, which was released last week, showed that for the year ending 30 June 2003 Australia had a surplus of one per cent of GDP. That compares very favourably to countries overseas. I am asked by the member for La Trobe how it compares in particular to the United States. The United States had a budget deficit of 4.3 per cent of GDP. To put that into Australian terms, that would be a budget deficit of $32 billion, rather than the budget surplus which we returned. How does it compare to France? According to the IMF world economic outlook, France had a budget deficit of 3.8 per cent. The United Kingdom was much loved by the Australian Labor Party at one point, when they were going through their New Labour phase -   - their third wave phase, which they seem to have got off ever since the Iraq war, I notice. They are no longer interested in the third wave. The third wave dumped them. The United Kingdom has a budget deficit of 2.6 per cent of GDP, compared to an Australian budget surplus of one per cent. - I love the putative challenges, egging me on to attack the member for Werriwa. But don't smile too much. Look, the member for Lilley pretends he is not smiling. - Don't egg me on too much. I love that speech about men in tights jumping across the political landscape. - I am sorry. Every time I hear a rooster crow it gets me going! The average over the advanced economies compared to Australia was a 3.3 per cent budget deficit. Australia has a one per cent budget surplus - and the average over the advanced economies is a 3.3 per cent budget deficit. People say, `That could not happen here. We could not have a 3.3 per cent of GDP budget deficit.' Well, we did. Over the last five years of the Labor Party, the average budget deficit was 3.1 per cent. If we were still making the same kind of returns in fiscal policy as the Australian Labor Party, our budget would have been $25 billion in deficit. That was the record of the last five years. I do not think the enormity of Labor's failure has ever sunk in to their current frontbench, where there is no understanding; there is no policy.We have this absurd situation now where the member for Werriwa says he is going to make the Labor Party the party of fiscal rigour. Labor is going to become the party of the surplus rather than the deficit. You only have to sit in question time for about three questions to realise the Labor Party's sole attack on the government is that we are not spending enough money. Whether it be from the member for Jagajaga's question or whether it from the member for Lalor's question, the sole attack on the government is that money is not being spent in sufficient quantities here, there and everywhere. And the member for Werriwa says he is going to make the Labor Party the party of fiscal rigour! -  - Or of fiscal rigging, as the member reminds me. The test is this: if the Labor Party wants to become the party for fiscal rigour, there is $1.5 billion of expenditure savings now lined up in the Senate, not from this year's budget but from last year's budget - that is, not from May of this year but from May of last year. If the member for Werriwa wants to demonstrate that Labor is changing its spots, Labor should change its vote in the Australian Senate. Let those measures go through. Let us reform the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, let us reform welfare, let us reform the labour market and, most of all, let us see the reform of the Australian Labor Party. That is what we need to get a program through the Senate which will set Australia up for the kind of opportunities that it deserves in the future. Let us see the reform of the Australian Labor Party. Let the member for Werriwa deliver rather than jump across the stage in tights with these claims which stand for nothing. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Bonython for his question. The problems that face Australian universities are quite complex, as are the solutions. The Labor Party would have you believe that all you have to do is open the taxpayers' chequebook and pour out as much money as it thinks might be required to fix a problem it considers to be quite simple but which is quite complex. One of the things, for example, that the member for Bonython and other South Australian members might appreciate is that there were 7,000 people who got a place in a South Australian university this year who will not be in that place by the end of the year and who will never go back to university, in part because many people who profess to lead in Australian life are telling them that the only thing they should do is to go to university instead of doing an apprenticeship or training.One of the very important things in the government's package of reforms for higher education is that more than $40 million in extra core money will be available for South Australian universities in the first three years alone. Of the universities in South Australia, Flinders is overenrolled by 10 per cent - which means that those students are currently attracting a quarter of the public funding attracted by students enrolled up to the quota - and the University of South Australia, in the member for Bonython's electorate, is 2½ per cent overenrolled. The government realise that this is having a very bad impact on quality. It is affecting the ratio of students to lecturers. It is also creating an environment where a lot of students are dropping out. As I said in an earlier answer, the government are going to fully fund 25,000 marginally funded overenrolled places. In addition to that, we will be negotiating with the South Australian government in relation to where we distribute currently overenrolled places within the state of South Australia.The government is determined to expand the number of HECS places available to ensure that students receive a quality education to make them able, if they wish to, to get jobs in other parts of the world and at the same time make sure that there are opportunities available for the students who choose to go to the private higher education providers in South Australia by, for the very first time, providing them with a loan from the taxpayer that they only pay back when they have graduated. All these things are absolutely necessary to make universities competitive and of a high quality. What the Labor Party has done, as it does all the time, is to say, `We'll take the taxpayers' chequebook to fix the problem,' and it has refused to address the issues of the governance and management of universities, of work practices in the universities and of the way we commercialise and support research that comes out of them. The Labor Party should get on board in the interest of Australia's future. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Fadden for his question. There was a report in the London Times a couple of days ago suggesting that Zimbabwe may be seeking to enlist the support of a number of other countries to have Don McKinnon, the Secretary-General of the Commonwealth, replaced. The theory apparently is that, if Zimbabwe were to do that, it may in turn ease its readmission to the Commonwealth. If this report is true - and I cannot confirm the veracity of the report - then the Australian government will maintain its support for Don McKinnon as the Secretary-General of the Commonwealth, as we intend to do in any case.There is only one way for Zimbabwe to regain admission to the councils of the Commonwealth - that is, to meet in full the benchmarks set by the Commonwealth, including the restoration of good governance and political freedoms. So far there are no signs of this happening. Some tricky move to try to get the Secretary-General of the Commonwealth removed and thereby avoiding meeting the Commonwealth benchmarks and getting back into the Commonwealth would be completely unacceptable to the Australian government and, I know, to many other governments as well.The situation in Zimbabwe remains very grim. The Mugabe government recently closed down the only remaining daily independent newspaper in the country, and local elections, which were held in August, were marred, as were the national elections, by violence and intimidation. Economic mismanagement has led to skyrocketing inflation. Inflation in Zimbabwe at the moment is running at 425 per cent. There is an acute cash shortage in Zimbabwe as well. Even more serious than a 425 per cent inflation rate and a shortage of cash is the fact that 5½ million Zimbabweans - that is, about half the population of the country - require food aid. Today I announced a further $7½ million food aid contribution by Australia to the World Food Program's appeal for southern Africa, including Zimbabwe, but of course we are going to make absolutely sure that the provision of that food aid to Zimbabwe through the World Food Program is properly administered. I know the World Food Program itself is very conscious of allegations that the Zimbabwean government has tried to manipulate food aid for political purposes. If it were to do that then no Australian food aid would be involved in such manipulation.This government is committed to working with others to keep the pressure on the Zimbabwean government. At the last meeting of the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group in New York, which I attended, I circulated a paper highlighting Zimbabwe's failure to meet the Commonwealth benchmarks for its readmission to the Commonwealth. Honourable members will remember that, at the end of last year, Australia implemented smart sanctions against Zimbabwe. I hear from the opposition in Zimbabwe - the Movement for Democratic Change - that the sanctions regime is beginning, to use their words, `to bite'. Let me make it perfectly clear: without an improvement within Zimbabwe, Australia will continue to oppose strongly any efforts to try to get Zimbabwe readmitted to the councils of the Commonwealth. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Melbourne for the question, which is not unexpected. The claim that the performance figures that were published by the Australian Communications Authority are inaccurate or deceptive is, in itself, misleading. The numbers given are correct. The Labor Party has been seeking to selectively use information that is publicly available in the ACA Telecommunications performance monitoring bulletin for the June quarter. Selectively using information seems to be a habit the Labor Party engages in.The Australian Communications Authority bulletin does indicate the period for which the network reliability framework figures are calculated. As the NRF has only been operational since January, it is impossible to calculate an annual figure. In the June bulletin, the figures reported were clearly stated as being from data collected from January to July and August 2003. Further information on how the ACA calculates performance results under the network reliability framework is also available on the ACA's web site portal.I understand that at the Senate committee hearing last night the ACA undertook to review the presentation of this information to avoid confusion - confusion that has been evidenced by the selective use of the information by the member for Melbourne. My office has confirmed this with the ACA today. The key point is that the numbers in the information provided in the bulletin are correct and they demonstrate a continued high level of network performance.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Maranoa - from that very large electorate of his - for his question and acknowledge his interest in trade with the 10 ASEAN economies. We welcome the declaration that has come out of the Bali summit. It signals a strong political commitment to ongoing openness and trade liberalisation within the region. Of course there is already an ASEAN free trade area, called AFTA. This is a further commitment to achieving the Bogor goals that we are all committed to with regard to the APEC agreement that has been ongoing. We will attend the APEC ministerial meeting - and the Prime Minister will attend the APEC leaders meeting - towards the end of next week. It is important to note the size of the economic relationship between Australia and the ASEAN economies. Two years ago, when we started negotiating a closer economic partnership agreement with the ASEANs, it was at about $32 billion. It is about $34½ billion now, on its way to the target of $65 billion in 2010. What we are seeing here is a further public commitment from the ASEAN economies to keep moving in that direction. - It is important to note - and I note the interjections from the Labor Party, which in 13 years in government achieved nothing with the South-East Asian economies - that last year this government signed a closer economic partnership agreement with the 10 ASEAN countries. This year we entered into force the Singapore-Australia free trade agreement. By the end of this year - hopefully in the next couple of weeks - we will conclude the negotiations for a free trade agreement with Thailand. It is an explicit example of this government's engagement with the South-East Asian economies in developing our relationship in the region. It goes without saying that it puts the lie to what a lot of the members of the Labor Party and some of their spokespeople have been saying in terms of our broader engagement across the world weakening our relationships with East Asia and particularly South-East Asia. It is not happening. This is proof positive of that.We are ahead of the game in our relationship with the South-East Asian economies. None other than the Malaysian trade minister herself, Rafidah Aziz, following the signing of the closer economic partnership agreement last year, said that this agreement would put Australia and New Zealand ahead of China and Japan in negotiating market opening measures with ASEAN. So we have been getting on and developing stronger and deeper relationships with the 10 ASEAN countries both bilaterally and regionally through the ASEAN grouping. We have been able to get in and see the leaders of these countries and we have been able to negotiate these deals, while the Leader of the Opposition is left sitting outside the door trying to see the President of Indonesia.</DOC>

 - I again thank the member for Melbourne for his question. As a general proposition, the government believes that selling the remainder of Telstra is ultimately in the interests of the company itself - 1.8 million shareholders - the wider telecommunication industry and, most importantly, all Australians. It is competition that drives new services and lower prices, and regulation that provides safeguards to protect consumers. The government does not need to own Telstra to achieve those outcomes - and, in fact, there is a conflict in the government being the owner and the operator. The government has indicated many times that it would not progress the further sale of Telstra until it was satisfied that services were up to scratch in the bush. This commitment was met with the government's comprehensive response to the regional telecommunications inquiry, including proposals for future proofing. If the member for Melbourne by his question is seeking to have the government insert into a statute precisely what action it will take in an industry in which technological change is happening every day, then he is misleading himself.The bill that is before the Senate and the Senate committee at the moment contains an obligation on the government and on future governments to conduct regular reviews of the services within the bush and to respond to those reviews. This is an obligation that this government will take very seriously indeed. It encompasses the obligations that the member for Melbourne wants detail on - detail that it is impossible for any government to provide.</DOC>

 - I would like to thank the member for Petrie for her question. She is a wonderful advocate for children in the Redcliffe area and I want to commend her on the work that she does. She asked a question about the government's policies on child care. One of the outstanding successes of the Howard-Anderson government since 1996 has been the unprecedented amount of funding going to child care, with $8 billion having been committed for the next four years. That is 70 per cent more than the amount provided by the Australian Labor Party in its last six years in government.The Department of Family and Community Services will soon be releasing a census done on child care up to May 2002. That census contains some very interesting indicators that I would like to share with the House. The first point is that the number of children who are using Commonwealth funded child care has increased substantially since the introduction of the child-care benefit. Indeed, there was a 27 per cent increase in the number of children accessing such child care, increasing from 577,000 children in 1999 to over 732,000 children in May 2002.What is interesting as well is that the cost of child care has gone down. Child care is 10.2 per cent more affordable than it was in 1999. So there are more children using child care and the costs have come down. The maximum rate of child-care benefit was paid to over 43 per cent of families. That means that 43 per cent of families accessing long day care and family day care were receiving child-care benefit at the maximum rate, which is $137 per week. What is even more remarkable is that there has been a very large increase in employment in the children's services sector. In 1999, 59,000 people were employed in children's services; that figure was up to 76,000 in May 2002.I am rather concerned because, with all this good news, the only news we hear from the Australian Labor Party is that they are desperate to see the coalition's child-care policies fail. Not long ago we heard the shadow minister, Senator Jacinta Collins, outlining the failure of the Australian Labor Party's policies, particularly when it came to their youth policy. Just to remind the House, she was very complimentary of the Prime Minister.  - The shadow minister said that he inspires people, particularly young people. I absolutely concur with those honest remarks, but it is time now for the shadow minister to focus her attention on the child-care policies of the Australian Labor Party. I am very concerned about some comments that were made by Sharan Burrow at an ACTU child-care forum on 30 June in Sydney. She had some interesting proposals. In relation to the ACTU's policy she said, firstly, that for children under school age the first 20 hours of child care should be free. I thought that was interesting, because the political arm of the ACTU have been very silent on this proposal. The second point that she proposed suggested that child-care fees be set at $50 per day. Isn't that interesting? At the moment the average is $36 a day. They are actually proposing that Australian families pay more.What is most alarming is that the ACTU President, Sharan Burrow, stated that private service providers were `abhorrent and despicable' and that the corporate providers were `evil'. Two-thirds of the child-care facilities in Australia are provided by the private and corporate sectors. Here is the leader of the industrial arm of the Labor Party saying they are abhorrent and despicable. What an interesting contribution to work and family. What is more ironic is that the introduction of subsidies to the private sector was actually introduced by the Australian Labor Party. Without doubt, it is the coalition that is absolutely committed to child care and it is the coalition that is committed to work and family.</DOC>

Therefore, the question ought properly to be addressed to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs and, in this case, to the Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs, who represents her.

 - I thank the member for Moncrieff for his question. I recognise that he is a great advocate for small business on the Gold Coast, and not just for the tourism businesses but for the rapidly growing IT industry up there and a range of other businesses, including the building industry. What the member for Moncrieff and many on this side of the House know is that the coalition wants to reduce taxes on small business. We are committed to doing that. We have done it in the past by reducing company tax from 36 per cent to 30 per cent, abolishing wholesale sales tax, reducing fuel excise, abolishing stamp duty on the transfer of shares and undertaking a range of other initiatives that are all about reducing the burden of taxation on small business. I picked up on a comment by an economist by the name of Peter Switzer. Peter Switzer has not always been a big fan of the coalition, but when I saw this comment it really prompted me to respond. On the John Stanley program on 2UE he said: Certainly I think the important thing is if Labor had any brains - and we know that Labor is not currently displaying many brains at the Federal level - they would actually put together a group of policies that would really please small business. At the moment, they are totally ignoring a very important part of the voting constituency.I will not go on, because what happens after this is a little embarrassing for the member for Werriwa.Government member - Go on! We demand it! - It goes on to the leadership credentials of the member for Werriwa. Malcolm T. Elliot says:No, he won't get there. Women don't like him. What can I say? Women don't like him. I think I know some pretty real women out there, and they don't like Mark Latham. - It could be about the tights. - That comes up later. - Mr Speaker, I obtained a copy of the shadow Treasurer and member for Werriwa's `light on the hill' speech in which he said:Higher taxes and charges are forcing families deeper into debt. They are also taking away the incentive to work harder in our society.He went on to say:The harder people work the more likely they are to fall into the top marginal tax rate of 48.5 per cent ...I remind the House that the member for Werriwa voted against any attempt to provide relief under the new tax system for people involved in the 48.5 per cent tax threshold. On the one hand, the member for Werriwa is complaining that too many people are paying 48.5 per cent and, on the other hand, he is voting against it. Of most concern to small business is what he went on to say:Australia has a vast army of wage and salary earners - people who have studied hard through TAFE ... This is the great imbalance in the taxation system. Honest, hard working PAYE taxpayers are cross-subsidising the corporate sector ...He goes on to say that the 30 per cent tax rate for corporates is too low. There are 600,000 small businesses out there paying 30c in the dollar at the corporate tax rate. What they want to know is: what is the position of the member for Werriwa? Does he believe that the corporate tax rate should rise? How is that going to affect small businesses out there - the electricians, plumbers, carpenters and all of those people who are the very fabric of our nation? The hardworking small business people in coffee shops and delicatessens and all of those people, who work hard, are paying 30c in the dollar at the corporate tax rate. Now, the member for Werriwa is clearly signalling that he wants to increase the tax on those small businesses. We want answers from the member for Werriwa. We do not want him to give us the usual dialogue about how Labor is about fiscal rigour or that Labor is committed to lower taxes. We want to know: does he really believe that the 30 per cent corporate tax rate is too low?</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Eden-Monaro for his continuing interest and involvement in science and innovation. The government is spending a record $5.3 billion on science and innovation this year, and the expenditure is increasing as Backing Australia's Ability brings on new spending for new programs which are highly targeted and gaining widespread support throughout the research and business communities.This government's commitment to small business ensures that the benefits flow through to small businesses. We do this in a number of ways. For instance, one of the key objectives of the new funding provided for the Cooperative Research Centre program - and $200 million is invested in that in this budget year - has been to provide abilities for SMEs to participate in CRCs. The House will be pleased to know that there are now 350 small businesses involved in CRC programs that provide employment opportunities and economic growth. CRCs are using a range of strategies to engage small businesses in their activities. Some CRCs involve small businesses through a consortium or an alliance. Others have associate arrangements that enable small businesses to be involved in specific projects of the CRC and, for limited amounts of time, to be flexible to incorporate the needs of small business.In addition, the government is investing $570 million in the CSIRO. That organisation provides great benefits to small businesses. The CSIRO itself benefits enormously from this linkage with small business, because it ensures that the research undertaken by the CSIRO meets the needs and expectations of industry and keeps the science focused. Collaboration with small businesses leads to enormous breakthroughs in science that create value for Australian industry and the community. In 2001-02, the CSIRO had 2,030 contracts and 56 licensing agreements with small businesses, representing an aggregate value of over $30 million. Seventy-one per cent of the CSIRO's private sector contracts were with SMEs and 29 per cent of the aggregate value to the CSIRO of the private sector contracts came from contracts with SMEs. As the science policy of the government continues to evolve and develop, it will be implemented with a view to capturing the strengths of the economy, including our vibrant small business sector.I am asked about alternative policies. I would like to inform the House that the Australian Labor Party had a skerrick of a policy on science and innovation, but I am unable to do so. Unlike the Aladdin's cave of quotes and policy pronouncements from the member for Werriwa that so interest the Treasurer and the Minister for Small Business and Tourism, my cave is bereft of any announcements from the Labor Party on anything to do with science and innovation. There is no policy, there are no initiatives and there is no new thinking by the Labor Party.Members on this side will remember the rhetorical question of some weeks ago: who is the shadow minister for science and innovation? Without reference to formal documentation, very few, if any, members of this House would know who it is. He or she is remarkable by their silence on science and innovation. A couple of clues: the person has a great love of Albania, wishes to ape many of the economic policies of Albania and shares a similar surname to the person most destined to be the next Leader of the Opposition - the New South Wales Premier. That is as many clues as I am prepared to give on this occasion.</DOC>

 - Again, this matter has not been raised with me in my role as Attorney-General. I understand the department that I formerly administered was undertaking certain investigations in relation to certain allegations that were made last week, I believe, on a television program and repeated in the Sydney Morning Herald. The department of immigration - and the information is publicly available - put out a release dated 3 October making it clear that it does investigate any allegations of misconduct that come to its attention. It does not normally comment on the progress of investigations but, to `clarify the current reports', it said:	To assist with the investigations, on 1 October the Department's investigators contacted (among others) ABC Lateline, a by-lined journalist at the Sydney Morning Herald, and the Edmund Rice Centre, on whose research the allegations have been made.	No information has yet been forthcoming. In two cases, the request for additional detail has so far been refused; the Centre has indicated it needs to consult with an official who is currently in Switzerland. There was another report that related specifically to me. It was a report that two years ago migration agent Marion Le had raised certain concerns that an immigration officer had suggested returnees obtain false passports. It was asked whether that had been investigated. Records of correspondence between Ms Le and myself showed that earlier concerns had arisen and been resolved. The release quotes the letter from me to Ms Le responding to her advice that she had received certain information. I said:I am advised that his comments to the group - this is speaking of the officer who had interviewed them - have been misconstrued, perhaps mischievously. At their request - the officer - met with this group in Port Hedland recently. Members of the group expressed concern with difficulties arranging their departure, contrasting this with the ease with which they were able to travel to Australia.The officer:... explained that while members of the group were clearly able to travel around the world with false documents obtained by people smugglers, it was not possible for the Australian Government to use such means.The officer:... took pains to explain that they should not take this to mean they should contact people smugglers in order to obtain travel documents.Ms Le received that advice from me in relation to the investigation that was undertaken and the comments of the officers and made no further contact in the following two years with me to pursue that matter. The following extract, referring to the same officer, is from an affidavit lodged by Ms Le in the Federal Court of Australia, New South Wales Registry, on 3 June:Ms Le said she had been told by the DIMIA officer - so she spoke to him - that: 'Essentially in discussion with the -  group - about their future, I said to them, we're doing what we can but we can't move people on documents which aren't kosher. We need to deal openly, unlike the people smugglers.' So I simply make the point there are no new allegations. - There are no new allegations. - The people who made them, to a television program and a newspaper, have been asked to confirm them and, as I said, at the date - 3 October - they had not been able to provide any information to the investigation section on those matters.The department of immigration - and it is not for me to say this - takes these matters very seriously and would not be engaged in providing documentation to people that is false. When people are given documents in the form of an Australian identity document for travel, to use to obtain a visa to enable them to enter another country, that is a valid Australian document properly issued by law and which people are entitled to take and use for overseas travel and to get a proper visa. I understand that in relation to all of the people moved, except one, that was the case. In relation to one of them there was a passport which he presented to officers which was believed to be valid, and we have no reason now to believe that it was not valid but we have not seen it for some three years to know whether or not it has been interfered with in some way. I simply make the point that the government would not be party - nor would its officers - to giving people documents that were false, and there is no evidence to suggest that they have. Those matters have been investigated where evidence has been provided and evidence has been sought from those who have provided information to the media, and it has not been forthcoming. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. This House and most of Australia is now aware that we are at a 13-year low of unemployment at 5.8 per cent, something this government is very proud of. But it is probably less well known that for older workers the unemployment figures have also come down quite dramatically over the term of the Howard government. In fact, mature age unemployment peaked at eight per cent under the Labor Party and was 6.2 per cent when the now opposition leader was employment minister when the Labor Party lost government. Today it stands at 3.6 per cent, and that is something that this government is very proud of - a more than halving of the peak rate of unemployment.There is a very good reason why this government continues to work to get mature age workers into the workforce. Obviously, it is very helpful to those individuals and it is something that we want to work with them on at a personal level. But it is also good for the economy. As the work force ages, we are going to need more older people in the work force. There is a good news story there from the government as well. During this period when the unemployment rate for mature age workers has come down, the actual participation rate of mature age workers has in fact increased from 63 per cent to 68 per cent. That is very positive news for both the economy and mature age workers.There are many very specific measures the government is taking over and above generic programs like the Job Network. The Treasurer and I launched Mature Age Month on 1 October in Melbourne. We are trying to encourage businesses to understand the positive attributes that mature age workers can bring to their business. It is a well-known fact that a mature age worker, when retrained, is likely to remain with a business for five years longer than a retrained younger person. They are less likely to have absenteeism; they are more likely to be a stable person in the workplace and actually help young people and the business overall.This government is now introducing industry specific measures. In South Australia - and I am sure the member for Hindmarsh and the member for Adelaide would be interested to know this - we are working with the aged care sector to meet its needs and the needs of mature age workers to ensure that we engage these particular people in industry. In Brisbane, we are working with the taxi industry. Salvation Army Employment Plus has recently worked with the Retailers Association of Australia to make sure that we connect mature age workers with what is one of the largest sectors of employers in Australia.While we have driven unemployment down to 5.8 per cent - while mature age unemployment is now down to 3.6 per cent - this government will continue to work at every level in every community to continue to drive down unemployment for the benefit of individuals and for the benefit of the Australian economy as a whole.</DOC>

 - I thank my colleague the member for Cook for his question. I know aged care issues are important in his electorate and I acknowledge his interest. It is relevant to consider how the aged care sector was before the Howard government came to office. Under the Labor government there was no complaints scheme, there was no certification of aged care facilities, there was no accreditation of approved providers, there was no regular evaluation of the care subsidised by the Commonwealth, there was no authority to place sanctions on providers for noncompliance and - members will find this of interest - there were no prudential reporting requirements. - Obviously, in order to gauge achievements one has to look at what we started with. - All of these have been put in place by the Howard government. It is enshrined in history that a 1998 auditor's report demonstrated that, under Labor, there was a 10,000-bed deficit. There were in fact only 148,000 allocated places in 1996. As at 30 June 2003, there were 197,000 allocated places. - As I was saying, as at 30 June 2003 there were 197,000 allocated aged care places, so we are well on track for meeting our target of 200,000 places by 30 June 2006. Along with the increased places, the government has increased the level of funding for the aged care assessment teams - the ACATs. In fact, last week the government announced a 10.6 per cent increase for the assessment program. That brings it to $46.3 million and is helping to provide timely assessments for the aged seeking community aged packages or residential care.Also the Howard government has been working in partnership with the aged care sector to provide a transparent and accountable system that will deliver continual improvements to the quality of care that our aged so richly deserve. I think one comparative statistic tells it all. In 1995-96, $3 billion was spent on residential and community aged care. Today, under the Howard government, $6 billion is spent on aged care. This 100 per cent funding increase compares very favourably with the 16.5 per cent growth in the over-70 population.Some of the individual increases are very telling. If one compares the 1995-96 Labor expenditure with the 2003-04 government budget, in residential care subsidies there has been a 59 per cent increase. In community aged care packages - they are the packages to help people remain independent and remain at home - there has been a 784 per cent increase from the Labor figures. In the flexible care subsidies - a very important area - there has been a 783 per cent increase, and so the list goes on.According to the annual report on the operation of the Aged Care Act, there was a total of $941.7 million expended in building activities in the last financial year. This indicates real confidence in the aged care sector. As well as the general ageing of the population, the report specifically cites the government's record funding levels and the allocation of new aged care places over the past 12 months. That includes 52,700 in the past five years. They are the reasons underpinning a healthy level of investment in the aged care sector. So the report is a very positive endorsement of the Howard government's achievements, and we will continue to work on progress in this regard. This is a government that cares about older Australians.</DOC>

 - As I told the House yesterday, the reason why the report has not been released is that the report is based on actuarial calculations provided to the government by UMP, and the government is not entitled to release publicly information which it does not own. We are not going to release the report.  - I accept that the matter that was given to us by the UMP actuaries was then reviewed by the Government Actuary. But all the essential material was provided to us by UMP, and it would be quite improper for the government to publicly release information that it does not own. The intellectual property in that information belongs to UMP. The levy notices that have been sent to doctors were sent out on the basis of legislation passed by this parliament. I can understand why doctors are concerned about the quantum of the IBNR liabilities. It is precisely to meet those concerns that the government announced last Friday a moratorium on all IBNR levies over $1,000 and an ongoing policy review process to keep tabs on this, at the end of which the actuarial liabilities will be recalculated and the question of the levies will be revisited.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Macquarie for his question. I say to him and to other members of the House that today is a great day for Australian workers and their families because this government welcomes the excellent news that the unemployment rate for September is 5.8 per cent. This is the second consecutive month that the unemployment rate has been below six per cent. In fact, it is 13½ years since Australia had two consecutive months of unemployment below six per cent. Better still, the number of Australians in full-time employment is the highest in the history of Australia. Full-time employment in September increased by 43,300. Indeed, almost 75 per cent of the growth in jobs over the past 12 months has been in full-time employment.What these figures once again confirm is the strong economic policies of the Australian government. This is despite the drought, which still afflicts some parts of Australia, and despite a weak global economy. The figure also reflects the taxation and the workplace relations reforms of the Howard government. Unemployment figures do vary from month to month, but they are a far cry today from the 10.9 per cent that they were under the Australian Labor Party in government in 1992. Indeed, when the current Leader of the Opposition was the Minister for Employment, Education and Training in the Keating government - for almost two years - unemployment in Australia averaged 8.8 per cent.This is a government which has now created 1.2 million jobs since coming to office. We know that having a job is important for Australian families and for individuals in this country. We are committed to continuing to build the Australian economy to ensure that Australia continues to be a prosperous nation. It is about time that the Australian Labor Party stopped obstructing measures in the Senate that would actually allow us to create more jobs in this country for the men and women of Australia. We are committed to reforms to create more jobs, to improve people's choices and to provide greater flexibility. We are doing what the Australian people want - that is, providing real outcomes in terms of real jobs. Why are we so committed to creating more jobs? Because more jobs means stronger, healthier and happier Australian families. </DOC>

His levy is capped at $1,000 for the next 18 months. - That doctor's levy is capped at $1,000 for the next 18 months. As for future levies, those levies will depend upon a recalculated IBNR, and that will happen in the course of the 18 months when we have had a chance to review the actual experience of the new tort law liabilities which have been put in place by the several states.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Deakin for his question and his interest in the employment prospects of the people of Deakin, because I know he works very hard on that. As the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations has just indicated, unemployment is at a 13-year low at 5.8 per cent. The good news about this month's labour force figures was not only that the rate stayed low but that we had 43,000 new full-time jobs reported in the month of September. When you consider that we have been, in the course of this year, through an American downturn, through a war, through SARS, and through the worst drought in Australian history, the fact that the economy kept growing and kept producing jobs I think is a very remarkable outcome.I was representing Australia at the IMF-World Bank meetings in Dubai two weeks ago and I can report to the House that the Australian economy is seen as one of the strongest economies in the world. In the Economist magazine this week, the Economist poll of forecasters says that, of all the countries of the developed world, Australia is forecast to have the strongest growth in 2003, and in 2004 the second strongest growth after the United States. It is actually a good thing that the US economy is coming back, because for many years now we have been outperforming the world. The world has been weak. We have been the strongest economy of the developed world. What that has meant is a lot of pressure on our current account, but to see the US economy coming back in 2004 is very welcome news, and it should help our exporters. How times have changed, because for 28 straight months under the Australian Labor Party the unemployment rate was more than 10 per cent. This took me back to an opinion piece that was written by my good friend the shadow minister for finance, who back in the Labor days represented Australia at some of the IMF meetings. The member for Fraser came back from the IMF meeting in May 1991 and he said:Last week, I had the opportunity to represent Australia at meetings of the IMF and the World Bank in Washington. Such occasions tend to put domestic concerns into perspective. Three things struck me during the course of these meetings: first, we should never forget our relatively favourable situation. ... when compared to the problems of Mali, Peru or Bangladesh, all Australians should rejoice in our good fortune.Back in 1991, with a budget in deep deficit, with unemployment above 10 per cent, the good news from the Australian Labor Party was that we were doing better than Mali, Peru and Bangladesh! We do not tend to compare ourselves with Mali, Peru or Bangladesh anymore. - Mr Speaker -  - I was asked what the labour force figures say about the Australian economy. What they show is that the Australian economy is strong and that it is strong compared to other world economies, as the Economist poll shows. We can compare our economy these days to economies like the UK, France or Germany; we do not have to compare them to Mali, Peru or Bangladesh - Third World countries which, it did strike me, have some problems that might be akin to those in Australia. I understand that they have terrible crime problems in Mali, Peru and Bangladesh. Taxi drivers are not always safe as they take fares in those sorts of countries. But we can compare ourselves to countries like the UK and the US and, as the Economist poll shows, we compare very favourably indeed.I pay tribute to the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, who, after three days, has already equalled the achievements of his predecessor, the member for Warringah - who himself was a star in the portfolio. Could unemployment go lower? If we keep the Australian economy growing and if we put in place structural reform, it could. But it will not happen unless we put in place structural reform. What could we do to take unemployment lower in this country? The first thing we could do is improve our industrial relations system. We could get rid of these unfair dismissal laws which are making small business employment conservative because they do not want to find themselves in the hands of lawyers if they have a downturn in their business and they have to be flexible in their employment practices. We could make sure that we have secret ballots on industrial action so that employers could be confident that they were not going to be held to ransom. What has to be done in this country to improve those structural blockages is that the Australian Labor Party, now running a spoiling tactic in the Senate, ought to get out of the way. It ought to allow this government to get on with structural reform, to let us reform the labour system and the welfare system -   - and give Australians the kinds of job opportunities that they deserve. Labor had its go for 13 years and now, in opposition, it is trying to keep unemployment higher than need be. The coalition is the party of jobs; let Labor get out of the way so we can get on with the business.</DOC>

 - In response to the member for Sydney, let me say that obviously it is most unfortunate that this paediatrician is apparently no longer in practice and is apparently no longer treating his patients. I want to make this point to the member for Sydney: any decision that that doctor has made ought not to be based on the IBNR levy because, as of Friday -  - the government announced an 18-month moratorium on IBNR levies over $1,000. What I want, what the government wants and what all members of this House should want is for doctors to stay at their posts and to continue to treat their patients in the best and finest traditions of the medical profession. The government is determined to continue to work with reasonable members of the medical profession to find answers to the long-running issues of medical indemnity liability and insurance. We want to find reasonable answers, and we will find them, but it requires the medical profession to continue to talk to us in good faith. In that way we can go forward.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Pearce for her question. I must say that I did read with some amusement media reports this morning that I had been snubbed by not being invited to the ASEAN business and investment summit held in Bali this week. These reports are very hard to reconcile with the letter of invitation I received last month from the chairman of the organising committee of the business summit inviting me to attend. It was dated 1 September 2003, and it was signed by the chairman of the ASEAN BIS organising committee inviting me to attend the summit. It was an invitation which, owing self-evidently to my parliamentary and other commitments this week and last week, I was unable to accept. I want to put on the record that those reports are wrong. According to my understanding no attempt was made by the correspondent in question to check the veracity of the claim with my office or with anybody in my department, which I think is regrettable. These media reports are of a piece with reports earlier this week that Australia had been rebuffed in our alleged efforts to have an ASEAN-Australia leaders summit. The only problem is that we have not been doing any such lobbying. Indeed, we had advised our ASEAN friends that this was an issue for ASEAN to decide in its own time and in its own way. I put on record the fact that the claim that some attempt was made to snub me in relation to this gathering is plainly wrong.</DOC>

 - The government can understand why people have significant and serious concerns about the whole IBNR situation, and that is why last Friday we announced a moratorium on IBNR levies above $1,000. That is why we announced a moratorium. Not only did we announce a moratorium but we announced a policy review process that will consider this whole issue, including the quantum of the total IBNR liabilities. At the end of the 18-month moratorium period, the levies will be recalculated on the basis of our actual experience of how the reformed tort law system will operate and what it will do to medical indemnity liabilities.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dunkley for his question. Obviously, it is a most unfortunate situation where you have up to 100 doctors resigning from public hospitals in New South Wales and doctors in other areas in other circumstances withdrawing from practice. This government wants doctors to stay at their posts and it wants them to continue to treat their patients in the best and finest traditions of the medical profession. We do not just want them to do it, we are assisting them to do it. The government has already announced $350 million worth of funding over five years to subsidise the insurance premiums of obstetricians and neurosurgeons and to meet 50 per cent of high-cost medical indemnity claims over $2 million. As I have said already repeatedly - and let me say it again for the benefit of members opposite - last Friday the government announced an 18-month moratorium on IBNR levies over $1,000, and we also announced a policy review process to see how we could best achieve an affordable, sustainable system of medical indemnity insurance. At the end of that 18 months, we will recalculate the IBNR liabilities based on our actual experience of the reformed tort laws in New South Wales and the other states. Today, I had further discussions with the Australian Medical Association about medical indemnity issues. I can inform the member for Dunkley that I will continue to talk with the AMA. I want to talk with the AMA. - Yes, in good faith, and I am sure they are talking to me in good faith, because this government accepts that there are significant issues in medical indemnity. This government accepts that doctors have many reasons for feeling unhappy with the system that has evolved through our courts, through our legal culture and through our tort laws over the last few years. I want to make three points. The first point is that governments have to make decisions based on the national interest and not the medical interest. The second point is that no government will submit to ultimatums from any group no matter how important. The third point is that the government will not give a blank cheque to any group however worthy that group might be. I want to make this very clear: we will do whatever we reasonably can to produce a fair, sustainable and affordable medical insurance system. We will work to find answers but those answers have to be fair to patients, be fair to taxpayers as well as be fair to doctors.</DOC>

 - Let me make it very clear -  - that the IBNR levy was calculated on the basis of actuarial material that was provided to the government by UMP. It would be wholly improper of the government to release material provided to us by third parties who have the intellectual property in that material. That is the first point I want to make. - The second point I want to make is that the situation has moved on. -  - It has. Last Friday the government announced an 18-month moratorium on IBNR levies over $1,000. The IBNR liabilities will be recalculated. That old calculation will no longer be relevant, because they will be recalculated on the basis of new actuarial information provided, once we have had some serious experience of the operation of the new tort laws.</DOC>

You are speaking for the Queensland Labor Party, are you? -  - Moving on to the substance of the question, I think the House would be aware that travel advice for Indonesia recommends that Australians defer non-essential travel. Of course, we recognise that many of the families who are going to attend the Bali commemoration this weekend judge that a visit to Bali for the first anniversary of the Bali tragedy is indeed essential travel. We understand that several hundred family members and the seriously injured have taken up the government's offer of assistance to travel to Bali. They will join as many as 2,000 other Australians, Indonesians and people of other nationalities for the service.The government has been working very closely with the Indonesian authorities to organise the memorial service. The security and welfare of Australians have been uppermost in our minds in planning the commemoration. As I think the House knows from previous discussions about Bali, this morning I met with the Indonesian Coordinating Minister for Political and Security Affairs, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono. The Prime Minister has met with him during the course of the afternoon. Security arrangements have been discussed more broadly with him.Australian security professionals conducted two advance visits to Bali to look at security arrangements and to work with their Indonesian counterparts. A substantial team is in Bali at this moment to finalise the arrangements. There will be a strong security presence at the main venue for the memorial service, and at other locations across Bali which are likely to attract Australians. This includes 2,000 Indonesian police officers and special forces. All vehicles entering the site will be screened, and bag checks will be conducted on all people attending the service. Indonesian special forces will have two helicopters on standby as part of its readiness for any counter-terrorist response. The Indonesian military is also assisting the police in securing the outer perimeter of the main venue. My department, together with other Australian agencies, has put in place detailed contingency plans in the event that there are any incidents around the time of the anniversary. Of course, we would always endeavour to do this for major international events in any case. It is only honest to say that no government can provide an absolute guarantee of security, particularly in an environment where we know terrorist groups remain active. But, working with the Indonesians, we have put in place the best possible security arrangements. The government will continue to monitor the security situation. We will keep any Australian travellers to Bali fully informed through our travel advisories as to the security situation. As I have often said about our travel advisories, it is very important that people look at them on a fairly constant basis if they are travelling, because they change from time to time. They are readily available on the Internet.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. First of all, I would like to address the Ubon medal question. There was a letter to the editor in the Australian earlier this week. I table that letter, because it covers the fact that my refusal to recognise the Ubon service with the Vietnam Logistics and Support Medal was not something I just decided myself. This has been looked at by two comprehensive reviews. In 1993-94, there was a committee of inquiry into defence and defence related awards by General Peter Gration. General Peter Gration, as I am sure the honourable member for Cowan is aware, is a former Chief of the Australian Defence Force. In 1999 there was a review of service entitlement anomalies in respect of South-East Asian service between 1955 and 1975. This was chaired by Major-General the Hon. Bob Mohr, who was a former justice of the Supreme Court of South Australia. The issue was also considered more recently, in 2002, by the review into veterans' entitlements which was chaired by the Hon. John Clarke, who is a Supreme Court justice of New South Wales and a justice of the Court of Appeal. More importantly, on that committee was Air Marshal Douglas Riding, who is a former Vice Chief of the Australian Defence Force and himself a senior RAAF executive officer.This medal has not been awarded to the people in Ubon because they did not meet the criteria that are required by the legislation to award this medal. They were never in Vietnam. They were never in an operational area. That has been made very clear. It is a matter of fact. - I also make the point, and I make it with great respect, that neither this government nor any other government has ever given medals on demand. They have actually had to be earned.  - One of the reasons we do not give medals on demand -  - is that it demeans the value of the contribution and the sacrifice of all those Australians who have earned medals and done it the hard way - who have been there, given service, given up their lives, in many cases, and given up their youth. In Vietnam, we lost 520 Australian service men and women. There are still six Australian heroes who are missing in action. There are many thousands of Australians who did service in Vietnam and who are still suffering from the results of that service - and we all know many of them, because many of them are in our electorates. They are TPIs or they have psychiatric problems because of their service. If we gave medals to people just because they demanded it, it would devalue and demean the service of those outstanding veterans. With great respect, I say that this government have never ever given medals on demand and we never will. I would like to table that letter.Further, I think the honourable member raised the issue of the medals in the Strait of Malacca. We have searched our records and we would be very grateful for some further advice. The member said he has given me the information; I am unaware that it has been received.Also, the Long Tan medal was a medal that, purportedly, that particular South Vietnam government at the time wanted to give. We cannot award a Long Tan medal. It is not our medal. It was a medal that came from South Vietnam. I also understand that there were protocols required for that medal to be given, which was an approach to the government for approval to grant the medal. The government of the day never approached our government. That particular South Vietnamese government never approached our government to award that medal. That is a matter of fact, and it is a matter of fact on the face of the record. It is not a medal that this government can award. - Mr Speaker, I did address the issue of the national service medal for the honourable member the last time I answered this question. I understand that there was a backlog of 25,000 of those national service medals. I also understand from the department that that backlog will be cleared by Anzac Day next year so those national servicemen will have their medals to wear on Anzac Day.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Mitchell for his question and his very strong support that values education and especially teachers in the Hills district of Sydney. This government recognises that Australia's economic and social development for this century will essentially be driven by what happens in education, by our ability to learn how to learn and to develop ideas and, from them, technologies we apply to our traditional and emerging industries. This government invested $3 billion in science, innovation and research, and one of the key initiatives of that was to review what constitutes quality teaching in Australia. After 15 months, Professor Kwong Lee Dow, the Deputy Vice-Chancellor of Melbourne University, has today delivered a three-volume report which canvasses the issues in terms of attracting, retaining, preparing and inspiring the best teachers that we can possibly have. I think that most of us as parents realise that, apart from us as parents, it is teachers who will most inform and influence the development of our children. That is why this government places such a high priority on the quality of teachers in Australian schools. There are three principal issues that are addressed by the report, which I commend to every member of the House for reading. I have dispatched a copy of the report today to every state and territory education minister and to those who run non-government education authorities. The first of the three themes is quality. What really makes a difference in a school is not the size of the sandstone out the front of the school or the size of the playing grounds. It is the quality of the teaching that occurs in the classroom that accounts for the difference between and within schools. On behalf of the government I announced in July this year that we will commit the first $10 million to the establishment of a national institute for quality teaching and school leadership to see that we bring national consistency to the quality of teachers that are teaching our children.The second theme of the report is leadership. What really makes a difference in a school - government or non-government - is the quality of the principal, and his or her ability to inspire the teachers in that school. The third issue addressed principally in the report is that of the teacher work force. There are 376,000 teachers in Australia and disturbingly 117,000 are not teaching. Within five years of graduating from university, a quarter of Australia's teachers have left the teaching work force. Disturbingly, in the report you will find that four months after graduating from university only 60 per cent of teachers are actually teaching in a classroom.So the arguments in relation to teacher shortages cannot be responded to by simply turning on the tap in terms of training even more teachers. This government has announced an extra $81 million investment for the training of teachers in universities and has increased places over the next five years for the training of teachers.I was asked about alternative policies. The Australian Labor Party's attitude to this is simply to reduce the HECS charges on 57,000 students studying science subjects at universities. What will happen is that if the Labor Party should ever come to office the head of the Commonwealth Department of Finance and Administration will say to the new Treasurer that he will have three choices: firstly, he will have to find another $262 million because the Labor Party has underfunded its commitments; secondly, he will have to apply a $262 million tax on Australia's 38 universities; or, thirdly, he will have to be honest with the Australian people and say that the Labor Party cannot do its maths and cannot adequately fund its commitments. This report released today is all about our future and I commend it to the parliament.</DOC>

 - The specific reason why this issue has been canvassed in this report is because I raised with the chairman of the committee a year ago -  - the issue of HECS contributions made by science and mathematics graduates who subsequently go on to teach. - This government not only appropriately and fully accounts for whatever commitments it makes but also does things methodically. I asked Professor Kwong Lee Dow and his reference group to carefully consider the merits of such a policy application. Today they have made a recommendation in that regard and of course the government will be considering it.My challenge to the Australian Labor Party is to recommend two of the other recommendations to their cousins who currently run state and territory governments. If you want quality education in Australian schools, there are two things that need to be done. The first is that schools themselves need more freedom to run their own affairs instead of having a centralised education bureaucracy telling a school who it should employ and what it should do. How can a principal offer a quality education to our children if he or she has to take 10 teachers that are sent to him or her from head office despite the fact that two or three might be pretty ordinary?The second recommendation from the report that I put to the Labor Party is that of performance based pay for teachers. The problem in Australia at the moment is that the most mediocre teacher receives the same rate of pay as a teacher who works his or her tail off for our kids. - The teacher who turns up at seven o'clock in the morning, goes home at six o'clock at night, comes in at weekends, prepares lessons and does all kinds of things to support our children receives the same rate of pay as the most mediocre, disinterested, disengaged teacher in the school. One of the key challenges for state governments in particular, which we as a government and as parents put to the education authorities, is to introduce performance based pay for teachers, and then the legitimate industrial concerns of the teachers and their union representatives will be more likely to be met sympathetically by governments and the Australian public.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kalgoorlie for his question. He is obviously a very staunch proponent not only in the seat of Kalgoorlie but in all of Australia for the development of our resources. This government, unlike the opposition, stands for investments, exports and jobs. If we look at today's job figures, you need no further proof. We have the lowest unemployment for almost 14 years. Part of our job-creating formula is our Invest Australia agency. Invest Australia has attracted some 28 projects into Australia through its work and they are projects that would have gone elsewhere in the world were it not for our efforts. Projects like Comalco's Gladstone refinery and Holden's V6 engine plant will bring some 1,400 jobs to Australia and see some $300 million worth of investment in Australia over the next three years. Today it is Western Australia's turn. This morning I announced a grant to fund the establishment of a joint user infrastructure of some $35.4 million on the Burrup Peninsula. That will see the establishment of infrastructure like a seawater pipeline, the establishment of a desalination plant, the connection of electricity and, of course, port services. The response to that has been immediate from the company GTL Resources. - The investment by GTL Resources is substantially larger than the Mallee pipeline. The investment is some $700 million in the Burrup Peninsula. It will create some 600 jobs during its construction. It will earn this country some $350 million per year in exports. Those are the sorts of things that we do for regional Australia: we encourage investment in regional Australia; we create jobs in regional Australia; we create exports from regional Australia; and we, of course, encourage the introduction of new technology into regional Australia. These actions by this government are not only good for Western Australia - not only good for the member for Kalgoorlie and his seat - but good for all of Australia.</DOC>

 - In answer to the honourable member for Calare, the federal government considers recommendations from the National Rural Advisory Council, which independently assesses all of the applications that are put to it for exceptional circumstances relief. It considers the information provided by the respective state governments and deals with the specific requests by the state governments in relation to the declaration. In some instances the states request the declaration only for certain industries. That will often be because they have made an assessment themselves that a particular industry does not qualify or because, for some other reason, they do not have adequate data to support the case.The National Rural Advisory Council deals independently with the information that is put to it. It also seeks additional advice where it can from the Australian Bureau of Agricultural Resource Economics, BRS and other relevant organisations. Invariably, the government accepts their recommendations. If the honourable member wants more specific details about a particular application, I am more than happy to respond specifically to the honourable member, but my expectation is that the National Rural Advisory Council has made a recommendation on the basis of the request provided by the New South Wales government with the application.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Maranoa for his question and recognise the large number of regional and remote small businesses in his very large electorate and how well he services their needs. Small business employs 3.2 million Australians - and even more after the great figure this month. Thirty-four per cent of Australia's 1.1 million small businesses are in regional Australia. To create small business jobs, it is crucial for the unfair dismissal law reforms to pass through the Senate. There have now been 17 separate occasions on which the Labor Party has refused to remove the application of the unfair dismissal laws to Australia's 1.1 million small businesses.You would have thought that the member for Werriwa, who has expressed an opinion on just about everything, would have said something about the application of unfair dismissal laws to small business. Well, he has said very little. In fact, he has said nothing. I went back over 150 articles he has written since 2000 - I was suffering insomnia - and there was nothing there about unfair dismissal laws. There was nothing about payroll tax, which is imposed by the states on small business. There was nothing about the imposition of land tax on small business by the states. There was nothing about stamp duty, which is a huge impediment for small business in the states. But he has written six articles about online democracy and other `top of mind' issues. He has written an article about the new political correctness; he has written about why the IT revolution is undermining statism; and - how about this old one, another justification for the Whitlam government - he wrote an article on Jackson Pollock's Blue Poles. There was nothing about small business.If the Labor Party would for just one millisecond care for the interests of Australia's 1.1 million small businesses, they would pass the reforms to the unfair dismissal laws and they would call on their mates in the states to pass the reforms to the law of negligence, because there are still some states that have not passed reforms to the law of negligence. Everywhere I go, Australia's small businesses say to me, `We want reform to the law of negligence by the states so that we can go back to the days when people would accept some responsibility for their own actions.' That is what we want - that is what the coalition believe in - and sooner or later the Labor Party have to do something for small business instead of just hating small business.</DOC>

 - I can provide some updated information for the House in relation to the situation confronting the sheep on board the MV Cormo Express. The vessel is currently in Kuwait, taking on additional feed and other provisions. There have been significant delays in putting that feed on board. Early in the week there was a small fire on board, which held up the process. Subsequently there have been equipment breakdowns. There have also been problems in securing the required quantities of feed from the various Kuwaiti authorities. We anticipate that taking on board the feed will take at least another 24 hours - probably 48 hours. At that particular stage a further decision can be made about where the vessel will sail.  We have three teams of people working on options as to what might occur in relation to the future of the shipment. One group is dealing with seeking a satisfactory destination in the region where the sheep can be unloaded. That remains by far the government's priority. We believe the best option is to find a place where the sheep can be unloaded, preferably as near as possible to where they are currently located. But because we have already made contacts with more than 30 countries - we have exhausted 50 or more various options and ideas that have been put forward as to how the sheep might be able to be placed in various locations - we have to consider, realistically, the alternatives. There are essentially two alternatives: the first is slaughter at sea or at some other location offshore; the second option is for them to be brought back to Australia under strict quarantine conditions. There are two teams of people working on each of those options, neither of which is attractive. There are all sorts of difficulties associated with each option. We have not ruled out either. We are looking at what needs to be done in each particular case. If they are to be brought back to Australia, it will require that that occur under strict quarantine conditions. Work is being done on the development of a risk evaluation process, on the identification of diseases and on other issues that have to be addressed. That work is quite advanced. In addition to that, to complete a full risk evaluation obviously we have to know what type of arrangements would be put in place in relation to quarantine. If a decision is made that the sheep should be returned to Australia, that kind of information obviously will be made available. Considerable consultation is already occurring with industry. It is not being done privately or in secret. I welcome the cooperation of industry, but a lot more work will still have to be done before a final decision is made in those regards. </DOC>

 - The first point I would make is that Peter and Lindy are far more likely to have a job in the first place than when the Labor Party was in government. The second point I would make is that their home mortgage repayments are infinitely lower than they were when the Labor Party was in government. - The third point I would make is that their real incomes would have risen by about 12 per cent on average over those that they would have experienced when the Labor Party was in power. The next point I would make is that I have no idea what assumptions the member opposite makes about their income levels. I can tell the House that, whatever they are, the extrapolation made cannot possibly have been accurate because tax rates have come down, not up. I would conclude by saying that I think we have a very proud record on this side of the House of meeting the needs of all sections of the Australian community - a far better record than yours, Mr Speaker, and we intend going on -  -  - than the Labor Party's - and we intend going on meeting the needs and aspirations of Australians to a very high level.</DOC>

 - First, can I thank the honourable member for Pearce for her question and her interest. I think all members of the House would have been very moved over the weekend with the commemoration of the Bali bombings one year ago. Much has been said about that by the Prime Minister and others. It is important for us to remember - as the Prime Minister, the opposition leader and others in Bali have done - the Balinese victims of the events of 12 October. In the immediate aftermath of the bombings, Australia provided medical services and trauma counselling to Indonesian victims, who were predominantly Balinese. In February of this year, we announced a $10½ million package of health assistance to Bali, which includes the construction of a burns unit and an intensive care coronary unit at Bali's Sanglah Hospital; the building of a new eye centre to treat operable blindness, and short- and long-term training for Balinese health workers. Yesterday in Bali, the Prime Minister laid the foundation stone for the eye centre and unveiled plaques at the burns and intensive care units. He also announced the awarding of six long-term scholarships to Balinese health staff to study in Australia.The contributions we made have been important, and once the work is finished it will be of great assistance to the people of Bali. The impact, though, has not just been in the health sector or on those Balinese who were directly affected by the bombings. The exodus of visitors from Bali has caused very great economic hardship in the tourism sector and, obviously more broadly, on the livelihoods of the Balinese people. In order to help Bali address that, Australia has set up the Bali rehabilitation fund so that we can provide some assistance to help individuals and community groups get back on their feet and, in some cases, to find alternative means of employment. This fund has supported activities such as women's microcredit programs and training for urban women in various forms of work - for example, so they can produce salted eggs for sale in markets. It is also providing management training to 200 small businesses which are struggling to keep afloat as a result of the impact on tourism of the Bali bombings. AusAID have done a study into the effectiveness of the Bali rehabilitation fund and, frankly, have been rather impressed with the efficacy of the fund. As a result, I took the opportunity of announcing over the weekend that the Australian government would renew the fund for another year. In a year's time we will see how it is going and what has happened to the Balinese economy. In answer to the honourable member for Pearce's question, I want to make the point today that we in this country have thought a great deal about the impact of the Bali bombings on the people of Bali. We do not expect any praise or credit for this, but we quite rightly have gone out and made a contribution to try to help the beautiful people of Bali deal with the terrible consequences of those horrific events of 12 October last year.</DOC>

 - Let me make the point that under the family payments system that we have put in place they would certainly be doing better than under the family payments arrangements that you had in place. - They have been very substantially increased. They amount to some $11 billion to $12 billion a year now. - The fact is that arrangements have been put in place to seek to facilitate those who may have, over time, inadvertently been paid more than they ought to have. I believe that the government has moved reasonably and fairly to meet those needs.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for La Trobe for his question. As members of the House will know, last Thursday's labour force figures showed that unemployment remained at 5.8 per cent in Australia, which is a 13-year low, going all the way back to 1990. The combination of low inflation and low unemployment that we have in this country is something that we have not seen for quite some time. The last time Australia had a combination of an unemployment rate below six per cent and an inflation rate below three per cent was in December 1968. Those people with economic experience since 1968 - as most of us have - have never seen a combination of low unemployment and low inflation to this degree. During the last five years Australia has been able to weather the Asian financial crisis, the US recession, the war in Iraq, SARS and many other downturns in the economy because we have kept our economy strong.I am asked what obstacles we have had in keeping the Australian economy strong. Within this country, nearly all of the obstacles to keeping the Australian economy strong have come from the Australian Labor Party. When this government determined to balance the budget, we were opposed by the Australian Labor Party. When this government determined to reform the tax system, we were opposed by the Australian Labor Party. When this government have set out to change Australia's unfair dismissal laws, we have been opposed by the Australian Labor Party, acting on the orders of this country's trade union movement. This government's proposals to change the unfair dismissal laws have now been blocked or defeated in the Senate on no fewer than 16 occasions. It is not because the Labor Party do not know the truth; they know that these are job-destroying laws. - The member for Hunter, who intervenes at this moment, knows it, because the small business woman to whom he is married has actually told him that the unfair dismissal laws are hampering job creation in this country. Labor opposes budget reform; it opposes tax reform. It opposed labour market reform. It continues to oppose welfare reform. We have been promised so many things by the member for Werriwa, who was going to make Labor the party of economic responsibility and fiscal rigour. In one of the speeches that he gave when he was in his macho phase, muscling up, back in July of 1999 -  - The Deputy Leader of the Opposition enjoys this. She sure does. The member for Werriwa gave a speech called `The welfare state and the third way'. We do not hear much about the third way anymore in question time. It has gone the way of roll-back. In that speech the member for Werriwa said:Something also needs to be done about the outrageous growth in the Disability Support Pension ... It is being used as a way of shifting people off the dole and artificially lowering the unemployment rate. Some experts believe the size of the program should be no more than 150,000 -  - Mr Speaker, the member for McMillan intervenes. - The last time unemployment was below six per cent and inflation was below three per cent was before the member for McMillan had been born, before the midwife had given him the first smack on the bottom. We wish she had given more smacks on the bottom. In terms of the welfare state and your third way, `the DSP needs to be overhauled and mutual responsibility policies applied to all with a genuine capacity for work'. Here was the big, macho member for Werriwa demanding that there be reform to the disability support pension. The government has a bill in the Australian Senate to do precisely that - to introduce mutual obligation in relation to disability support. The Labor Party has defeated it twice and the member for Werriwa, so brave about the third way, declines to vote for it. I said that, if the member for Werriwa wanted to show that Labor was intent on turning over and trying to become barely respectable, the first thing he would do would be to change Labor's vote in the Senate on the disability support pension and the PBS. There is lots of macho talk but no action. This is a government which led in the budget. It led on tax reform. It is leading on PBS. It is leading on welfare reform. This is a government which has given Australia opportunities, and the thing that stands between it and better opportunities for Australians is the Australian Labor Party. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. The first thing I point out is that, with all due respect to Richmond, it is not a geographically huge electorate and around 63 per cent or 64 per cent of patients are still bulk-billed. I have to say it would still be quite possible to find someone to bulk-bill in that electorate; so that, I think, demolishes the first part of your argument.But if Peter and Lindy were in any way worried about whether or not they could access medical care, the first thing they might like to consider is the way in which, under Labor, the number of country children studying medicine slipped to about five or six per cent of the medical intake in the country's medical schools. We know full well that the supply of medical practitioners in country areas is heavily dependent on a decent number - around 25 per cent to 30 per cent - of kids from the country studying medicine in the first place. That is where we have got it back to. That will give us the supply of doctors that we will need in future in rural and regional areas. The point I would make about our target constituents, Peter and Lindy, is that it is not surprising that one thing that our research showed is that they do not believe the Labor Party has any answers or is worthy of any support.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and his interest. The first thing to say in answer to the honourable member's question is that the Australian government warmly welcomes the steps that the Indonesian government has taken in the course of the last year to counter the threat of terrorism. It has legislated for greater powers to investigate and prosecute terrorists including, in the case of the Bali investigation, introducing some retrospective legislation. Thirty-six of those directly or indirectly involved in the Bali bombing have been placed in custody. Of these, 21 have been convicted and sentenced. Three of them have received the highest sentence in Indonesian law, the death sentence. For now, five suspects still remain at large. I very much welcomed Minister Yudhoyono saying, in his recent speech, in relation to the five:We will hunt them, we will find them, we will bring them to justice.If the Indonesian government's record on the investigations into the Bali bombing is any guide, I am sure they will succeed. What is more, today Jemaah Islamiah is an internationally proscribed organisation. We have worked shoulder to shoulder with the Indonesian government in the fight against terrorism. We are helping them establish a financial intelligence unit to identify and restrict the flow of funds to terrorists, and we have provided a four-year package to help to build Indonesia's counter-terrorism capacity in law enforcement, antiterrorist financing and border security. Importantly, the Indonesian foreign minister, Hassan Wirajuda, and I will be co-hosting a regional ministerial summit on counter-terrorism in February of next year. That will include ministers from all the ASEAN countries - from China, Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand, obviously, and the United States. We also think it would be appropriate to invite a representative from Europe.A tremendous amount has been done between Australia and Indonesia over the last year in the fight against terrorism. There is a great deal more work to be done. There is a long way to go in the fight against Jemaah Islamiah. Nobody can claim that the job is done, but the job has started and good work has been done. There is much still to do.I think it is probably fair to say that we were disturbed by the news some weeks ago that a senior Jemaah Islamiah member who is an Indonesian citizen - Fathur Rohman al-Ghozi - had escaped from police custody in Manila and was on the loose. This is a person who has been responsible for many bombings and the planning of bombings and who is a seriously dangerous terrorist.It is with great delight that the Australian government has learnt that al-Ghozi has been shot. Perhaps one should not say we are delighted that someone has been shot but, nevertheless, we are delighted that he is no longer on the loose. Whilst we are not a government that would encourage people to be assassinated, it is also important to say though that this is somebody who has been responsible for a series of terrorist attacks. The fact that he is now no longer able to do that is frankly very good news and we do not hide from that. He was one of the region's most wanted and dangerous criminals. I understand he was killed by the Philippines security forces in Mindanao yesterday evening.Al-Ghozi was a truly evil man. He was a master bombmaker and trainer. He was arrested and sentenced in the Philippines for possession of explosives. Al-Ghozi escaped from detention, as I said earlier, in July. It is important to just reflect on this bit of information: al-Ghozi is suspected of masterminding bombings that killed 22 people in Manila in December 2000, as well as bombings in the Philippines and Indonesia. So we are delighted that he is no longer on the loose. Australia welcomes the high degree of cooperation we have had with the Philippines on counter-terrorism, and I can only say that al-Ghozi's demise makes the region and the world a safer place. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. No, I am not aware of that particular situation in Gladstone and I will talk to the member for Hinkler about it afterwards. Let me firstly make the point that the government has indeed rapidly expanded the number of apprenticeships available in the Australian education system and there will be a very substantial increase in the number of places at TAFE under the higher education reforms being brought forward by the minister for education.Mr Speaker, let me also make the point that if there is one thing that, if there is a Peter and Lindy in Gladstone, they might be concerned about it would be the fact that it is a mining dependent region and you are going to tax them out of existence to pay for your so-called higher education plan. They do not think that is a good idea in Gladstone at all, nor do they think your policy on Kyoto is a good idea.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Cook for his question. I appreciate his concern to ensure that all Australians have continued access to affordable, high-quality health care. I can inform the House that the government has had extensive dialogue with the Australian Medical Association because we understand the depth of doctors' feelings about the medical indemnity problem and we also appreciate the importance of keeping doctors at their posts in New South Wales and Queensland public hospitals.Last Friday I announced that existing IBNR levy notices would be withdrawn and that new levy notices would not be issued until after a policy review process has been completed and that they would be capped at $1,000 for an 18-month period. I also announced that doctors in public hospitals with personal private practice income of less than $5,000 would be exempt from existing and future levies. I will chair a policy review process committee, including at least two doctors, to report to the Prime Minister by 10 December, to reassess IBNR levies, liabilities and the incidence of levies in the light of our experience of tort law reform. The policy review process will also examine what needs to be done to ensure that Australia has a long-term, affordable and sustainable system of medical indemnity insurance. In the meantime, the government will extend the existing high-cost claims scheme to medical indemnity claims of more than half a million dollars. I very much welcomed the AMA's issuing of the medical equivalent of a return to work notice. I look forward to continuing to work with the medical profession to ensure stability in our public hospitals. I look forward to continuing to work with the New South Wales government in particular, which is responsible for the operation of our public hospitals and which has, to a very great extent, put reform tort laws in place. The one thing I would give great credit to the New South Wales government for is that it has never tried to play politics with the health of the Australian people.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Jagajaga for her question of the government. In 1988-89, to its great credit the Australian Labor Party introduced the Higher Education Contribution Scheme, otherwise known as HECS. Under those arrangements what happens is that students, when they have finished university, then pay back through the tax system about one-quarter of the cost of the education that they have received, three-quarters of which has been funded by everyday Australian taxpayers, many of whom have never seen the inside of a university. What the government is intending to do is to ensure as we go forward into the future that Australian citizens, when they access Australian higher education, do not have to pay a cent up-front when they get to the university gate; that the taxpayer will continue to pay for almost three-quarters of the cost of university education; and that graduates will pay back their HECS contribution through the tax system once they have finished their university education. I also remind the parliament that those who go to university have a lifetime unemployment rate that is one-quarter that of those who have not gone to university. Men who have gone to university earn on average $622,000 more than those who have not gone to university, women who have gone to university earn $413,000 more than those who have not gone to university, and 92 per cent of people who have gone to university have a job within four months of graduation. What the Labor Party is seeking to imply in the question is a deception - a cruel deception being perpetrated on parents to lead them into the false belief that university education is something that has to be paid for in HECS contributions when students get to university - when in fact the very system they are seeking to criticise is the one which they designed and implemented, to their credit.In relation to facts, and it is an entirely hypothetical question - of course it is, in a sense - I will remind the Labor Party of some facts. The member for Jagajaga refers to an article in the Sunday Herald Sun. I would like to refer to an article in the Sunday Herald Sun of 21 June 1992 to remind Peter and Lindy and everyday Australians of what life was like under a Labor government. Under the headline `A national disgrace', this editorial says:Welcome to the lucky country. University graduates are begging for unpaid jobs ... - Life for everyday Australians under a Labor government was represented by the Sunday Herald Sun under the headline `A national disgrace'. `Welcome to the lucky country,' it read. - It said:Welcome to the lucky country. University graduates are begging for unpaid jobs just to get experience in the workplace. Sacked apprentices are offering their services for nothing in return for a chance to finish their trade training. A desperate father is offering to pay an employer $100 a week for three years to give his son an apprenticeship, yet there is still no taker as teenage unemployment hits 46 per cent in Victoria. Welcome to nothing.That is the kind of future the Labor Party represents when it gets control of the government Treasury bench: an empty future in which the future of current generations of Australians is traded in return for profligate expenditure and failure to manage the Treasury bench and the economy of the country effectively. What this government is doing is giving the next generation of Australians a future and, in this case, a quality university education in which they and their parents can have confidence. </DOC>

 - The honourable member for McPherson is right in identifying as particularly repugnant the form of transnational crime involving sexual servitude and the trafficking of people in one form or another from nation to nation, involving the deception and degradation of many hundreds of thousands of people. While in international terms here in Australia it is a relatively small number of people that we believe have been trafficked, the fact is that few countries are immune. The Asia-Pacific region has become a hub for trafficking in persons, particularly for sexual servitude. All countries, whether they are source countries, transit countries or a destination country such as Australia, have a responsibility to address this issue.The Australian Crime Commission, in consultation with other Commonwealth agencies, is gathering intelligence so that it can provide a better assessment for government on the issue. We take seriously our responsibility to combat this trade - one victim of trafficking is one too many. We have been making sustained efforts to eliminate it, by investigating and prosecuting traffickers, and to protect the welfare of victims. In 1999 we introduced strong legislation criminalising some of the serious forms of exploitation. Slavery now carries a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment. That is a very significant penalty. The Australian Federal Police recently arrested eight alleged people-traffickers in Sydney and Melbourne and, I am advised, are currently investigating 18 cases. Today the government has announced a further commitment, by allocating $20 million over four years for a major package of additional measures. These measures will enhance detection, investigation and prosecution. The package will complement existing efforts, including the Australian government aid program activities which are valued at $14 million. It includes a new public awareness campaign, a 23-member strike team for the Australian Federal Police, a new senior migration officer in Thailand focused on trafficking issues, closer links between the AFP and DIMIA, new visa provisions for potentially trafficked persons and a comprehensive package of victim support measures. It will include a development and reintegration assistance package for those people who are returned to source countries in particular. It will involve improvements to legislation to comprehensively criminalise trafficking. It will contain legislative amendments to make telecommunications interception available in connection with trafficking. This package is a very strong, well-considered and determined response to people-trafficking and sexual exploitation and it confirms our commitment to combat this insidious crime.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question which I dare say might have been foreseeable. Again the ALP seek to play with words and they seek to scaremonger. A point I made at the conference was that one of the problems with this debate is the sheer level of dishonesty, lies and misconstructions that are put about for politically opportunistic reasons. The very first point that has to be made is that the Labor Party's only latterly discovered interest in rural telecommunications cannot be taken as genuine - and no-one believes it is. It might interest the honourable member that, as there is so much fascination with the conference we have just had in Canberra, I actually asked the assembled delegates, of which there was a very large number, whether a single one of them believed that the Labor Party would not sell Telstra, and there was not one. When I posed the question, `Do you think they would sell it the way they sold the Commonwealth Bank, without safeguards?' they believed that as well.  - One of the chief lies told in this place is that somehow or other governments cannot regulate the private sector. Of course they can. Does anyone here seriously believe that the member who has just asked me the question really adopts the position that the Commonwealth government could not regulate Telstra?An opposition member - You can't even regulate sheep. - The flippant answer of course tells the reality that they know full well that this place can regulate Telstra regardless of who owns it. They know that. They chose not to do it when they sold the Commonwealth Bank, but they know full well that the government can do it. We go on from there: they know full well that we have said that a licence condition for Telstra to remain operating will centre on it maintaining an ongoing local presence in regional, rural and remote Australia. They seek to scaremonger on that as well. What we propose to do is clearly set out in the second reading speech. The mechanism for doing it is contained in section 66 in the explanatory memorandum. If the shadow minister took the time to read it, he might very well find that he understands it better. Under those arrangements the conditions put in place by the minister will be subject to a disallowable instrument. I think the real question here is: what would the Labor Party do with that disallowable instrument? Are they now telling the Australian people that they will let Telstra off the hook? Are they now saying that, despite all their rhetoric about wanting to keep Telstra up to the mark and about caring about rural Australia, they will through the disallowable instrument walk away from those standards? That is what the Australian people need to know - whether you will go back to what you did when you were in government when we had a wholly owned Telecom and a wholly owned PMG before that and we had the widest gap ever between country and city standards. Is that what you are going to take us back to? It is open for you to tell us whether you are going to use the disallowable instrument to achieve that objective. That is something the Australian people would be very interested to hear.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Cowper for his question. Of course it is a simple fact that since 1996 the sound economic management that the coalition government has delivered to Australia has seen significant export growth in Australia from $99 billion worth of exports to $151 billion and all the jobs that go along with that throughout Australia, both metropolitan and regional. The member for Cowper would be interested to know that as part of that process an engineering company in the member for Cowper's electorate has benefited from some of the good work that our government has done in providing a strong and competitive economic base in Australia to deal with the markets of the world. An engineering company in his electorate called Smith Hudson has recently created 45 new jobs with a contract for $30 million to provide equipment to the North West Shelf following the sale to China of $25 billion worth of gas off the North West Shelf. Not only are there benefits to Western Australia from that deal, there are also benefits in Coffs Harbour in the member's electorate. As the result of sound economic management that we have been able to deliver to the Australian economy - giving low interest rates, low inflation, low unemployment, a 20 per cent improvement in productivity and the all-important tax reforms that we introduced as a government - we have significantly improved the competitiveness of Australian exporters in the international marketplace. Tax reform removed a $3.5 billion burden off the back of Australian exporters, and that in itself is a significant achievement in terms of making our exporters more competitive in the international environment. It should also be remembered that every inch of the way every one of those changes was opposed by the Australian Labor Party in this place and in the Senate. During this period of Australia's history, the Australian Labor Party will be seen as a roadblock or a handbrake on the Australian economy, not as a builder of the Australian economy. That has been achieved under the leadership of those in this House. That is a fact and those opposite are still doing it. They want to be recorded as destroyers of the Australian economy, not as builders.The challenge is before Labor now in the Senate to pass our budget bills to help create a more sustainable, strong Australian economy. The challenge is before the Labor Party to pass our unfair dismissal bills in the Senate to help small business and to help make us, as a nation, much more productive than we are today. The challenge is before them. We will keep putting these bills back to the Labor Party. The Australian public, as we run through to the next election, will know who is opposing them and who is supporting them.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. In relation to the first part of his question - the question of Hicks and Habib - the government has made it clear on a number of occasions, first of all, that these people have been detained as unlawful combatants in Afghanistan. The situation is quite clear: there is a war against terrorism, there was military conflict very specifically in Afghanistan and, in the case of David Hicks, that was where he was detained. - The honourable member for Denison calls out `forever', but he knows only too well that the United States has proposed taking David Hicks before a military commission. The Australian government has been in negotiation with the United States over the details of how the military commission should work, and the British government has been in like discussions. Those discussions have moved forward very successfully and we will wait and see as events unfold. In relation to human rights issues concerning China, the present Australian government established some time ago - in 1997 from recollection - a bilateral human rights dialogue with China. We were one of the first countries, if not the first country, in the world to establish a dialogue of that kind. We also have a human rights technical assistance program that comes out of that human rights dialogue. This has given us an extraordinary opportunity to be able to raise a full range of human rights issues, including those relating to Tibet. The government and delegations have raised these issues. NGOs have been invited to functions during the human rights dialogues when they take place in Australia, which they do in alternate years. Some NGOs, by the way, boycott the functions, but some come. Those that choose to come and engage in discussion with the Chinese about these issues are obviously able to raise questions relating to Tibet and a whole raft of other issues on the human rights agenda with China - for example, the rights of the Falun Gong.We have a very extensive process for engaging with China on these issues and it is part of the maturity of the relationship. We do not pretend that Australia and China agree with each other on everything, that we share exactly the same values or that the same principles of democracy apply in both countries. We have differences. We have set up mechanisms for discussing those differences in a civilised and constructive way with the Chinese - not, if I may say so, through a series of stunts. I am not accusing the honourable member for Cunningham of pursuing a political stunt. Maybe he has not been here long enough to do that yet! I do not think political stunts - and I mean that in the broad, not in relation to Australian politicians particularly - are the way to get a message across to governments such as the Chinese government. I would hope that during the visit of President Hu Jintao, which will be the second ever visit by a president of China to Australia, people will treat him with appropriate respect. The range of issues that are of interest and concern between Australia and China will, of course, be discussed.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Parkes for his question and very strong advocacy for the people of Parkes and, in particular, Aboriginal people. The Prime Minister of this government and, indeed, the entire government has placed a very high priority on progressing the fundamental issues that face Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians in health, living conditions, education and employment outcomes. I suppose at times, as we debate certain issues in the parliament, it is easy for us to lose sight of there being a group of Australians whose needs are, by any standards, enormous.What the government and the Prime Minister did in November 2000 was to have the state and territory premiers and leaders agree, through the Council of Australian Governments, to a whole of government approach targeting eight regions of Australia to do what we could to overcome some of the bureaucratic obstacles to delivering better services to Aboriginal Australians. One of those eight regions is Murdi Paaki, which covers 300,000 square kilometres and includes the electorates of Gwydir and Parkes. It has nine local government areas and 18 Aboriginal communities where about 55,000 Australians live - all of whom, but in particular the 15,000 Aboriginal people in that area, have significant needs. An Aboriginal man named Sam Jefferies has been appointed Chairman of the Murdi Paaki Regional Council. This government is working with the New South Wales government and local government authorities to overcome some of the bureaucratic obstacles which prevent the seamless delivery of services. Only about one in five Aboriginal children in New South Wales can pass a basic year 3 reading test and only one in four Aboriginal children can do so in year 5. Of course, in some parts of New South Wales it is much worse.When we came to government, only 29 per cent of Aboriginal people stayed on until year 12. That figure is now 38 per cent. But, by any standard, we have a long way to go; it is still only half that of non-Aboriginal Australia. With the member for Parkes, I recently visited the Wilcannia Central School. We also went to Lightning Ridge, and I commend Peter Partridge for the enormous reforms he is undertaking at the Lightning Ridge Central School. Having left Moree, we also visited Cobar, and I must say that one thing is obvious: there is on the part of the Howard government and the New South Wales government a determination to cut through the bureaucratic obstacles and have community working parties, led by and composed entirely of Aboriginal people, give us advice on what programs they want delivered to their communities and on what those priorities are. They have told us that they want to focus on strengthening families, on education and on improving the health of families, and this government is determined to assist them. In the end, we will all be judged by the extent to which we are able to lift educational outcomes at this end of the spectrum as much as, if not more than, the extent to which we are able to achieve world-class excellence at the other.</DOC>

It owns and operates the Labor Party and funds it to the tune of $5 million a year, and he who pays the piper calls the tune. As members opposite would well know, the Liberal Party supports traditional institutions, and the strongest traditional institution of all is the Crown.

 - I thank the honourable member for Dunkley for his question, and I acknowledge the leadership role that he plays in the environmental debate within the coalition. The Howard government's $2.7 billion Natural Heritage Trust is without question the greatest environmental rescue effort in Australian history. Because of the trust, we now have cleaner beaches, reduced erosion, cleaner air, more productive agricultural land and increased protection for our threatened species. The Natural Heritage Trust has funded environmental works on over 700,000 hectares of land - that is over one million rugby pitches. The trust has mobilised more than 400,000 volunteers to assist in planting some 27 million seedlings and constructing over 36,000 kilometres of fencing, the equivalent of fencing the road from Sydney to Melbourne 42 times.I announced a short time ago, in fulfilment of a major 2001 election commitment, some 15 Australian places as major biodiversity hot spots. These hot spots are areas which are rich in biodiversity but face immediate threats from salinity, weeds, feral animals and unsustainable land clearing. Hot spots have previously been identified at a global level, but it is a world first to identify these hot spots at a national level and on a continental scale. We are putting the spotlight on these areas because if we act now we can prevent environmental damage to key areas where Australian biodiversity is at risk. The government will be ensuring that the Commonwealth's eight statewide bush care coordinators and over 60 regional facilitators are trained in hot spot conservation and that the regions put hot spot conservation at the top of their priority listings.Unlike Labor, we believe that economic and environmental sustainability are intrinsically linked. The reason the Howard government have been able to make these very substantial investments in Australia's environment is that we have put into place responsible economic management and retired billions of dollars of Labor debt. That has put us in a position where we are now able to invest unprecedented amounts in preserving the Australian environment. Labor has an unsustainable approach to government finances, to economic management and to Australia's environment. It is this government which is giving the leadership which is putting it at the forefront of the world's protection of biodiversity.</DOC>

 - I can understand why the member for Flinders has asked me that question. There is good news for his electorate, thanks to the programs of the Howard government. A doctor has just established a new practice at Pearcedale in the electorate of Flinders under the government's More Doctors For Outer Metropolitan Areas scheme. I inform the House that, since this $80 million program began operating in January this year, 113 new doctors are in outer metropolitan areas around Australia, thanks to the Howard government. This program complements the government's Rural Retention Program to keep doctors in rural and remote areas. I advise the member for Flinders that so far some 2,400 doctors have received $54 million under this particular program.As well, in the last financial year over 1,500 overseas-trained doctors were given Medicare provider numbers to work in areas of doctor shortage. Thanks to the policies and programs that this government has put in place, I am pleased to say that the number of rural doctors working full time has increased by 11 per cent over the last five years. This government does not believe in medical conscription, but it does believe in carefully targeted programs to ensure that doctors go to areas of need.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Cowan for his question on the new military rehabilitation and compensation scheme. A significant role in my portfolio has been to meld the Veterans Entitlements Act with the best aspects of the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act. The bill will have a strong focus on rehabilitation, which will ensure that people are not left alone, to drift out of the work force and into social isolation. The compensation for permanent impairment in this legislation will match the VEA and the SRCA, and compensation for severe impairment - I am sure the honourable member for Cowan will be pleased to hear - will be enhanced. There will be a choice of tax-free regular payments that are indexed to the CPI or a tax-free age based lump sum, so that people can choose from the available packages the one that will best suit their circumstances. Widowed partners will have a choice to receive the equivalent of a VEA, a war widows pension for life or an age based lump sum. Again, they can choose to what best suits their circumstances. If their partner's death is a result of warlike or non-warlike service, they will receive an age based death benefit -  - In the case of a widowed partner, if their partner's death is as a result of warlike or non-warlike service, they will receive an age based death benefit of up to $100,000. This bill is planned for introduction early in November this year. The member for Cowan has asked about an offset. It is not a means test; it is an offset. - If the offset is not applied, it means that the taxpayer is funding this compensation scheme twice. It means that the recipient will receive this particular part of the compensation twice. In some cases, this will mean that the recipient could receive more than they did before they received the compensation payment.This bill addresses many of the shortcomings regarding the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Scheme that the Labor Party failed to address when they had the chance. I would like to add that this compensation package was developed in close consultation with the ex-service community. It represents a significant step forward. It addresses the needs of our injured or ill service personnel. This bill is a testimony to this government's resolve to ensure that our injured and ill service personnel are provided with practical assistance, help and support whenever they need it and that, above all, they have a choice.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Eden-Monaro for his question and his ongoing interest in the provision of world-class aged care for older Australians. The honourable member will be particularly interested to hear that, in his electorate, older Australians requiring residential aged care places will be able to share in 70 new residential places and 20 community aged care packages which have been released to the Southern Highlands aged care planning region. This is on top of some 468 places allocated to this region since 1999, worth some $7.1 million in annual recurrent funding. The question is about allocations generally and a misinformation campaign. Let me say first that some 8,666 new places for Australians, worth some $186 million in recurrent funding, have been released for distribution around Australia. These places include a mix of residential aged care places, community aged care packages, extended aged care at home and places for national priorities, such as restructuring. Also, additional places have been made available for a range of initiatives, including multipurpose services and the aged care innovative pool. These new places mean that, over the last five years, the government has made available over 52,700 aged care places and is well on track to meeting its target of 200,000 places by June 2006.The results of the 2003 aged care approvals round are expected to be announced before the end of the year. In that context, I remind members that the overall Commonwealth funding has increased from $3 billion in 1996 to $6 billion this financial year. The member for Canberra lives here, so I am sure she will be pleased to learn that the ACT is well above the planning benchmark of 100 aged care places for every 1,000 people over the age of 70. - In fact, I understand that it is the member for Canberra's birthday today. In wishing her a happy birthday, I would remind her that, over the last four years, 349 new places have been allocated to the ACT, worth $8 million a year in recurrent funding. In addition, in this year's aged care approval rounds, a further 90 residential places and 14 community aged care packages will be made available for the care of elderly Canberrans.Despite this, Labor is continuing its scare campaign. I am dismayed to report that, this time, the member for Canberra, the member for Fraser and Senator Lundy have contrived two community meetings in Canberra to back up their scare campaign. It must be designed to undermine the aged care sector. I do trust that Labor will inform those who may attend these campaign meetings that the ACT Labor government has closed 14 acute care hospital beds at the same time as the Howard government has allocated 259 new aged care places in Canberra. - I hope they tell them also that the federal government has expanded the ACT transitional care program at Morling Lodge, which includes eight new places worth $405,000, and is providing $6.3 million to the ACT over five years under the Pathways Home program to help older people leaving hospital to return home. I call on the member of Canberra to take up with her state Labor colleagues the huge discrepancy between the federal government commitment to aged care and that of the ACT Labor government. The federal government is one that cares about older Australians.</DOC>

This amendment will allow the Australian Secret Intelligence Service, ASIS, to undertake its functions more effectively and - importantly, from the perspective of ASIS officers - more safely.Since the act came into force in 2001, the world has changed a lot. There have been the terrorist attacks in New York and Washington, the terrorist attack in Bali, and of course we are dealing with a still more severe threat of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Bearing all that in mind, not only has ASIS's work environment never been so important to Australia as it is today but the work of our intelligence agencies is critical to the government's efforts to counter terrorism and transnational crime. ASIS people, therefore, are working in an increas-ingly difficult and threatening environment.The amendment will not change the functions of ASIS. The functions of ASIS will remain as they currently are - that is, ASIS will not be able to take upon itself paramilitary work on its own behalf - but this amendment will allow ASIS's people to defend themselves better. On the rare occasions that it might be necessary, ASIS officers will be able to carry a weapon for self-defence purposes - but only for self-defence. ASIS cannot and will not, under this amendment, be able to initiate any activity involving weapons or violence.The amendment would also allow for close personal protection to be provided to ASIS officers by other organisations such as, most obviously, the Australian Defence Force, and also improve the ability of ASIS to work with other agencies overseas. Under the current legislation, ASIS could not assist in the planning for the capture of a terrorist where, for example, the capture of that terrorist involved the use of weapons; but with this amendment ASIS would be able to do that. These amendments are important amendments; they will make the Australian Secret Intelligence Service more effective than it already is. But I should take the opportunity to tell the House that I think that ASIS itself has done an absolutely outstanding job in recent years. We admire very much the work that it has done. I have no doubt that in the future it will continue to perform with great capacity and skill.</DOC>

 - Senator Alston, when he was the minister, complied fully with the requirements of disclosure. There are a couple of statements in the question that are wrong. He did not have an effective interest in Telstra; it was a contingent interest in a family trust. It is apparent from the statement that was issued today by Senator Alston that he went to great lengths to ensure that he complied in full with his obligations. The senator himself has indicated that he did not know of the ownership of the Telstra shares until yesterday. In those circumstances, it is a bit absurd of the member for Melbourne to suggest that I had known earlier. The answer is: I did not know in advance of Senator Alston. There has been no breach at all of the ministerial guidelines. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Canning for his question and for his interest in the state of the Australian economy and the effect that it has on people's prospects for work and income. Today's National Australia Bank monthly business survey shows that business conditions remain strong. Although slightly down on the August reading, they are at a very strong level of plus 16, which the National Australia Bank says is consistent with the non-farm economy growing at above four per cent. In addition to that, the business confidence index rose four points to plus 19.4, which is the strongest since April 2002.Interestingly enough, the survey shows that capacity utilisation has risen to historically high levels. That is a good thing because, if capacity utilisation is strong, that is likely to lead to further business investment - and that, of course, is going to be good for the economy as well. So that is a consistent story with a strong non-farm economy. We know that the farm economy is still struggling with the effects of drought. Although it looks as if there will be a decent grains crop overall in Australia, we know it will take a long time for breeding herds to be redeveloped and for livestock industries to recover. In addition to that, there are signs that the United States economy is recovering and that the global outlook is a little better than it was three months ago.One of the keys to the government's economic policy has been consistency. We have had a very clear idea of where we want to take Australia - a stronger economy, balanced budgets, a better tax system, improved labour markets and welfare reform - and we really want to set Australia up for great opportunities in 40 years time. What are the barriers to that? I regret to inform the member for Canning that the great barrier to economic reform in Australia is the Australian Labor Party. The most positive contribution that the Australian Labor Party could make would be to get out of the way and allow the government's reform program through the Senate.I appeal to the members of the Labor Party on this basis: they said they were opposed to the balancing of the budget and, when it had been done, said they were then in favour of it. They said they were against the new taxation system and, now that it has been done, they say they are in favour of it. The Australian Labor Party always comes to the right outcome last. Our appeal to the Australian Labor Party is to get out of the way and let the government get its program through the Senate. Let us get some better opportunities for young Australians. If the Labor Party had had its way, so many more Australians would still be out of work. What about a chance for those who want a job? Why not put the job opportunities of young Australians before the sectional interest of the Australian Labor Party and its trade union barons? Let us free up the government's legislative program and let the Australian economy grow in the way that we want to see it grow. </DOC>

 - The truth of this matter is that Senator Alston did not know of any suggestion until - I said `yesterday' in the earlier answer and that was wrong; it was last week - he was written to by the Australian Financial Review journalist Laura Tingle. He did not know until receiving her letter last week that he had knowledge of any suggestion that Messen - and Messen is the trustee of the Alston family trust - or Balmoral, which is the nursing home company, had any shares in Telstra. It is as simple as that, and there is absolutely nothing unusual about somebody not having any knowledge of the shares of a close family member. There is nothing unusual about that. The rules that are laid down do not mean that a minister's father, mother, wife or independent children cannot own shares in an area of portfolio responsibility. There is nothing that Senator Alston has done that has been in any way in breach of the guidelines, and nothing that has been alleged, even by the Australian Financial Review on this occasion, suggests otherwise.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I must say that his interest in these matters is understandable, with the port of Gladstone, which received a mention in this place yesterday, being in his electorate. It is a magnificent, deep port and is now responsible for some 12 per cent of the movement of Australia's exports by water. Indeed, as its port central area develops, containerisation will be increasingly important. The government has made a serious contribution to port road development there to take that development forward. The benefits of waterfront reform will flow on to Gladstone, denied them so long by the Labor Party.The Labor Party and the unions consistently opposed waterfront reform in Australia. They said that you could not improve beyond the 16 container movements an hour, on average, that we were managing in Australia when we came to government. I am delighted to be able to tell the House that the latest figures show that the national average crane rate for Australia is running at about 27½ containers per hour. Taking into account the relevance of our type of waterfront and the stevedoring operations that characterise the Australian waterfront, we are truly at the cutting edge of world's best performance. That is a momentous claim to be able to make but it is nonetheless true, confirmed to me anecdotally recently by European shippers whom I met with several years ago. They told me in gory detail the lengths to which they would go to avoid sending their ships into Australian harbours because they did not know how long they would be there, whether they would get them out or what it would cost them. The same group of shippers told me recently that dealing with Australian ports now is just a delight; they are straightforward and economical - it is altogether a transformation. I am sure those champions of the working men and women of Australia on the opposite side would be reluctant to admit it, but doing a job well is immensely satisfying. I reckon those workers on the Australian waterfront would be enjoying their jobs a lot more than they would have been when the ALP refused to concede that they could do any better. I made the comment that, when we came to government, average container movements were static at a bit over 16 movements an hour on average across the nation in our major ports. It is worth noting that the Patrick Port Botany terminal manager has advised that the terminal set itself a performance target of 33 container movements per hour - about double what Labor said could be managed. In the last quarter - the June quarter - they got to 32.4 containers per hour.So no wonder the member for Hinkler has such an interest in this. The port of Gladstone is certainly better off under our policy; it is certainly steaming ahead. When you stop and think that the Labor Party not only wants to stand in the way of things like waterfront reform but also has such niceties coming up, should they ever win power, as massively increasing the tax burden on the mining industry and signing up to Kyoto - a flawed approach as it currently stands - it is no wonder that increasingly the workers at the port of Gladstone look to the member for Hinkler to confirm their future.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Indi for her question, which is especially appropriate today because there are 40 young people in the gallery from rural Australia who are participating in the Australian government's young rural leaders course. Two of them are from the electorate of the honourable member for Indi. We welcome Ross Gehrig and Nicola Bussell, who are amongst the people who are participating in this course.The young rural leaders course is one of the elements of the government's Young People in Rural Industries program, which is part of the $800 million Advancing Australia agriculture initiative. Over this week these 40 young people will be covering a range of topics during their seminar, including how to develop policy in rural areas. They will be meeting many of the leaders in rural industry organisations. They will be talking about leadership styles, communications, media skills, meeting procedures and the like and will be endeavouring to develop the sorts of skills that are necessary to ensure that we have the quality of leadership in rural communities necessary to drive agriculture into the future. We have enormous capacity amongst the young people in regional Australia. This program demonstrates our confidence as a government in their capacity to lead rural industry into the future.This is only one of a series of programs under this initiative. There are also the corporate governance scholarships, which provide opportunities for young people to participate in the Institute of Company Directors' week-long residential course. There are study awards to enable young people in rural industries to take on a particular project of interest to them. The export market development course provides an opportunity for 30 young people to develop skills in exporting rural products. The international observers program gives young people an opportunity to participate in international conferences as part of Australian delegations. Around 250 young Australians have now participated in this program. With over one-third of the people involved in agriculture aged between 18 and 35, this is an especially well-targeted initiative. I extend my best wishes to those who are participating in this program, including those who have come from the electorate of the honourable member for Indi and from the many other rural electorates around Australia. I wish them well in this course and indicate to them how important the government regards this program and its investment in the young people of Australia.</DOC>

 - Let me make two points about this. Firstly, I was not at the briefing, but my staff have advised me that all material given to Senator Macdonald was material on the public record. Secondly, there is a police investigation into this absolute fascination the opposition has with what it calls the Andrew Bolt article. Let me make a point about this: I have had a look at the material that has been made public; in the last couple of weeks I had an opportunity to have a look at it. I do not think there is any intelligence material that has been made public that could remotely do any damage to Australia - not remotely. Secondly, I would have thought that the material that had been made public was entirely consistent with a press release that -   - On 13 March the member for Griffith put out a press release in which he quoted extensively from Mr Wilkie, saying that if there were to be a war against Iraq it would be a humanitarian disaster and that Saddam Hussein would pursue a scorched earth policy and could use weapons of mass destruction. Quoting extensively the views of Mr Wilkie -  - I will happily talk later about the member for Griffith's knowledge of Mr Wilkie's opinions, as passed on through an ONA report, because he used those opinions extensively on 13 March. How the member for Griffith got hold of Mr Wilkie's opinions, which had been expressed through an ONA document, I think we would be very interested to know.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Solomon for his question, and I recognise his very keen interest, coming from Darwin, in the relationship we have with all 10 South-East Asian countries. I recognise, particularly, those immediately to the north that we have very strong trading relationships with. Given that we have a delegation in the gallery from Indonesia, I recognise the very strong trading relationship that we have with Indonesia. As I was getting to my feet, I heard the interjection from the member for Rankin which only indicates how little he really knows.The relationship with the ASEAN countries is in very good shape at the moment, both on a bilateral basis, with the individual members of the ASEAN group, and collectively. It is a well-known fact that in September 2002 Australia signed a closer economic partnership agreement with the 10 ASEAN countries - something that no other country has been able to achieve thus far. Although there are negotiations between ASEAN and the North Asian countries, to date nothing has been concluded. At the end of 2002, Australia also signed a free trade agreement with Singapore, delivering substantial benefits to our services sector. We are at the moment involved in a negotiation with Thailand, with an ambition to conclude that negotiation by the end of this year, if not sooner. If that negotiation with Thailand is concluded this year, Australia will be the first country to have two free trade agreements with South-East Asian countries. We will be the first amongst the countries in North Asia, in this region and across the Pacific and the Americas to do that, which is very important to note. The strength of the relationship is indicated in the trade that is done with the South-East Asian countries. Twelve per cent of Australia's exports go to South-East Asia - some $13.8 billion worth of exports alone - let alone the two-way trade and investment. This was pointed out very clearly, I might add, in an interview that was conducted on the 7.30 Report with the Indonesian Minister for Industry and Trade, who is a very good friend of Australia. Minister Rini Soewandi was interviewed by Kerry O'Brien. There were the usual questions that you would expect to come from Kerry O'Brien on relationships with East Asia, but Minister Soewandi handled those questions extremely well. I will have the opportunity at the end of this week to convey that sentiment to her. Repeating a comment that often comes from the other side of politics and other parts, Kerry O'Brien made the usual claim that Australia seems to many in Asia to be `a transplant from another region'. But in her response the minister defended the relationship with Australia, saying:... we feel that Australia and New Zealand are also close to ASEAN. We do need to strengthen closer economic relations and Indonesia and Australia and New Zealand are trying to work out also a comprehensive closer economic partnership and see the possibilities of having closer and better trade relations.After a further question from Kerry O'Brien, when he persisted in saying that Australia was not economically engaged with ASEAN, Rini disagreed with him. She said:... Australia and New Zealand is a very important component of the South-East Asian atmosphere.That is from a minister who is very active and very high up in the Indonesian administration, and very influential in South-East Asia. I might add that she is a very close friend of Australia. I think her daughter is attending the University of Melbourne. Along with about 100,000 other students from South-East Asia who study in Australia, it indicates the strength of the relationship between Australia and the ASEAN countries.</DOC>

 - My office retains copies of ONA reports for a substantial period of time, which is the practice of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. - So I would assume that, as with other ministers' offices, as I understand it, there would have been copies of that report in my office in any case. Whether or not an additional copy was sought I would not have thought was terribly important, because there would have been copies in my office anyway. But I also make the point that this matter is the subject of a police investigation. The opposition wanted it investigated and seems to think that it is a most terribly important issue. I would have thought it was somewhere out on the fringe of the most trivial of issues, given that there is no intelligence leak, according to ONA, involved in this. There are procedures to be gone through. The police will go through those procedures and I think that they will do a good job. I had a look at the famous Andrew Bolt article - Andrew Bolt is sometimes a critic of mine and sometimes a supporter - and I compared the material in the article to a press release that the member for Griffith put out on 13 March. It seems to me perfectly clear from what was said on 13 March - the member for Griffith was attacking me for ignoring Mr Wilkie's advice - that the opposition spokesman on foreign affairs knew a good deal about what was in Mr Wilkie's report and referred back to his December report. There is one other point that I would make on this issue, which is a particularly important point - that is, I have noticed on occasions that the member for Griffith quotes the exact security classification of this report - the top secret AUSTEO code word - and he uses this from time to time. That is not in the Bolt article; Senator Macdonald did not use that expression. I think it is very interesting that the member for Griffith knew precisely what the classification of the document was, that the member for Griffith knew what was in the document on 13 March and put it in his press release, and that the member for Griffith is involved in the most manifest mock indignation over some comments that Senator Macdonald made, or whatever it may be, which have absolutely no implications whatsoever for our national interest - absolutely none.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Makin for her question, and I acknowledge her deep commitment to ensuring that Australians have the best possible access to affordable high-quality health care. The member for Makin and everyone else in the government believes that private health insurance is a very important part of Australia's health system. Private health insurance enables people to have choice and it takes the pressure off the public hospital system, particularly off public hospital waiting lists for elective surgery. Unfortunately, the opposition has always disliked private health insurance, and under the former government the percentage of Australians with private health insurance plummeted towards 30 per cent. But, thanks to the policies of the Howard-Anderson government and particularly the private health insurance rebate, the percentage of Australians with private health insurance has gone up to nearly 44 per cent - that is, almost nine million Australians have access to private health insurance and to the security and reassurance that private health insurance brings.I have been asked about possible changes. I regret to inform the House that the Labor Party's policy is to rip the guts out of the private health insurance system. In particular, the opposition is now considering a proposal to means test access to the private health insurance rebate. This is the opposition's latest attempt to penalise success and to play the politics of envy. The member for Werriwa knows how counterproductive the politics of envy can be - at least he does on his good days - but he has had no success in persuading his colleagues, who are still following the economic policies of Jim Cairns. They still think that Jim Cairns is the great guru of economics. For the benefit of members opposite, as they will demonstrate later on today -   -  - Do you want me to say he is not the great guru of economics? Not today, surely. - If members opposite do not like any reference to the importance of Jim Cairns's economic policy in the Labor Party, I withdraw. For the benefit of members opposite, let me point out to them that if the private health insurance rebate was restricted to families earning less than $50,000 a year, 4.3 million Australians would be excluded from access to the private health insurance rebate - the families of 4.3 million Australians would lose $750 each a year thanks to the policies that the Labor Party now has under consideration. Without the private health insurance rebate, these families would face a 42 per cent increase in private health insurance premiums. That means the private health insurance rates would collapse and the pressure on public hospitals, particularly on public hospital waiting lists for elective surgery, would increase. I call on members opposite to come clean about exactly where they stand on the private health insurance rebate so that millions of Australians know who they can trust with their health care.</DOC>

I suggest to the member for Werriwa that if he is deeply curious about this he should ring up Malcolm Turnbull and ask him. What I do want to say is that one of the great contemporary political tragedies is that the union movement is still in a symbiotic Siamese twin relationship with members opposite, because the fact is that the vast majority of the decent union members of this country know a good Prime Minister when they see one and they are now supporting the Howard government. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Aston for his question. According to a Melbourne newspaper today, the Victorian government has paid out First Home Owners Scheme grants to 38 infants and  toddlers below the age of 10. This is in clear violation of the Victorian government's undertakings, and the federal government will not tolerate the Victorian government abusing the First Home Owners Scheme. By an intergovernmental agreement between the Commonwealth and the states, the states and the territories have agreed to make legislative provision for the First Home Owners Scheme and provide that eligible applicants must be natural persons who are Australian citizens or permanent residents who are buying or building their first home in Australia, and an eligible home must be intended to be a principal place of residence and occupied within a reasonable period. It is an absolute nonsense to suggest that a toddler could be buying or building a first home in Australia. In fact, it is an absolute nonsense to suggest that a toddler could sign a contract for the purchase of a home - which apparently the Victorian government legislation has made provision for. In addition, it is an absolute nonsense to believe that toddlers could be moving into their principal place of residence while they are three or four or under 10 years of age. So the Victorian government have admitted 38 people under the age of 10 to the First Home Owners Scheme, and they have done so in complete violation of the intergovernmental agreement between the Commonwealth and the states. The Victorian Treasurer, Mr Brumby, according to AAP today, said that it appeared parents who were ineligible for the grant because they already own a home have been making applications in the name of their children. If the Victorian government has allowed people who already own a home to make applications in the name of their children and has paid them a First Home Owners Scheme grant as a consequence, that is an abuse of the system. Mr Brumby said today that he will be introducing legislation in the Victorian parliament to close the loophole which apparently exists in his own legislation. As far as the Commonwealth is concerned, that loophole should never have been opened by the Victorian government, and the Victorian government should never have paid First Home Owners Scheme grants to toddlers.If it is the case - and I believe it most probably is the case - that the Victorian government has claimed from the Commonwealth reimbursement of the grants that it has paid to 38 toddlers, the Commonwealth will not be reimbursing the Victorian government for those amounts. In addition to that, if it has already been claimed and paid, the Australian government will be claiming that money back from the Victorian government, because the Victorian government was never authorised to claim from the Commonwealth reimbursement for First Home Owners Scheme grants to toddlers.This afternoon I will be writing to the remaining states and territories alerting them to the fact that this has apparently occurred in Victoria and asking them to ensure that they have not claimed reimbursement for any such grants in their own states and, if they have, asking them to reimburse the Commonwealth accordingly. The Victorian government is apparently changing its legislation today to close this loophole which should never have existed. I point out to the parliament that not only does it have to be a natural person buying a home and intending to live in it as their principal place of residence, but the relevant states and territories have also covenanted to put provisions in their legislation to prevent abuse of the First Home Owners Scheme. As far as the Commonwealth is concerned, this is an abuse of the First Home Owners Scheme. There should have been provisions in the Victorian legislation to prevent it, and the Commonwealth will not be reimbursing Victoria for any grants if they have been claimed from the Commonwealth under this scheme.</DOC>

We understand the difficulties of the banana industry, along with many other rural industries. We know that the banana industry has benefited enormously from the much lower interest rates and the very stable economic conditions that rural Australia has had over the last 7½ years.The position in relation to Filipino imports is that an import risk assessment was issued. We are still gathering responses and comments on that. I can assure the honourable member and the many other members who are interested in this issue that no decision has been taken. We will assess very carefully what is put forward. I am not specifically aware of the comment made by the Australian Ambassador to the Philippines, who does a very fine job of behalf of this country. In the context of saying that, I can assure the honourable member for Kennedy that no decision has been taken by the government. We are cognisant of the challenges that the people of the Australian banana industry face. We are also cognisant of our obligations of reciprocity where it is reasonable in relation to our trading partners. We will look very carefully at the concerns of the industry. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Herbert for his question. He is a very strong supporter of James Cook University in Townsville and a very strong supporter of the internationalisation of education. Today, on behalf of the Australian government and Australian education providers, the foreign minister and I have released the first forward policy document in more than 12 years setting out the vision for education and Australia's strategic direction over the coming decade.At the moment, amongst the English-speaking countries Australia attracts the third largest number of international students. That education and training is now worth $5.2 billion to Australia. We have 380,000 international students who are currently being educated by Australia or in Australia. About 280,000 of them are actually in Australia at the moment. This is our third biggest services export industry. It is responsible for employing 43,000 Australians. In fact, in the budget this year the government announced a $113 million package to further promote and develop internationalisation of education. The government will be putting $40 million into additional counselling and promotion facilities, particularly in North America, Latin America, the Middle East and Europe, and $10 million towards strengthening auditing and quality programs in offshore facilities - obviously outside Australia. The government will also be establishing four international centres of excellence: Asia-Pacific studies and diplomacy at the Australian National University, water resources management, sports science and administration, and mathematics.On behalf of not only the government but also the opposition, it is fair to say that there are two things upon which this parliament would agree. The first is that students are very welcome from all countries - in fact 200 countries at the moment - to receive an education in Australia. The second point that I think both the government and the Australian Labor Party would make to the Australian people is that not one of these overseas students takes a single place from an Australian student. It is important for Australians to understand - and I think the Australian Labor Party would join the government in reminding Australians - that the 130,000 university students who come from overseas to go to university in Australia not only do not take a single place but create extra places for Australians from the revenue that comes from educating these students, and it improves the quality of education that our own children receive. The absurd position of the Australian Labor Party is that, having recognised that fee-paying foreign students create more opportunities for Australians and improve quality, it then says, `But Australian citizens are not allowed, after HECS places have been expanded, to take up the same opportunities that are currently available to 130,000 students from overseas.'For example, at James Cook University there are 1,400 foreign students. They are welcomed; they are an important part of our educational, political and cultural framework. But the Labor Party then says, `But if you are an Australian citizen living in Townsville the only way that you, under a Labor government, will be able to take up a fee-paying opportunity at James Cook University is if you sell your Australian citizenship overseas and come back as a foreigner.' It is very important that there be consistency in higher education policy in Australia, and the Labor Party should at least give Australians the same break in higher education as it gives our international community. </DOC>

 - I thank the very hardworking member for Macarthur - a great fighter for Western Sydney - for his question. The member for Macarthur, who was a small business man himself before entering this parliament, knows how important it is to try and reduce tax for small businesses to give them a fair go, because they now represent more than one-third of the Australian economy and theirs is one of the fastest areas of growth in employment in Australia. Small business is crippled by state taxes and charges. In New South Wales, particularly in Western Sydney, the Carr government are now collecting record levels of stamp duty, at $3.55 billion this year; they are collecting record levels of payroll tax - in fact this year they are expecting payroll tax revenue in New South Wales to increase by around six per cent, or $280 million - and of course the Carr government are collecting record levels of land tax. They are expecting an extra $217 million. So when I woke up this morning and saw the new headline `$133 million tax grab' in the Daily Telegraph, I said to myself, `Oh no, not again - Labor is at it; Labor is jacking up land tax for small business and jacking up land tax for people in Western Sydney.' The truth is this: every time land tax is increased it affects small business. Every small business that operates in a shop or that has a workplace ends up paying the land tax, whether it owns the building or it rents the building, because if it rents the building the landlord passes the land tax straight through to the small business. So when it comes to land tax in regional communities you can see that rising rents have a real impact on holiday accommodation and that rising rents have a real impact on the coffee shops and the souvenir stores right up and down the coast. The member representing Port Macquarie in this place, who is a minister, knows all too well what the impact of land tax is on small businesses in his electorate and all up and down the coast of New South Wales.You would have thought that the member for Werriwa would have said something about this. You would have thought that the member for Werriwa would have complained about higher levels of state taxation and the impact they are having on small business. The only comment from the member for Werriwa on the record is that he says it is `a legitimate goal of government to lift land prices'. He says it is legitimate for governments - state governments - to increase land prices, particularly for people in Western Sydney. Well, we oppose any increase in land prices that is going to be driven by taxation. We oppose any attempt to increase land tax, especially by state Labor governments. It is not just about the fighters for Western Sydney, like the member for Macarthur, but about the members of the Liberal and National parties, who are going to fight against increased taxes imposed by the Labor Party on small business.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kalgoorlie for his question and I can inform the House that the Westpac-Melbourne Institute index of consumer sentiment rose by 1.5 per cent in October to 117.8. This is the highest level of the index since July 1994. The index has risen by almost 21 per cent since March of this year and is 14.7 per cent above its level of one year ago. According to Westpac, today's result reflects recent positive developments such as the low unemployment rate, improvement in share market conditions and the strong business confidence outlook.As the Treasurer reminded the House on Monday, Australia is currently enjoying a concurrent combination of unemployment below six per cent and inflation below three per cent. That is the first time since 1968 that those two achievements have occurred concurrently. It is a remarkable tribute to the economic management of this country over the last 7½ years that the Treasurer should be able to report to the parliament that, for the first time since 1968, we have the golden economic double of inflation below three per cent and unemployment below six per cent. That is a golden economic double, and the Westpac consumer sentiment index drives home the message that this country is in good economic hands. Over the last 7½ years we have not only seen inflation and unemployment driven down. We see that the average home buyer pays $450 a month less on their mortgage than they did in 1996. We see real wages having risen by somewhere in the order of 10 per cent versus about 2½ per cent in 13 years under Labor. We see an enormous lift in the number of apprenticeships in the country. Wherever you go you find evidence of quality economic management, and the Westpac-Melbourne Institute consumer sentiment index is the latest piece of independent evidence of the good economic conditions that Australia is now enjoying.</DOC>

 - It is obviously easy for opposition members to stand up and make rather populist comments about government advertising, but I would simply make the point that all governments have advertised and all governments will advertise, and there is nothing wrong with this government continuing to advertise to give people the information they need. - On the question of dental care, this has traditionally been a matter for the state governments and I would certainly encourage the state governments to do all that they possibly can to ensure that Australians have access to appropriate dental treatment. One thing that the federal government is doing to try to ensure that people do get help with dental care is putting in place the private health insurance rebate. A very large number of people who need dental treatment get rebates for that dental treatment through the private health insurance rebate, and there are more than a million Australians earning less than $20,000 a year who have private health insurance. The very worst thing that people could do in terms of damaging access to dental care would be to rip the guts out of the private health insurance system, which is what the opposition wants to do.</DOC>

 - Firstly, I thank the honourable member for Mitchell for his question. The House should be aware that Australia is one of just 11 countries which have been participating in the Proliferation Security Initiative. We took part in the latest meeting, in London, between 9 and 10 October. That was the fourth meeting of the PSI, as we call it, which has taken place since May. All the participants at that meeting - including the United States, Japan and many members of the European Union such as Britain, France, Germany and others - agreed that the global threat of weapons of mass destruction demanded a truly effective global response.The Proliferation Security Initiative will now be opened up to countries and international bodies that want and have the capacity to contribute expertise and capabilities to help the PSI achieve its aim. This broadening of participation in the PSI is essential and it will obviously strengthen the capacity of the PSI to deal with the trafficking of weapons of mass destruction around the world. Progress has also been made on a model boarding agreement with flag states to facilitate practical measures to interdict traffickers of weapons of mass destruction materials at sea.Interestingly enough, the participants at the London meeting agreed on further exercises. Honourable members will remember that the first exercise under the Proliferation Security Initiative, which was called Pacific Protector, took place in the Coral Sea in mid-September under Australian leadership. Another exercise was held just before the London meeting. There are now eight more exercises planned for between now and the middle of next year. It is my expectation that Australia will participate in one way or another in all of those exercises. In some of those cases we may have a very minor role but, nevertheless, it is appropriate for us to participate and be involved in Proliferation Security Initiative exercises. In the next few months, for example, there will be Spanish and French led maritime interdiction exercises and also an Italian air exercise.I can only say that I am very pleased that support for the Proliferation Security Initiative is strong and growing. Over 50 countries have now expressed their support for the aims of the initiative, and such strong support does reflect something that has changed in the international community in recent times, which is the determination of the international community to address the issue of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. There used to be a rhetorical commitment, but what we are really seeing now is a very practical commitment to try to stop the trade in these dreadful weapons systems.I was asked whether there are any alternative views. I do not actually have much to say about that. I know the opposition has been uneasy about the Proliferation Security Initiative; it has failed to give it active support. That is surprising, because during the life of the Hawke and Keating governments the Australian government was very committed to trying to stop the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction - there was the chemical weapons convention, the biological weapons convention and so on. But now we have an opposition which apparently is not very happy with the idea of trying to stop the trafficking in weapons of mass destruction through the Proliferation Security Initiative, which leads one, sadly, to conclude that the opposition is rather weak on security issues.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Rankin for his question. I say to him and to the House that the best thing that we can do for Australians in terms of poverty and doing the best that we can for their lives is actually getting them a job. If we want to compare records on that in both creating jobs in Australia -  - As I was saying, the thing that this government has been doing is providing jobs for ordinary Australians. That is what this government has been about. If the opposition wants to compare the record of the Howard government in terms of creating jobs in this country with what the Labor Party did when it was in government, then it is an appalling record on your part. That is the case. If you look at jobs growth, 1.2 million extra jobs have been created since the coalition came to government. If you look at the last six years under the Labor Party, 710,000 jobs were created. If you want to drill down into the exact figures and look at the growth in full-time jobs in Australia, then you can see that some 596,000 full-time jobs were created in Australia between March 1996 and September 2003. Compare that period with the previous six-year period, when just 191,000 jobs were created. On any comparison between what the Labor Party did in government and what the coalition is doing in government, the record of the coalition stands out.If one looks at earnings over a period of time, the Labor record from 1983 to 1996 shows a 3.1 per cent real wage reduction compared with the coalition record, from 1996 to 2002, of a 4.9 per cent real increase. We are talking about a reduction in real wages for workers under the Labor Party in government compared with an increase under the coalition since it came to government in 1996. I welcome the question from the member for Rankin. Ask me some more!</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Aston for his question. I note his very real interest in this and his commitment to those who would benefit from the delivery of the Scoresby Freeway, but I regret that there is no similar commitment from anyone in the ALP. I have to say that I am aware that the Premier of Victoria has written to 200,000 homes in Melbourne's south-west and has spent, I understand, at least $100,000 in the process.  -  - There is no doubt about it: those opposite would rather we did not explore this issue. They would love to have it covered up and spoken over. At least $100,000 was spent on the mail-out, and I will table a copy of the letter; it is not identifiable in terms of who it went to. It is an attempt to justify the backflip on Scoresby. I am glad to note that Mr Beattie -  - Ha, ha! - Aah! Mr Bracks - I'm sorry - has finally given up on his attempt to rename the Scoresby after a couple of marginal seats. He has given it a proper name at last. What an extraordinary example of creative writing this is by Mr Bracks.  - The state election was just a few months ago; it is very obvious that the backlash for breaking an election promise really is biting. Then again -  - The Leader of the Opposition just does not want to talk about Scoresby. - Neither does the member for Batman. He does not want to talk about Scoresby either. Maybe the Leader of the Opposition's name ought to be all over this document. If he only knew what his position was, I am sure he would agree to put his name on the document. - It is the Bracks position. What is the Bracks position? Let us come to the Bracks position. Eleven months ago, the Victorian Labor Party promised the electors a toll-free Scoresby Freeway under the memorandum of understanding that they signed with us. That is what they promised. Just to remind those opposite - and I quote from the memorandum: `Victoria undertakes to ensure that users of the Scoresby Freeway will not be required to pay a direct toll.' So what have Labor done? They have imposed a toll on the road - the road they said would be a freeway they now say will be a tollway. The fact remains that the government is committed to a freeway. We are committed to building this road with no tolls.Mr Bracks claimed in his letter that the Scoresby Freeway could not be completed until 2020. That is what he said: `We could not complete it until 2020.' I have to say that that is news. If that was the case, why did they not tell the people of Victoria during the last election - just 11 months ago? Why did they not tell the people of Victoria that they would not be able to complete it until 2020 without a toll? Mr Bracks also says in his letter that we on this side of politics have not explained how or if we will fund the Scoresby Freeway. That is what he has told Victorians. The fact is that we are committed to our funding of $445 million under the MOU. That money is sitting there, waiting to be given to Victoria the minute they agree to a memorandum of understanding that they signed just 11 months ago.Even after the Labor government had let the budget for this project blow out, we remained committed. We are still committed. But at no stage, I note, did they talk to us about additional funding, yet now they cry poor over federal road funding for Victoria.  - `Mmm' says the Leader of the Opposition. That letter claims that they get just 15 per cent of federal government funding. I had a look at this. Do you know what percentage of federal road funding was allocated to Victoria last year? It is three per cent of Australia's land mass. Mr Bracks claims we commit 15 per cent. Do you know what it was last year? It was 24 per cent. Then you come to RONIs - Roads of National Importance. What are RONIs? They are roads that we help state governments to build so that we can accelerate them for the benefit of the Australian public. We have committed around $2 billion since 1996. Do you know what Victoria's share of the RONIs program has been? It is 38 per cent.  -  - I hear somebody say `take it away'. We do not want to take it away; we want to spend it. We actually want to build the Scoresby Freeway. Here is another amazing figure. Do you know what percentage of the forward allocations the forward works program for Victoria is over the next four years? It is 37 per cent. Yet Premier Bracks still claims that we hate Victoria so much that we will not look after them.Here is a challenge for the Leader of the Opposition - three questions. Firstly, does he support tolls being put on the Scoresby?  -  - He does. Secondly, does he think it all right to break a commitment which was signed off in an MOU? Thirdly, whose side is he on - the people of Victoria's or the Premier of Victoria's?</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Throsby for her question. In relation to youth unemployment, whilst any level is far too high - and I think we could all agree about that - the rate of youth unemployment in Australia has nonetheless fallen substantially. If one looks at the number of teenagers who are unemployed and looking for full-time work, the latest figures indicate that there are some 66,000 at the present time. That compares with the teenage full-time unemployment rate between 1989 and 1996 of more than double that - 133,300. The reality is that everybody would like to see the lowest level of unemployment, whether it is for young people or for older workers. But I have to say to the honourable member that in general terms any fair reading of the data in relation to this indicates that the measures that this government has been taking have led to a substantial reduction in relation to youth unemployment. - I am responding to the interjection by the Leader of the Opposition. Most of the young people in Australia are in education. There are some in work and unfortunately, as the member points out, there is still a number who are unemployed, but those figures have come down under the measures put in place by this government. Indeed, when one looks at places like Wollongong, one sees that there was a much higher level. I am looking at a cutting taken from the Sunday Herald Sun on 3 May 1992 where it says that youth unemployment in industrial centres like Wollongong was 55 per cent. I understand the honourable member for Throsby's concern about reducing the level of youth unemployment but, by the same token, 33 or 34 per cent, which is far too high, is a far cry from the 55 per cent it was under the Labor Party. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Moore for his question, and I appreciate his interest. There has not been much discussion about the Solomon Islands in the parliament for a little while, and I am glad he has asked for an update. I am pleased to be able to report that the regional assistance mission - RAMSI as we call it - has made significant headway in removing the key threats to the Solomon Islands government's capacity to govern. Harold Keke's terrorisation of the Weathercoast has been stopped altogether. Keke remains in RAMSI custody, and he is expected to go on trial early next year. Fifteen of Harold Keke's associates have now been arrested for serious crimes, including murder. The harassment and intimidation of government officials in Honiara has mercifully ceased. Progress has been made also in arresting Malaitan ex-militant criminals and investigations into serious crimes over recent years are continuing. The RAMSI mission, in addition to the main police base, has established 15 police posts in eight of the nine provinces of Solomon Islands. The police have now collected over 3,700 weapons - 637 of those weapons are ex-police weapons.Stabilisation of the economy is well underway. Seventeen Australian advisors and in-line personal are in place to ensure the implementation of sound financial management. We are also going to provide $12 million worth of budgetary support up until June 2004 so that the government of Solomon Islands can function and basic services can be provided. We are putting into place systems to underpin economic reform and to target corrupt practices.There is a continuing very high level of public and political support for the Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands. The Solomon Islands opposition continues to voice support for the regional assistance mission and civil society and church leaders who were very welcoming when the mission was first deployed continue to be extremely supportive. I am delighted also to report that the six countries, in addition to Australia and New Zealand, that have provided personnel to RAMSI are contributing successfully to police and in some cases to the military. Vanuatu is due to send some personnel within the next few days.It is also pleasing to see that international financial institutions are re-engaging with the Solomon Islands following our repayment of the Solomon Islands arrears owed to the Asian Development Bank and the World Bank. Indications also are that major donors - such as the European Union and Japan - are becoming more confident in the situation in Solomon Islands. There is going to be a meeting - I think in late November - and our expectation is that there will be some fairly solid commitments made at that meeting to the Solomon Islands. This initiative to deploy into the Solomon Islands has so far been enormously successful. The security situation in particular is massively better. Obviously, we will have to consider now the gradual draw down of some military elements, consistent with the police-led nature of the regional assistance mission.</DOC>

 - I have not checked the unemployment figure for the honourable member's electorate but I have always found him to be a fairly straightforward bloke and I do not think he would have deliberately misrepresented it in the question. It is true that even in circumstances of sharply lower unemployment in this country there will be some areas where the rate is higher than in other parts of the country. That goes without saying. What a government has to do is to enact economic policies that are successful.If the honourable member is interested in an intelligent debate about this issue he has to accept as a given that unemployment in Australia now is dramatically lower than what it was in March 1996. We have created 1.2 million more jobs. The rate, for the first time in 13½ years, has for two successive months remained below six per cent. We do have that golden double. - I notice that the Leader of the Opposition has kept interjecting, repeating the expression `golden'. It must have struck a chord. Every interjection from the Leader of the Opposition has now got `golden' in it. I will have to try this a bit more often and I will give him a few more lines.We are a government of more jobs, lower unemployment, lower interest rates and lower inflation. The honourable member for Chifley asked me what specifically the government is doing in relation to the unemployment rate in his electorate. My understanding of his electorate, which is quite reasonable, tells me that there are a lot of small businesses in Chifley. One of the things we are doing for Chifley is trying to get the ridiculously cumbersome unfair dismissal laws off the back of small business. So let me turn the question around: ask not what the government can do for Chifley; ask what Labor can do for Chifley. Labor can do a lot for Chifley by getting out of the way and letting our unfair dismissal changes through the Senate.</DOC>

 - I can inform the member for Dickson that Labor's secret plan to rip the guts out of the private health insurance system would be very bad news indeed for millions of Australian families. Labor's plan to impose a means test on the private health insurance rebate, to take the private health insurance rebate away from families earning over $50,000 a year, will penalise 4.3 million Australians. The families of 4.3 million Australians will be slugged an extra $750 a year if Labor's plans ever come to fruition. Without the private health insurance rebate, these families will face a 42 per cent increase in their private health insurance premiums. That will mean plummeting rates of private health insurance and more pressure on public hospital waiting lists, and that will hurt the most vulnerable people in our society. The 8.6 million Australians who do have private health insurance deserve to know where their local members stand on the issue of the private health insurance rebate. I can inform people living in the electorate of Werriwa that their local member thinks that the private health insurance rebate is bad economics, a first-rate absurdity and the maddest piece of public policy you will ever see in this place. In the electorate of Werriwa, 40 per cent of the electorate, or 34,000 voters, have private health insurance. If we look at the electorate of Fremantle, held by the future president of the Australian Labor Party, we find that the member for Fremantle says that the private health insurance rebate is `poorly conceived, recycled and partisan'.In Fremantle, 61 per cent of the electorate, or 50,000 voters, have private health insurance. The member for Canberra said that the private health insurance rebate was `throwing good money after bad'. In Canberra, 54 per cent of the electorate, or 59,000 voters, have private health insurance. The member for Sydney described the rebate as `shocking - hardly money well spent'. Well, 63 per cent of her electorate, or 55,000 voters, have private health insurance. Then there is the member for Jagajaga. She said the private health insurance rebate was `an incredible amount of taxpayers' money pouring into the same black hole'. Fifty-eight per cent of her electorate - 51,000 voters - have private health insurance.By contrast with members opposite, I can say to the member for Dickson that the 50 per cent of voters in his electorate can be confident that he supports their continued access to private health insurance. I call on members opposite to hear what their own voters are saying; drop their ideological opposition to private health insurance; accept that millions of Australians want and need private health insurance; and stop trying to rip the guts out of a system which is doing great things for Australians' health.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Jagajaga for her question. It very helpfully enables us to focus on the facts in relation to school education and funding. The first point that should be made is that state and territory governments are responsible for administering, regulating and primarily funding their state schools. As Australia's minister for education, I am not allowed to visit a public state school without the written permission of the New South Wales minister for education. - For the benefit of the parliament, there are 2.2 million children in Australian state government schools. Those 2.2 million students attract $20 billion in public funding. The 1.1 million students in Catholic and independent schools throughout Australia do not attract $10 billion - half the amount that the state school students are getting - $9 billion, $8 billion or $7 billion; they attract $6.2 billion in public funding. In other words, if those students were to leave the non-government, Catholic and independent schools throughout Australia and suddenly line up at state schools, for which their parents have already paid, there would have to be in excess of another $3.8 billion in public funding invested in the education of Australian school children.The New South Wales government is responsible for the funding and administration of government state schools - when the member for Jagajaga stops laughing and giggling, I ask her to listen to a couple of facts - and the federal government is responsible for around 12 per cent of the money which goes into these schools. So about $2.5 billion of that $20 billion comes from the Australian government. This year this government has increased its funding to New South Wales government state schools by 5½ per cent, at a time when the inflation rate in this country, thanks to the government's leadership of Australia economically, is running at just under three per cent. We have given a 5½ per cent increase in funding to New South Wales government state schools. What did the New South Wales government do this year with its schools in its budget? What increase in funding did the New South Wales government deliver to these schools, which often service very low-income communities? Was it 5½ per cent? Government members - No. - Was it five per cent?Government members - No. - Was it four per cent?Government members - No. - Was it three per cent? - It was not even one per cent. It was 0.8 per cent. If the New South Wales government - and I suggest the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Jagajaga go and have a meaningful chat to the New South Wales Premier - was of a mind, it could have taken some of the $9.2 billion in GST it will get this year and given a fairer deal to the parents and children in New South Wales relying on state government schools. If the New South Wales government had increased its funding by 5½ per cent, there would be $292 million more this year alone to support the education of children in New South Wales state government schools. In relation to the parents of students at Trinity Grammar, King Abdulaziz or any of the Catholic or independent schools in New South Wales, every single one of those parents paid their taxes and paid for a place at a government state school. A two-parent family works in four jobs, lives in a two-bedroom house and drives a 15-year-old car in order to send their kids to a non-government school. The Labor Party says that they should not do that, but on this side we believe that they should. We believe that they should be free to have a choice and that they should be supported.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Riverina for her question. I think it is generally recognised these days that the Howard government is providing the national leadership which is putting in place the largest environmental rescue plans in Australian history - in particular the $2.7 billion Natural Heritage Trust, the $1.4 billion National Action Plan for Salinity and Water Quality, and the $500 million national water initiative. Today the minister for agriculture and I are announcing that $266 million from the National Action Plan for Salinity and Water Quality and $76 million from the Natural Heritage Trust are being provided to support major environmental and natural resource management reforms in New South Wales. Of this money, 50 per cent is being provided by the Commonwealth and 50 per cent by the state of New South Wales.Let us call a spade a spade. For some time the New South Wales government has failed to put in place an adequate regional process for dealing with environmental repair and natural resource management in that state. The Howard government has been very concerned about the failure of the New South Wales government in this regard. In particular, in New South Wales there has been a very heavy domination of the regional process by the state bureaucracies in Sydney. Before the last New South Wales state election the Wentworth Group drew the attention of the state government to this problem. I drew the attention of the House to the fact that there was a need for much more autonomy in the regions of New South Wales when dealing with environmental and natural resource management before that election as well. The Howard government believes that communities, regions and land-holders need to be fully involved in these issues of environmental repair. Today the Carr government announced that it is reforming its regional natural resource management arrangements to give much greater autonomy to regions in managing the process of environmental repair. Without endorsing every detail of this, I believe that, in general, the concept is a great victory for commonsense. It is certainly a great victory for the regional communities of New South Wales. These reforms, however, must not become an excuse for delaying the implementation of the natural resource management plans that have already been developed by these communities after a great deal of hard work.Along with this announcement, I understand the state government has also set in place today new vegetation management targets, including an end in New South Wales to broadscale clearing of remnant native vegetation. Apart from the salinity, water quality and biodiversity benefits of proper vegetation management, the end to broadscale clearing of remnant vegetation in New South Wales will deliver a greenhouse gas abatement benefit of approximately seven million tonnes per annum. The Commonwealth is contributing some $45 million to ensuring that this process of vegetation management reform is fairly and properly managed and that land-holders are properly involved. I am very pleased to see today that the President of the New South Wales Farmers Association, Mr Mal Peters, has described the package as a great step forward for the farmers of New South Wales.I have also been asked to comment on whether there are any alternative policies. In simple terms, there are no alternative policies. There has not been a question from the environment shadow minister to me for the last 10 months, while this government has been pushing ahead with environmental management in this country on an unprecedented scale.</DOC>

 - In answer to the member for Corio, I am aware that there are a significant number of homeless people in this country. Every person that is homeless ought to be a matter of concern to both sides of politics. It ought to be a matter of concern to all governments. One of the ways, of course, in which you reduce homelessness is to expand people's economic opportunities, and we have already had many occasions in this question time to remind the Australian public that over the past 7½ years the opportunity for people to earn an income, the opportunity for people to get a job and the opportunity for people to be more economically self-sufficient has grown. It has not been reduced. One of the remarkable things which was driven home about the poverty debate -   - which the opposition is obviously focusing on -  - I am glad the opposition is focusing on it, because on every count over the last 7½ years this government can point to a better record in tackling poverty than can the former government. Look at real incomes; they have risen. Look at unemployment; it has fallen. Look at the number of jobs; that has risen by 1.2 million. As the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations pointed out earlier in question time, in relation to low-paid workers in this country -  - If we are talking about poverty, surely it is relevant to remind the parliament and the Australian people of the record of this government compared with the record of the last government in helping the lowest paid workers in our nation. If you look at the figures for low-paid workers - that is, those who are at the 10th percentile according to full-time total weekly earnings of adult employees - you find, as the minister pointed out earlier in question time, that between 1983 and 1996 there was a 3.1 per cent reduction. There was a 3.1 per cent cut and, worse still, the then prime ministers, both Prime Minister Hawke and Prime Minister Keating, and the then treasurers boasted about the fact that they cut real wages. I remember coming into the parliament day after day, and the then Prime Minister would get up and boast about it. - I will go further and point out to the House that the provision of public housing in this country does, after all, happen to be a responsibility of the states. There has to come a time in public debate in this country where the states no longer have it both ways. They cannot assert their constitutional power without discharging their political and social responsibilities. Fundamentally, that is what state government after state government wants to do in this country. Whenever they want to throw their weight around, they are the important states, guaranteed a position under the Constitution. But, when it comes to accepting a bit of political responsibility, be it for health, education, housing, roads or any form of transport or infrastructure, the state governments' constant refrain is, `The federal government should give us more money.'That is another thing that this government have done over the last 7½ years - we have introduced a new taxation system that will guarantee steadily rising taxation shares to all of the Australian states over the years ahead. What we have done with the GST is taken away the alibi of the states in relation to housing, taken away their alibi in relation to education and taken away their alibi in relation to health. I say to the state premiers of Australia: you have responsibilities under our federal sharing arrangements; you discharge them. Face your electors, stop blaming the federal government and live up to your political and social responsibilities. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Farrer, because she rightly says that this is a very important issue for her electorate. She, like other people living in that significant part of Australia's productive areas, will be interested to hear that at noon today the Murray-Darling Basin Commission released the interim scientific reference panel report on the environmental impacts of returning various levels of water to the River Murray. It is an important document in helping to inform the community as the debate about the Living Murray initiative reaches an advanced stage.The report identifies the sorts of achievements that can occur with different levels of water flow and, naturally, points out that more can be achieved with the greater volumes of water that are provided for environmental purposes. But most particularly it makes the point that good management of the water that goes to the environment is just as important - probably more important - as the volume of water that is actually supplied. By skilfully using environmental waters, a relatively small amount can achieve quite significant outcomes for the system.  - This particular finding tears at the heart of the Labor Party's policy in relation to the Living Murray issue -  - which was again espoused a couple of days ago by the opposition spokesman. - The Labor Party policy is essentially to take 1,500 gigalitres off irrigators in country towns and just flush it down the river - who knows where, who knows when and who knows why? - with no outcomes and no plan involved at all. This scientific report makes it clear that that is not the way in which to effectively achieve good environmental outcomes in the Murray-Darling system.What is clearly coming through in relation to the first step initiative under the Living Murray program is that, if we identify some key icon sites, very substantial achievements can be made to improve environmental health by allocating water in a carefully planned way. By using these icon sites to improve the health of the river, we can achieve worthwhile outcomes without having to destroy rural economies or tear at the heart of the availability of water for irrigators and others who are so dependent upon that system.The scientific report, along with the social and economic work that is being done and the consultation with the community, is important in achieving a balanced outcome and a good result in relation to the Living Murray initiative. This government is committed to improving to the health of the Murray-Darling system, but we are also committed to the economic viability of the region concerned. We believe it is possible to achieve both of those objectives. We do not have to work on the basis that one objective can only be achieved at the expense of the other. By working with communities, we believe we can deliver good environmental outcomes and maintain strong levels of profitability in rural and regional Australia. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for the question. This government views the health of all Australians as a matter of great concern. For original Australians, people who have been here for tens of thousands of years, the series of false starts and attempts to try and address the matter over many years have of course delivered a set of great challenges. The government has been working very strongly. Since coming to power, this government has very much looked at seeing the health question subset dealing with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders as an approach. Rather than trying to simply decommission Indigenous Australians, if you like, from health specialists, we have been trying to work closely with them. The government is absolutely determined to work closely with local communities and community representatives to deal with a range of issues that are relevant to each of them.  - As far as the life expectancy of Indigenous Australians is concerned, it is a matter that is on the record. It is understood, and it is our responsibility -  - to continue working with those who are directly affected as well as ensuring that those who have the expertise to assist them are in direct contact with them.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hume for his question and acknowledge how hard he fights for small businesses in Bowral, Goulburn and various other important centres in his electorate. The coalition government believes that small business should pay less tax. That is why under this government we have reduced company tax from 36 per cent to 30 per cent; that is why we have substantially reduced income tax so that around 75 to 80 per cent of Australians are paying no more than 30c in the dollar; and that is why through our tax reform initiatives we have abolished wholesale sales tax and provisional tax and have created an environment for the abolition of a number of state stamp duties.Out of all this, together with - and I should not forget this - our major initiative on capital gains tax, where we have halved the rate of capital gains tax and created rollover relief for small business on capital gains tax, we have backed up our words about reducing the tax burden on small business with real action. So it is alarming for all of the members of the Liberal and National parties, and for more than one million small businesses around Australia, that the state Labor governments continue to increase the tax burden on small business. In New South Wales alone this year, Bob Carr and his Labor mates are collecting more payroll tax than ever before; they are collecting more stamp duty than ever before; and they are now collecting $133 million more in land tax than they did last year. I want to know what the members of the Labor Party based in New South Wales are saying. I want to know what the member for Hunter is saying to those small businesses in Cessnock, because the member for Hunter does not stand up for small business when it comes to taxation. He wants to see increased tax on small business. What are the member for Chifley and the member for Greenway saying to the small business people in Blacktown? A little earlier the member for Chifley asked why unemployment is higher in his electorate. I say this: one of the reasons is that small businesses in his electorate are paying higher state taxes than those in any other jurisdiction in Australia. They are paying land tax on their rents. At the end of the day, those small businesses in Western Sydney have a higher penalty on further employment than do businesses based in Brisbane, Melbourne or other places. I want to know what the member for Banks is saying to some of the small business people in parts of his electorate, such as Roselands and Revesby. What is he saying to them about the state Labor taxes? We know what the member for Werriwa says. I found a little beauty. - Another one. I thought for a brief moment that the member for Werriwa might be agreeing with us about tax. During the second reading debate on the Trade Practices Amendment (Small Business Protection) Bill 2002, the member for Werriwa said -  -  - Got me worried! The member for Werriwa said:What major issue is identified as the most important hindrance or constraint to small and medium sized business growth? It is taxes and government charges.This is the member for Werriwa. He said:It is taxes and government charges. That is the big issue that is concerning the small business sector.On the same day that the member for Werriwa raises the issue of homelessness, I remind the member for Werriwa of his words about taxes in Western Sydney, when he said:It is a legitimate goal of government to lift land prices in Western Sydney.That is terrible for homeless people, but it is also bad for small businesses - the small businesses that have to pay more land tax today, more stamp duty today and higher rents today and that now find it more difficult to employ people in Western Sydney. If the Labor Party is really serious about creating jobs and providing opportunities for people, particularly in New South Wales, then they should get on the phone to Bob Carr and ask him to start reducing taxes instead of increasing them.</DOC>

 - The member for Lilley's question is posited on the proposition that there is something new or particularly penal or especially associated with the present government in the notion that, if a taxpayer owes the government something by way of refund, it should not be recouped if there is a credit in that taxpayer's taxation return. I remind the member for Lilley that the government that he sat in and supported in this House between 1993 and 1996 employed the very tactic that he now condemns, and there is absolutely nothing remarkable, unfair or especially penal about a situation where, if you owe the government something and the government owes you something, you appropriately set the two off against each other. There is nothing unfair about that. You can dress it up with emotive and colourful language such as `stripping taxation returns', but the reality is that if a taxpayer is entitled to a taxation refund of $1,000 and the taxpayer owes the government $500 because of an overpayment of a family benefit - and bear in mind that the family benefit legislation is cast as part of the taxation system - it is not, in my view, unreasonable to set the $500 off against the $1,000. That was the approach that was adopted by Labor when it was in government. We did not oppose it then, to my recollection, and I think the Labor Party is being utterly and completely hypocritical and opportunistic in doing so now.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Macquarie for his deep and abiding interest in science and innovation. Members of the House - at least on our side - will be aware of the revolution that has occurred in science and innovation over the past few years under the HowardAnderson government, particularly brought about by Backing Australia's Ability in 2001, where we saw a new allocation of $3 billion being injected over five years into the innovation system, so that this year the Commonwealth is spending a record $5.4 billion. And it just keeps getting better. A short while ago the Minister for Education, Science and Training launched the latest Australian Research Council grants, where we doubled ARC funding. Under Backing Australia's Ability, he announced an allocation of some $250 million over the next three years for 965 new research projects, and they will be spread over universities and research institutes. They involve more than a thousand partnerships with international bodies and with industry and the like.This is also, as many members would know - and I thank the 150 members and senators who participated in Science Meets Parliament - a particularly important time for science when we are seeing scientists, engineers and technologists meeting with members of parliament. To kick off Science Meets Parliament, we had a debate yesterday at the National Press Club. I was up against the mysterious shadow minister for science. I have asked a couple of times in this House, `Who is the shadow minister for science?' I have given a couple of clues. The shadow minister for science has a love of the command economy of Albania -  - I have also said by way of a clue that the shadow minister for science shares a surname with the most likely replacement for the Leader of the Opposition. But people still do not know who it is. - I outlined a great many initiatives yesterday in the National Press Club in the debate which was part of the Science Meets Parliament exercise. The shadow minister is a senator; I finally admit that the shadow minister is a senator. But who is that senator's representative in this place? That makes it even harder because, since my becoming science minister after the last election, the opposition have asked 1,100 questions in this parliament - and how many have been asked by the shadow minister for science's representative in this place? Would it be 20, 10, five, three, two or one? No, it is zero. Of 1,100 questions, the Labor Party has not directed one. - I am drawing to a conclusion, Mr Speaker. I must admit that on alternative policies there is a glimmer of hope because the shadow minister for science said there would be a science and innovation policy `soon'; that he - I have given away the gender - has worked with the Leader of the Opposition personally to draft a science and innovation policy. He promised new money and it is just over the horizon. I look forward, finally, after two years, to possibly - although it is unlikely - seeing an alternative policy coming from the opposition.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question and for her recognition of the impact of dementia on the community. The Howard government recognise the needs of people with this debilitating condition and are committed to funding and delivering a range of programs which support them and their carers. Importantly, we are ensuring that residential aged care homes are able to provide dementia care to those who need these services most. In this year's aged care approvals round, priority will be given to applications from providers who provide specific care programs for people with dementia.Other important initiatives and funding being undertaken by the Howard government for people with dementia include about $2 billion for residential aged care for people affected by dementia, and that is out of a total budget of $4.5 billion; over $146 million annually for home and community care services for people affected by dementia, and that is out of the total Australian government contribution of $732 million; and around $86 million for community aged care packages for people affected by dementia, and that is out of the total allocation of nearly $308 million. Further, there is around $36 million for a range of targeted dementia services and around $5 million for research specifically related to dementia and Alzheimer's disease.The Howard government is also providing the peak body, Alzheimer's Australia, with funding of around $10.6 million annually for information resources, including telephone advisory services, counselling, support groups and targeted education for carers of people with dementia. I know that both sides of the House recognise the social and economic impact of this condition not only on the individuals but also on their families and their carers. The Parliamentary Friends of Dementia group is testament to this, and I do pay tribute to Senator Marise Payne and the member for Newcastle for their initiative in establishing this group.The member for Pearce also asked about the carers of people with dementia. I know it can be a heartbreaking experience for carers, so we have expanded the National Respite for Carers Program from $19 million in 1996-97 to about $98 million in 2003-04. This funding supports carers and those whom they care for through access to information, respite care and other resources. In particular, I am pleased to inform the honourable member for Pearce that 35 new aged care places have been allocated to Western Australia for people with dementia. Southern Cross Care will run a project known as the Dementia in Alternative Settings Pilot, and this is going to provide a range of services, such as personal care, medication management and the like. This particular project will receive federal government funding of up to $2.4 million over the two years of its operation.This is just another example of the approach that we are encouraging under the Australian government's $31 million innovative pool program - innovative, creative and responsive approaches to caring for those with particular needs. These 35 places in the west are in addition to the release of 635 new aged care places for the west in 2003 which will be allocated to aged care providers later this year. So I am pleased to say that the Howard government have allocated some 3,162 additional aged care places to the west, worth about $57 million, over the past four years. The Howard government are ensuring that world-class support services are being delivered to people with dementia in this country as well as to their carers. </DOC>

 - All honourable members have been following with concern the plight of the 52,000 or thereabouts sheep on board the Cormo Express. The vessel is in Kuwait and is about to leave for the return journey to Australia. The government have been involved in extensive negotiations with countries around the world. We have been supported in those negotiations by the industry itself to seek to find an alternative destination for the sheep. That remains our priority. Even if the vessel is most of the way home and we uncover a satisfactory destination, the vessel will be diverted to that destination. A second vessel is being prepared in Australia to take on additional feed and supplies because it is quite clear that, once the vessel leaves Kuwait, the next load of feed and provisions that it will require will have to come from Australia. So we are undertaking a lot of preparation work in that regard.It would clearly be irresponsible for the government not to also be considering what options are available in the event that we are unable to find a destination for the sheep close to where they are. In that regard we have looked at a couple of options - slaughter at sea or some other location or the alternative of bringing them back to Australia. Those negotiations and those scientific studies are well advanced. You indicated that a number of industry bodies have expressed concern about the sheep coming back to Australia, including the Australian Veterinary Association. To be fair, you must also acknowledge that that association has issued a press release saying how unsatisfactory slaughter at sea would be. So I think the Veterinary Association's commentaries on the issue demonstrate how challenging and difficult this situation is. The government have no intention whatsoever of compromising Australia's enviable quarantine status. We will not in any way be putting at risk our clean and green image. The work that is being done would put in place a quarantine regime the like of which we have never seen in this country. It is not the kind of quarantine regime that you would have for a routine import. This is an emergency situation and it requires an emergency response and a tighter rein of quarantine than you would normally have. The industry associations have identified some of the disease and pest issues that have to be addressed. We are confident that those issues can be effectively addressed; indeed, the industry associations themselves have identified many of the ways that that risk can be reduced to the kinds of levels we would expect in relation to our trade with other parts of the world.I would remind the House that these are Australian sheep and we are proposing to bring them back to Australia. They have not left the vessel and it is an enclosed vessel. So the risk of any kind of infection coming on board is quite low. Nonetheless, we are not prepared in any way to compromise our nation's clean and green image, and the quarantine plans put in place will take no shortcuts.Finally, it is by far the best option for us to be able to unload these sheep in other parts of the world. That is still our primary objective and we are working to achieve that end. But if that cannot be achieved, then we have in place and will be able to put in place a satisfactory arrangement so these sheep can be brought home to their native country, Australia.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Boothby. He is certainly a staunch supporter of the automotive industry. He has in his electorate not only Mitsubishi but also a number of component manufacturers. As I mentioned in the House the other day, Mitsubishi in particular are embarking on an almost billion-dollar expansion and renovation program which will cement their place amongst auto manufacturers in Australia for many decades to come. The automotive sector is a driving force behind the solid growth in the Australian economy.  Today, the Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries has lifted industry expectations even higher. The 2003 forecast for the sale of new motor vehicles in Australia has been lifted officially to 900,000 vehicles. That is a 9.2 per cent increase on last year's record sales and again demonstrates that this industry goes from strength to strength. This sector continues to benefit from and enjoy very substantial and very important growth as a result of the federal government's policies; not only those policies as they specifically relate to the automotive industry but also those policies which deliver economic certainty and consumer confidence.The growth in the automotive market in Australia is not the only thing benefiting our automotive sector. We are also receiving a substantial benefit from the growth in automotive sales in over 30 countries which we export to. This week we will see Holden launch the Commodore in Thailand, again a substantial step forward - and somewhat enhanced by the Commodore taking centre stage on the basis that it will be the official vehicle used in the APEC summit in Bangkok. Holden are only one of the companies that stand to benefit from the outcomes of the free trade agreement which we are currently talking with Thailand about. They say it `could deliver substantial opportunities for General Motors in the region'.Perhaps the most well-known export that Holden currently has is the Monaro or, as it will be known in the US, the Pontiac GTO. This is a fantastic vehicle, slightly rebadged and restyled. It is still an Australian built vehicle of enormous quality and fantastic performance. It will be marketed as a Pontiac because the Americans like that name. It is another clear example of how Australian vehicles are exciting buyers the world over. None of this would have happened without the continued support of this government. None of this would have happened without the $4.2 billion that this government has committed to future investment in the industry in the next 10-year plan.It is also appropriate in concluding that I recognise the imminent retirement of a very inspiring industry leader. Peter Hanenberger, as the CEO of Holden, has made an enormous contribution to the automotive industry in Australia and he is certainly going to be a loss to the industry. At the same time I wish to welcome his successor, Denny Mooney, who has big shoes to fill but, I am sure, will see Australian General Motors Holden, along with all the other automotive companies in Australia, continue to grow over the next decade.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Forrest for his question. I can inform the House that yesterday the Australian Treasury and the Australian Bureau of Statistics released the annual data for private sector wealth in Australia, which showed that, as at June 2003, private sector wealth in Australia stood at $4.325 trillion, increasing by $553 billion in the year to June or by 14.7 per cent.According to this series, since March 1996 private sector wealth has increased by $2.2 trillion or 109 per cent; that is, the wealth of Australians has increased by 109 per cent since March 1996, an average increase of 10.7 per cent per annum. Since 1996 Australians on average have doubled their wealth. All members of the House will welcome the fact that Australians have had an increase in the value of their assets and that the net wealth of Australian households has increased by so much.Consumer sentiment was released yesterday, which is at a nine-year high. That is consistent with the fact that unemployment is now at a 13-year low. In addition to that, the retail turnover has been very strong in the last year. Notwithstanding the fact that wealth has increased for Australians on average over the last year by such a large amount - by 14.7 per cent - there are those in Australia who are still doing it tough, particularly in rural Australia where they have been affected by drought.There are those who are still locked out of the labour market because we do not give them a go. We should not forget those people who have been affected by the labour market laws in this country which still keep people who want to work out of work. That is why this government intends to proceed with its reform program. The results for average wealth and incomes in Australia are quite clear but we need to go further. The government's program needs to be implemented to give those who have not shared in all of that prosperity a better go in the future.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question, because he represents an area where an increase in agricultural trade would be of enormous benefit to the economy of the region. Since the setback at Doha, Australia has been active in endeavouring to re-engage the nations who have a particular interest in developing a freer and fairer trading regime and get this multilateral process back on track. The multilateral trade negotiations remain the government's No. 1 trade priority -  - and we are certainly redoubling our efforts to get WTO members back to the negotiating table to ensure that the Doha objectives can indeed be achieved. As the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources said a few moments ago, the potential for bilateral trade agreements is significant, offering real benefits to Australia. But if we can achieve a widespread multilateral agreement -  - then clearly other benefits will also flow in very significant quantities back to our country. The Minister for Trade is in Bangkok at present and he is calling together key WTO members, in the company of WTO Director-General Dr Supachai, to capture the work that has been done in Cancun. Some progress was made in the agricultural negotiations at Cancun, but unfortunately, because the meeting broke up before it got to the discussions on agriculture, a lot of that could not be put into text and into agreement.Australia is determined to ensure that there is no backtracking, that there is no loss of the progress that was made at Cancun. The meeting that Minister Vaile is currently convening in Bangkok will, hopefully, build on the negotiations that occurred at Cancun and enable the Doha Round to make another step forward. There will be enormous benefits to Australian agriculture in electorates like Barker if we are able to get a fairer and freer trading regime. The Cairns Group proposals, for instance, if accepted would increase average farm cash incomes on broadacre and dairy farms in Australia by between $11,000 and $15,000 a year. So it is very well worthwhile doing and the efforts of the trade minister are to be commended in getting the Doha Round back on track and making sure that progress continues to be made.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Solomon for his question and for his ongoing interest in the employment of Indigenous Australians, particularly those in his electorate in the Northern Territory. In 1999 the Australian government introduced the Indigenous Employment Policy and, since then, has expended more than $200 million on it. The Corporate Leaders for Indigenous Employment program is part of the policy, which also includes the Job Network and the Indigenous Small Business Fund.I am pleased to inform the House that, from 1999 until August this year, the partnership between the Australian government and business has seen more than 75,000 Indigenous job seekers helped by the Job Network and nearly 40,000 being placed in jobs. In addition, more than 30,000 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have been assisted under the Indigenous Employment Policy. Last night the member for Solomon, along with a number of other members of this House, attended the Corporate Leaders for Indigenous Employment awards in the Great Hall here at Parliament House. This was an opportunity to recognise and congratulate the efforts of 70 Australian companies that have joined this partnership with the Australian government, with commitments to some 4,000 jobs for Indigenous Australians. This is something which I believe we can all be proud of.To give the House an indication of the sort of work which is being done under this program, the winner of the main award last night was Mr Barry Orr, who received the prestigious Neville Bonner Memorial Award for what is really inspirational work with the Indigenous community stores in remote areas of the Northern Territory. Last year Barry Orr, together with his wife, Colleen, and his family, moved from Mildura in country Victoria, where he was employed by Woolworths, to the Wugularr community outside Katherine to manage a Fred Hollows Foundation and Woolworths project to make nutritional food and fresh produce available to remote communities.This project has had two quite significant outcomes for the people of the community: firstly, it has led to full-time employment for people in the community through the management and conduct of the store, and, secondly, through the introduction of more fresh produce on a regular basis, it has also had a significant health outcome for the Indigenous people living in the community. I take this opportunity to congratulate all those who were involved in the Indigenous employment program, particularly the 70 corporations around Australia and their leaders, and the winners of each of the awards last night.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Ryan for his question. I am very pleased to inform the Australian public and the Ryan electorate that the Howard government has a very proud record when it comes to regional telecommunications services. It is a record that Labor can only dream of. That has not stopped the opposition, however, from conducting an irresponsible scaremongering campaign over the full privatisation of Telstra.The fact is that there is an extensive regulatory regime safeguarding the interests of Australian consumers in relation to services provided by Telstra. This regime will remain in place after full privatisation. In fact, not only will all the current safeguards remain; there will be additional safeguards for Australian consumers under the government's response to the regional telecommunications inquiry - the Estens inquiry. The government retains the ability to regulate the telecommunications industry and, if necessary, introduce new regulatory safeguards. - Australian telecommunications consumers currently enjoy some of the world's strongest safeguards, including the universal service obligation, the customer service guarantee, the right to untimed local calls and the digital data service obligation. The introduction of full and open telecommunications competition has also brought many benefits to all Australian consumers. - Consumers have enjoyed a real decrease in -  - As I was saying, the introduction of open telecommunications competition has also brought many benefits for all Australian consumers. - Consumers have enjoyed a real decrease in prices for telephone services of 20.7 per cent since 1997. The introduction of the customer service guarantee by this government has meant that, for the first time, companies have had to comply with strict time frames for installation and repair of phone services or pay compensation. Before the introduction of the customer service guarantee, the most remote customers in Australia could expect to wait up to 27 months for attention. Under the CSG they can now expect their service to be connected within 20 days of making the request. The government has accepted all 39 recommendations of the Estens inquiry, and this is another example of a longstanding commitment to regional telecommunications services. The inquiry recommended that Telstra be required to maintain an ongoing local presence in regional, rural and remote Australia into the future. - The Estens inquiry recommended that Telstra be required to maintain an ongoing local presence in regional, rural and remote Australia into the future. In response to that the government have announced a firm commitment that we will impose a licence condition requiring Telstra to prepare a plan setting out the activities and strategies it will undertake to maintain its local presence in regional areas.There is a range of other matters that have been dealt with in the response to the Estens inquiry. The government is also imposing a licence condition on Telstra to provide a minimum equivalent throughput speed of 19.2 kilobits per second for dial-up Internet access over the fixed line network and a Higher Bandwidth Incentive Scheme to provide financial incentives to service providers.The Howard government has a genuine commitment to the maintenance of services to rural and regional areas. This contrasts starkly with the hypocritical, Johnny-come-lately actions of the Labor Party in feigning an interest in rural and regional services. The real commitment of the Labor Party to services in rural and regional areas is demonstrated by what the Labor Party did when the Commonwealth Bank was privatised. What the Labor Party did was precisely nothing. - I was referring to notes.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Lalor for her question. It was shame she did not invite me to the meeting that she had in Tweed Heads only last week. It was interesting that, with all those who attended - there were meant to have been hundreds there, but I think there were 50 or 60 - there was not one comment about bulk-billing or about the fall in bulk-billing. Indeed, the terms were very general, particularly about hospitals -  - Thank you, Mr Speaker. Health is an issue of concern to all Australians - and of course it is of concern to the good residents of Richmond. It is interesting that, on the points raised earlier in the House about other medical issues, a lot of the fear and drama painted by the Labor Party was unfounded.But on the issue of immunisation - to answer the question - it is interesting to note that, when we came in to government, the level of immunisation was at the lowest of the OECD countries. When Labor left the treasury bench in 1996, it was at 71 per cent. It was this government that introduced the regime to ensure that more Australian children were immunised - indeed, 91 per cent. As for the actual answer to your question, I think the Minister for Health and Ageing quite adequately answered it in response to the previous question.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Paterson for his question. When he is not fighting for Newcastle University, he is fighting for Hunter Valley Grammar School, Raymond Terrace Primary School or Gloucester High School. This government is undertaking a major reform of Australian universities because it is in Australia's long-term interests. The government is proposing to invest an extra $10 billion of taxpayers' funds in universities in the first 10 years and $1½ billion of additional public money in the first four years, which includes $122 million extra money for regional and rural campuses and up to some 25,000 scholarships for young people, worth up to $24,000, to help them with their education costs when they are at university. In addition to that, the government is increasing the funding to train nurses and teachers - expanding the places in the first five years by 6,500 as well as fully funding 25,000 overenrolled places.Today there is a strike which is being conducted throughout Australia's publicly funded universities. Some 80,000 employees in Australian universities are going on strike. This is a strike that is supported by the Australian Labor Party. The average Australian must ask themselves: what is the strike about? It is about this: the government has the Australian taxpayers' chequebook out and is about to write a cheque for $1½ billion for the first four years and, before the first $404 million of extra money is delivered to universities, the government is asking the universities to formalise what already occurs - and that is that every enterprise agreement will include a clause that says, `You, the employee of the university, have the right to negotiate an enterprise agreement through your union or staff association but, if you choose to negotiate an individual Australian workplace agreement with the university, you are free to do so.' What the government is saying to universities on behalf of Australian taxpayers is, `Please, do not discriminate against or in favour of unions and please ensure that every employee knows that they are free not only to be represented by their union but also to negotiate an individual agreement,' and that the arrangements in the universities should not be outside the norms that the community expects. The average working Australian has been through major change in the last 10 to 15 years. As a result of their sacrifices, this country is now going very well - but no less should apply in Australian universities.There is another strike planned for 4 November. The strike on 4 November is being run by the New South Wales Teachers Federation. Whereas the member for Jagajaga was scheduled to address a university strike this morning in Canberra, I will be most interested to see whether she will be attending the strike organised by the New South Wales Teachers Federation throughout TAFEs in New South Wales - a strike which is opposing not an optional 30 per cent increase in funds which is being proposed for universities but a 300 per cent increase in TAFE fees imposed by the New South Wales government.Unlike universities, TAFEs cater for a disproportionately large number of low-income people who come from the poorest families in the country. Unlike in university, there are no loan schemes. If you do not pay the fee when you get to the TAFE gate, they send you away. I would be interested to know whether the member for Jagajaga will be lining up, shoulder to shoulder, with the New South Wales Teachers Federation and opposing the 211 per cent increase for a welding course at the Queanbeyan campus of the Illawarra Institute of TAFE. I would be very interested to see whether the member for Throsby will be going down there with the member for Jagajaga. The message needs to be sent: if the Labor Party wants to be consistent - and it is very, very inconsistent - it needs to stand up and go along to that strike. This government does not encourage strikes but, if there is going to be one, the member for Jagajaga ought to be there. I apologise for going on, Mr Speaker, but I have worked out how the Labor Party works. -  - The Australian newspaper are running a series entitled `Pursuing opportunity and prosperity'. On Monday they ran a feature on education. They rang the Leader of the Opposition and said, `We'd like a forward-thinking contribution to the paper which addresses the real issues facing Australia in education.' Who did they send? They sent the member for Werriwa, who of course talked about performance based pay. Today when there is a strike at universities they send the member for Jagajaga because what they want is short-term opportunism and ideological dogma. In fact, as the member for Werriwa said, on 18 December 2000:Higher education policy should allow for fee deregulation. We need to stop poncing around with education policy. </DOC>

 - I regret to inform the member for Parkes that Aboriginal health is one of the most intractable problems that Australia faces. On all of the indicators - life expectancy, infant mortality, incidence of diabetes - Aboriginals do significantly worse than the general community. I can also inform the House that the government are spending more, and spending it more creatively, in an attempt to make a difference. This year we are spending $258 million on Indigenous specific health programs. This is a 50 per cent real increase on Indigenous health spending since 1996. I will give just a few examples of where we are making a difference. Thanks to a federally funded project at the Townsville Aboriginal and Islander Health Service, the incidence of low birth weight babies has dropped from 17 per cent in 2000 to nine per cent this year.In another federally funded project for the Nganampa Health Council in South Australia, the incidence of low birth weight babies has dropped from around 15 per cent in the mid-1980s to just five per cent now. Also, immunisation rates amongst Indigenous people there have gone from 60 per cent to almost 100 per cent, thanks to this federally funded project. Another federally funded project, in the Torres Strait, involves comprehensive diabetes management and has led to a 32 per cent reduction in hospital admissions amongst Indigenous people. In the current financial year we are spending over $16 million to support 67 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander programs to try and rein in substance abuse amongst Indigenous people. There are a whole range of factors that contribute to Aboriginal ill health - isolation, lifestyle, diet. Most of these are not readily amenable to government influence, but the government are determined to work with Indigenous people to try to produce better services, better structures and better communities to help produce the stronger social fabric which will ultimately produce healthier and happier people.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Chisholm for this question. When I said to the Australian public that I believed our Tough on Drugs policy was working, what I was referring to was the decline in the death rate from heroin overdoses. What I was referring to was the fact that this has happened in partnership with the states - all of the state Labor governments. I am pleased to say that this is an issue where, by and large, the state Labor premiers of this country - to their credit - have taken a bipartisan approach.In our view the Tough on Drugs strategy is one of the reasons why - it is not the only reason - there has, for the first time in years, been a decline in the death rate from heroin overdose. In fact, one of the most identifiable declines has occurred in the state from which the honourable member for Chisholm comes from, and this is the state of Victoria.I am also referring to the fact that illicit drug use has fallen and that the education program that we conducted has resulted in a very positive response. The survey that was carried out indicated that it led to a very steep increase in the regularity with which parents spoke to their children about drug abuse. We have now invested in the order of $1 billion - the largest ever investment by a national government - in a Tough on Drugs campaign. We have got record heroin and cocaine seizures, we are seeing a reduction in heroin death rates, we are seeing an increase in parental awareness of the challenge of drugs, we are seeing a reduction in illicit drug use and the honourable member has the nerve to suggest that our program has been a failure.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Cowper for his question, and I say to him and to the House that the Australian government's record on employment is excellent. We saw this last week with the release of the unemployment statistics, which showed that the unemployment rate in Australia was below six per cent for the second month in a row for the first time in 13½ years. To the member for Cowper, I say: there is more good news. The Australian Bureau of Statistics in its data for the month of September has indicated that long-term unemployment - that is, those who are unemployed for 12 months or more - is now at its lowest level in 13 years. Seasonally adjusted long-term unemployment fell by 9,900 in September, a 7.5 per cent drop on August.In fact, the long-term unemployment figure is 207,000 below the peak of 329,000, which was recorded in May 1993 under the Keating Labor government. There has been a fall of more than 200,000 from the peak in May 1993, under the Australian Labor Party in government, of some 329,000. The level of the very long-term unemployed - those who have, unfortunately, been unemployed for more than two years - has also fallen by almost 40,000 since this government came to power. There is always more that we can do in this regard, but this is very good news in relation to unemployment. It indicates once again that the economic policies of this government, aimed at making Australia a prosperous nation, are working for unemployed people. </DOC>

 - I am aware of some of the matters raised by the honourable member. The Red Cross visited Guantanamo Bay recently, and their report was unusual because it indicated they had some disagreement with the practice of ongoing detention of people in this circumstance. That is a matter about which this government has a different view, but they did raise that matter. In the context of torture, having only seen the prisoners in the last few weeks, the Red Cross gave no indication in their report that torture was evidenced. - They do not normally comment on other matters either, but they did on this occasion. - The further point I would make is that I have seen reports from the President of the United States in which he said that he would not expect that agents operating on behalf of the United States would torture detainees. I have also seen the reports of Australian officials who have on a number of occasions visited Guantanamo Bay and seen both of the detainees. There were no reports to them of any torture. That is the background to the matter. I have seen the reports, and I have asked for inquiries to be made as to whether there have been any further developments.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. There have been some 271,000 participants since 1997 contributing to Work for the Dole, in over 15,000 projects. It is very interesting - and I think this statistic will stun most people in the House - that that equates to over 38,000 working years of work that Work for the Dole participants have put into communities right around this country. They have done a fantastic job, doing work that otherwise would not be done, meeting their mutual obligations and doing something positive for themselves and their wider community. That is 38,000 working years of worthwhile activities building better and stronger local communities. Today I received from the member for Hume an email he received from the Harden Shire Beautification Program.  - The local shire council has got behind Work for the Dole, and a bit of that email is worth reading because it goes to the heart of what a wonderful program this is. It says:Some of the tasks include:Finalisation of the Lighthorse Memorial - DoneRepair and renovate classrooms within the Trinity Education centre for occupation by the TAFE Riverina - Done ...Repair and renovate a community respite centre within the Trinity Centre - Done ...Remodel and re-paint hospitality areas at the Harden Picnic Race Club - DoneInstall a full irrigation system for the use at the Harden Picnic Race Club - Done ... - The email continued:Renovate, repair, re-paint and construct a Tourism and Regional Produce Centre in Murrumburrah - Underway.The list goes on and on. This is a small community council that is working collaboratively with Work for the Dole, the Howard government, its unemployed and the local community to do a fantastic job in providing better facilities for its local community and opportunities for the unemployed and allowing the unemployed to meet their mutual obligations. When you look at 38,000 working years of community work being undertaken by these people, you can only but wonder what it is that makes some of those in the Labor Party throw the barbs that they do and fail to recognise the benefit, not only to the individual but also to the local community and the nation, of Work for the Dole.</DOC>

If there is anything I can usefully add to what he already knows, then I will do so. We have no desire as a government to stifle debate on these matters. I think the honourable member's views on these issues are ventilated from time to time. He has a right to do that but, on the other hand, we have agendas that we have to implement on behalf of the Australian people. It is also the case that in relation to private member's bills, there are other private member's bills, and there is absolutely no attempt by us to stifle debate.</DOC>

 - I would like to take the opportunity to congratulate the member for Wentworth on his leadership of the Australian parliamentary rugby team, which won the recent world cup for the first time from New Zealand. It was a great event involving all members of parliament and just a few former Wallabies - they were all part of the squad. The Rugby World Cup is truly a great event for Australia and, importantly, it is a great tourism event for Australia. We are expecting in excess of 40,000 international visitors over the next few weeks and more than 100,000 Australians are travelling interstate for the Rugby World Cup. The event, involving 44 matches, is being held over 40 days. At the same time that we are using this event to broadcast to more than four billion people over 40 days worldwide, the Australian government - through the Australian Tourist Commission - has commissioned additional advertising in key markets such as the United States -  - The member for Hotham has a problem with us advertising Australia offshore; is that right? It is extraordinary. - We believe we should be promoting Australia offshore. Five million visitors come to Australia every year, and it is directly linked to the marketing efforts of the Australian government through the Australian Tourist Commission. We are about trying to encourage more tourists to come to Australia, because it creates jobs in regional Australia and it creates jobs in metropolitan parts of Australia. Significantly, for every visitor that comes to Australia more wealth is created for Australians - and that is great for Australia. We welcome the Rugby World Cup. We want to see the Wallabies win the World Cup. We want to see a greater tourist opportunity for Australia so that we can promote a great country to the rest of the world.</DOC>

I can only say that I am profoundly sorry that it occurred. I apologise to the lady concerned.

 - I thank the honourable member for Blair for his question. I can confirm that Mr Willie Brigitte was taken into immigration detention on 9 October and was returned to France on 17 October. He was questioned by authorities in Australia before his return and, in relation to the questioning that occurred, he was largely uncooperative. I have seen some claims that this demonstrates some flawed liaison between French and Australian authorities. I want to say firstly that I think this demonstrates very close and effective working relationships between Australia and France.The point in time at which France first advised us that Mr Brigitte was of interest to them was on 22 September. We subsequently received on 7 October some more pressing advice of their concern about the nature of his presence in Australia, and we were able to deal with the matter within two days. The fact is that the first advice from France was largely of a routine nature, but the expectation that other countries are going to put onto their alert systems, and advise us of, the names of every person who may be the subject of an incidental inquiry by an intelligence agency would, I think, fly in the face of any sensible arrangements that Australia or other countries would be prepared to put in place. If you were going to have arrangements of that sort, they would have to be genuinely reciprocal. The opposition is arguing at the moment that Australia ought to enter into arrangements with other countries through which the name of any person who is the subject of any inquiry by an intelligence agency is added to a list and circulated to other liaison countries. I suspect that if I ask the opposition for a bill to permit us to advise authorities of any Australian citizen who is the subject of an ASIO inquiry in Australia, simply because somebody reported to an agency that there might be something of interest that they should look at, they would object very vigorously. If you want to test how the opposition would respond to the proposition which they are, in effect, putting here today, you only have to look at the nature of the cooperation that has been offered from the opposition in relation to more substantial issues. The fact is that they have asserted - through the media, I have to say - that the new ASIO powers might have been able to be used in relation to questioning Mr Brigitte before he left Australia. The fact is that they have conveniently overlooked the terms of the bill -  -  - of the act; I stand corrected - that require the Attorney to be reasonably satisfied in relation to any requests that a person is going to be able to offer substantial assistance with regard to a suspected terrorist activity in Australia. That is the nature of the test. The advice that I have received from the competent agencies is that it is a moot point whether we would have been able to satisfy that test.  - The further point I will make is that, in relation to the assessments that were being made about Mr Brigitte, our agencies quite properly formed the view that, with the power available to the French authorities under French legislation - which enable them to detain him for questioning for perhaps up to two years, with the approval of a judge - and the fact that they had access to more relevant information about his activities, it was preferable that the questioning be undertaken by the French authorities. It was on that basis that he was removed from Australia, and the effort to test the powers that were included in the ASIO legislation was not undertaken in this particular instance.The only other point I make is that it has become quite clear that if you look at the nature of the powers that we have and the nature of the powers that the French have - and I am not necessarily saying it should be the French standard that should be used, but if you look at it as a question of degree - they have substantially wider powers than our agency has available to it. In relation to the way in which the compromise emerged, it is quite clear that there are other difficulties already apparent in the legislation that we have, and they were of surprise to me. One is that, if you are dealing with people whom you could detain for questioning only for three periods of eight hours and you have to use an interpreter, you effectively have half as much time to pursue your questioning. - The member laughs, but I think that is a significant defect in the nature of the legislation. The legislation, as it is presently drafted, does not permit an organisation to seek to have a person detained because it is believed that he is likely to leave the country. There are other provisions I have read which people might argue could take you to that view, but there is no specific, explicit provision that if a person is likely to leave Australia we would be able to detain them. People say, `Why did you vote for it?' We wanted to get legislation that would enable us to question people of concern about potential terrorist activity in Australia and we had to make compromises in order to get it in place. It is not just second best; it is third and fourth best if you start to look at the range of issues that are emerging where we could have done far better. - It is not the practice to table advice from security organisations but, as the Leader of the Opposition knows, the government regularly makes senior officers available to brief the opposition on these matters -  - and they do. - I made it abundantly clear that advice from agencies is not tabled. In relation to those matters, the Leader of the Opposition is able to access briefings. He has been briefed on this matter. If he required further briefings on the specific issue -  - If he required further briefings on this matter in particular he could ask for them.</DOC>

 - I have in front of me a copy of the relevant section which deals with the way in which these issues are dealt with. They are not powers reposed in me. There are requests that are forthcoming from a competent organisation. I have already told you that ASIO formed a view that it was a moot point as to whether or not the powers would be available.You can see quite clearly if you read section 34C(3) of subdivision B, `Questioning, detention etc', dealing with the requesting of a warrant, that the minister - speaking of the Attorney - may by writing consent to the making of a request, but only if the minister is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for believing that issuing the warrant to be requested will substantially assist in the collection of intelligence that is important in relation to a terrorism offence and that relying on other methods of collecting that intelligence would be ineffective. I think you can see, simply by reading those terms about the nature of the test, that there has to be a judgment that it will substantially assist, it has to be on reasonable grounds and it has to be after satisfying oneself that other intelligence would not be effective in dealing with the issue that you could come to a view. You can see why the authorities have been very effectively constrained by those words. So in the advice that was given to me this is clearly a moot point.</DOC>

 - First of all, I thank the honourable member for his question. I think all members of the House know that his electorate, which includes the city of Townsville, is very much the heart of the military component of the regional assistance mission. The honourable member himself has been very supportive of those Australian Defence Force personnel in the Solomon Islands. Last Friday, 31 October, marked the 100th day of the Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands being in place. As we have said before, the government is very pleased with the progress that the mission has made. A lot of attention has been focused on the successful law and order component of the mission, and we have seen some tangible results: some 3,700 firearms have been handed in and ex-militants such as Jimmy Rasta and Harold Keke have been arrested, which is obviously a very important step forward. Also arrested were more than 25 Royal Solomon Islands Police members. The 25 Solomon Islands Police members have been arrested on serious charges, including murder, assault and robbery. This is a very important part of the mission - not perhaps so far much publicised - to ensure that the Solomon Islands Police operate more effectively. So successful has been the stabilisation of law and order that at least some of the troops are going to come home.But RAMSI, as we call the Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands, is a lot more than just security. We do not think that a bandaid solution to the problems of the Solomon Islands is sufficient. We have to help Solomon Islands rebuild their institutions, their economy and indeed their nation as a whole. Working with RAMSI are financial advisers. They are assisting the Solomon Islands government to put together a credible budget for 2004. RAMSI is also conducting a strategic review of the Solomon Islands Police, in this case in consultation not only with the Solomon Islands government, obviously, but also with civil society.Finally, let me say that today in Sydney the Australian government is hosting an aid donors meeting which is being attended by delegates from Japan, the European Union, the United States, the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank. Not only will they be briefed by the Special Coordinator of RAMSI, Nick Warner, but we hope that this meeting and a follow-up meeting which is to be held in Honiara on 20 November will encourage much-needed investment to reverse the decline of the past five years. The challenges are still daunting. We appreciate the cooperation with the Solomon Islands government, but importantly we appreciate very much the cooperation with our friends and partners in the Pacific Islands Forum. Representatives from a number of countries in the Pacific Islands Forum are here today in the House of Representatives, including the Prime Minister of Vanuatu. I want to say in front of them how much we appreciate the Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands being a regional solution to a regional problem.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Cook for his question in relation to this. I can inform the House that on Friday the Australian Securities and Investments Commission announced the establishment of a special team to review reported information concerning Offset Alpine Printing. The investigation will be focusing on the veracity of information previously provided to the commission in the Federal Court in connection with the beneficial ownership of shares. Under section 64 of the ASIC Act it is an offence if a person in the course of an ASIC examination gives information or makes a statement that is false or misleading in a material particular, and that offence carries a penalty of up to two years imprisonment.The government have increased funding for the Australian Securities and Investments Commission quite substantially over recent years. In the 2002-03 budget, an additional $90 million was provided over four years. In this year's budget, an additional $12.3 million was provided over four years to assist with enforcement activities on accounting and an additional $12.3 million was provided over four years for corporate insolvency. As I have said on a number of occasions, from this government's point of view we expect the law to be enforced without fear or favour. We do not believe that the Australian Securities and Investments Commission should give precedence to people because of their position or their connections. We think it is important that all members of the Australian public are subject to prosecution where the corporate regulator believes that to be appropriate.Members will be aware that there has been a campaign run against the Australian Securities and Investments Commission in this place by the member for Werriwa over a number of years. He has been interjecting in the course of this answer to continue that attack on ASIC and its chairman. He has put that attack in place over a number of years because of his complaint that civil proceedings were brought against, to use his words, `the son of a Labor icon'. That was in a speech that he made in this House of Representatives. From the point of view of the government, regardless of who one's father is - or, indeed, who one's son is - where there is evidence to bring proceedings, the corporate regulator should do so without fear or favour. - And the member for Werriwa continues his vendetta against the Chairman of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission to this day in this House. Corporate regulators need support to bring proceedings to enforce the corporate regulation in this country. They will get that support from this government - without fear or favour - to bring those proceedings. Nobody should jump to any conclusions, because this ought to come into a court of law, but the moment that people in this parliament suggest - as the member for Werriwa has done - that some should be off limits because of blood relations, that will undermine the whole of corporate regulation in this country. In that context, I want to endorse the words yesterday of Senator Conroy, who apparently can see something that the member for Werriwa cannot. When he was asked by Barrie Cassidy on the Insiders program whether they should `let the cards fall where they may', Senator Conroy - who, I hasten to say, although he does not know a great deal in the area, knows a great deal more than the member for Werriwa - said:ASIC have done a good job, David Knott has done a good job over recent years in not being prepared to look at reputations. He's been prepared to apply the law as he's seen it and pursue anybody, no matter how high profile, in doing his job.Well said, Senator Conroy - a repudiation of the member for Werriwa!</DOC>

 - It is not the case that countries have at any time routinely exchanged their full databases in relation to people of potential concern - that has never been the case. It is not the case that Australia shares information with other countries about every Australian who has ever come to the attention of ASIO - that is not the case. And if you think it is the case that countries ought to adopt a standard whereby every person who has ever come to the attention of a security agency ought to be advised to other countries with a view to prohibiting or limiting their access to travel, let us see whether you are prepared to do it - let us see whether that is what you are going to advocate - because the implications are very significant.The situation is that in relation to this matter we received advice from France on 22 September initially drawing to our attention that they had an interest in Mr Brigitte and that they thought he might have come to Australia. We received further advice on 7 October that he was a person of significant concern to them. That was the time at which it was raised with us as a matter of some importance. Thereafter, within two days, the person had been located, taken into immigration detention, questioned and, on 17 October, removed. I think it is a demonstrable success of cooperation - an undoubted success. - Yes, Mr Speaker.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Page for his question. I can inform the House that the Australian government has taken a number of steps to try to pierce the veil of bank secrecy which is sometimes used in offshore locations for illicit activities. In April 2000, in my capacity as the Chairman of the OECD that year, I brought to the council a report called Improving access to bank information for tax purposes. This was an attempt to get agreement between OECD countries to allow cooperation where there was reasonable cause and identification of sums concerned. The OECD members unanimously agreed to that report, including a recommendation to lift bank secrecy for civil matters by 31 December 2005, and to adopt a common definition of `tax fraud' which would provide the key to the lifting of that secrecy. I have unfortunately to report to the House that on 16 September this year four countries, led by Switzerland, vetoed those recommendations.I raised this matter at the APEC finance ministers meeting in Bangkok on 6 September 2002 and it received agreement from those countries that were there to continue with the project. The weekend before last I raised the subject again in Morelia in Mexico, at the G20 finance ministers meeting. There was broad agreement around the table at that meeting of 20 finance ministers and central bankers that diplomatic efforts should continue to try to bring those countries which are not cooperating with the OECD project into an agreement and that, having achieved an agreement amongst the OECD, that the provisions would then be applied to non-OECD members that are suspect to allowing illicit activities or can be used as tax havens or indeed worse.I make this point: banker secrecy cannot only be used for tax purposes or indeed corporate purposes; it could possibly be used for the financing of criminal activity, including terrorist activity. Australia is willing to exchange information on tax matters where requested by competent authorities with due cause to do so. We believe that the OECD recommendations represent the best way of taking this matter forward. We call on all countries, including Switzerland, to join that project and to accept that common definition. We believe that all countries have an interest in allowing the exchange between competent authorities, where there is prima facie evidence on the basis of reasonable cause, to enforce corporate laws in tax matters and indeed to crack down on the financing of illegal activities. - No.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Fairfax for his question, because it is demonstrably clear that our present arrangements for listing terrorist organisations are not in Australia's interests. The government take our responsibilities for protecting Australians very seriously and we are committed to ensuring that every possibly measure is taken to deal with terrorist threats. While we have been able to move to list 14 terrorist organisations, we have been constrained in our ability even to consider listing a number of other organisations that we are advised represent a potential threat.The current requirement that the terrorist organisation be identified by the United Nations Security Council before it can be listed prevents quick and independent action to deal with threats to Australians and Australia's interests as they arise. If you want to look for examples, they are not too hard to find: one is Lashkar-e-Taiba - LET - and Hamas is another which has not only been raised on this side of the House but has been raised by members opposite, as I have observed from time to time. They are just two examples of organisations that we would consider listing but we cannot because the United Nations Security Council has not listed them. The fact is that while -  - The fact is that a number of countries, notwithstanding the inability of the United Nations Security Council to get around to it, have listed these two organisations - those countries include the European Union, the United Kingdom and the United States of America. Quite frankly, we believe that we should not be held hostage to the United Nations in relation to these matters; we believe it is a question of our sovereignty, the integrity of Australia -  - yes - that should be able to determine what is in Australia's interests and how those issues should be dealt with. It is for that reason that we have a bill before the parliament at this stage. It has already been through this chamber; it is in the Senate. It does require the consent of the states because it involves legislation for which certain undertakings were given to the states to agree to further changes. The Prime Minister has written to the state premiers advising them of the advice that we have received in relation to Lashkar-e-Taiba, because we have had advice that it is an organisation of potential concern. He has also advised them about the concerns that we as a government have about Hamas and he has sought their support for the bill. We believe that the proposals in that bill clearly safeguard Australia's interests. They are stronger; they are at least the equivalent of those in the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada. We believe that the premiers and chief ministers, if they will set aside party politics and cooperate in relation to this matter, can support measures that are clearly in the Australian interest, in the national interest, and ought to be enacted as soon as possible. </DOC>

 - I made it abundantly clear that we do not believe that we should be captive to some other organisation every time we want to list an organisation that our intelligence organisations tell us presents a real threat to the security of Australia and the region. That is the point we make. We do not think we should have to go -  - I make it clear that we do not believe that every time we want to list an organisation of concern to us here in Australia we should have to go, cap in hand, to another organisation to ask them whether they will give us permission to list it. That is the view we take. What we seek is legislation from you that will enable us as Australians to be able to make the determination as to what is in our interests. -  - We believe, quite frankly, that we should have the same capacity to be able to deal with these issues as they have in the United States, in the United Kingdom and in the European Union - that is the reason. The fact is that what the Labor Party wants is that each time, no matter how urgent the request, we have to wait until the United Nations gives us approval or we have to wait until we can get a bill into this parliament - a bill that has to go through every stage, with the potential for further committee deliberations - and through both chambers -  - of the parliament. They believe that that sort of process, in relation to dealing with potential terrorist threats to Australia, is quick, efficient and timely. I can tell you that that is not our view.</DOC>

 - First of all, I thank the honourable member for Dobell for his question and compliment him on the excellent job he is doing as the member for Dobell. The government has implemented a range of different measures to combat terrorism, including, importantly, to prevent funds from Australia being used for terrorist groups or terrorist acts. In my capacity as the Minister for Foreign Affairs, I have listed under Australian law some 470 individuals and organisations for their links to terrorist acts. Actually, since there has been some discussion about an organisation which is variously described as Lashkar-e-Taiba - and other possible variants of that name are used from time to time - I point out to the House that it was listed by me on 20 March 2002. These listings make it a criminal offence for persons to hold assets that are owned or controlled by the organisations or individuals listed within Australia, and that is punishable by up to five years imprisonment. This is part of the obligations that the Australian government has under Security Council resolutions to freeze funds and other financial assets, but of course this is not the same thing that the Attorney-General has been talking about as proscribing organisations, as terrorist groups, for the purposes of the Criminal Code.This can only be done under existing legislation in Australia if those organisations are listed by the United Nations, and a consensus decision at the United Nations Security Council under Security Council resolution 1267 - a consensus decision by what is called the 1267 committee - is needed for a listing to take place. There is a further qualification, which is quite an important qualification, that that listing will not take place unless that organisation is associated with the Taliban or al-Qaeda to the satisfaction of all of the members of the committee. So that explains why Hamas, an organisation which I would have thought was unequivocally a terrorist organisation - and Hezbollah is another example, and we have legislated against it here - has not been proscribed here: because it has not been listed by the United Nations committee. It has not been listed by a United Nations committee because of the failure to get consensus on that. Exactly the same argument applies in relation to Lashkar-e-Taiba. If you cannot get a consensus in the United Nations, no matter what we think in this parliament or no matter what we think in this country, according to the legislation that the Labor Party has allowed through the Senate we are not able to proscribe that organisation. So organisations can be manifestly terrorist organisations but not be on the UN list. Lashkar-e-Taiba, which has not elicited any questions from the opposition in the 7½ years I have been a minister but is an organisation which focuses on the Kashmir crisis - in other words, it is essentially a Kashmiri-oriented terrorist organisation - is not on the UN list, and that is hardly surprising because of the qualifications that apply to the 1267 committee. So the Australian government, on behalf of the Australian people, obviously is limited in terms of its capacity to ensure that organisations which are manifestly terrorist organisations are proscribed in this country. The only alternative path to choose is the path of legislation through the parliament. The government has been working very hard where we have the legal authority to do so, and in particular in terms of taking measures to ban any financing of terrorist organisations, where we have greater scope. In that particular context, as I said, Lashkar-e-Taiba was listed quite some time ago. But this is all part of the strong pattern of opposition by this government to terrorism and terrorist organisations. That is illustrated, if I may say so, by the fact that the Indonesian Foreign Minister and I will be co-hosting a regional summit on counter-terrorism in February next year.  </DOC>

 - As has been frequently acknowledged, the introduction of the GST has given the tax office additional mechanisms with which to track income tax avoidance. That is because under the GST system every business has to have an Australian business number and both suppliers and sellers have to report in order to get input tax credits. I would have thought that now that the Labor Party support the GST -  -  - they would not be continuing their campaign. I paused a moment then just to clarify what the proposition was. The tax office has now indicated that revenue outcomes consistent with the estimated additional income tax collection of $2.6 billion have come about. The Australian National Audit Office said in a recent report: The ATO strategy to address the cash economy is consistent with those of comparable countries. It offers a wide-ranging approach in dealing with the cash economy. In fact, the collections themselves would show that there has been enormous success, I would have thought, in picking up additional revenue -  - On cue, they come in. When you do pick up the black economy and collect tax, the Labor Party complains that too much tax is being collected, as the member for Melbourne just did. As the tax office and the ANAO have indicated, the GST system, the Australian business number and the cross-matching have given additional revenue. If the Labor Party believes that the ABN or the GST system should be rolled back, we would be willing to hear it.</DOC>

 - I would like to thank the member for Makin for her question and acknowledge her keen interest in the auto sector, particularly in South Australia. It is well known now that, a fortnight ago, we concluded negotiations with the Thai government with regard to a free trade agreement between Australia and Thailand, in a meeting that took place between the Prime Minister and Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra in Bangkok. The last remaining issues were resolved to put in place what is a comprehensive and very balanced agreement between Australia and Thailand. Interestingly, it will clearly benefit the Australian auto sector and the Australian wine industry. Both industries are very important to the state of the member for Makin and, indeed, your state, Mr Speaker, in terms of the access that we will get into that market. Thailand is a country of 61 million people. We currently have a two-way trade with them of about $7.25 billion a year. That will be significantly enhanced as a result of this agreement. It will be of particular interest to the member for Makin that, in the area of the auto sector, the agreement allows for the immediate elimination of tariffs on exports from Australia to Thailand of automobiles with engine capacities above three litres. It also allows for elimination of tariffs on export of vehicles in the commercial vehicle fleet into Thailand. It allows for a significant reduction in the tariff on vehicles that have engine capacities less than three litres. In fact, it is a reduction of a tariff of 80 per cent to a tariff of 30 per cent. So, obviously, this is going to secure the jobs of many Australian auto workers. Indeed, in the future, it will prospectively create many more jobs as we are able to penetrate that market.That point has been borne out by a couple of public comments that have been made recently. One is by the president of Holden Australia, Peter Hanenburger, who said:I think it's fantastic and shows particularly the vision that government has.He has also said:The reduction of these tariffs will offer opportunities for Holden and other Australian car makers and help to build our critical mass of production to protect Australian jobs.The other comment came from the Australian Labor Party, and it was very welcome. The opposition spokesman for trade, Senator Conroy, said:Labor welcomes this free trade agreement with Thailand.It will be of significant benefit to many Australian industries, including cars ...We welcome that comment from the Australian Labor Party. We certainly look forward to their support in the implementation of this very important agreement and as we negotiate with the United States of America.</DOC>

 - Despite valiant efforts to try and besmirch the reputation of the tax commissioner, the tax commissioner has consistently found a compliance dividend - and I tabled a media release on 19 August 2003 - of $3.5 billion over three years of additional tax estimated to be raised as a result of the new tax system. In addition to that, I have the Cash Economy Task Force report media release No. 3 of 1991. - Yes, 03/91. No. 91 of 2003. - I will say it again. I have the cash Economy Task Force report media release 03/91 - that is, No. 91 of 2003. It says:A Cash Economy Task Force report has found the new tax system is impacting significantly on the cash economy, producing a more robust tax system that is harder to evade ...The report states:`The design features of the reformed tax system are working together to produce a more robust tax system that is harder to evade ...'The report lists the following indicators of the positive impact of the new tax system:	More that $135 million has been withheld from businesses that did not quote a valid Australian Business Number -  - The Cash Economy Task Force report media release of 23 September 2001 is directly on this point. I will continue. The report goes on:	More businesses than expected have registered for an ABN, with tens of thousands of businesses previously outside the tax system now drawn into the tax net. The Tax Office has already raised about $50 million in backdated taxes.At the third dot point, it says:Revenue outcomes are consistent with the expected compliance dividend from the new tax system to June 2003 of $2.6 billion being achieved.At the fourth dot point - this is September 2003 -  -  - No, again I say 2003. - It is media release No. 91 of 2003. The Cash Economy Task Force report media release, at the third dot point, says:Revenue outcomes are consistent with the expected compliance dividend from the new tax system to June 2003 of $2.6 billion being achieved.The fourth dot point states:A survey of small business and public practice Certified Practising Accountants found 81 per cent of CPAs considered their clients' bookkeeping procedures had improved under the new tax system and 68 per cent saw improvement in invoicing procedures.This is the Cash Economy Task Force report, as recently as 23 June. The task force includes -  - Not just the Australian Taxation Office. It includes academics, small business operators, tax practitioners, representatives from the building and construction and retailing industries, microbusinesses and home based businesses, ACOSS, as well as senior staff from the tax office, Centrelink, AUSTRAC and the states and territories. The tax commissioner has reported it - the Cash Economy Task Force has reported it - and I would say that the collections endorse it. Notwithstanding all of Labor's claims that the GST would fail or would not be effective, the evidence is in: Australia's economy is as strong as it has been in recent years. If you wanted any greater endorsement of the new taxation system, the fact is that, after opposing it hook line and sinker, the Labor Party now supports it. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Aston for his question. I can inform him and the House that the Melbourne Magistrates Court today found a senior CFMEU official guilty of threatening or intimidating an employee of a major construction company because that employee had proposed to give evidence in another matter before the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. This successful prosecution is one of nine matters that the interim building industry task force has pursued and that are before various courts around the country. It is the first on which a verdict has been reached. It confirms the need for the reform of the building and construction industry. The Cole royal commission presented a compelling case for reform, and today's judgment in the Melbourne Magistrates Court adds further weight to that.The problems in the building and construction industry mean fewer jobs and lower standards of living for all Australians. That is why this government is committed to reform of that industry. Reform equals more jobs and higher standards of living. This sector of the economy is worth some $40 billion. It is a $40 billion industry employing some 700,000 Australians, yet this sector has Australia's worst record of industrial disputes; it has seven times the number of strikes of all other industries in Australia. Indeed, the Cole royal commission found that improving the industry's workplace practices would boost Australia's economy by some $2.3 billion a year. At the core of what Mr Justice Cole found in his commission's report was an industry that is characterised by lawlessness, by illegal and improper payments, by chronic failure to honour legally binding agreements, by regular flouting of court and Industrial Relations Commission orders and by a culture of coercion and intimidation.The interim building industry task force, which was established after the royal commission, has, as I said, nine matters before Australian courts - six involving union officials and three involving employers. The government is committed to reform. I will shortly be introducing legislation into this House to reform the building and construction industry. The question now for the Labor Party is whether it is prepared to support this legislation and whether it is prepared to support the government and do away with lawlessness in the building and construction industry. Will the Labor Party support the legislation which the government will shortly bring in, or will it show once again that it is simply a captive of an unrepresentative vested minority group - namely, the big union bosses in Australia?</DOC>

 - I now have the Hansard record of 19 August 2003. The Hansard record will show that this is what I said:The tax commissioner - and I table this media release - says that the ANAO has found a:... compliance dividend of $3.5 billion over three years of additional tax estimated to be raised as a result of the New Tax System ...It is tabled. The transcript is tabled on 19 August 2003. But there was a misrepresentation that day, and getting the Hansard reminded me of it.Government member - It is always instructive. - It is always instructive to get the Hansard of the day. That was the day when the member for Werriwa made a claim about the black economy. He claimed that a figure was given by the tax commissioner that the black economy is 15 per cent. I have just been reminded that the reason why I tabled the transcript that day was that the transcript came out with the tax commissioner on The World Today saying this - seeing as we are in the business of misrepresentation -  - In fact, I was asked about what I said in the House on 19 August, and I tabled the transcript and I quoted the tax commissioner. That transcript will be in the records of the House somewhere. Since we are on the question of misrepresentation and misleading the House, it has brought back to my memory why I actually tabled the transcript of the tax commissioner that day - that is, the tax commissioner had to go on The World Today.In the transcript which I tabled, he said:... it has been claimed by Mr Latham that I have confirmed a figure of the black economy of 15 per cent of GDP. I've done no such thing.People who are interested in misleading and misrepresentation in this House should not be throwing their stones in glass houses. That is why that came up on 19 August: the tax commissioner had to go out on the airwaves that day because he had been misrepresented and the House had been subsequently misled. I tabled his transcript. His transcript said that the ANAO had found a compliance dividend of $3.5 billion over three years of additional tax estimated to be raised as a result of the new tax system. I also had a lot to say about cracking down on the black economy in the taxi industry, but I will leave that aside for present purposes.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Mitchell for his question and his very strong support for the modernisation of Australian universities, the expansion of places and the increased money for those 38 publicly funded universities. In 1989, to its great credit, the Australian Labor Party then in government introduced the Higher Education Contribution Scheme, otherwise known as HECS. One of its principal architects was Professor Bruce Chapman, who is the professor of economics and social policy at the Australian National University.There was widespread opposition at the time to the introduction of HECS. Those who argued stridently against it said that it would reduce participation in Australian higher education by low-income families. It was further said that it would effectively destroy the future of higher education. The truth is that, after 14 years since the introduction of HECS, to which the Australian taxpayer contributes three-quarters of the public funds that go to universities and the students then as graduates pay a quarter back through the tax system, the size of Australian university participation has almost doubled and the proportion of Australians who hold a university degree has also doubled from nine per cent to almost 19 per cent.Recently a lot has been said, particularly by the Australian Labor Party, about proposed changes to HECS. The Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee commissioned Professor Chapman, who is also a former adviser to former Prime Minister Paul Keating, to examine all of the research that has been done in relation to the impact of HECS. Professor Chapman's report, which was released by the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee on 17 October this year, says a number of things which are very important and which I encourage Australian families, in particular, to read. For example, on page 13 of the report he says:... HECS has not deterred students from less privileged backgrounds from attending university.He also says:... the introduction of HECS did not affect the access of the disadvantaged, in terms of enrolments.In relation to changes that the government introduced to HECS in 1997, when we went to a three-tiered system where dentists, doctors, lawyers and vets paid the most for their HECS contributions and those in arts, humanities and social sciences the least, the report says:... neither the introduction of higher and differential HECS nor the lowering of the income repayment threshold after 1997 affected the share of low socioeconomic status individuals among total higher education students.This government is proposing a number of changes for Australian universities which mean in total $10½ billion of extra public investment in universities over the first 10 years. But one of the changes argued for by all of the vice-chancellors which the government has accepted is that universities for the first time will set the HECS charge from zero to a level which is a maximum 30 per cent above the current HECS levels, with no change at all for teachers and nurses. In this regard in particular, this report is very important because Professor Chapman and Dr Ryan say: ... we do not expect HECS-HELP - these are the changes proposed by this government - to adversely affect the socioeconomic composition of enrolments in Australian universities.In other words, the experts who have reviewed all of the research, who are quite dispassionate in their analysis of all of this, have said that these changes will have no adverse impact on participation in Australian higher education.I am asked about other policies. The Australian Labor Party has said in its own policy, three-quarters of which it adopted from the government's, that it proposes to reduce the HECS contributions by students in science and mathematics. That is 80,000 students in Australian universities. That is 14 per cent of all the students in the sector. The Labor Party costed that, by the way, at $43.6 million. The department of finance has costed it at $262 million. In other words, there is a black hole in Labor's economic analysis of $218 million - and of course the Labor Party frontbench laughs while the member for Werriwa sits there stern faced because he at least knows this is accurate and that he will have to take notice of the department of finance if he ever gets hold of the taxpayers' chequebook. But, interestingly for the Labor Party, Professor Chapman, in relation to this particular measure, says:... the ALP proposes moving mathematics and science courses from band 2 and band 1.In other words, they would be reducing the contribution. He says:While this will significantly reduce the cost for maths and science students, it is not expected that there will be important effects on higher education demand in these areas.So there is the Australian taxpayer presented with a Labor Party policy which is underfunded to the tune of $218 million, not according to this government but according to the department of finance. Worse still, any dispassionate analysis of it, which has been done by the vice-chancellors, finds that it will actually have no impact whatsoever on higher education outcomes. Mr Speaker, I seek leave to table the report produced by Professor Chapman. - I table that and I also table the media release from the Australian vice-chancellors.</DOC>

 - I would like to thank the member for Lilley for his question. We do not often get questions from him these days and, before I answer his question, I would just like to say that it is of course this particular government that has a very keen interest in the welfare of Australian families. That is why we introduced the family tax benefit in 2000, and at that time an extra $2 billion went to those two million families supporting 3½ million children. Indeed, when you look at the average payment now of family tax benefit, for family tax benefit part A it is $4,714 - that is the average payment per family - and for family tax benefit part B it is $1,963. So we are looking at about $6,700 as the average payment now for those families receiving either family tax benefit part B or family tax benefit part A, not to mention the unprecedented amount that we hand out in child care. The member did ask the question: are these payments slightly lower? I think that one of the successes of the Howard-Anderson government is that more people today are in employment and real wages have increased dramatically by 16 per cent since the time we came into office, from 1996 through to today. - What is happening, Member for Lilley, is that we are seeing more people earning more today because of the fine economic stewardship of this government - more jobs -  - Absolutely - we agree - and what we are seeing is that income rates have gone up and, because our family tax benefit is means tested, as average wages increase then of course the amount they receive in family tax benefit slightly goes down.

 - I thank the member for Petrie for her very strong commitment to the protection of children in schools and especially for disseminating the Humpybong state school antibullying booklet. There are many things that, as parents, we want from education for our children but perhaps none more so than to be able to send our children to a school in which we feel that our children are safe. The extent to which we are committed to protecting the transition of our children through childhood and adolescence to adulthood is one of the critical measures of a caring society. Bullying in Australian schools might once have been trivialised by some people, but this government takes it extremely seriously. Last year one in six children was bullied on a weekly basis. Almost half of Australia's schoolchildren were bullied at least once throughout last year. We also know that boys are twice as likely to be engaged in bullying than are girls and we also know, sadly, that children who are bullied are more likely to suffer from stress, to have absences from school, to have lower academic performance and, sadly, at the extreme end there is increased drug use and completed suicide, which is two to three times higher.This government takes these measures very seriously. There are a number of things that this government is now doing to see that our children are protected in schools. Firstly, the government has taken the lead in developing the National Safe Schools Framework, with the support of the Australian Democrats, to which all of the state and territory governments have now agreed. It will be a requirement when the legislation is introduced next year for the next four years of Australian government funding for schools that every school in this country - government schools and non-government schools - have a systematic plan established and readily available to parents to show how they propose to recognise, prevent and deal with bullying. The government is investing $4½ million in specific measures to assist in the prevention and management of bullying. It includes $3 million in the first two years for the professional development and training of teachers to make sure that they are well across the appropriate way to deal with bullying in school. One million dollars will be invested in specific programs to evaluate the effectiveness of any initiatives that are undertaken. This is obviously an emotive area, but we want to make sure also that money and effort that are invested in this area actually deliver the outcomes that we need. Three hundred thousand dollars is being invested with the Australian Principals Professional Development Council, and a resource kit will be delivered to every school in Australia in relation to advising them how best to deal with bullying. The government are also investing $200,000 in the Bullying. No Way! web site, which is currently attracting 500 visits a day. As I announced last year, the government are also strongly committed to supporting and expanding programs for values in schools, because in the end, as talented as we want our children to be, it is character that really pays off.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Dickson for his question. This matter, of course, was raised yesterday. Currently, an organisation cannot be listed for terrorist purposes unless it has been expressly identified in or pursuant to a decision of the United Nations Security Council. - The requirement to wait for a Security Council listing, of course, prevents Australia from acting independently to list a terrorist organisation, even though it might be in our national interest. The requirement is a result of changes to counter-terrorism legislation originally proposed as a result of amendments that were insisted upon by the opposition. There is currently a bill before the Senate - the Criminal Code Amendment (Terrorist Organisations) Bill 2003 - which is seeking to remove the requirement, but we have indications that the opposition will not support that measure unless there are further changes made to it. The fact is that the government has previously introduced legislation to allow specifically the listing, on a one-off basis, of particular organisations where they have not been identified as a terrorist organisation by the United Nations. We think the government of the day ought to be able to act quickly, effectively and decisively when there is a need to protect the Australian community.Let me make it very clear, in relation to this issue, that any proposal that involves the introduction of legislation to specifically identify terrorist organisations is a second-best option because it is not timely. The fact is that you can, by passing the legislation that is in the Senate, ensure that the decision can be made in a timely way, in an effective way, and still be subject to parliamentary scrutiny by way of disallowance. But that is not a course that the opposition wants to follow. Now, it is obvious that, when the government have received information that these issues have to be addressed, there is only one option available to us if we are going to deal with it. But it is the second-best option - I make that point again. The government has received advice that a Pakistani organisation, Lashkar-e-Taiba, also known as LET, has links with Australia, and therefore does pose a threat to Australia and Australian interests, and is known to have conducted a series of terrorist attacks resulting in dozens of deaths in the subcontinent. There have also been concerns expressed about the military arm of Hamas, and many members would be aware of the recent terrorist activities, which include shootings and bombings. While there have been no direct linkages with Australia and Hamas, it is a matter of prudence or - in terms that I have used before - `more abundant caution' to take action in relation to this organisation as well. As a result of this, the government will be moving to amend the terrorist organisations listing provisions in part 5.3 of the Criminal Code Act. The purpose of the bill will be to create a basis for identification and listing of Hamas and Lashkar-e-Taiba as terrorist organisations under the Australian law if a minister is satisfied that either or both of those organisations are engaged in terrorist organisations. The government will move promptly to deal with this matter. I will give notice today of an intention to bring that legislation into the House tomorrow and we will seek passage through all stages. But let me just make it clear that that is dependent always upon the parliament sitting at a relevant time when notification needs to be taken of an organisation, and of course it is also pertinent that you need to have the Senate sitting at the same time if you are going to deal with it quickly - and the fact is the Senate is not sitting. - In order to obtain quick, prompt and timely action in relation to this matter -  - In order to be able to deal with this matter in a timely fashion, there are a number of issues that have to be dealt with. We need to obtain agreement of a majority of states and territories - at least four - quickly and effectively. In other words, we need to know they are not going to stand in our way in relation to that. Not only do we need to ensure prompt passage through this chamber, which we can secure, but we need to ensure that in another place it comes together quickly and in another place the practices whereby minority parties can have matters referred off to parliamentary committees that might take an interminable amount of time to deal with are abrogated -   - They are the sorts of issues that it will be seen potentially can significantly delay the identification of a terrorist body on which we have that advice. So I want to make it very clear that, although we see this as the second-best option, there is the potential for the way in which this is addressed to make it abundantly clear the sorts of difficulties that any government experiences in trying to list organisations of concern such as Hamas and Lashkar-e-Taiba.</DOC>

 - It is the case that this matter was raised with the former Attorney and -  - I said `and' - and that a letter was sent to me early in the period in which I was appointed drawing that matter to my attention. I understand the former Attorney had orally advised the shadow minister that the government did not see that as an appropriate measure in this instance. I have a letter which I intend to send to the shadow minister.Opposition members - Oh! - I do. - Let me make it abundantly clear what the government's position is. We think it is appropriate that the decision to list a terrorist organisation is made by the government, rather than a court, as the government has responsibility for ensuring the security of Australians and the information and the expertise with which to make a fully informed decision. Further, a government can act much more quickly than a court in relation to these matters and a government, at the end of the day, is far more accountable than a court in relation to any decision that it takes.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Fadden for his question and make this point: I do not think there has been very much focus in this parliament on the intelligence relationship with France, or on almost any other facet of our relationship with France, on the grounds that there does not appear to have been, in my view, sufficient interest. The fact is that the Brigitte case does bring into the open the very successful cooperation that Australia has with France on security and intelligence issues, including those in relation to very specific terrorism matters. The information on Brigitte provided by the French authorities enabled Australia's security and intelligence agencies to take action to investigate his activities here in Australia and those of his associates and to prevent any potential threat he presented to the Australian community. This illustrates very clearly to anybody the value of the intelligence relationship that we have - and we have had for many years - with the French.Australian intelligence and security agencies share a strong and longstanding relationship with their French counterparts. There are regular exchanges of information and intelligence, and there have been for a long time. Information sharing with our partners, including France, gives us the international dragnet we need to disrupt terrorist networks and activities. France has also been a valuable partner for us in supporting the war against terrorism not only generally but also very specifically in the Asia-Pacific region. For example, France is helping to build the capacity of countries in South-East Asia to fight terrorism in areas such as antiterrorist financing, border management and intelligence gathering.We also work very closely with France in relevant multilateral forums, including the recently established G8 Counter-Terrorism Action Group, which France currently chairs and of which Australia is a standing member. The second meeting of this group is to take place in a couple of weeks time on 17 November in Paris. It is going to focus on counter-terrorism capacity building in the countries of South-East Asia. So that is another very clear illustration of how closely we are working with the French government. Australia has participated in a number of regional coordination meetings of the Counter-Terrorism Action Group to discuss counter-terrorism needs, and in October there was a meeting in Indonesia. Just in case some people think that there has not been a sufficiently close relationship with France on counter-terrorism intelligence, the points that I have made today illustrate that, on the contrary, it is a very close and successful relationship, obviously demonstrated and brought into the open by the success of the Brigitte case.</DOC>

 - The advice I have is that the government had no information about Mr Brigitte at the time of his arrival in Australia on 16 May. -  - As I previously advised, as far as Australian authorities are aware, the French authorities advised us about Mr Brigitte as soon as they established a possible link with Australia. The French agencies, as advised by the head of ASIO last night to a Senate estimates committee, have been central to the progress of our investigations here in Australia. As I made clear in my answer yesterday, it is a nonsense to suggest that countries share details in respect of their own citizens without good reason. We would not accept that in relation to Australians, and most other countries would not accept that in relation to their own citizens. I simply make the point again that the French authorities advised us about Mr Brigitte as soon as they had established a possible link with Australia.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Gilmore for her question and acknowledge all of the work that she, as one of the most energetic members in the area and, indeed, in the parliament, does in that capacity. As the House would be aware, construction in housing has been very strong in the past year, with about 170,000 dwellings compared with an average of about 150,000 dwellings per year in the 1990s. Indeed, investor finance in the housing sector has risen quite considerably.As I have said on a number of occasions, with the increase in house prices, people outside the market find that a difficulty, although people who own houses no doubt find that a source of accumulating wealth. I noticed today that, in light of these figures, ACOSS has claimed that tax law should be changed to discourage investor housing on the basis that investment in housing by investors was working against renters. I want to make it absolutely clear to the House that investor finance in housing does not work against renters; in fact, it works in favour of renters.One can be critical of investment in housing by investors because of its effect on price, but one cannot be critical on the grounds of its effect on rents. One of the consequences of investment in housing is that rents have been falling in Australia. According to the CPI, they fell 0.7 per cent in real terms up to the September quarter of 2003 and over the past two years have fallen 1.6 per cent. TD Securities and the Melbourne Institute estimate that rents in Melbourne have fallen 11 per cent in the five months since May 2003. The point I want to underline is that that actually works in favour of renters.We do have empirical evidence that making the taxation treatment of investor housing more onerous works against renters. It was tried in 1985. In the two years from June 1985 to June 1987, when the Keating government changed the taxation treatment of investor housing, rents across Australia rose by 37 per cent. During that period, the average rent for a three-bedroom house in Sydney rose by 57.5 per cent. So the one thing we know is that changing tax treatment to work against investor housing - whatever effect it has on house prices - most certainly works against renters. We also know, of course, that the poorest people in the community tend to be renters. So I say to ACOSS that its proposal is not going to help renters - whatever other effects it might have. I notice, of course - and I have informed the House of this before - that it was in fact Labor policy, for 12 hours, to change the tax treatment in relation to investor housing, but sanity prevailed. The Leader of the Opposition repudiated the member for Werriwa on his second day in the job, after the member had raised that possibility on Lateline the night before.</DOC>

 - First of all let me make a couple of points about this, because the honourable member raises a number of issues in his question. Mr Brigitte was not known to Australian authorities, in a security context, until the French government advised us. Of course, they would not necessarily advise us unless they had some reason to believe that Brigitte would have some association with Australia. I would have thought that was a fairly obvious point. When the French realised he had gone to Australia they had some concerns, about which they advised us. Subsequent to that, they raised even graver concerns. On the basis of that, he was, as you know, detained and deported. -  - A fusillade of insults comes from the Leader of the Opposition and his backbench. I understand that Brigitte was issued an electronic travel authority visa in France on 10 May. Of course, we were not informed about any concerns relating to Brigitte until 22 September. The initial concerns expressed by the French were enhanced when the French themselves had more information about him. - The Leader of the Opposition becomes more exercised as the polls go down. - A good week in the polls and you would be a bit quieter. I suppose you become a bit statesmanlike then, do you? - I am making the point that, obviously, as the French develop particular concerns about particular people and have more information about them and that information may be relevant to Australia, they pass that information on. I would have thought as a matter of fact that there was a very obvious point here, and that is that the cooperation between Australia and France in relation to Brigitte clearly worked. It clearly has been successful. He is now back in France and in a cell and that of course is as a result of the cooperation between Australia and France. I would say that was a pretty good outcome, mon ami.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Solomon for his question. Obviously, representing the very important part of Australia in the Northern Territory that is the closest to South-East Asia, he takes a very keen interest in what we are doing in actively engaging South-East Asian countries.  - I should indicate at the outset that, following the conclusion of negotiations with Thailand and the announcement of the free trade agreement with Thailand, Australia is in the interesting position of being the only developed country that has negotiated free trade agreements with two of the ASEAN countries. The opposition should recognise and reflect on that in light of some of the comments that some members of the opposition run with in regard to our relationship with East Asia and particularly South-East Asia. We now have a free trade agreement in place with Singapore and with Thailand, and a closer economic partnership agreement in place with the 10 ASEAN countries. - Also, interestingly, during the visit to Australia by President Hu Jintao of China, we signed the economic framework with China. But the member for Solomon asked about the relevance of this agreement for agriculture. Of course, agriculture was at the centre of the negotiations and will significantly benefit, particularly with regard to exports out of the Northern Territory, where there will be significant reductions in the tariff on live cattle exports and on exports of fresh fruit and vegetables that go out of the Northern Territory into many South-East Asian markets.   - Overall, for the information of the member for Rankin, more than 50 per cent of the 5,000 tariff lines that the Thais have had in place will be eliminated completely on entry into force. There will be new opportunities, particularly for the dairy sector - and we know that that industry has been struggling in recent times. We will see an immediate increase of additional quota for skim milk powder out of Australia of 2,200 tonnes for the Australian dairy industry, and the elimination of tariffs on four major lines of dairy products. We will see the elimination of tariffs on wheat, barley, rye and oats. Importantly, into a South-East Asian market, we will see the elimination of tariffs and tariff rate quotas on rice. It was a great achievement being able to export rice back into Japan; we are now going to be able to export rice back into Thailand from Australia, all as a result of the negotiations on this agreement.Industry representatives have been quite glowing in their praise of the outcome of this agreement. SunRice, the Australian rice exporter, has said:This free trade agreement saw the removal of all quotas for Australian rice exports to Thailand. Australia's rice industry, a strong advocate for the removal of all restrictions to free trade, welcomes the agreement as a step in the right direction.Allan Burgess, who heads up the dairy industry in Australia, has said:It offers some immediate commercial advantages for the Australian dairy industry; it offers an opportunity to share in the growth of one of our most dynamic neighbours ... There has also been some enlightened comment from the spokesman from the Australian Labor Party, Senator Conroy. Senator Conroy has said:Labor welcomes this free trade agreement with Thailand. It will be of significant benefit to many Australian industries, including ... some of our rural and agricultural producers.Also on The Insiders program on the weekend Senator Conroy went as far as saying that, in other words -  - because the WTO has moved onto a bit of a slower track, he supports the government's policy of competitive liberalisation and pursuing bilateral agreements as we are. He can see where there are going to be benefits delivered to Australian exporters, which is much more than his predecessor was prepared to concede in that portfolio responsibility.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Hume for his question. I can inform him and members of the House that unemployment in regional and rural Australia has fallen below 6 per cent for the first time in 21 years. Not since Just a Dash won the Melbourne Cup in 1981 has unemployment in regional and rural Australia been below 6 per cent. The Australian regional labour market survey has indicated that in the September quarter of this year the unemployment rate in non-metropolitan Australia was 5.9 per cent. So, despite the drought, almost three-quarters of regional Australia has recorded a drop in unemployment over the past 12 months, while employment has indeed increased by more than 70,000. This is good news, even though labour force figures can fluctuate from month to month.If you take the area covered by the member for Hume's electorate, back at the height of the Labor Party's recession unemployment in that region was almost 12 per cent - 11.9 per cent. Today, it is half that rate at 6 per cent. This is not confined to electorates which are held by coalition members. I see that the Newcastle Herald just a few days ago described the unemployment rate in the Hunter region as `a beautiful set of numbers'. In the year to September 2003, employment in the Hunter region was up by 30,000 - some 12.8 per cent. Unemployment was down by 1.1 per cent to 6 per cent and the participation rate was up by three percentage points to 58.7 per cent - another example of the good economic management of this government and another example of the benefits of the reforms that this government has brought about, including reforms in the workplace relations system. We are not satisfied with these rates; we continue to build on them. That is why we are providing some $100 million under the Sustainable Regions Program to provide improved and increased job programs and opportunities for people living in regional and rural Australia.</DOC>

We have committed additional resources to this area, and I can inform the honourable member for New England that I will talk to the Minister for Family and Community Services and, if there is an extension needed to achieve the goals the honourable member speaks of, I will have a look at that. It is in no way the policy of this government to in any way deny people with disabilities the opportunity to be engaged in meaningful work. I continue to choose to describe the sheltered workshop concept in that fashion because it is better understood in the community. It is our desire to support sheltered workshops. I will certainly examine what has been put forward and, if any changes are needed in the interests of properly implementing the government's policy, those changes will be made.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Dunkley for his question. I indicate to him that a consequence of what the Victorian government and, in particular, Minister Hulls in that state are threatening is the re-establishment of a separate workplace relations system - indeed, a dual system in the state of Victoria. A consequence of this would be that it would add unnecessary cost and complexity for employers in Victoria and would cost jobs for Victorian workers. As I said in answer to a previous question from the member for Hume, this government is all about jobs and reducing unemployment in this country. The Victorian government would be much better off directing the money that it would cost to establish a separate dual workplace relations system into essential services in the state of Victoria, like hospitals and schools. I have told Mr Hulls, the minister in Victoria, that I intend to introduce legislation into this parliament that would avoid complexity and cost and preserve jobs in Victoria. I urge him and the Labor Party in this place to get behind and support this legislation.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Shortland for her question. I also thank the member for Mackellar for her excellent point of order. I am aware of some significant issues with the supply of doctors on the Central Coast of New South Wales, because the member for Dobell invited me up to the area just the other day to learn at first hand what some of these problems are. I am aware from discussions with doctors on the Central Coast that in some areas there has been a 40 per cent increase in population over the last couple of decades and, at the same time, a 20 per cent decline in the number of doctors. I am aware that there are significant problems on the Central Coast. I am fully aware of these matters.As members opposite should know, the government has already taken significant steps to boost the medical work force: there are 234 additional medical student places per year for the next four years and there are 150 additional GP training places a year for the next four years. I want to make two points in response to the member for Shortland. The first is that I have more faith in the doctors on the Central Coast than she does and I do not believe that any of those Central Coast doctors would ever turn away any emergency patients. They would not turn away emergency patients; they would not turn away patients in real need. The final point is that we will not adopt Labor's policy because it will not work.</DOC>

The Melbourne Cup is a substantial event that not only attracts tens of thousands of people to Melbourne but, importantly, also is broadcast around the world. In fact, in Hong Kong the only race day of the year that is changed is today, when the races are brought forward from Wednesday to Tuesday so that they can broadcast the Melbourne Cup directly to thousands of people.   - Yes. That is a clear illustration of how important events are in sending a message to the world that Australia is open for tourism. The member for Moncrieff raises the Indy car festival. I know the member for Moncrieff threw himself into the celebrations around the Indy car festival! It is a substantial event for the Gold Coast. More than 300,000 tickets to the Indy car races were sold this year, and visitors spent an average of $180 per head on the Gold Coast, which is a substantial -  - You will be in the obituaries soon, son. - Couple that with the substantial Rugby World Cup, for which more than 50,000 people travelled to Melbourne last weekend, and we find that events are a substantial form of not just entertainment but investment in infrastructure, investment in jobs and investment in the reputation of the country. Australia is reaping the benefits of that at the moment by holding international events like the Rugby World Cup, the Melbourne Cup and the Indy car festival.</DOC>

Let me make this point: every year, thanks to the government's private health insurance rebate -  - some $350 million more goes to dental services.

 - I thank the member for Eden-Monaro for his question and for his keen interest in innovation. He chairs the parliamentary committee which recently released the Riding the innovation wave report. The Howard government remains committed to Backing Australia's Ability and assisting businesses and individuals in turning good ideas into great products. The business community have responded to that by boosting their investment in R&amp;D by 13 per cent in the last 12 months. That means that spending by businesses on R&amp;D is now at record levels, at some $5.5 billion. This government continues to support those businesses through a range of programs. This year alone I have awarded over $150 million to 800 companies in Australia.Other companies have drawn on the R&amp;D tax concession. This is to help companies and individuals with good ideas to turn out great products. There is no better example of that than the company I visited last week in Perth called Almos Systems, a company that started some 15 years ago with three people in a garage and these days employs almost 50 people, turning over millions of dollars. That company has made significant advances in the area of weather forecasting, particularly as it relates to airfields and airports, and has done that to some degree with significant assistance from the federal government through programs that we administer.I was asked if I am aware of alternative policies. We know that Labor's approach to health is to cut the private health insurance rebate. We know that their approach to child care is to cut the baby bonus. We also know that Labor's approach to regional Australia is to cut the diesel fuel rebate. It is therefore no surprise that Labor's response to innovation is to cut the R&amp;D tax concession. - I hear the groan from the opposite side, so perhaps for the member for Rankin I need to quote Senator Kim Carr, who said:I'm going to look at whether the research-and-development tax concession is in fact effective.If that is not enough of an alarm bell for Australian industry, that statement was further endorsed by the member for Werriwa -  - who said that the R&amp;D tax concession `is not a good outlay, not a good policy and not an efficient strategy'. I table both those statements. The member for Werriwa and the Labor Party can explain to those businesses - some 4,700 of them - who use the tax concession why they are going to cut it. They can also explain to the small businesses who use the tax offset why they are going to cut that. Really, what we see here is further proof that the Labor Party are anti-business, anti-economic growth and anti-jobs growth.</DOC>

 - I am very happy to answer this question but I regret to say that I do not think it is a sincere question, because, whilst it is true that household debt has risen, household assets have risen even more. Today, for every dollar of debt households have, they have $2 in financial assets and around $6 in total assets. Why do I say that I do not think the question was sincere? It is because the member for Werriwa was quoted on this exact point on 1 April 2002 in the Sydney Morning Herald. TheSydney Morning Herald says:... Latham isn't worried about debt. Like all good capitalists, he thinks our increased debt has been put to good use. 'Debt is always relative to assets' ... 'In the mid-1980s, Australians held $4 in assets for every $1 in household income. Today they hold $6.50 in assets for every $1.'He even believes that much of the growth in levels of credit card debt has been put to productive use ...That was in April 2002. I know it is unfair of me to refer to what the member for Werriwa has said in the past, because in the past he has had a position on every single issue; he doesn't know whether he is Arthur or Martha. The truth is that he is both Arthur and Martha.He asks me this question: is household debt of concern? Well, household debt has to be seen in comparison to household assets, and household assets have risen. Household debt has risen also but, as he himself notes, the assets to debt ratio is six to one. When one looks at the question of servicing that household debt, when one looks at the flows on the stock - the debt and the assets are the stock and the servicing and the income are the flows - indeed the servicing rates are also lower than they have been in the past as well. This is a point that has been made by none other than the member for Werriwa himself, and on this question he was right in April 2002. </DOC>

 - First, I thank the honourable member for Solomon for this question. I know that, as a member of parliament for, amongst other parts of the Northern Territory, Darwin, he is very strongly committed to a strong border protection policy. So are the government as a whole, and the government's border protection policy has been spectacularly successful, bearing in mind that we have only had, I understand, two illegal boat arrivals since August 2001. The illegal boat arrival which occurred the day before yesterday is only the second since August 2001, and that simply illustrates a number of things. First of all, it illustrates that the government have been very strong on border protection. It also reflects the fact that we implemented what is sometimes referred to as the Pacific solution: we made it clear to people that if they try to come to our country illegally we have an offshore processing centre in Nauru. That is an initiative which has been mutually beneficial to Australia and Nauru. The government of Nauru and the President of Nauru, President Harris, are both happy with that arrangement, and of course we are happy with it because it contributes to strong border protection policies.The third thing is that we have had excellent cooperation from the countries in our region and, in particular, we have had excellent cooperation from Indonesia. In 2002 the Indonesian foreign minister and I instigated what is now known as the Bali process, and in April this year we co-chaired the second Bali Ministerial Conference on People-Smuggling, which was attended by 28 ministers from 32 countries in the Asia-Pacific region. The Bali process members have been promoting increased regional information exchange, legislative development and law enforcement cooperation. Final preparations are being made for a legislation workshop to be held next week in Malaysia. Further than that, over the next few months Bali ad hoc experts groups will also be holding workshops on return issues, identity verification, asylum management, the targeting of key people smugglers and trafficking.I think yesterday's arrival does underscore how this type of regional cooperation - in which, of course, this government has played a leading role with the Indonesian government - is vital in our efforts to secure the ongoing reduction in the ruthless and cold-hearted activities of the transnational organised criminals engaged in people-smuggling. - I note that the Leader of the Opposition is interjecting. I was asked whether there were any alternative views, and there are. The Leader of the Opposition's policy is to scrap the arrangement with Nauru, amongst other things. He will now apparently oppose - having once supported - the policy of excision and will also have a totally confused and incomprehensible policy in relation to the detention of illegal migrants. He proposes that somehow this mishmash of policies is going to lead to a stronger border protection policy. Anybody with any commonsense would know that the Labor Party is not only deeply divided on these issues but weak on these issues. The simple fact is that this government has been successful because it has been strong and determined to take difficult decisions. The Labor Party is weak on border protection and does not have the courage or the strength to make sure that appropriate measures are taken to enforce an effective policy. </DOC>

 - That sort of question is enough to reaffirm your faith in the Almighty! It really reaffirms my faith in the Almighty; there is a god. To think we have the member for Corio asking such a question! I am aware of a lot of things about the views of the Reserve Bank, but I am also aware of one other central issue in this - that is, the Australian public will never forget the 17 per cent interest rates under the Australian Labor Party.The reality is that the average new mortgage which is now being written in Australia is around $190,000. On a loan of this size, interest payments are now $585 a month lower than they were in 1996. That is a product of this government having pursued policies - almost always in the teeth of vigorous opposition from the Labor Party - to reduce inflation, lift employment, strengthen the budget position, increase competition in the Australian economy and further liberalise the Australian labour market. The strength of the Australian economy, which is the envy of most other developed countries, is a product of those policies over the last 7½ years.The reality is that Australians are better off now than they were in 1996. Their mortgage payments are, on average, almost $600 a month lower, their wages are higher and they have more jobs, so our unemployment rate is lower. The international fiscal position of this country, where we have a level of government debt to annual wealth generation that is the envy of other countries, means that this country is being put on a sound fiscal basis. All I can say to those who sit opposite is this: keep asking us questions about interest rates, and we will keep reminding you of what the Australian people think of your record, when you were in government, on the issue of interest rates.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Petrie for her question and her interest in the state of the Australian economy. The International Monetary Fund does what is called an article IV assessment of all of its members' economies on an annual basis. As a result of that review, it has a practice of releasing what is called a public information notice. On 22 October this year, it published that information notice comparing the Australian economy with the other economies of the developed and developing world. In that report, the IMF said: Australia's economy has continued to perform remarkably well over the past year, despite encountering major adverse shocks, including persistent weakness in the global economic environment and a sustained, severe drought at home.It went on to say: Executive Directors commended the continued strong performance of the Australian economy in the face of persistent weakness in external demand and a severe drought at home. They attributed Australia's ability to generate robust economic growth with low inflation to the enhanced resilience of the economy, brought about, in turn, by steadfast pursuit of prudent macroeconomic policies and structural reforms ...As the Prime Minister said, as the IMF found, prudent macroeconomic management and structural reforms have made the Australian economy resilient in the face of a US recession, an Asian financial crisis, the worst drought in 100 years and the SARS epidemic environment. The Australian economy has continued to grow in the face of all of those difficulties because this government had the foresight and the commitment to put in place the economic reform which would strengthen it. As the Prime Minister said, this government was opposed by the opportunism of the Australian Labor Party every single step of the way. When we decided to balance the budget, the Australian Labor Party opposed it. When we decided to reform the taxation system, the Australian Labor Party opposed it. When we decided to reform Australia's industrial relations law, the Australian Labor Party opposed it. The Australia Labor Party has stood against all of those economic reforms, and they are the reforms that have made Australia stronger.As the Prime Minister said, one of the consequences of that is that interest rates today are much lower than they were when this government came into office. Interest rates were increased by 0.25 per cent of one per cent today by a decision of the Reserve Bank this morning. If that should flow through to the variable mortgage interest rate, that would take that rate to 6.8 per cent. That is still lower than the average interest rate under this government, which, since it came to office, has seen average home mortgage interest rates at 7.15 per cent. The average home mortgage interest rate over the 13 years of the Labor government was 12 per cent. That was the average. Whilst an increase of 0.25 of one per cent would, on a $190,000 mortgage, increase repayments by $30 a month, those repayments today are $585 a month lower than they would have been if the interest rate which this government inherited when it came to office were still in place. In other words, instead of it being a saving of $615 a month, it is now a saving of $585 a month.Australia is in a position where it has continued to grow, with low inflation, with an economy which has outlasted a US recession and with - rare amongst the economies of the developed world - a budget which is in surplus. The US budget is not in surplus. The British budget is not in surplus. The French budget is not in surplus, nor the German budget. I have not looked up the economies of Mali and Peru, which the Labor Party used to like to compare itself to, but I doubt that they are in surplus. This government has put Australia in a strong financial position. We have continuing growth, and it is economic reform which will keep us there.  </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Werriwa for his question. Australia is blessed with a very strong economy that has been the envy of the world for the last four years. During the Asian financial crisis, when seven out of our top 10 trading partners were in recession or depression, Australia had one of the fastest growing economies in the world. When other economies are in recession or in severe financial downturn, they have to reduce interest rates to try to stimulate economic growth. They have to do it because they are at the bottom of the economic cycle. Australian small businesses are grateful that we have had a strong economy. They are grateful for the fact that we have inoculated the Australian economy by undertaking the structural reform that the Treasurer talked about. That is why Australia has had a benign interest environment for the last 12 to 18 months. Small business will never forget the interest rates in the 1990s under the Labor Party. They will never forget when their overdraft rate was 22 per cent and small business failure was at record levels. The Labor Party opposed structural reforms that we undertook on taxation and, in the 12 months after the introduction of the new tax system, 47,000 net new small businesses opened their doors. The environment for small business has never been better. The 25 basis point increase today clearly illustrates that the Australian economy is getting faster and is growing more, and small business see that as a damn good thing. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Fadden for his question. I would simply say that I welcome the passage through this House, and I hope we have a speedy passage in the other chamber, of amendments to the Criminal Code Act dealing with a number of terrorist organisations. I hope the fact that we have now had to deal directly with three organisations of concern on a case by case basis demonstrates the need for legislation that will enable the executive to make decisions without having to come back to the parliament with all the difficulty that that occasions. I note that in relation to these matters some people observe that that does not provide for a democratic review of these matters, but the bill before the Senate back in June does provide for disallowance of any decision by the executive. The democratic processes operate just as much in relation to a regulatory environment as they do in relation to a statute. - It does enable the parliament to review and to take out the regulations - and to do so quickly, if it wishes. Let me just say that the purpose of legislation of this character is demonstrable in terms of the impact that it can have on terrorist bodies and organisations, because the legislation proscribing a body enables us to access the offence provisions in relation to any individual that directs the activities of a terrorist organisation. It enables us to activate the offence, effectively, of recruiting people to a terrorist organisation - including through exhortations through the media. It enables us to constitute as an offence under law the receiving of training from any such organisation or the providing of such training - including administrative, technical, strategic or military skills development. It is an offence to receive funds and to make funds available to a terrorist organisation. It is an offence to provide support and resources to such an organisation. That is designed to ensure that such a body cannot get the sorts of materials that it might need to commit a terrorist act. It is an offence to be a member of a terrorist organisation. The penalties that are involved are very considerable: up to 15 to 25 years. It is important to recognise that the laws do not preclude people from supporting or contributing to legitimate charitable, religious or ideological causes but are designed to deal specifically with terrorist organisations. The objective is to provide the public with information about them to enable them to make informed choices about the ways in which they support such bodies. The listing also makes it clear internationally that Australia is not a haven for terrorist networks or their supporters. The importance of legislation of this character is, I think, beyond doubt. We need to have the capacity to deal with significant terrorist organisations that have established - or might establish - linkages into Australia in particular. In six months we have had three bodies that have come to notice. There may well be more. The capacity to deal with those issues speedily is something that we still seek.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Paterson for his question. As others have indicated, he does a very fine job for the people of his district. First of all, I think it is very important that people understand the intellectual point here. -  - I know for you to understand an intellectual point is but a dream, but it is no easy matter to have a terrorist organisation listed by the United Nations Security Council 1267 committee. There are two reasons why it is difficult to do that. First of all, there has to be a consensus among all members of the Security Council on the existence of a link between a terrorist organisation and al-Qaeda or the Taliban. That is the first requirement. Secondly, there are obvious practical difficulties in relation to sharing intelligence among members of the Security Council, outside of the existing intelligence relationships that they have. I think honourable members would understand that, particularly those members who have been involved in the processes of government. The 1267 committee's capacity, therefore, to list organisations - and for those organisations to be proscribed under our legislation - is extremely limited. In some cases the 1267 committee will not provide a consensus, because one or two members of the Security Council may have a particular view about a particular organisation which is not shared by other members of the Security Council. It might equally be that a member of the Security Council - and there are cases in point here - has very specific intelligence but is not prepared to share that intelligence. This puts a great limitation on getting listings through the 1267 committee.To date there have only been 13 organisations that Australia has been able to proscribe under its legislation pursuant to a listing in the 1267 committee. The 1267 committee has not been able to form a consensus on listing known terrorist agencies such as Hamas - as we know from discussion in the parliament - Hezbollah or Lashkar-e-Taiba, which has been a matter of discussion in the parliament and more broadly this year. The only alternative, as the House knows, to proscribing a terrorist group which has been listed by the 1267 committee is through the recalling of parliament and the enacting of specific legislation. As we know only too well, that is a very cumbersome procedure. It does prevent quick and independent action to deal with possible threats to Australia, as there are terrorist organisations which are not related to al-Qaeda or the Taliban as well as geopolitical factors at work which can make 1267 committee listing simply impossible.Let me give the House a couple of examples. There is an organisation called Mujaheddin-e Khalq. This is an anti-Iranian group which fought alongside Saddam Hussein's troops against the coalition of the willing and has been closely associated over a long period of time with Saddam Hussein's regime. We cannot proscribe that organisation in Australia because we could not get a 1267 committee listing for it. Another example is the Palestinian organisation Islamic Jihad. It is manifestly a vicious terrorist organisation. It is one of the greatest threats to peace in the Middle East - to the implementation of the road map between Israel and the Palestinians - yet we could not get it listed through the 1267 committee process. Or you could take the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam - the Tamil Tigers. Again, it is not possible to get the Tamil Tigers listed through the 1267 process. - The Leader of the Opposition, as is his wont, interjects. It was the opposition that insisted that within the legislation we had to have the written requirement that the United Nations had to authorise the proscription of an organisation.</DOC>

 - In reply to the Leader of the Opposition, let me make it clear from the beginning that I do not accept for a moment his categorisation of the briefing that he received from my minister. I endeavour, in accordance with the proper conventions that apply in this place, to extend appropriate courtesies to the Leader of the Opposition, and they should not be repaid by cheap abuse of my colleagues. That is the first thing I want to say. As to the rest of the question asked by the Leader of the Opposition, let me make one thing crystal clear to this parliament. It would not have been necessary for regulations to have been made yesterday excising inter alia Melville Island from the migration zone of Australia -  - I will take up from where I was interrupted by the Leader of the Opposition. The action taken yesterday would not have been necessary if the opposition had not combined with the Democrats on three occasions over the last year to make it more difficult to protect Australia's borders from illegal immigration arrivals. That is what has happened. On three occasions, the Labor Party and the Australian Democrats have combined -  - The regulations were first made and gazetted on 7 June last year. They were tabled on 19 June last year. They were disallowed by the Senate on 19 June. We introduced the Migration Legislation Amendment (Further Border Protection Measures) Bill 2002 on 20 June. It was rejected by the Senate twice. So on three occasions the Labor Party, under the direction of the Leader of the Opposition, has acted to make it easier for illegal immigrants to gain access to this country. That is what the Leader of the Opposition has done and no amount of obfuscation can alter that fundamental fact.  - As to the exact circumstances and the precise status of the people concerned, that is a matter that is still being assessed on the basis of interviews that are being carried out. When I am in a position to provide some further information to the Australian public, I or one of my ministers will do so. - But there is one thing that does not need any further assessment and that is that on three occasions over the last year the Labor Party has acted to make it easier -  - The issue is about the Labor Party. - Yes.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Dickson for his question on this issue, about which I know there is a good deal of public interest. I might say by way of preface that it would be inappropriate for me, as the particular matter may come before a court, to comment on the details of the particular case. I am concerned that the Family Court may not have jurisdiction to set aside binding financial agreements, where those agreements may undermine the legitimate rights of third parties. The provisions in the Family Law Act which were introduced in 2002 allow people to make binding financial agreements before and during marriage and after separation. That was seen to be a very useful addition to the law. The intention of the provisions was to allow people to make agreements about the distribution of their property after a relationship breakdown and to settle their affairs without the need for court intervention. That is obviously a very desirable outcome as well. But I do not think anybody thought that provisions of that sort would be used to defeat those who might be seeking to exercise their legitimate expectations of repayment in relation to loans or other matters. The government therefore has commenced the preparation urgently of amendments to the Family Law Act, in light of the ASIC approach and the reference by a court, to look at the court being able to deal with applications by third parties to set aside agreements where they might defeat or prejudice those third party interests. Those amendments, which are being considered, should ensure that a court would be able to look at property moved out of reach of third parties under those forms of agreements. That is what the court is requesting that it be able to do. I hope that the amendments can be introduced to the Family Law Amendment Bill that is before the Senate in the current sittings. Following the established procedures which are necessary, I am trying to deal with those issues as quickly as possible.</DOC>

 - May I thank the honourable member for Kalgoorlie for his question. It recognises the enormous importance that the government are placing upon quarantine and quarantine awareness and also on beefing up our front-line border defences against unwanted pests and diseases. The government have invested $600 million over four years to massively increase the surveillance and the intervention of passengers and freight on arrival in this country. For instance, mail inspections have risen from five per cent when Labor was in office up to 100 per cent. We now have 46 dog detector teams working around the country and 64 X-ray machines, including a range that are able to detect biological substances; there has been a massive increase in staff numbers; and of course we have toughened the fines and penalties for those who breach these laws. It is also important to have an effective awareness campaign so that the public recognise that quarantine does matter and that they have a role in ensuring that unwanted pests and diseases do not come to this country. The federal government have also launched an exceptionally effective `Quarantine matters!' advertising campaign. It has been the most successful campaign we have ever had on quarantine. It has significantly increased public awareness of quarantine issues. Eight out of 10 Australians now say that they have an understanding of the importance of quarantine, and 90 per cent have picked up on the quarantine awareness campaign theme that it takes only one item not being declared to potentially decimate an entire agricultural industry or a reliant community.Members opposite have been very critical that the government have chosen to use Steve Irwin as the front for this particular campaign. His high international status has certainly provided a magnificent boost to this campaign. They have been particularly critical of the fact that we have paid him a fee to undertake that activity. The fee was a concessional fee because Steve Irwin cares about these matters, but it was $175,000. That was the fee that was paid to Steve Irwin as a concessional fee to undertake these services for a year. It is quite interesting to note that Steve chose to use this money to build a koala hospital in Queensland. Instead of ridiculing, you would think the opposition members would have been touched by that generosity as a further demonstration of his genuine commitment to helping with quarantine measures and to preserving Australia's wildlife. -  - Mr Speaker - An opposition member - Is there more? - Much more. The opposition has been very critical about the fact that the government has used a high-profile figure like Steve Irwin to front this particular campaign. One of the interesting things that occurred to me with all this criticism is that you would think that governments had never used a high-profile person before to launch a particular campaign or that they had never paid a fee to an individual before to run a campaign of this nature.My memory can go back 10 years, to the days when another government was in power. The Labor Party were in power, and they were endeavouring to promote one of their failed mini budgets, the so-called Working Nation campaign. They engaged a Labor mate called Bill Hunter to be the frontman for this particular campaign. I wonder whether members opposite have remembered how much they paid Bill Hunter for this particular campaign. How much did they pay? Would you like to know?  - This is 10 years ago. You would think it would be something quite small, wouldn't you? Two hundred and fifty thousand dollars was what Labor paid to try to promote their failed Working Nation campaign, yet they criticise the most successful quarantine campaign of all time and the fee that was paid to an outstanding Australian who has done a wonderful job to help promote quarantine in this country.</DOC>

The issues which the honourable member raises are constitutionally within the power of New South Wales, but there are a number of recommendations from the findings of Mr Justice Cole in his royal commission into the building and construction industry that this government, within its realm of power, intends to pursue. One of them relates to the establishment of a federal safety commissioner. Other recommendations have been referred to the national office of occupational health and safety. Indeed, I have written to each of the state and territory industrial relations or workplace ministers referring them to other relevant recommendations along the lines of what the honourable member has referred to.

 - I thank the honourable member for Mitchell for his question and for his continuing interest in the reform of the building and construction industry in this country. I remind the House that in his findings, the commissioner conducting the royal commission, Justice Terry Cole, characterised the building and construction industry as one exhibiting lawlessness. Indeed, in the report he said:At the heart of the findings is lawlessness. It is exhibited in many ways. There are breaches of the criminal law. There are breaches of laws of general application to all Australians ... There are breaches of many provisions of the Workplace Relations Act ...He also said:These findings demonstrate an industry which departs from the standards of commercial and industrial conduct exhibited in the rest of the Australian economy. They mark the industry as singular. They indicate an urgent need for structural and cultural reform. These findings, which are set out in great detail by the royal commissioner, have been reinforced in a series of clear and unambiguous ways by three separate court cases in the past week. Just in the last few days the secretary of the CFMEU's building division and a member, I understand, of the ACTU national executive, Mr John Sutton, was found guilty of two charges of malicious damage. Just last Friday, the New South Wales District Court convicted a Mr Salvatore Manna, another CFMEU official, for perjury, arising out of false evidence he gave to the royal commission. Just this week in Victoria the Magistrate's Court in Melbourne convicted Mr John Setka, another CFMEU official, for issuing threats against a construction manager who was due to appear against him in an industrial relations case.So just in the space of the last few days we have three clear examples, found by separate courts in separate cases, of industrial thuggery involving officials of the CFMEU. These are independent court findings which reinforce the findings of Justice Cole in the royal commission. That is why the government will introduce legislation in this House tomorrow to address the issues arising from Mr Justice Cole's findings in the royal commission. This bill will deal with a singular industry and these activities.The honourable member for Mitchell asked me about any alternatives to this. This is a question for the Australian Labor Party. Is the Australian Labor Party going to support this essential reform or will it continue to do the bidding of the John Suttons and the Martin Kinghams at the expense of the general community? We know that the CFMEU, for example, over the past six years has donated some $2.7 million to the Australian Labor Party. So there is a series of issues for the Labor Party in relation to this. Does the Australian Labor Party -  -  - Mr Speaker, you always know when they are uncomfortable because the level of interjections increases. There are a number of questions for the Australian Labor Party. Does the Australian Labor Party support these prosecutions? We have heard nothing but silence in relation to this. Will the Australian Labor Party -  - There are a number of issues here to which the Australian Labor Party is the only group of individuals that can respond. There are questions, for example, such as: do they support all Australians? Will we have a situation - An opposition member - He's doing it again! - In the absence of any indication otherwise, we can assume that the Australian Labor Party will take the $2.7 million rather than take into account the interests of ordinary Australians. I think the $2.7 million from the CFMEU was about the amount that the winner won in the Melbourne Cup yesterday. - Mr Speaker, they are very sensitive. There is a choice for the Australian Labor Party in relation to the building and construction industry: they can continue to take the $2.7 million from the CFMEU or they can deliver a $2.3 billion productivity bonus for all workers in Australia. The issue before the Australian Labor Party is that they know privately that they are dealing with rogue elements of the union movement in Australia - rogue elements that bring into disrepute the union movement generally and cost this country and ordinary Australian workers some $2.3 billion. Do they want to protect ordinary Australian workers or do they still want to take $2.7 million from Martin Kingham and his mates in the CFMEU? That is the issue. The bill will be in this place tomorrow. We will see how they vote.</DOC>

 - I am aware that bulk-billing rates have dropped. I made this very point myself in an article in the Australian on Monday. I should point out that the average bulk-billing rate over the life of this government has been 77 per cent. The average bulk-billing rate over the last seven years of the former government's life was 74 per cent. - The average bulk-billing rate today is 68.5 per cent, which is higher than the average bulk-billing rate over the life of the former government. So the bulk-billing rate today is higher than the average bulk-billing rate over the life of the former government. Let me make this point very clear: bulk-billing is important and bulk-billing should be available, but it has never been the position of this government, and it was never previously the position of the Australian Labor Party, that bulk-billing should be compulsory. It is not the position of this government and it was not the position of the former government that bulk-billing should be compulsory. Let me make this point clear: Medicare is not about universal bulk-billing; Medicare is a universal safety net delivering affordable, high-quality health care to all Australians, and that is the Medicare system that this government has delivered to the Australian people. </DOC>

But I can inform the member for Lalor that, under the former government, the patient copayment increased by 11 per cent a year. Under the former government, there was a bulk-billing rate of 68 per cent and an 11 per cent copayment increase. Under this government there is a 77 per cent bulk-billing rate and a six per cent -  - The government are concerned about the out-of-pocket expenses faced by Australians when they visit a doctor. The government are concerned to make Medicare an even better and stronger system. The government are concerned to strengthen the universal safety net which is Medicare, and that is why, as part of the A Fairer Medicare package, we have before the Senate right now a proposal to strengthen the safety net. If members opposite were serious in their concern - if they actually wanted to help patients rather than try to turn them into a political football - they would support that aspect of the government's A Fairer Medicare package. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dunkley for his question and for his strong interest not only in the automotive industry in Victoria but also in all manufacturing industries in Victoria. The automotive industry in Australia moved up a gear today with the announcement and opening of the V6 Holden plant in Melbourne. This plant - some $400 million worth of investment by GMH - is one of only two plants in the world and will produce over 200,000 engines each year. These engines will not only be fitted to our locally built Commodores but also be exported around the world.In scooping this plant for Australia, the industry has again confirmed the reputation that Australia is now enjoying in terms of being a leading automotive manufacturer in the Asia-Pacific region. Of course, as well as the investment in the V6 plant, GMH has invested some $200 million in an upgrade at Fishermans Bend and $400 million in an upgrade in the Elizabeth plant in South Australia. This further confirms the confidence that the Australian automotive industry has in its future both in Australia and in terms of exports.In terms of the process, the federal government was involved and, of course, the Victorian government was involved. Steve Bracks was this morning only too happy to be involved in creating jobs in Victoria. The SIC process is, of course, one which this government uses to ensure that these sorts of investments in Australian industry are made. It is worth noting that that process is under threat from the Labor Party. I will table a document from the member for Rankin in which he clearly says that it is Labor's policy to abolish the SIC process.Mr Bracks this morning was only too pleased to announce that, as part of that process, Victoria will gain some 500 jobs in direct terms from this investment by GMH. Some 6,000 indirect jobs will also come that way. The confidence that the industry is enjoying is also very much due to the policies of this government, but not only in terms of the some $10 billion to $12 billion worth of tax cuts to the price of motor vehicles. On top of that some $7 billion has been invested by this government, through the ACIS, in the future of the automotive industry. Over the term of those two schemes, some $15 billion - perhaps even as much as $20 billion - will ensure that that industry continues to grow and that we continue to export one in three cars produced.In terms of the free trade agreements that secure those markets for export cars, we have already had the Thailand free trade agreement, and the US free trade agreement is under negotiation. Industry continues to prosper here in Australia under the policies of this government. The strength of the manufacturing sector has been reinforced this week by the rise in October's Australian Industry Group performance manufacturing index.  -  - I know they do not like good news -  - In terms of a strong rise in domestic orders in that industry, we are also seeing strong future prospects. All this is good news for jobs in Australia and good news for the economy. </DOC>

 - I am very happy to take questions about interest rates and indeed about the general economy. If the honourable member would like to address them to me, I would be very happy to answer them as well. The first part of the question asked for a statement about future direction in interest rates. The government does not speculate on future directions in interest rates. - As I said to the House yesterday, I say again today that if interest rates moved up in response to yesterday's official rate rise of 0.25 per cent they would be around 6.8 per cent. The average interest rate under this government is 7.15 per cent. The average interest rate during the 13 years of Labor government was 12.75 per cent. So when one wants to look at these rates historically, they are low rates compared to when the government came to office. The saving on the average mortgage is $585 a month. That has given young Australians lower interest rates than we have had in the last 20 or 30 years. It is one of the reasons why the Australian economy has been so strong during a period of international downturn.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Corangamite for his question. The government welcomes the passage yesterday through the House of the bill that will proscribe, or lead eventually to an examination of the proscription of, LeT and the military wing of Hamas. The government looks forward to an early passage of this bill through the Senate. Once the bill has been passed, regulations can be considered to list the organisations for the purposes of the Criminal Code Act 1995.I read an article in today's Agewhich suggested that the opposition is set to back terror laws. The article made interesting reading, because the article itself suggested that the opposition is set to back them if the government is prepared to have a tribunal - a security division of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, I understand - examine the evidence on which a listing might be based. This is not a notion that has been adopted by New Zealand, Canada, the United Kingdom or the United States of America.If you look at the bill that is before the Senate, you see that a large number of steps have to be taken before any proscription can occur. The first is that the Director-General of Security must provide material to the Attorney-General's Department regarding the organisation - regarding its background and the training activities that it may have been involved in, or any terrorist activities. So, first, the director-general must provide that material to the Attorney-General's Department. Then the Australian Government Solicitor provides advice as to whether the information is sufficient to enable the Attorney-General to be satisfied. A submission is prepared by the Attorney-General's Department setting out that information and making a recommendation in relation to that issue. Then it is only at that stage that the Attorney-General would have to consider the matter and, if satisfied that all the criteria had been met, approve of a proposed regulation. We believe that is a very comprehensive process, one with very significant requirements that have to be satisfied.In addition to that, the bill has provision for parliamentary scrutiny through the disallowance mechanism. The process is subject to judicial review under section 75(v) of the Constitution and section 39 of the Judiciary Act. Our view is that these mechanisms provide more than enough accountability and safeguards. Further, if you were to pass this enactment with a decision for a tribunal to review the matters as a threshold test, it would be for the government to abrogate its responsibility to take a matter of this sort forward. I have to say that this is not a notion that this government would accept. First, we consider it is the role of the executive government to take decisions regarding terrorist organisations.  - I simply make the point that the comprehensive range of measures do take some time to outline, because they envisage an appropriate range of checks and balances that the government believe warrant support rather than opposition and change - as the opposition is foreshadowing. We believe it is appropriate that the democratically elected government is responsible for ensuring security of Australians. We believe that the government of the day has the available information and the expertise to make a decision. We believe that it can do so clearly, effectively and decisively if there is a provision for the use of regulatory powers. The danger that you face is that, if you want to act quickly on advice that has been given to you, if you have to wait for another tribunal to sift through the evidence what you are doing is building in provision for delay rather than timeliness.I notice that there have been some comments made in relation to the way in which these issues are being discussed and debated. One of the matters that have been of particular disappointment to me has been the way in which the Leader of the Opposition in particular has commented on these matters and been prepared to distort matters in order to try and get his arguments across. Yesterday, for instance, the Leader of the Opposition said, `What about the terrorist sent back to Spain whose name I cannot remember at the moment?'Let me help you. You may of course have been referring to Abu Dada, who is being held under custody for investigation in Spain as part of a Spanish investigation. I have checked in relation to this matter, and ASIO and the AFP say that there is no terrorist suspect that we have sent back to Spain, despite what the Leader of the Opposition has alleged. There is also no record of Abu Dada having ever entered Australia under his known name or any aliases. I would suggest that if we are going to have sensible debate about these questions, get the facts right from the start and, if you have not got the facts right, come and get a briefing and we will make sure you are fully informed. - Mr Speaker, I had notes, as I usually do, and I was using those notes as appropriate. The notes are confidential.</DOC>

 - I would like to thank the member for his question. It gives me a wonderful opportunity on behalf of the government to reiterate some of the magnificent things this government has done for Australian families since it came into government in 1996. I suppose one of the greatest things is that there are one million more people employed today than there were in 1996. Through our family tax benefit, they are receiving substantially more payments than they did under the old system - 20 per cent more. It was interesting to note in estimates today that the top-up payments are significantly more in the 2002-03 estimates. We have seen increased payments, particularly through the child care benefit. Yesterday, the Treasurer very accurately described the amount that was being paid on mortgages at the height of the Keating government and compared it with today's payments, and interest payments today are substantially less. This government has a very proud record when it comes to Australian families. The greatest thing, though, is that so many more Australian families are being paid substantially more today because of real wage increases - 16 per cent more compared to what there was in the dying days of the Keating government.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Boothby for his question. I can inform the House that the labour force statistics for the month of October showed the unemployment rate below six per cent for the third month in a row, with unemployment falling in October to 5.6 per cent: a level as low as unemployment has been in Australia in the last 22 years.Government members - Hear, hear! - According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, during the month of October an additional 69,200 new jobs were created and since the government was elected in March 1996 nearly 1.3 million new jobs have been created in the Australian economy. This does not come about by fluke; it has taken a lot of hard work to rebuild Australia's economy since the recession of 1990. The last time unemployment was at 5.6 per cent was for two months - in November and December 1989. We then had Paul Keating and Labor's recession that we had to have, and we have never been back in this territory until today. Today unemployment goes back to where it was before Labor's recession and we can say for the first time that the damage of Labor's recession, when it put people out of work, has now been undone. It has taken 13 years and, over the last seven years, this government balancing the budget, repaying Labor debt, recovering Australia's credit rating, getting interest rates down, bringing in a new taxation system and bringing in new labour market reform - all of that dedicated economic work has gone into producing the job outcomes for the younger people here in Australia. The tragedy is this: unemployment could go lower in this country if the Australian Labor Party would pass the government's reform measures in the Senate. We call on Labor. Hasn't Labor done enough damage to employment in this country? Why doesn't it get out of the way and give more people the opportunity for a job?Let us compare today's outcome with that of the Labor government which, for 28 consecutive months, held unemployment above 10 per cent. Mr Speaker, it is a Thursday afternoon and I like to send members back to their electorates with a song on their lips and a chuckle in their hearts -  - and I am comparing the outcomes we have today to the outcomes in Australia 10 years ago. In 1994, the then Minister for Employment, Education and Training, the Hon. Simon Crean, was asked about the unemployment figures, and he said -  - Mr Speaker, I am commenting on the factors that have brought unemployment from where it was in 1994 to where it is today. When the then minister for unemployment was asked about unemployment in July 1994, he said:These are very good figures for people looking for work. 30,000 new full-time jobs created ...He went on to say:... in terms of May, we got - unemployment - down to 9.8, all we've gone back to - in June - is 10 ... The reality is that had the participation rate not changed, unemployment this month would have been 9.6%.Back when the member for Hotham was the minister responsible for labour, results like 9.6 per cent were considered to be good results. These were the days when the member for Canberra was comparing the Australian economy to Mali, Peru and Bangladesh. We have come a long way because of economic reform. We could go further if the Labor Party would get out of the way. Let's give Australians the opportunity they deserve: the Senate should pass this government's program. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Fraser for his question. I want to make it clear that the issue of the capping of child care places is a matter which I have invited the minister to bring forward for consideration. - The minister has some views on this matter and obviously, like all proposals that involve the expenditure of additional revenue, it will be carefully scrutinised. But I take the opportunity of reminding the member for Fraser that under this government not only has child care become more plentiful, it has become cheaper. The cost of child care was meant to have risen as a result of the GST. Indeed, what has happened is that the cost of child care has come down.Let me also take the opportunity to say that the government have not taken any decision to alter the cap. We will consider it but, quite rightly, the Treasurer has said that in a rigid budget process all proposals that ministers bring forward have to be carefully considered against competing priorities. That criterion will be applied to the proposal of the minister for children.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Moncrieff for his question and his interest in this matter. - The unemployment rate of 5.6 per cent for October announced today is great news for Australian workers and their families. As the Treasurer said, the rate of unemployment in Australia has not been below 5.6 per cent for 22 years. Whilst the figure will no doubt bounce around - and does from month to month - what is important is that we now have a historic opportunity to lock in lower unemployment in Australia, an opportunity which will mean not only more jobs but higher wages for Australians because not only has unemployment come down in Australia through the creation of almost 1.3 million jobs under the Howard government but the pursuit of more flexible labour markets has meant real wages have increased.If you take a comparison of the level of real wages in Australia between 1985 and 1996 under the Australian Labor Party in government and the level of real wages under the coalition in government since 1996 then it is quite telling. Between 1985 and 1996, real wages for full-time employees in Australia rose by just 2.2 per cent. In other words, from 1985 to 1996 there was an increase in real wages of just $12 for Australians when the Australian Labor Party was in government. Contrast that to the period since 1996, when the Howard government has been in power in Australia. Real wages over this period of time have increased by 16 per cent or $91. Under the Labor Party we had an increase in real wages from 1985 to 1996 of just over $10. Since 1996 we have had an increase in real wages under this government of almost $100 - a remarkable contrast between what the Howard government has done and what the Labor Party did when it was in government.That is why, in answer to the second part of the member for Moncrieff's question, I can say this government will continue to pursue workplace reforms. It is why today I introduced legislation dealing with reform of the building and construction industry, legislation to bring about better bargaining between employers and employees, legislation to create a more national unfair dismissal scheme and to help small businesses deal with unfair dismissals. The most significant obstacle to this is the Australian Labor Party. The Australian Labor Party has stood in the way of every significant reform that this government has attempted and has pursued over the last 7½ years, as the Treasurer indicated before.Despite that opposition, we have brought about some of those reforms, which have created more jobs and higher wages for Australian workers and their families. We urge the Australian Labor Party to abandon this needless, mindless opposition to every proposal that comes forward, to get behind Australian workers and their families and to bring about more reform. As I said, if we do that then we can lock in lower unemployment in Australia. We have at this present time a trifecta of low interest rates, low inflation and low unemployment. Reform means more jobs and higher wages, and that must be good for all Australians.</DOC>

He might tell us precisely what his plans for the private health insurance rebate are. Obviously this government is concerned with trying to keep costs down. We want to keep costs down to consumers and we want to keep costs down to people who take private health insurance.  - But let me give the Leader of the Opposition this assurance: this government will not do anything to destroy or detract from the clinical effectiveness of procedures.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Wentworth for his question and his interest in this area. The Australian Securities and Investments Commission's annual report, which was tabled earlier this week, shows that ASIC, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, achieved record enforcement outcomes in 2002-03. In that year ASIC obtained 43 criminal convictions, resulting in 29 people being jailed for fraud, criminal breach of duty and insider trading. ASIC has now achieved 73 jail terms over the last three years. Over the last three years $1 billion has been protected, with compensation ordered or assets frozen, and 67 civil proceedings have resulted in 151 court orders against companies or individuals. In addition to that, in 2002-03 ASIC banned 16 company directors and 39 financial services, and disciplined eight company auditors or liquidators.This government has asked ASIC, without fear or favour, to enforce corporate regulation. In the 2001-02 budget, ASIC was given an additional $90.8 million over four years to assist with enforcement and regulatory activities. An additional $28 million was given to ASIC to fund its investigations and prosecutions arising from the HIH Royal Commission. I would hope that all members of this House would support ASIC in its work of enforcing corporate regulation. I regret to say that the active campaign by the member for Werriwa to undermine ASIC continues on the grounds that ASIC brought some civil proceedings against someone he says is the son of a Labor icon. Apparently the Leader of the Opposition, who is aware of this, has done nothing to rein in the member for Werriwa and to disassociate himself from this campaign which has been continuing for years.On behalf of this government I want to make it clear that we believe the corporate regulator, without fear or favour, should bring proceedings. It is up to the courts to determine whether people are guilty or innocent, but there is no rule that is being put down by this government that sons of political icons should be immune. I call on the Leader of the Opposition to disassociate himself from this campaign by the member for Werriwa, who continues his campaign against ASIC on that basis. I will make this one point: Senator Stephen Conroy has had the decency to disassociate himself from the campaign by the member for Werriwa. Senator Stephen Conroy went on The Insiders last Sunday and said: ASIC have done a good job, David Knott has done a good job over recent years in not being prepared to look at reputations. He's been prepared to apply the law as he's seen it and pursue anybody, no matter how high profile, in doing his job.It is very simple. The Labor Party can have the Senator Stephen Conroy position or it can have the member for Werriwa's position, but it cannot have both. If the Labor Party wants to put up somebody as a putative Treasurer who believes that corporate enforcement should be determined on the basis of whether a person is the son of a political icon and that that is a relevant consideration in enforcing Corporations Law, so much to the shame of the Leader of the Opposition. The Leader of the Opposition has been entirely silent in this matter. He either backs Senator Conroy or he backs the member for Werriwa. Conroy is right; the member for Werriwa is wrong. Let us see some leadership from the Leader of the Opposition.</DOC>

 - It is really pathetic, isn't it? It is so sad. The Leader of the Opposition is going, and so is the member for Griffith! - It is very odd, Mr Speaker. I thank the honourable member for her question. As some honourable members know, the Prime Minister and others will be going to the United Kingdom next week, principally for the unveiling of the Australian War Memorial in London.It is also important that people understand that we do value very much our political relationship with the United Kingdom, as well as our economic relationship. It is our judgment that we need to rebuild - I suppose that is the right way of putting it - some of the broader community contacts between the United Kingdom and Australia. It is in that spirit that the very first Australia-UK Leadership Forum will be held, and a number of members of this House will be participating in it.  This is an initiative which is timely, given the strong links we have with the United Kingdom. But I do not think that links with countries like the United Kingdom should be taken for granted - we have got to keep working on these relationships. At the political level, Australia and the United Kingdom have become much closer in recent years than has been the case for a long time. That is not born out of some sense of sentiment; although, of course, there is nothing wrong with positive sentiments about other countries - it is not something I personally criticise; if people have positive sentiments about other countries, I applaud that.Rather, it is born out of a convergence of interests - that is, we have had to deal with very major transnational global threats. We have had to deal with the problem of Islamic fundamentalist terrorism and we have had to deal with the problem of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Obviously, since September 11, 2001 we and the United Kingdom and others have been more robust in doing that. As a consequence, there are the capabilities that the United Kingdom brings to bear to deal with these problems. If I may say so, the determination of the Blair government and of Tony Blair himself, as the leader of that government, to address these issues and not run away from them or seek populist positions - even though he is a Labour leader - and to confront his critics on the back bench and demonstrate the strength to overwhelm them in the cause of a greater good is something we do admire here on this side of the House. I appreciate it is only on this side of the House; there is not bipartisanship on that.It is the determination of the British government to address issues that we have been determined to address that helps to bring us together. We have a longstanding traditional intelligence relationship and a very longstanding economic relationship. It is still a very important economic relationship, as the Minister for Trade knows only too well - we have around $19 billion worth of bilateral trade with the United Kingdom. These relationships have been built on very much by our joint determination to take on some of the great issues that the world has to confront. Neither of our governments have been governments that have run away from our responsibilities, and both of our governments have had the courage to take on those issues, sometimes in the teeth of a bit of opposition.We very much look forward to the Australia-UK Leadership Forum. It will be an opportunity for us to expand our contacts with the United Kingdom through the business sector, the academic community, journalism and the like, and to develop a much greater understanding of each other in our countries than perhaps some of the traditional stereotypes might suggest. Traditional stereotypes that the opposition seems to find so droll are, as a matter of fact -  - The opposition, by the way, when offered tickets to go to the United Kingdom, rushed to take them, the Leader of the Opposition himself included - but, there again, this is a man who enjoys going to Wimbledon finals. - There is nothing wrong with that, but, Leader of the Opposition, do not criticise other people for having interests when you yourself hold the same interests.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Riverina for her question. On a day that has seen the lowest level of unemployment for 22 years, it is significant to recognise the contribution that Australia's export industries make as far as employment in Australia is concerned. In October, 69,200 new jobs were created, which helped unemployment fall to 5.6 per cent. Of course, right across the labour market in Australia about 1.7 million jobs in the Australian economy rely on export industries for their existence. That is a significant number. As we always say, one in five jobs across the Australian economy rely on exports.What have we been doing to ensure the sustainability of those jobs and to see those numbers increase? Since the election of our government in 1996 we have been focused on creating a very good economic environment in Australia that engenders competitiveness, efficiency and productivity - particularly as far as the export sector is concerned. On top of that, we have recently been pursuing a very ambitious trade agenda in terms of our multilateral agenda and, particularly, bilaterally with countries like the United States. We had a question about this a moment ago, and we are deeply engaged in negotiations with the United States. We have concluded an agreement with Singapore. I know that the member for Riverina was very interested in the recent conclusion of the free trade agreement with Thailand, which saw the tariff on rice drop from 52 per cent to zero per cent. The employees at SunRice in her electorate are going to be guaranteed of their jobs well into the future because there are more markets for them to sell into and they can make more profits in those markets that we are opening up.  - Our government has been focused not just on sound economic management here at home in the Australian economy but also on taking every opportunity to open up new markets and remove barriers to old markets across the world for our exporters. We have removed $3.5 billion worth of Labor's tax burden from the back of Australia's exports, which makes them much more competitive in the international marketplace. We have focused on repaying Labor's debt and returning the budget to a sustainable footing, producing surplus after surplus after surplus to give Australia and Australians a much better credit rating across the world. We have seen a significant reduction in interest rates, which are still at historically low levels, which significantly benefits the export sector.What the Labor Party can do is support our reforms that still sit in the Senate concerning the management of the economy and the removal of impediments in the workplace. Certainly we seek support from the Labor Party as far as our trade and economic policies are concerned. That will continue to deliver more employment growth in the future for all Australians.</DOC>

Thanks to the policies of this government, those one million people living in families with income of less than $20,000 a year have access to a private health insurance benefit averaging $750 a year, and that is the benefit that members opposite want to rip off them. I would advise the constituents of members opposite to give their members of parliament a very strong message: `Hands off the private health insurance rebate!'</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Makin for her question. I am very pleased to be able to point out to her and to other members the fundamental fact that, to have a strong and effective Medicare system, we also need a strong and effective private health insurance system, because the private health insurance system is necessary to take the pressure off the public system - in particular, to keep down the waiting lists in public hospitals. Thanks to this government's policies, nearly nine million Australians now enjoy the security and choice that private health insurance gives. Not only are there one million Australians living in families with incomes of less than $20,000 a year who enjoy the benefits of private health insurance, there are 5½ million Australians living in families with incomes of less than $50,000 a year who enjoy the benefits of private health insurance.As was clearly revealed by the member for Throsby's earlier question, Labor has a secret plan to rip the guts out of private health insurance. Just last week we saw a Labor frontbencher, Senator Michael Forshaw, talking about the need for the private health insurance rebate to be capped or targeted. Just about every Labor member of this parliament is ideologically biased against private health insurance. For instance, just to take another sampling to join the samples I gave the other day, the member for Denison, using language unique to himself, described the private health insurance rebate as an `egregious manifestation', while 55 per cent of the electorate of Denison, or 51,000 people, have private health insurance. None other than the member for Melbourne described the private health insurance rebate as `one of the least efficient government programs of all time', while 33 per cent, or 54,000 people, in his electorate have private health insurance. Then none other than the member for Perth, the former shadow minister for health, described the private health insurance rebate as a `public policy crime', and he said that the Labor Party's policy review would encompass all the options, including abolition. The member for Perth said this even though 46 per cent of the electors of Perth, or 58,000 people, have private health insurance. It is high time for the Labor Party to come clean. They have been reviewing this policy for six years. It is high time for the Leader of the Opposition to finally take charge so that nearly nine million Australians can plan their health future with security and confidence.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Gilmore for her question and congratulate the employers in her electorate of Gilmore on the very strong commitment they have made to apprentices and training. This government believes very strongly that every young Australian should have options available to them and that apprenticeships and opportunities in TAFE are no less important than those in university, as is getting a job. The government is currently negotiating with the states to commit another $3.6 billion over the next three years to support Australia's national training system and, at the moment, almost 400,000 Australians are undertaking apprenticeships over the length and breadth of Australia. In fact, to contrast that with the Labor Party in government, when the now Leader of the Opposition was the minister for training, there were 140,000 Australians in apprenticeships; there are now almost 400,000.At the moment, however, there are a number of threats in relation to apprenticeships and training. The Victorian government announced recently that it will increase by 25 per cent the up-front cost of doing a TAFE course. Unlike university, for TAFE the money has to be paid at the gate of the TAFE institute. There is no HECS system and there is no paying it back once you have graduated and you are earning good income - you have to pay it up-front. That is a 25 per cent increase, or a slug, predominantly for low-income families in Victoria. A 50 per cent increase was announced by the South Australian government for apprentices who want to go to TAFE. Again, we heard not a word from the Australian Labor Party here in Canberra - not a word was raised in opposition to those increased charges. But the daddy of them all has to be in the state of New South Wales. In the state of New South Wales this year, the New South Wales Labor government has announced a 300 per cent increase in up-front TAFE fees for predominantly low-income families trying to get their kids trained, and not a single word has been said about it by the Australian Labor Party here.I opened the Illawarra Mercury this morning and there was the heading `Fees policy attacked' and I noticed some photographs under the heading `What the politicians had to say'. Illawarra MP, Marianne Saliba, said:We need to consider the impact increased fees will have on young people in this region.That, of course, is what the member for Gilmore and others on this side have been telling me for some time. Then we hear from Kiama MP, Matt Brown. He said:I think it would be terrible if people did not study because of the fee increases, and that is the message I will be taking to the Education Minister, Andrew Refshauge.Then I read about the Wollongong MP, Noreen Hay, who wants to convene a meeting with local members and the minister to consider the devastating impact on students and teachers. I turned the page and I could not find a photograph of the Leader of the Opposition, I could not find a photograph of the member for Jagajaga, and I certainly did not see a photograph of the member for Throsby, or indeed a photograph of the member for Cunningham.So here we have the Australian Labor Party, and I think it is summed up very well by the Wollongong TAFE Federation representative, Rob Long, who said: Prior to the last state election, the ALP policy on TAFE student fees was to abolish all fees in TAFE for mainstream vocational courses but now Refshauge has increased fees by up to 300 per cent.So the message there is twofold. Firstly, the Australian Labor Party in opposition will say one thing and then in government do something completely different. The second thing is that the Labor Party runs around the country protesting at possible changes to university charges of up to 30 per cent that students pay back once they are doctors and lawyers but it does not have a word to say about a 300 per cent up-front increase in TAFE fees in the state of New South Wales.  I say to the member for Throsby: you tell Mr Barry Howard, on $226 a week, that he is going to have to work for two weeks and spend every last dollar of his salary if he wants to do the automotive brake repair course at the Illawarra Institute of TAFE. He is going to have to work for six weeks to pay for his mechanical supervision diploma at the Wollongong Institute of TAFE. What the opposition needs to understand is that you cannot run around the country expressing concern for lawyers, doctors, dentists and a whole range of people, three-quarters of whose education is funded by the taxpayer, and at the same time have absolutely no concern for low-income families trying to get their kids apprenticeships and training through TAFE.</DOC>

 - This is almost a historic question: it is now 11 months since the last time I was asked a question by the shadow minister for the environment. What this shows is how empty are the efforts of the Labor Party to produce environmental policies that have any credibility whatever. We know that the policies that will revive the health of the Murray River are the policies that are put forward by this government through the national water initiative and the $500 million that is being allocated through the COAG process to the revival of Murray River health. Throughout the entire 13 years of the Labor government virtually nothing was done to prevent the continued deterioration of the health of the Australian environment and the health of the Murray River. - The health of the Murray River is a very important question -  - and the ministers - led by the Commonwealth government, under the chairmanship of the Murray-Darling Basin Commission Ministerial Council, by the minister for agriculture - have put out to the Murray-Darling Basin communities a series of reference flows in the Murray River: 350 gigalitres, 750 gigalitres and 1,500 gigalitres. The government has also commissioned, through the Murray-Darling Basin Commission Ministerial Council, a scientific report which shows the flows that will be necessary in order to restore health to the Murray River. Let me make it quite clear that we accept the scientific report that is put forward on behalf of the ministerial council and the Murray-Darling Basin Commission and on behalf of this government. This government is committed to the restoration of the health of the Murray River, and it is quite clear from that report that the scientific assessment is that over time the restoration of flows of the order of 1,500 gigalitres have a prospect of restoring the river to good health. That is a very significant conclusion from the scientific report. Interestingly enough, it is scaling back the flows that were previously suggested would be necessary to restore the river to health. What is absolutely vital for the communities along the Murray River is to have a clear indication of the outcomes - the environmental outcomes - that are to be achieved by any flows and any management of those flows. Where the Labor Party's approach to this has been so derelict is that it has failed at any time to indicate what those environmental outcomes should be or how any flows within the river should be managed. This government has put forward the proposals. The Murray-Darling Basin Commission has now been working on a first-step proposal which will be presented to the ministerial council next week. The fact that that first-step proposal is now practicable is a result of the efforts of the Prime Minister and his national leadership through COAG so that the resources can be made available now to initiate first-step flows in the Murray River to rescue the environmental health of the major environmental assets of the river. This government has provided the national leadership; the Labor Party has done nothing but provide empty rhetoric and practise opportunistic politics.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Barker for his question, and I thank him very much for his strong support for sustainable farming practices within his electorate. The Howard government is providing strong national leadership towards the environmental sustainability of this country. It does so at the very highest levels of government, through the Sustainable Environment Committee of the cabinet, chaired by the Prime Minister. It gives a lead to our research community through the establishment of An Environmentally Sustainable Australia - one of the four national research priorities. It does so through the establishment of the magnificent $2.7 billion Natural Heritage Trust; the $1.4 billion National Action Plan for Salinity and Water Quality with the states; the huge marine planning effort, which is now going on in our exclusive economic zone in the Great Barrier Reef; the Living Murray initiative; and the national water initiative.I am delighted that our historic environmental efforts are being noted. A headline in yesterday's Canberra Times said, `Australia is ahead of the rest in environmental sustainability'. The article went on to say:Believe it or not, this country leads the world in cooperative management of our national land and water resources. - This is the Canberra Times, believe it or not. The story concerned remarks by Andrew Campbell, the Executive Director of Land and Water Australia, who was reporting the response of Canadians that he had met on a recent visit to Canada to Australia's achievement. He said: When they heard that Australia had drawn together all its governments to cooperatively generate and share data on natural resources to provide a national picture based on consistent measurement criteria, they were flabbergasted.They told me that was an achievement equal to sending humans to Pluto and bringing them back.Simon Grose reported that the response of the Canadians highlights the fact that most Australians do not appreciate that, when it comes to managing our environment, we are doing better than any other country. This requires national leadership, particularly in a federal country such as Australia. No other continent in the world has put in place the strategic, regional framework for resource planning that this government has done in cooperation with the states through the Natural Heritage Trust and the National Action Plan for Salinity and Water Quality. No other country in the world is engaged in marine planning around its entire continental shelf. No other federal country is so advanced in bringing together the key data we need to make the best decisions for the future.I want to take this opportunity to congratulate and acknowledge the work of the Land and Water Resources Audit, which is providing the critical information we need to take wise decisions for the future. The Howard government has already invested $34 million in that audit, and the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and I recently announced a further $3 million to support the audit into a new phase. The audit has been one of the great achievements of the Natural Heritage Trust. Through our programs, we are empowering Australians and particularly empowering regional Australia to finally work to put this continent on a sustainable basis.On the other side of the House, we see absolutely no serious attempt whatever to address these issues. We have just had the first question in 11 months from the shadow minister for the environment. The Labor Party have a so-called climate policy that would set out to destroy industries and jobs. Their so-called policy on the Murray River has regard neither to environmental outcomes nor to social and economic impacts. The only thing you can infer, Mr Speaker, from this quietness, this extraordinary silence on the environment from the Labor Party, is that they have certain plans for the expenditures on these great national programs. They may have dropped the R word that meant roll-back, but they have raised a new R word - that is, reprioritisation. The reason they are not pursuing these environmental programs is that they have their eye on these sources of money that are putting Australia on a sustainable basis and they are going to use them for other political purposes. No-one could have any confidence that the Labor Party will sustain the enormous national effort that this government has put in place to put the Australian continent on a sustainable basis for the future.</DOC>

 - This is another example of where federal Labor is so weak in its relations with its state Labor parties because, as the member for Wills may well know, a bilateral has still not been finalised with Queensland on the Natural Heritage Trust. The reason why that is not finalised is that the Beattie government will not make a commitment to protect vegetation of concern in that state. The Labor government in Queensland has failed to put itself behind the protection of the most threatened vegetation communities in that state. Of course, the commitment of the federal government to vegetation management reform in Queensland remains. But what remains totally unclear at the moment is whether the Beattie government is prepared to commit itself to concerned vegetation protection and whether federal Labor is prepared to talk with its state colleagues and tell them to get on with the business of protecting the environment in Queensland, of putting that environment on a sustainable basis and of protecting the vegetation that needs to be protected.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dickson for his question and I appreciate his concern to ensure that the people of northern Brisbane continue to enjoy universal access to affordable, high-quality health care. MedicarePlus is a $2.4 billion investment in a stronger, better Medicare system. MedicarePlus has four elements. The first is patient convenience. Thanks to the HIC initiative, patients will be able to access their Medicare rebate from the doctor's surgery without the need to line up in queues at Medicare offices. Second, MedicarePlus means more doctors and nurses in the system. It means 1,500 more doctors and it means 1,600 more nurses by 2007, and that will take the strain off hard-pressed general practices. Third, it means more opportunities for bulk-billing, through the new $5 incentive payment for doctors who choose to bulk-bill concession card holders and children under 16. Fourth, it means a brand-new safety net to protect households from substantial out-of-pocket out-of-hospital medical benefits schedule expenses.The MedicarePlus package responds to critics of the government's earlier proposals. The critics asked for an extra half a billion dollars. The government delivered $1.5 billion more. They were unhappy with the gap proposal. That has gone. They did not like the private health insurance aspect. Now we have a universal safety net delivered entirely through the Medicare system. They wanted a better deal for kids, and that has been delivered in spades thanks to the Howard government. Not to pass the government's legislation would be a low blow to families in need, and I call on the Senate to pass the legislation this week.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Mackellar for her question. I can inform the House that today the government is announcing a review of aspects of the self-assessment system of the income tax system. This will be looking at the question of whether we have struck the right balance between protecting the rights of individual taxpayers and protecting the revenue. There have been criticisms in the past as to the uncertainties which come from the self-assessment system. The self-assessment system was introduced in 1992 by the previous government. It means that not all tax returns are audited, but there is a capacity after a person has self-assessed for matters to be reopened. Some taxpayers say that this leads to unreasonable delay or unreasonable uncertainty. In the light of that, the government will commission a review. As part of that review, which will be conducted by the Treasury, a discussion paper will be put out early next year identifying key issues to be looked at. There was a report in one of today's newspapers saying that the government was reviewing the question of the income tax threshold and work related expenses. That is not part of this review. Those issues have been looked at on occasions over the years, but they are not something that is currently being reviewed by the government. What is being reviewed by the government is the self-assessment system. In addition to that, the government announced, through Senator Coonan, on Friday that it will be looking at the general interest charge, particularly in relation to certain arrangements that have been the subject of controversy. They are the matters that are under investigation.</DOC>

 - I am not going to quibble with the member for Lalor's arithmetic, but let me say that the new MedicarePlus safety net is an important structural improvement to Medicare. Just so that the member for Lalor is in no doubt about the situation that some families face, currently some 50,000 concession card holders face out-of-pocket MBS expenses of $500 in a single year. Some 30,000 Australian families face out-of-pocket MBS expenses of more than $1,000 in a single year. These people should not be left in the lurch; they should be protected by a stronger safety net. That is why members opposite should pass this legislation.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and acknowledge his very real interest in health outcomes for rural areas. I also take this opportunity to thank the Minister for Health and Ageing for his work on this issue and his wide consultation - and his willingness to take into account the particular needs of different parts of the country. As has been commented on, we are aiming at having another 1,500 doctors and 1,600 nurses across Australia by 2007. Many of those will, of course, find their way into rural and regional areas, largely because of the various ways in which the package has been constructed. That will make a very substantial difference in those areas where it is hard to access medical practitioners, and indeed nurses as well. For one thing, the pressure on heavily worked rural doctors will be eased by the nurse initiative, which I think is very much to be welcomed. In addition to that, rural doctors working as surgical assistants - or GP proceduralists, as they are known - will be reimbursed up to $10,000 a year to help maintain their skills. There is nothing like endorsements from people in the field. I note that Dr Sue Page, the President of the Rural Doctors Association, recognised that this was a very valuable highlight indeed. There is nothing more important than having those GP proceduralists in country areas where you cannot get ready access to specialists. This will make a real difference to their willingness to continue providing proceduralist services and to new doctors being able to undertake them in the future. In addition to that, the cutting of red tape in relation to the immigration system in pursuit of another 725 foreign trained doctors by 2007 has been welcomed by ACRRM, the Australian College of Rural and Remote Medicine, and the increased rural retention payments will continue for another four years to reward the commitment of GPs who provide services to rural and remote communities for lengthy periods of time. I think it is very important - and testimony, again, to the fact that the government listens - that the 234 new medical school places will see periods of up to three years of postgraduate training undertaken by medical students recognised in meeting their bonding requirements. That too, I think, will move a lot more young doctors into country areas. As we know, when they have sampled country life - gotten over their initial concerns and understood what it is like - many of them will then stay.But we hear constant talk from the ALP about the universality of Medicare and not developing a two-tiered health system in this country. If ever there was developed a two-tiered health system in Australia, it was the country-city split under Labor. We have known for decades that, if you want a decent supply of doctors and allied health workers in country areas, you have to train a decent number of kids from country and rural areas. Labor let the intake of our medical schools get down to about four or five per cent. Under the packages we have put in place, that is up around 25 or 26 per cent, which will give us the supply of doctors and health care workers that we will need in the future. It is a dramatic improvement and gives the lie to any accusations about our commitment to decent health care for all Australians, regardless of where they live.</DOC>

 - I would make the point, in response to the member for KingsfordSmith, that bulk-billing is a function of two factors: first, financial incentives, and financial incentives to bulk-bill will be significantly improved under this package; and, second, the supply of doctors, and the supply of doctors will be dramatically improved under this package. In fact, the supply of general practitioners will go up by almost 10 per cent as a result of this package. Certainly, whatever difficulties there may be in some places, people living in the electorate of KingsfordSmith enjoy, under the policies of this government, a bulk-billing rate of 88.7 per cent. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Robertson for his question and acknowledge his interest in the wellbeing of older Australians who need care - not only in his electorate but across Australia. MedicarePlus will introduce an initiative that will provide better access to medical care for residents in aged care facilities - firstly, through a new Medicare benefit schedule item and, secondly, through grants to general practitioners. MedicarePlus will support doctors to care for residents in aged care facilities through a new Medicare benefit schedule item which makes comprehensive medical assessments far more accessible - that is, more residents in aged care facilities will be able to obtain this assessment.The Howard government introduced health assessments in 1999, and to date more than 560,000 older Australians have had access to the assessments. However, I have found in the last few weeks as I have travelled to various electorates, including Calare - I visited the member for Calare - Paterson, Ballarat, Aston, Flinders, Pearce, Melbourne Ports and, this morning, the electorate of Fraser, that health assessments have a very high satisfaction rating amongst consumers and GPs and that they provide a very valuable way of identifying not only a person's physical but also their mental and sociological health and wellbeing. Under MedicarePlus, all doctors will be able to undertake a comprehensive medical assessment of both new and existing aged care residents. That will attract a Medicare rebate of about $140 per resident, irrespective of their age - and that is an important change.Also, funding of up to $8,000 a year will be available to GPs who provide routine care to residents in aged care facilities and who undertake urgent and after-hours care and who also work with aged care facilities to improve quality standards. In order to access this assistance, all an aged care home needs to do is work with its local division of general practice. In fact, those divisions will be funded with a dedicated resource - a person who will work with the aged care facility on this issue.This MedicarePlus initiative underscores our commitment to caring for older Australians, but interestingly I have not heard a word from Labor on this initiative. I would like to know what Labor's policy is on the MedicarePlus initiative for ageing Australians and for older Australians who are in residential aged care. In fact, I would like to know what Labor's policy on aged care in any area is - I have not heard a word from them. This compares with the Howard government, which is committed to ensuring that accessible and quality care is available to older Australians throughout this country.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Solomon for his question and for the interest he shows in this issue. He is a strong supporter of the government's border protection policy. The point about the policy is that the sheer scale of the crime of people-smuggling does demand a serious response. It is estimated that four million people are smuggled or trafficked across international borders each year. We are working very actively with other countries, in particular the countries in our region, to shut down this criminal activity. We do not want to leave in place incentives for this activity to continue.In answer to the honourable member's question, I particularly refer to the regional cooperation arrangements we have had in place with Indonesia since 2000. They have allowed the International Organisation for Migration to care for potential illegal immigrants and the UNHCR to process asylum claims. Since 2000, more than 3,900 people have been processed in this way. That is 3,900 people who could have come to Australia illegally if it had not been for the cooperation that we have had. The SIEV14 case again demonstrated that regional cooperation arrangements are working. Those arrangements ensure that bona fide refugees have access to international protection, but they also ensure that smugglers are going to be thwarted. Our arrangements with Indonesia, as well as our offshore processing centres in Nauru and on Manus Island in Papua New Guinea, have sent a clear message to the people smugglers that Australia is closed to this evil business. The fact that only two boats have made it to Australia in the last two years is an illustration of the enormous success of the policy.Let me also say that the Bali process - the ministerial conferences that took place in 2002 and 2003 - has produced practical activities which have improved the broader cooperation around the region. So far, 19 regional countries have adopted legislation to make people-smuggling and/or trafficking a crime, and there are 12 that are still actively considering doing that. The fact is, the government has a strong policy. It is a tough policy, but the point about it is that it is an effective policy. Are there any alternatives? There is a simple alternative. There is the alternative of the opposition, which is to be weak on people-smuggling and to have incentives in place, in effect, by saying they would not be tough. That will encourage people smugglers to deliver people to Australia. It is as simple as that. - The Leader of the Opposition interjects with great gusto, but I noted that he had a doorstop interview in London on 13 November and he was asked if he wanted illegals sent back before processing, and he replied `No. I think what we have to do is assess whether they are genuine or not' - in other words: Everybody can come to Australia. Let us leave the door open to the people smugglers. But what was interesting was that, when the transcript of that doorstop was put out on that day, that part of the transcript was left off. The opposition talks about integrity and honesty: I think the Leader of the Opposition has a lot to answer for on that count. </DOC>

 - Let me make it very clear to the member for Chisholm that the government does not determine who gets bulk-billed; doctors and patients determine who gets bulk-billed. That has always been the case. -  - As the political architect of Medicare, Dr Neal Blewett, repeatedly made very clear, doctors have a choice. They can bulk-bill their patients - and he said that this would be particularly the case for pensioners and other needy people - or they can charge a fee and then the patients can get back 85 per cent of the schedule fee from Medicare. So this government's position on bulk-billing is exactly the same position as that of the political father of Medicare, Dr Neal Blewett. Let me make this point very clear to the member for Chisholm. Every bulk-billing doctor will be better off under this government's package. Every doctor who is currently bulk-billing will have a greater Medicare income as a result of this package, and many doctors who are not currently bulk-billing will have significant incentives to go back to bulk-billing. So the bulk-billing rate in Chisholm, which is currently 73.8 per cent, may very well go up under this package.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Wentworth for his question because I am aware of a number of statements that have been made suggesting that unauthorised boat arrivals on our shores pose a threat to our national security. I might also say that I am also aware of a number of statements suggesting that boats do not pose a threat to national security. The problem of course with those who make these statements is that they are all from the one party - and the statements sometimes come from the same person. For instance, on 9 November, the shadow Attorney-General said on the Sunday program:...they could be carrying terrorists. To say to a boatload look, if you're a terrorist and you want to come into the country come in to one of the small islands to the north of Australia, because we really can't protect it, is quite frankly surrender.The next day, on 6PR, he said: I think it is fanciful to suggest that terrorists are going to come out here and claim asylum status. Why? Because they would be detained for a period of time under our laws.The contradictions, of course, go on, because members opposite have been suggesting from time to time that Australia is not exposed to risk from terrorists. Many comments of that sort were made. - On 25 September 2001, the then opposition leader, the member for Brand, said on Lateline:...there is more and more of an understanding that terrorists don't arrive on a hit-and-miss process by boats. - We know in a speech reportedly at an ALP function at Rooty Hill last Saturday night, the member for Brand, commenting on fishing boats in our northern waters, is reported as saying:Imagine if any of those boats carried terrorists with a mind to roll out a few sea mines over the side.So you see that there is a very significant element of confusion amongst the opposition in relation to how these issues ought to be pursued. There is no confusion on this side. We have always made it clear that we need to have a strong and very determined message on border protection. We have sought to put that in place through the measures that have ensured that people who arrive in Australia without authority are properly detained and, if they are not able to establish a proper basis for being in Australia, they are removed from Australia.Secondly, we have been able to put in place measures that have ensured that people who seek to come here and arrive at excised places can be removed elsewhere - either returned to where they have come from or, in the case of those whom we cannot safely return, taken to an offshore centre for processing. Those messages have been particularly profound in terms of the effect they have had on people-smuggling issues. I would have to say that terrorists would have to be very mindful that it would be highly unlikely that they were going to reach Australia, with the measures that we have put in place to ensure that if they were going to get onto boats, as the opposition has been alluding to, they would not be successful. The range of measures that we have implemented has achieved just that. Let me just make it very clear: if the Labor Party are serious about national security issues and protecting the Australian community as a whole, there will be a range of further measures that they can look at to deal with those questions. When it comes to the Senate, they can also give us the appropriate powers to efficiently and effectively list terrorist organisations.</DOC>

 - Let me help the person who appears to be the new spokesman for the Labor Party on these issues, because I notice that the shadow minister for immigration, when she was asked to comment on these matters -   -  - I notice that the member for Gellibrand, when she was asked to comment on these issues, said:Now is not an appropriate time for border protection.I thought that was the most remarkable statement that I had ever heard. - On ABC radio in Adelaide. Let me make it abundantly clear: as far as this side of politics is concerned, border protection is pre-eminent at all times. Let me make that very clear. - The most important aspect of border protection has been to be able to return people who arrived in Australia without lawful authority to where they came from. The most important measure in terms of impacting upon the perception as to whether or not you are going to get to Australia is to be able to get people back. If you are going to get them back, you want them to be gotten back safely. Some of the reasons that people have been taken to offshore processing is that the vessels were not in a fit state for them to be returned. For that reason -  - people on some vessels have been transferred to offshore processing. But it has sent a very clear message to people smugglers that they are not succeeding when people have been returned. They have not succeeded if they have not come to Australia. Let me make it very clear: if you are going to return people, you need to return them safely; if you are going to strip the boats of the crew, then you have no prospect of being able to guarantee or assure that people will be able to get back safely.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Herbert for his question. He and many others warmly welcomed the announcement by the Prime Minister of the most significant tourism package ever delivered in Australia. I have to disappoint the House and say that the first response was a little disappointing. The response from the shadow minister for tourism, the member for Hunter, was disappointing, as he said, `The blueprint falls short.' He went on to criticise the content and size of the package. I am here to inform the House that that is not the view of the Queensland Labor tourism minister, who welcomed the paper, or the view of the Western Australian Labor tourism minister, who said that the paper would open up areas of Western Australia to the international market and that Western Australia was poised to take advantage of the strategies outlined in the white paper. It was not the view of the Tasmanian Labor Premier, who noted the genuine intention to drive significant reform for the tourism industry at the national level. And it was not the view of the Chairman of the Victorian Tourism Industry Council, one John Button, who said it could:... mitigate against future shocks by making the sector more responsive to emerging trends and opportunities.The disappointment was not shared by the tourism task force, which hailed it as a significant package, or the National Tourism Alliance, the tourism industry forum, the Australian Tourism Export Council, the Hotel, Motel and Accommodation Association of Australia, the Queensland Tourism Industry Council or the Restaurant and Caterers Association. They all praised the tourism white paper.There was one more association which also praised it. The World Tourism Organisation has just become a part of the United Nations and it met recently in Beijing - 140 tourism ministers from around the world. The Chairman of the World Tourism Organisation put out a press release from Madrid and said:As a government tourism strategy paper, the Australian document has undoubtedly raised the standards and set new benchmarks. The tourism white paper will be widely studied and will influence thinking and policy making in many countries.I table that document. What was the response to all of that support by the member for Hunter? The member for Hunter said to AAP:I think the gushing response of the sector was close to sickening.Here is a tip for the member for Hunter: it does not matter what he thinks of the tourism industry; what matters is what the tourism industry thinks of him.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Jagajaga for her question and for pointing out to the House that today this government introduced legislation before the Senate that will transform Australia's higher education and, in doing so, provide a world-class foundation for the economic and social growth and development of Australia. The government is proposing to invest over 10 years more than $10.6 billion of extra public money in universities, $1½ billion of extra money in the first four years, expanding HECS places, scholarships for students, their living expenses, and a whole variety of reforms to support regional and rural universities at the same time as increasing the core funding available to universities themselves. In fact it is interesting that the Labor Party, which has refused to be a constructive participant in the whole debate about the future of Australia's higher education sector, has taken the easy path of adopting three-quarters of the government's policy. It has opened the taxpayers' chequebook and basically put a tax on the mining industry to fund its policy. It is a Labor Party that cannot even do its sums. According to the federal Department of Finance and Administration, it has undercosted its policy to the tune of a minimum $260 million. The same Labor Party now belatedly seeks to be a player in this very important debate.I am asked about the attitudes of vice-chancellors. I point out to the House that today the incoming president of the Australian Vice-Chancellors' Committee has issued a media release. In part, Professor Di Yerbury said:We are prepared to go to the wire on this one. It is imperative that everyone understands where our focus lies and is aware that we are forcefully articulating our position to those who can provide the best outcome for the future of higher education in Australia.We cannot stress enough, the absolute urgency of the legislation being dealt with this year.....it is time for the direction and future of our education system to be clearly defined.... we are at a Crossroads and it is now imperative that we move our sector in the right direction and provide the best possible opportunities for the future of education in our country.In relation specifically to the matter that is raised by the Labor Party, it is entirely a matter for Australian universities as to what courses are offered in universities. But for the Australian taxpayer, who this year will put in excess of $6.8 billion of public money into universities, it is critically important, going into the future, that the taxpayers through the minister and the government of the day decide whether or not some courses will be funded.It needs to be put to the Labor Party that, at the moment in Australia, you have university courses in aromatherapy, the paranormal, skepticism, golf course management, surfboard riding and make-up application for drag queens. The Labor Party in the future may well want to absent the stage in deciding what will be funded in a university but, on behalf of the workers of Australia, this government will not.</DOC>

 - I am delighted to report to the member for Mallee and indeed the House that on 14 November the Murray-Darling Basin Ministerial Council agreed to a historic first step towards restoring the environmental health of the Murray system. The state Labor governments have agreed with the Commonwealth on a regime to improve the water flows and, particularly, on six iconic sites which should be given priority in the use of environmental water to improve the health of the system. These sites will use an average of around 500 gigalitres a year - that is more than the entire size of the Sydney Harbour - but it will be provided in a carefully managed way to deliver real outcomes. What has been remarkably successful about this agreement is that, even though a very significant amount of water will be made available, it will be done without compulsory acquisition on a `no regrets' basis. Essentially, it will come from improved management arrangements, new engineering works, water saving efficiencies on farms and the purchase of some water from willing sellers. This is a historic advance. It has been done in a great spirit of cooperation and has been warmly welcomed by irrigators, farm industry bodies and communities around the nation.That cooperation has of course been minus one obvious party - and that is the opposition. In the lead-up to the debate, the opposition spokesman was going around trying to lobby the states to get them to vote against and oppose this Commonwealth initiative. Labor are the only ones left in the country who are still mindlessly pursuing this idea that we should let 1,500 gigalitres flow down the river, not telling anybody where it is coming from, where it is going to or who is going to pay for it. It is significant to note that this 500 gigalitres agreed to by the Commonwealth and the states will achieve a whole lot more than Labor could ever have achieved with their 1,500 gigalitres. By carefully managing the water, we will deliver real outcomes in a way that is a win-win - a win for the environment and a win for the local community. This is a remarkable first step forward and leaves the Labor opposition completely out in the wilderness when it comes to real action on environmental reform.</DOC>

 - The Australian Labor Party, having refused for more than a year to constructively engage in any serious discussion - to which the Leader of the Opposition now laughs - about the future of university education in this country, now seeks to come in and have some sort of argument about fine technical detail. In his opening remarks at a forum in the University of Western Sydney last week, Professor Brown said, `Yes, I want the package to be passed.'What the Labor Party needs to be told repeatedly is that the Australian Vice-Chancellors' Committee and, in particular, the Group of Eight, of which Professor Brown is a key member, are in Canberra this afternoon for the next two days for one reason and one reason only, and that is to specifically lobby those members of the parliament who wish to constructively engage in discussion on Australia's future in education - and that does not include the Labor Party. As far as the Labor Party is concerned, whilst he is not a professor - though I think there is some merit, in terms of the sorts of courses the Labor Party would have funded, in making him a professor - the member for Werriwa, when quoted in the Daily Telegraph on 18 December 2000, said of the Labor Party, `We need to stop poncing around with education reform.'

 - I thank the member for Dobell for his question and his obvious interest in all things to do with employment and particularly Work for the Dole. I inform the House, and make it unequivocal, that Work for the Dole is a mutual obligation program that was commenced by this government that was put in place to ensure that those people who are receiving welfare payments actually, as the name says, work for what they receive - work for the dole. There is no apology from this side of the House for this program. It is a successful program, one that has been welcomed by the public around Australia and one that has added over 38,000 man years of work to this community and to this nation and to individuals.I am asked whether there are any alternative policies. When I put a press release out during the week suggesting to the Leader of the Opposition that perhaps he could once and for all give an unequivocal policy position on any one item, and particularly on Work for the Dole, it was in fact the member for Grayndler who responded when on 2SM he said, `Work for the Dole in its current form should be dismantled.' He did not agree with the name and he did not agree with its policy initiatives. In other words, get rid of the program as it stands, get rid of the fine work that is being done and get rid of the opportunities that it has provided. - The Leader of the Opposition interjects. The fact is, although the principal objective of Work for the Dole is mutual obligation, if you take the closest thing to it that the Leader of the Opposition put in place when he was in government, this program provides a 50 per cent greater opportunity to get work than the Labor government provided - a 50 per cent better chance. A recent study by Professor Neville from the University of New South Wales concluded that Work for the Dole actually improved participants' opportunities, and he went on to say that Australia has a compulsory work experience program which is more successful than similar schemes overseas.The last word should be given to one of the member for Dobell's own constituents, who was reported in the Central Coast Herald on Friday, 21 November. I would like to read a couple of paragraphs out of this particular news item. It says, `Before he got started on the Work for the Dole program Stuart was not keen on the idea. He has had to change his mind. He has come out of the program run by the Oasis Youth Centre in Wyong feeling positive about the contribution he has made to the community and the sorts of skills he has been able to use and acquire. He completed a graphic design degree last year.'This is a Work for the Dole participant who completed a graphic design degree last year and who was unable to find work. He said that the program, which was nothing like what he had come to expect through media reporting - and we would expect that when we hear the drivel from the members opposite - has helped him to brush up his skills. In other words, it has made him more employable. Work for the Dole continues to work for individuals and this country.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. For years in Australia it has been broadly agreed that low-level air space in Australia in particular needs reform. Our systems are essentially now based on models developed prior to 1950. Technology has moved on enormously since then, as has best practice internationally. The system that Australia is broadly moving to, it ought to be understood, is the North American system; that is what NAS stands for. - The Leader of the Opposition has apparently now become an expert on aviation safety and wishes to advise us that the North American air space system is unsafe. America is roughly the same size as Australia. It has far more aviation activity in its skies than Australia and, of course, it has more inclement weather than Australia has. - The fact of the matter is that the government -  - Aviation safety is purportedly important in the eyes of the Leader of the Opposition. Would you like the answer? - He would like the answer!  - The fact is that the airline companies, the RAAF - the Royal Australian Air Force, hardly known for taking safety flippantly -  - and a whole range of aviation experts -  - believe that this is the appropriate model for reform of air space in Australia. But, further to that, the bodies charged with aviation safety in Australia - plainly CASA, the regulatory body, and Airservices, who are charged with the responsibility for managing air space - have run this through exhaustive appropriate analysis to ascertain its safety. They are satisfied with the direction in which the process is being taken. - We are not ignoring them. The Leader of the Opposition charges that we are ignoring them. There has been exhaustive consultation. There is a campaign going on at the moment by the air traffic controllers - I don't deny that. It is not the first time it has happened. It has happened before; it will no doubt happen again. But the objectives of the government relate to maintaining our outstanding standards in relation to aviation safety, harmonising internationally and seeking through that process not only to improve safety in the future but to improve Australia as an international aviation market, as an opportunity and a place where people will come and train and where we can hopefully grow aviation in the future. But I make the point again that the body charged with establishing whether or not it is safe is CASA, the Civil Aviation Safety Authority. It has done safety tests and will continue to do so.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Eden-Monaro for his question and I acknowledge his concerns to ensure that we get more doctors and nurses into general practices in rural and regional Australia - concerns that will be substantially addressed by the MedicarePlus package. The MedicarePlus package is a significant improvement to the Medicare system. It is a substantial structural improvement to the existing Medicare system. The brand new MedicarePlus safety net will protect Australians from significant out-of-pocket medical expenses and it closes a substantial gap in the existing Medicare system.In 2002 there were 50,000 concession card holders who faced out-of-hospital, out-of-pocket medical expenses exceeding $500. In 2002, 30,000 Australian families faced out-of-hospital, out-of-pocket medical expenses exceeding $1,000. These people deserve protection and they deserve protection now. I want to make it clear that the new MedicarePlus safety net does not just cover general practice costs; it covers the cost of visits to specialists and diagnosticians, and it covers the costs of out-of-hospital medical treatments such as radiation oncology. This safety net will benefit an average of 200,000 Australians a year, but all 20 million Australians will benefit from the security of knowing that they will never face crippling out-of-pocket health care costs. For the last five months, the Senate has been inquiring into the Medicare system. That Senate inquiry received 226 written submissions and heard from more than 170 witnesses. This subject has been well and truly inquired into and there is no reason at all why the Senate needs to hear the same people say the same things over and over again. There is no reason why the Senate cannot decide this matter now. A further Senate inquiry would simply prolong uncertainty over health policy. So I call on the Senate to approve MedicarePlus this week.</DOC>

 - I did not call a crisis meeting -  - Because there has been no need to call a crisis meeting. There has been a regular period of extensive consultation across the industry. I believe that all players have had their say and they will continue to have their say. This is not being introduced overnight. An earlier question went to a narrow extract from an email that was sent from the then acting head air traffic controller, Phillip Faulkner, to some colleagues in the industry. That is purported to have this officer saying that this system is not safe. The officer himself has directly confirmed that NAS stage 2b, which begins on the 27th of this month, is safe.So much for the scare campaign from the Leader of the Opposition and the opposition spokesman for transport, who seek to politicise a process which they know full well has involved a full safety check-off from the body which is responsible for aviation safety in Australia - CASA - and which they know full well has been, if you like, broadly directed by a group known as the Aviation Reform Group and headed by the head of my department. It has involved the RAAF, Airservices and CASA and there have been endless discussions, precisely because we wanted to avoid the politicisation of this needed reform in the way that we saw five years ago and precisely so that we could ensure that there was wide based consultation.It is interesting to note that we brought out a couple of American experts to travel the length and breadth of the country and explain to people in aviation what was involved and let them ask the hard questions - and these reforms are based on the North American system; I think that international harmonisation would of itself suggest to people that this is a sensible safety direction to take - and it was only after those experts left that the members opposite seek to try and join in this process of politicisation of aviation safety. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Riverina for her question and her interest in small business. Today the Sensis Business Index - Small and Medium Enterprises was released - it was previously known as the Yellow Pages index - and it revealed that the confidence of small and medium sized businesses continues to increase, taking it to the highest level since 1994. Because the honourable member comes from Riverina she would know and be interested in the fact that regional businesses in New South Wales were the most confident, having recorded a confidence level of 75 per cent - no doubt influenced by good parliamentary representation in New South Wales. Looking ahead, some 83 per cent of respondents believed the economy will be performing as well or better than now, and perceptions of the Australian economy, according to this small business survey, are at the highest level since the index commenced. So small business is reporting expectations of continued economic growth and strong confidence, and expectations are at the highest level since the index began.I am sure both sides of the House would welcome the fact that the economy is strong and that small business is recording that kind of confidence. That backs up the ACCI small business survey, which was released last week, reporting that general business conditions have improved markedly, and that is consistent with the fact that the Australian economy continues to grow. We grew faster than any of the G7 economies in 2001-02. The Economist predicts that the Australian economy will be the fastest growing in 2003 and the second-fastest, incidentally, in 2004 as the US economy recovers. But we will not be disappointed by that: a strong US recovery will lead to a strong global recovery.Strong economic management does not happen by chance. It is not the outcome of chaos theory, which seems to be the guiding principle behind the Labor Party's economic attempts these days. It comes from disciplined and stable management in the economic portfolio, rather than the chaos theory management that the opposition seem to prefer. That is the way the coalition will continue, with sound, disciplined, purposeful economic reform, which provides confidence for small business and jobs for more Australians.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Flinders for his question. I know he has been very close to many of these NGOs, such as CARE Australia, over a number of years. The government condemns the attack on CARE's Baghdad headquarters which took place on Friday. Sir William Deane, who is the Chairman of CARE Australia, rang me on Saturday and told me about the attack and about CARE's decision not to close their operation, which has about 70 Iraqis working in it, but to withdraw around six expatriate staff from Baghdad to nearby Jordan. Fortunately no-one was injured in the attack, CARE Australia has told me, and I think it is right to say that the attack happened during the course of the night.The self-proclaimed perpetrators of this attack are called the Iraqi Resistance, and they have issued a death threat demanding all international aid staff leave Iraq before the last day of Eid, which is this week. The government cannot verify the credibility of this threat but it does continue to advise Australians against travelling to Iraq, as we have done for a long time. We understand the need for NGOs to take precautions, but we hope the draw-down of staff will be temporary because their work is vital for the Iraqi people. CARE, for example, is repairing water sanitation and health care infrastructure in Iraq and is assisting schools for the disabled. The government has given CARE $A4 million for these activities.Let me just make this clear to the House: the terrorists who have committed this outrage and many other outrages in Iraq will not prevail in their campaign, which is designed to restore the Ba'athist regime of Saddam Hussein. We are implacably opposed to the restoration of that evil and barbarous regime and, more to the point, most of the people of Iraq are implacably opposed to the restoration of that barbarous regime. We will not allow these sorts of attacks, we will not allow this sort of intimidation to bend our resolve to ensure that the people of Iraq are able to live in peace and freedom in the years ahead.</DOC>

 - Let me make it very clear to the member for Lalor that the safety net has universal coverage.  - Every single Australian is now eligible for the brand-new MedicarePlus safety net. Obviously some people are eligible for the $500 threshold and some people are eligible for the $1,000 threshold. Those who are eligible for the $500 threshold are those with concession cards or those who are receiving family tax benefit part A. That is very clear, but what is even more clear is that, thanks to the MedicarePlus package, all Australians have access to a brand-new safety net that they did not have access to before and that they will not have access to if members opposite have their way.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Blair for his question. I certainly am aware of the comments from some quarters that we should have kept the crew here in Australia to prosecute them. I think it is important to recognise that, when that is possible and when it is safe in terms of the people who may be on the vessels, those prosecutions do occur and have occurred very frequently. In fact it was this government that increased the penalties for organisers of illegal entry groups of five or more. We doubled the maximum penalty to 20 years in jail, we provided a minimum sentence of five years in jail and we also introduced a fine of up to $220,000. In recent years many boat crews have been convicted and sentenced to very lengthy terms in jail. Twenty-seven people are currently serving sentences, including two who were jailed in 2001 for eight years and others who are serving terms ranging from 2½ to seven years. Several alleged organisers have also been extradited to Australia and are now subject to arrest warrants in relation to their activities. Dozens of boats have been seized and destroyed.This has been an important signal to people smugglers, but the strongest signal sent to people smugglers occurred in 2001 when four boats were returned to Indonesia. That was the strongest signal that has been sent. Those four boats carried hundreds of potential unauthorised arrivals back, and at least one was organised by one of the largest people smugglers in the business. When he failed, it sent shock waves through the smugglers' ranks, and their customers came to them and told them, `If you can't deliver us to Australia, we're no longer intending to pay you.' That is the advice that they were given and, of course, people have not been prepared to part with money to people smugglers to arrange voyages in expectation that their vessels would be interdicted and they would not reach their destination. That is the reason that this has been the strongest signal sent yet. It is one of the reasons that we have had only two boats approaching our shores in the last two years.It is necessary to contrast that with what the opposition is now saying. The opposition is now saying, `Keep the crew here.' It is saying that we should either forsake the opportunity of returning the people who were being trafficked or, alternatively, put them on a vessel without a crew, where their lives would be at risk. You have only got two courses open to you, but that is what you are saying. We have sent a very strong signal to people smugglers and their customers that they will not succeed. We know, particularly after what we saw in the Senate yesterday, that the Labor Party wants to knock right off the table the very important legs of our policy which has succeeded. That is what it wants to do. Labor's message is that it will unwind border protection and will send to smugglers the signal, `Get back into business.' Let me say that we are not soft on border protection, and we will determine in each case the best way of ensuring that smugglers do not think that they are achieving their ends. </DOC>

 - I regret to inform the member for Lalor that there are very many government benefits which require the notification of that kind of information. That is the way the system works. The MBS safety net will work in exactly the same way that the PBS safety net works. People who wish to claim the MBS safety net will have to notify their family structure to the Health Insurance Commission in exactly the same way that they have always had to notify their family structure to the Health Insurance Commission for the purpose of accessing the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme safety net.   - This is exactly the same way that it has always been done.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Canning for his question. I know how concerned he is about this issue. There are a lot of reasons why the government has a tough approach to illegal migration and people-smuggling. To put it into a global context, there are about four million people a year who are smuggled or trafficked across international borders, generating an estimated $US10 billion worth of revenue. This is a massive business. According to Interpol, it is comparable with the profits made from drugs and arms smuggling. So, whatever political criticisms the government suffers, we regard it as important to counter this evil trade.We have taken tough measures, with our regional neighbours - through the Bali process; through bilateral cooperation, in particular with Indonesia, obviously; and through the establishment of offshore processing centres in Nauru and Papua New Guinea. These are all important components of our border protection policy, but we must have deterrents here in Australia in order to reduce the `pull factor'. Of course, that is why the government has taken the decisions that it has taken on excision, which was once supported by Labor and is now apparently opposed by Labor. There is no doubt at all that, if people smugglers can convince people that they can deliver them to the shores of Australia, then those people smugglers will get business and more business. There is simply no doubt about the logic of that argument. Therefore, it is crucially important to continue with the strong and successful policies we have to stop those people getting to our shores.Is there an alternative approach? Yes, there is Labor's approach, which will put the people smugglers back in business. They will abandon most of what the government is proposing and allow the people smugglers to deliver people to Australia. The only positive proposal that comes from the Labor Party is to establish a coastguard, which, according to the member for Gellibrand, would involve three motorboats covering thousands upon thousands of square kilometres of sea, where there are 500 fishing vessels at any one time, but no excision, no offshore processing and no strong stance by the Australian government to deter the people smugglers. What would the coastguard actually do? It is a very interesting question to ask. Labor's coastguard would bring the boats to Australia! That would be the job of the coastguard. It would not be to turn the boats back, which Labor is opposed to. Labor's coastguard would become a `coast guide'. Bringing people to Australia would be its only role. All I can say is that this simply underlines the bankruptcy of the Labor Party's approach to dealing with the evil trade of people-smuggling. </DOC>

How many cancer specialists bulk-bill? The answer is very, very few. It is precisely to address the kind of situation that people like that quite often find themselves in -  - that we now have the Medicare Plus safety net.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Cook for his question. I can tell him that it is very important that we keep a competitive income tax system in this country. It is one of the reasons the government introduced $12 billion per annum of income tax cuts on 1 July 2000 and why we cut income tax by another $2.4 billion per annum commencing on 1 July this year. One of the things that the government proposed as part of its tax plan was to take the threshold for the top marginal rate, which was $50,000, and increase it to $75,000. That was the plan we took to the election, that was the plan we introduced in the parliament and that was the plan which the Labor Party, led by the member for Hotham, opposed on the grounds that they were opposed to giving tax cuts to the so-called rich - as if people earning between $50,000 and $75,000 these days can be considered rich.If the Labor Party had supported our tax plan, that would be the threshold today. But unfortunately the Labor Party did not support it. So you can imagine how pleased we were to see the member for Werriwa come out recently and endorse the government's position by saying that people earning up to $80,000 a year deserve tax cuts. He had the opportunity to vote for that policy. Not only did he not vote for it, but, along with the member for Hotham, when he had the chance he voted against it. I always say, `Don't listen to what the Labor Party says; look at what the Labor Party does.' The big hero of the tax cut, the member for Werriwa, when he had his golden moment in this parliament, did not have the courage to nail himself to the floor and vote for those tax cuts.We welcome the conversion of the member for Werriwa to our policy. Unfortunately he seems to be rather lonely in this position. No sooner had he put forward the position that people earning up to $80,000 deserve income tax cuts than colleagues, one after the other, came out to shoot him down. It was like the opening of the duck season. They came out one by one. The member for Grayndler came out and shot him down. The member for Lilley came out on a rooster shoot to shoot the duck, saying that he was sick of the constant drumbeat for changes to the top marginal tax rate. The member for Sydney got into the action, saying that her priorities - Mr Speaker, why are all their heads down at the moment?  - Mr Speaker, it is just that when it falls silent I get very worried. The member for Brand came out next. He said, `You've got to look at what's happening to middle Australia, not upper income earners.' The member for Fremantle, who is the new ALP president - congratulations! -  - Her mother is sick; fair enough. -  - We understand completely. - I understand completely. All our sympathies go to the member for Fremantle. Of course they do.We come to the member for Melbourne. Not only have we had the member for Grayndler, the member for Lilley, the member for Sydney, the member for Brand and the member for Fremantle but yesterday, in scenes which I have never seen before, we had published in the Australianresearch that was commissioned by the member for Melbourne to undermine the shadow Treasurer's endorsement of the government's position. It was given to the Australian, as commissioned from the Parliamentary Library, by the shadow minister for communications, Mr Tanner. After he had given the commissioned research against his own shadow Treasurer to the Australian, Mr Tanner said: Whatever the merits of tax cuts for high-income earners, it's not a smart political strategy for Labor.Whose political strategy was it for Labor? - Mine? No, it was actually the member for Werriwa's. The member for Werriwa came out and endorsed the government's position. Labor's communications spokesman went out and commissioned research from the Parliamentary Library and leaked it to the Australian. - Apparently the Leader of the Opposition, in the party room today, told his troops -  - that they had to -  - stop their public disagreements over tax policy. He said that he expected debate with discipline. A frontbencher, Kevin Rudd, came out saying: `We've had a few ragged moments in recent times. I don't think it's right to say it's all been hunky-dory.' That must be the understatement of the case. You will never hear it from us again, but on this one the member for Werriwa is right. People earning up to $80,000 do deserve income tax relief. They deserve that under our tax plan. It would have occurred if the Labor Party had voted for it. We call on the Labor Party to support that tax plan, even at this late hour.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Kennedy for his question. As the honourable member knows, for some years now - since, from recollection, 1983 - the Australian dollar has been on a floating exchange rate. It was floated by the Hawke government, as one of its early initiatives, towards the end of 1983. Bearing in mind that we have a floating exchange rate, ipso facto there are weeks when it is higher and weeks when it is lower against a variety of different currencies.In recent months, we have seen a significant depreciation of the United States dollar against a wide range of currencies, including the Australian dollar. It is worth observing, though, that the United States dollar, on the contrary, appreciated very substantially over a number of years as a result of international perceptions, particularly about the United States's technological lead over other countries. There has been a correction of that in the international marketplace. The market will find its way. The government's attitude to trade is that we make the most of the international environment we have to deal with. Unlike the Labor Party, which believes that the only trade policy that is acceptable is a WTO negotiation, and whilst we support the WTO negotiations, we, for our part, are looking to get better access in a range of additional markets for the sorts of exporters that the honourable member refers to. We have a free trade agreement with Singapore and we have a free trade agreement now with Thailand, which is a wonderful achievement by the government. I acknowledge the role the Prime Minister played at the end of those negotiations with Prime Minister Thaksin.Finally, unlike the Labor Party, we support negotiating a free trade agreement with the United States, which again offers, potentially at least if the negotiations are successful, tremendous advantages to our exporters. That is the best thing for Australia to do in these circumstances, as well as continuing with our Export Market Development Grants program and support from Austrade.</DOC>

 - The honourable member for Kalgoorlie takes a keen interest in northern quarantine, and I thank him for his question. The federal government takes very seriously the importance of protecting our northern borders, especially from the threats that might be posed by the arrival of illegal entry vessels. These vessels may bring significant quarantine risks, including infestations of timber pests such as borers, mosquitoes and the like. The food carried on board could also carry some risks and, of course, the passengers may bring items that give concern in relation to our pristine animal and plant environment.There is widespread support, particularly among the island communities, for strict quarantine controls. Indeed, many of the island communities are vigorously engaged in the government's northern Australian quarantine strategy and are actively involved in assisting to ensure that no pests and diseases come into those areas. The government has provided $600 million to upgrade quarantine which was sadly neglected and allowed to run down under the previous government. We particularly appreciate the efforts of the Tiwi Islanders, who have demonstrated their interest in quarantine issues.It is important that there is a recognition of the shared responsibility between the enforcement agencies and the community to deliver good quarantine outcomes. The government recognises that contribution through quarantine awards. I am very pleased to tell the House that the Tiwi Land Council, due to its efforts in quarantine and its enthusiasm for protecting the environment of the Tiwi Islands, has received the regional award for quarantine services in the Northern Territory. Other Northern Australian people have also been recognised: Bruce Lansdown, who runs the Coen Information and Inspection Centre, has been recognised for the work that he does to inform visitors to the north about quarantine issues. I am sure the honourable member will be interested to know that the Shire of Roebourne is to receive the award for Western Australia for its particular role in dealing with the exposure to exotic pests and diseases in the port of Dampier. The government warmly appreciates the role of islanders - for example, the people of the Tiwi Islands, the Torres Strait Islands and other regions - for the keen interest they have taken in quarantine issues. They are helping to protect our borders, and they deserve the commendation and congratulations of the people of Australia on their outstanding efforts. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Port Adelaide for his question. There are a number of things that I can confirm. The first is that this government realises that Australian universities need reform, they need significant sums of money in the longer-term and they need changes to the way in which they are currently funded and regulated. I can confirm that in the state of South Australia the overenrolment at South Australian universities ranges from 2½ per cent at the University of South Australia to 10 per cent at Flinders University. I can also confirm that, in working through this package with those members of the Australian parliament that are prepared to take a constructive approach to these issues, I can guarantee in fact that the opportunities for university education in South Australia and right across Australia will expand under the proposals being put forward by this government. I can also confirm that if the Australian Labor Party were of a mind to get off the $10 billion of public money we are waiting to invest in Australian higher education over 10 years, all universities and future generations of students would sleep more easily.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Deakin for his question about union thuggery, of which the most recent and deplorable example was the attack last week on the National Secretary of the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union, Mr Doug Cameron. I note that after that attack, the Secretary of the ACTU, Greg Combet, said that he had been trying to get rid of thuggery in the union movement for years. Regrettably, this has shown that the ACTU and the union movement are unable to clean up their own backyard. In his recommendations and report on the royal commission into the building industry, Justice Cole indicated many examples of a culture of lawlessness in that industry, including chronic disregard of legally binding agreements and a culture of coercion and intimidation.  - I presume the member for Brisbane is not defending this. Recently, we have seen instances where union officials in three different courts have been guilty of thuggery, intimidation, threats and other poor conduct in this regard. That is why, as honourable members know, the response of the government to the royal commission is well known. It includes measures to clean up these inappropriate practices and measures to improve safety. Can I say to the House that, if we have come to the stage in Australia where a leading union official cannot walk outside his front door without being bashed, the time for talking is over and the time for action is now. It is time the ALP got behind the measures of this government to clean up the building and construction industry. </DOC>

 - I am asked about the views of Professor Ian Chubb, the Vice-Chancellor of the Australian National University. I can confirm as a result of meeting with and speaking with Professor Chubb early this morning that he is doing everything he possibly can to see that these reforms are passed by the Australian parliament.I should also inform the Australian public, contrary to the implications in that question, that under this government the first $1½ billion of extra public money in the first four years and the extra $10.6 billion of taxpayers' hard-earned money into the university sector in the first 10 years includes full funding for 25,000 overenrolled places that would otherwise disappear from universities and 6,500 extra HECS places. It includes extra money - $122 million - for 60 universities and campuses servicing regional and rural Australia. For the very first time in recent memory it includes $161 million for scholarships worth up to $6,000 for students to support their living costs. One other thing this government is determined to do is to see that those students, Australian citizens, who do miss out on HECS places determined primarily on merit - apart from the 40,000 who got a place by going through TAFE or using life experience or other opportunities given to them by universities - will have no less a right to be full fee paying students in an Australian university than the 118,000 international students we currently welcome to Australian universities. It is a travesty that the Australian Labor Party is proposing to ban and to throw out from Australian universities 9,700 Australians who currently pay their own way, without any support from the taxpayer, having been determined as eligible for university entry by those universities. Let us be very clear about this: the Labor Party is saying that the only way an Australian citizen will ever be able to have an opportunity for a full fee-paying place in an Australian university is to go overseas and sell their passport. We do not accept that. This is a policy that needs to be supported. It is supported by Australia's university leadership, and the Labor Party ought to get out of the way and let us get on with helping Australia.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Macquarie for his question. He shows a very strong commitment to Australian education and to university education in particular. We as Australians need to understand that, unless we undertake reform and change now, well within a decade and probably as early as within five years Australian universities will have sunk below the watermark of mediocrity. That is not something that I say lightly as Australia's Minister for Education, Science and Training; but it is absolutely critical that the Australian parliament pass the legislation for reform to enable us to invest significantly more resources of public money into Australian universities and to allow us to change the way in which universities are currently regulated and administered. If the reforms are not passed this year - and the Labor Party is doing everything it possibly can to see that they are not - then, in the first instance, 450 places will not be available in universities next year and $70 million of additional money will not be available immediately to universities. That means 210 regional nursing places and 234 medical places - and here is the Labor Party attacking the Minister for Health and Ageing about MedicarePlus at the same time that it is trying to actually stop this government creating more nursing places where we really need them, out in regional Australia, and supporting more doctors being trained for outer suburbs. Try and tell the member for Canning and the Peel region about the nurses that will not be there at Murdoch University.Here are the people that say they drive the social justice truck but, at the same time, as a result of Labor Party obstruction, 4,000 low-income students will not get scholarships to help them with their living and accommodation expenses next year. They cannot even cost their own policy correctly and then they want to oppose what the government is trying to do to build Australia's future. We will strengthen this country's future - we are determined to see these reforms through, and the Labor Party ought to get out of the way.</DOC>

 - In relation to the next three years of training, this government has put on the table $3.57 billion of extra money to support apprenticeships, training and TAFEs throughout Australia. That represents a 2½ per cent real increase per year in the first three years of the agreement. We are asking the states to contribute another 1½ per cent per annum real increase in funding. This government is proposing to fund at least an extra 71,000 places in the sector over the next three years. In relation to the Australian Labor Party, I think this is only the third question in two years that the Labor Party have been able to ask about training. There have been lots and lots of questions about middle-class people training to be lawyers, doctors and dentists - there have been endless questions about that - but they cannot even mention the word `apprentice' in a country where we have nearly 400,000 apprentices.What is important is that a lot of progress has been made in concluding this agreement. It is an unusual thing to say, but I must congratulate the states on the constructive way in which they have engaged in these discussions. As you would not be surprised to know, Mr Speaker, if the states were not to sign up to an agreement to create another 71,000 places then of course this government would make sure that we did everything we possibly could to see that Australia's interests came first and that there were training opportunities for apprentices in Australia. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. We are not reducing safety tomorrow in any way, shape or form. This campaign of misinformation that the Leader of the Opposition wants to engage in - in which he went so far yesterday as to claim to be a safety expert in aviation related matters, to the point of saying that he knew more than the Americans knew and that their airspace management system was unsafe - is simply not credible. Indeed, with regard to the American matter and quoting experts, I would have thought that a check and training 767 captain with Qantas might know a little bit about aviation safety. This captain sent me an email. He is an elected member of the committee of management of the Australian and International Pilots Association. He was briefly an air traffic controller prior to obtaining a job in general aviation. He is the general aviation association's representative on a number of bodies. In his email he said: I have flown extensively within the USA and know that this system is both safe and flexible for all users. I applaud you for introducing this system in the face of a barrage of criticism, which I consider to be uninformed and, in the case of air traffic controllers, to have an element of self-serving.We are introducing these changes because they will harmonise us with the aviation safety arrangements, in relation to airspace, which apply in America - a country where there is far greater aviation activity than Australia, where there are worse weather conditions -  - because the amount of controlled air traffic in Australia will increase, not decrease. - I will quote experts back to my opposite number, the transport spokesman for the Labor Party. When we were considering reforms to CASA - the Civil Aviation Safety Authority in Australia - he was given an opportunity for input. He drew his input overwhelmingly from a body called Air Safety Australia. He might like to read what they have to say about the new airspace arrangements. In a media release it concluded:The new airspace system is safe and well-proven. I support its adoption in Australia. The Minister for Transport and Regional Services, John Anderson, is to be commended for finally bringing this important part of aviation up to date.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Forde for her question. I can point out to her that MedicarePlus will give a big boost to doctors' incomes. A GP who bulk-bills 80 per cent of concession card holders and children under 16 will gain more than $15,000 a year. A GP who bulk-bills 100 per cent of concession card holders and children under 16 will gain nearly $20,000 a year. MedicarePlus will inject an extra $1 billion into doctors' incomes if they continue to bulk-bill their needy patients, as Dr Neal Blewett expected they would.MedicarePlus is the result of extensive consultation with minor parties and Independents in the Senate, with health professionals and, above all else, with members of the Australian public. Having gone through all this consultation, it is time to end the uncertainty over health policy, it is time to end the insecurity over medical costs and, above all else, it is time to pass MedicarePlus in the Senate this week. Yesterday, Dr Rob Walters, who is the head of the Australian Divisions of General Practice, which represents more than 90 per cent of Australian GPs, said that MedicarePlus should be passed without delay. Dr Bill Glasson, President of the AMA, said that Medicare needed another inquiry like it needed a hole in the head. Even the member for Werriwa thinks that inquiries are a waste of time. He said earlier this month that inquiries are just a political device to shove the responsibility elsewhere or to delay. Let us face it: he would know. He is the anointed one, anointed by Gough Whitlam as the next leader of the Australian Labor Party. Only a sick party would not want to help sick people. I call on members opposite to pass the MedicarePlus package and, above all else, to keep their hands off the bulk-billing incentive.</DOC>

 - Let me say at the outset that, while you call this my system, it is based on the North American system. It has had Qantas's full support. Is anyone in this House really surprised that, with any change of procedures, there would be an instruction that you work it through carefully at the beginning? You asked about the economic impact and the safety impact. The whole purpose of harmonisation in an upgrade is to improve safety and to improve the operating efficiency of aviation in Australia. It is to make certain that we have the air traffic control capacity to take things forward in the future.You play one so-called expert off against the other. I have letter after letter and expert advice after expert advice. None of them is more telling than the one I quoted from Air Safety Australia - the very people that I know the opposition transport spokesman refers to when he wants advice on aviation safety - saying that the new airspace system is safe, that it is well proven and that it is actually overdue. They commend the government - and this is the important point - on backing the experts, including CASA, who have done the safety case; Airservices, who run it; the Air Force; Qantas; and all the other people who have been involved in the design of this to ensure that we have a modern, up-to-date and harmonised set of airspace arrangements in Australia.Your resistance to this smacks of the same self-serving that the Qantas 767 captain that I quoted a moment ago found in some of the actions of air traffic controllers in recent days. This is not being done for some sort of blind ideological reason; it is being done to take forward aviation in Australia. You well know that. You are in contact with a lot of players in aviation. You know full well that the very people that you quote in this place - including in particular Captain Bill Pike, whom you often refer to in this place as the aviation expert that you trust - believe that these changes are overdue and much needed. </DOC>

 - As I have said on a number of occasions, the regulation of real estate agents is a matter which is done at the state level and always has been done at the state level. This matter has been discussed previously at ministerial council. On 1 August 2003, the Commonwealth and the states agreed to set up a working party to establish a common framework in relation to property investment marketeers - that is, not the real estate agents but property investment marketeers. The working group is chaired by the Queensland government. If there are any complaints about delays, no doubt the member for Werriwa will be directing them to the Queensland government, which is chairing this group. The Queensland government says it will be issuing a report next March. No doubt the member for Werriwa will be directing his complaints to Mr Beattie and the Queensland government.Can I also say in relation to the Kaye matter, as I have said in this parliament on a number of occasions, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission has the power to prosecute for false and misleading conduct and the Australian Securities and Investment Commission has the power to enforce the Corporations Law. As I understand it, both bodies have outstanding matters against the Kaye group, and it may well be that some of their actions have contributed to the recent events which we have seen in the last 24 hours or so. Far from the Commonwealth agencies being somehow lax in the matter, the Commonwealth agencies were both engaged, and it may well be that it was their actions that led to this current situation. But if one wants to go further in relation to investment marketeers with a new set of laws, that is a matter which is being chaired by the Queensland government. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Indi for his question -  -  - Sorry; I thank the honourable member for Indi for her question, and for her interest in these matters, and for her wonderful representation of the people of Indi, and for the enthusiasm and commitment that she brings to the coalition parties in Canberra, and for her humility in receiving these compliments. Can I say to her that the government takes very seriously its responsibility to keep income tax rates at competitive levels. When this government was elected the top marginal tax rate cut in at $50,000 and, as part of its tax plan, the government took out the 34c and 43c rates which applied between $20,000 and $50,000 and introduced a new 30c rate, which was lower than both the rates that had applied. The government also took a policy to the 1998 election to lift that threshold for the top marginal rate to $75,000. After winning the 1998 election, I introduced legislation to lift that threshold to $75,000. That attempt to lift the top threshold to $75,000 was rigorously opposed by the Australian Labor Party. - That proposal was rigorously opposed by the Australian Labor Party. I will table the Hansard of 10 December 1998, in which the member for Hotham said:We oppose this proposition because of the fiscal profligacy of the government's planned personal tax cuts, as evidenced by the dramatic impact of the tax package on the forecast Commonwealth budget, reducing the underlying balance ... by $4.76 billion.So Labor opposed it because they said that the tax cuts were too large, reducing the bottom line by $4.76 billion. He then said:We oppose it because of its unfairness in that 50 per cent of the tax cuts go to the richest 20 per cent ...The richest 20 per cent happen to be those above $50,000, and the tax cut for those above $50,000 was an increase in the threshold to $75,000. The personal explanation which the Leader of the Opposition made in the House yesterday was very carefully crafted. He said: Labor did not vote against either the second or the third reading in the House ...Why did Labor not vote against the second or third reading in the House? Because they voted for an amendment in the House which said that all words after `That' should be omitted and replaced with the following words:... that the bill be withdrawn and redrafted to produce a fairer tax system with no GST ... to overcome the following deficiencies:(1) the fiscal profligacy of the ... planned personal tax cuts - as evidenced by the fact that they would reduce the budget deficit by $4.76 billion and the unfairness in distributing the tax cuts to those above $50,000. So it was a really cute personal explanation to say, `We didn't vote against the second or the third reading because we moved an amendment to have the bill withdrawn.' I will also be tabling the vote which happened on 10 December 1998 on the opposition's second reading amendment to withdraw the bill. The question was that the second reading amendment be negatived. The government voted by way of ayes, and the noes included the member for Hotham and the member for Werriwa, Mr Latham. So it is rather cute to say, `We didn't oppose the government's proposal to lift the top threshold; all we did was move a second reading amendment to have it withdrawn on the grounds that it was too generous and it gave tax cuts of $50,000.' - If the Leader of the Opposition now wants to turn around and say - notwithstanding the record, which I table - that he never actually opposed increasing the tax-free threshold then he would be at liberty to revote for it. He would be at absolute liberty to vote for it now. - Mr Speaker, I also have a point of order. My point of order is that the member for Werriwa should not, on a point of order, allege a misrepresentation when plainly what I am doing is quoting from the Hansard and tabling the vote. - The record on that is absolutely clear, and if the Labor Party wants to come along now and say that it actually supports increasing that threshold to $75,000 then it is as simple as calling a press conference this afternoon and saying it - that is, that the Labor Party will now support an increase in that threshold to $75,000. We had thought that it was quite clear that the member for Werriwa was supporting that proposition on the front page of the Sydney Morning Herald and in other places. But after the opening of the duck season the duck has gone to water, because yesterday when he stood up here in this place and said that tax cuts were just for people on $60,000, $70,000 and $80,000 it did not actually mean he supported a tax cut for them; he was only identifying a problem.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Parkes for the question and acknowledge his very real concern about the provision of not just GPs and nurses but also, in places like Broken Hill, specialists - it is a real issue in far-flung big electorates like that. The broad reaction from rural medicos and their representatives has been extremely positive. They know that this will help relieve the shortage of doctors, nurses and specialists. They know that it will make it easier for their patients to access health care and that it will also make it more affordable. Further to that, they want these changes implemented now. They do not want any further obstruction.The Rural Doctors Association is an outstanding, well-headed group of people. Dr Sue Page, their current president, has issued a statement. What she has to say is worthy of repeating in this place. She says she joins with:... other GP and medical groups in calling on the Australian Senate to pass the MedicarePlus legislation and not to refer it to yet another Senate inquiry.She goes on to say:... we have already had the opportunity to present our views, concerns and policy requirements to the Senate at the Inquiry into Medicare - Furthermore - and this is quite germane - she says:... anyone would think that the Senate wasn't listening last time, if we have to do it all over again.She says:While we of course believe that community consultation is highly valuable and necessary on policy and legislative decisions - we also believe that this proposed inquiry would represent a considerable waste of taxpayer dollars and is unlikely to appreciably improve the Government's Medicare package ...That is what the very respected Dr Page has had to say. She has also welcomed the safety net. In fact, in very blunt terms she said:A form of safety net is vitally important for Australian families - rural and urban - and any delay will mean a delay in those families accessing the health and medical care they need now.I could not put the next comment she makes any better, so I will simply quote her:I call on the Labor Party, the Democrats and Independents not to refer MedicarePlus to a Senate Inquiry.The package is needed now. She puts it as eloquently and forcibly as anybody could from a position of understanding the need.</DOC>

 - This government believes, in the same way that the political architect of Medicare, Dr Neal Blewett, believed, that doctors have a choice. They can charge people up front or they can bulk-bill people, and bulk-billing should be directed towards pensioners and other needy people. So what this government has done is to put in a specific incentive to make sure that the Medicare scheme continues to reflect the intentions of its founder. I should also point out to the member for Scullin that the bulk-billing rate in his electorate is currently, under the policies of this government, 85 per cent. The interesting thing is that members opposite want to pay doctors $7,500 a year to achieve an 80 per cent bulk-billing rate. So they want to pay doctors in the electorate of Scullin $7,500 to bulk-bill fewer people. That is the idiocy of the policy of members opposite. </DOC>

 - The agreement which was reached yesterday between the administrators of Ansett and the former employees is good news for former Ansett employees, many of whom live in the electorate of Cook. In September 2001 the Howard government acted decisively to protect the former Ansett workers' entitlements by putting in place the special employee entitlements support scheme. I can inform the House that the Howard government has met in full its commitments to these workers. Because of the strong and decisive action taken by this government, more than $336 million has already been paid to almost 13,000 terminated Ansett workers. Former Ansett workers have received all their unpaid wages, annual leave -  - long service leave, pay in lieu of notice and up to eight weeks redundancy pay under this government scheme. The decision by the Federal Court yesterday means that those former Ansett workers who still have money owing to them over and above that which was met by the $336 million advanced under the SEESA scheme will receive substantial additional payments from the Ansett administrators. I note the comments made this morning by Mr Mark Korda, the Ansett administrator, on Sydney radio. He said:The only reason we were able to distribute $150 million to the employees starting before Christmas is because the government - that is, the Commonwealth government - has come to the party and deferred payment of $67 million to it. - In contrast to the noise coming from the opposition, even the secretary -  - In contrast to the noise coming from the opposition, even the Secretary of the ACTU, Greg Combet, acknowledged yesterday:... an important factor in reaching agreement has been compromise by the Commonwealth government.The Howard government's actions are in deep contrast to Labor's abysmal record, over 13 years, of failing to do anything to protect the workers in this regard.  -  - The opposition do not like it, but this government, in stark contrast to this rabble of an opposition, will continue to make strong decisions to protect Australian workers.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Barker for his question. I know that his constituents very much share his concern that the government retain a strong stand on the issue of border protection - particularly those constituents who will be passed to the electorate of Mayo at the time of the next election. Four million people a year are smuggled or trafficked across international borders. As I explained to the House yesterday, people smugglers turn over an estimated $US10 billion, or about $A14 billion to $A15 billion. That is a lot of money made out of a grisly trade. Most governments around the world are now strengthening their domestic, regional and international systems to address this problem. European countries are particularly doing that, given that they have had long experience of high levels of unauthorised arrivals.In the case of Australia and the EU, we have increased dialogue and cooperation on these issues through our agenda for cooperation, a framework of partnership with the EU that I signed with Commissioner Patten in April this year. The EU is forming a common policy on these issues. The UK recently proposed tougher asylum laws to shorten the appeals process, to fast-track deportations and to prosecute those who arrive without travel documents. France has adopted new immigration legislation, increasing penalties for people-smugglers. Sweden has made people-smuggling an offence. Italy has introduced mandatory detention for illegal entrants. Turkey has adopted legislation criminalising people-smuggling. This is part of a pattern around the world whereby countries are taking a stronger stand on the issue of people-smuggling. - I am aware of another approach - a rather lonely approach - on this issue, and that is the approach of the Labor Party. The Labor Party want to do the reverse of what the rest of the world is doing. When they get into government, what the Labor Party want to do is abandon the excision policy altogether. The Labor Party want to sack the Navy from its task. They do not want the Navy involved in this task anymore. They want to introduce onshore processing and what they call a coastguard. We know from statements by the Leader of the Opposition that he has a job for the coastguard - three motorboats floating around there off the north-western coast of Australia.   -  - They are surely not going to be sailing boats. They are not proposing that. We will give them credit. - You question that they would be motorboats, but I think they would be motorboats, not sailing boats. The bureaucracy will tell you they have to be motorboats, believe me. There would be three motorboats, and they would be the coastguard. And what is the coastguard going to do when it finds these boats? What the coastguard is going to do is say, `This is the way to Australia, to the processing facilities.' This is not going to be a coastguard; this will be the coast-guide. This is what Labor propose: three motorboats to tell the people smugglers where to deliver the illegal migrants who have paid to get to Australia. That is a policy that is a very expensive way of trying to stop a problem which Labor would only exacerbate with the introduction of their new coast-guide.</DOC>

 - It is true that the government has spent some money on advertising. I am not going to quibble with the $600,000 figure that the member for Lalor quotes. - That figure is dwarfed by the $700-odd million that the state Labor governments have spent advertising their policies and programs over the last two years, but I am not going to apologise. I am not going to apologise for the fact that we have spent a modest and reasonable amount of taxpayers' money advertising changes that will benefit them. I am not going to apologise for that. To quote from a news report from Brisbane on 19 November this year, a newsreader said:Premier Peter Beattie has defended the Prime Minister's right to spend taxpayers' money promoting the changes to Medicare.And what does he say? He says:I don't actually have a problem with it, in the same way that I think if you are announcing your programs you should advocate that, so I do not have any criticism of the Prime Minister doing it, to be perfectly honest.That is Premier Beattie: a decent Labor leader; a successful Labor leader. Maybe he is going to come down to Canberra and replace this dud Labor leader. He is right, and the members opposite are wrong. </DOC>

 - I do thank the member for Fairfax for his question, because the member for Fairfax is obviously concerned, as I am, about the very significant growth in the volume of litigation before all of our courts involving migration matters. It is placing a significant strain on the courts themselves and it is also causing very considerable inconvenience to Australian litigants, who are finding it increasingly difficult to get their matters promptly heard. I note that in 2002-03 two-thirds of the appeals in the Federal Court of Australia have been on migration matters, and last financial year 82 per cent of the matters filed in the High Court of Australia, in both its original and appellate jurisdictions, involved migration matters. That is an unacceptable situation in terms of the volume of work that is being given to the courts in what are primarily unmeritorious matters.What is the evidence of that? The evidence is quite clear: something like one-third of the matters before the Federal Court and the federal magistrates courts last financial year were withdrawn by the applicants before they got to a hearing. If you look at the outcome of the litigation - and the outcome, I think, is the most important measure - the government either wins or the applicant withdraws in 93 per cent of the cases involving migration questions. We want to see this issue dealt with. I have established a review to look at further ways in which these issues can be addressed. That review will look at how we can improve the tribunals' capacities to make better decisions. It will look at ways to streamline the judicial review process. It will look at how we can re-examine the grounds for judicial review and the information made available to the courts in that process. It will also look at the role of advisers in relation to unmeritorious cases.Let me conclude by saying that one of the very important aspects associated with this is to ensure that we do not see the arrival of further people who are likely to enter into the court system abusively with a view to remaining here in Australia. One of the things that we have to guard against is allowing further unlawful border arrivals, which will only put that system under further stress.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Lalor for her question and I simply point out to her that Medicare has been subject to a five-month long Senate inquiry, ending just a couple of weeks ago. In fact, they had a five-month inquiry that took 226 written submissions and had more than 170 witnesses. We changed the package in part in response to that inquiry, it is in the Senate for two days - two days! - and now they want another inquiry. - When will these people stop? When will enough be enough for members opposite? - I have respect for Professor Dwyer; I think he is a fine man and I think he has made a lot of constructive suggestions over the years on medical policy. But I respectfully say to Professor Dwyer and members opposite: enough is enough. This matter has been well and truly chewed over; it is now time to decide, and there is nothing stopping the Senate from deciding the safety net legislation this week - and they should.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Farrer for her question. It is fitting that she should ask this question at a time when a thousand or more local government representatives are gathered here in Canberra for the annual congress of the Australian Local Government Association. This government is very much aware of the effectiveness of local governments in tackling our environmental concerns. That is why local governments are playing such a very key role in the major environmental rescue packages that this government has put in place through the Natural Heritage Trust and the national action plan for salinity.As the member for Farrer says, local governments are also proving to be very effective campaigners in greenhouse gas abatement. The Howard government has invested some $15.7 million in the Cities for Climate Protection Program, which is administered by the International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives, and Australian local governments have proven to be extremely effective in implementing this program. Over four years the councils have invested some $70 million - that is a pretty good leverage for the government's investment of $15 million - and they have achieved abatement of 1.8 million tonnes of CO2, equivalent to the nearly three-quarters of a megatonne achieved last year. Australia in fact has the fastest uptake of participating local governments of any country in the world in this international program, with over 180 councils taking part and 75 per cent of the population covered. This approach, which has been so successful with greenhouse gas, has also got the potential to be very effective with water, and on Monday this week I announced that the Howard government will be providing $1 million to establish a partnership between local governments and the Australian government to promote better management of stormwater, grey water and water recycling in local communities. This water campaign has got the potential to empower local communities throughout Australia to take effective action to make sure that our scarce water resources are well used, and this will be a major contribution to moving this country further towards sustainability.</DOC>

 - In answering the question from the member for Jagajaga, I think it is worth pointing out to the House that we are approaching the 40th question on universities - which are not unimportant - and in this case the Labor Party's entire focus is on the career, employment and earnings outcomes for university graduates, and yet in two years we have not had a question about apprentices and the 70 per cent of kids who do not go directly from school to universities. In answer to the question from the member for Jagajaga in relation to the NATSEM study which looked at home ownership and income for university graduates and non-university graduates from 1986 to 1998, it ought to be pointed out to the member for Jagajaga and the entire Labor Party - who seem to have completely lost their way in relation to the real issues facing Australians, so they might be surprised to know this - that most Australians are not concerned with how women dentists, doctors, lawyers or vets are going to plan their third baby or buy their second house. Most Australians are actually concerned with how they are going to feed their kids, pay their car loans, pay their mortgages and try to get their kids into apprenticeships and training as much as into university. I point out to the member for Jagajaga that if she and her Labor Party colleagues read the research - and the Labor Party members ought to have a look at it - they will find that, over those 12 years, the incomes of the university graduates increased 11 times more than the incomes of the non-university graduates who pay for three-quarters of what happens in Australian universities. The Labor Party should, as I have said before, put Australia's interests first, support reform of Australian higher education and start to consider the needs of the people who pay for three-quarters of university education. The Labor Party should support the idea, as they once did when they led in 1989, that when graduates start working they ought to make a contribution to what they have received, and they should start asking some questions about apprenticeships. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dunkley for his question and for his very strong interest in innovation. Australia is very much a smart country, and the government are very much committed to helping small business turn those great ideas into commercial reality. We have a focus on the high-tech start-up companies so that they can grow and increase their exports to the world. A lot of these companies are small, one-idea companies which need every bit of assistance they can get while they live off the smell of an oily rag as they attempt to commercialise their ideas. That is why in 2001 we changed the R&amp;D tax concession to help these companies with their commercialisation. Companies turning over less than $5 million are now eligible for an R&amp;D tax offset. This offset is seen by many of these small companies, particularly the biotech start-ups, as the most effective measure that we have in our innovation package, and some 1,600 have applied for this measure. This is good because we are seeing innovation continue to drive economic growth in our economy. That means that we see a growth in jobs, a growth in exports and a growth in the economy itself. We have seen companies in fact increasing their expenditure by 13 per cent in the last 12 months to some $5.5 billion.I am asked how this assists our economy, and the outcome is clear. The thing that concerns me the most though is that the Labor Party has a policy to abolish the tax offset. Kim Carr's idea of promoting innovation is to abolish this measure which is recognised by many companies as the best part of our innovation package. It simply demonstrates that Labor continues to be anti small business, anti innovation and anti jobs.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Grayndler for pointing out to the House just how well the Australian economy is going under the leadership of the Australian government and the effectiveness of the policies being pursued by this government. That stands in contrast to when Labor was in government federally, when, as the Sunday Herald Sun reminded us in June 1992 under the editorial entitled `A national disgrace': A desperate father is offering an employer $100 a week for three years to give his son an apprenticeship yet there is still no taker.Youth unemployment in Victoria was running at that stage at 46 per cent. If the member for Grayndler had an interest in training and apprenticeships, which seems to be something recently discovered, the Australian Labor Party would be urging the states to sign up to the Australian government's $3.6 billion funding agreement in relation to the Australian National Training Authority.He might also like to ask the Queensland government why it is planning to reduce apprenticeships in the automotive industry by 12½ per cent over the next year and apprenticeships in the building and construction industry by 4.4 per cent. He ought to start listening to Commerce Queensland, who ascribe to the Queensland Labor government a contraction in apprenticeship places in Queensland of some 15 per cent over the next year. The Labor Party ought to support the signing of the agreement and the 71,000 places that will be created by this government in the offer that is on the table.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Mallee for his question and his continuing interest in science and innovation, evidenced as recently as last Friday by his attendance at the opening of the freshwater research laboratory in Mildura. He championed its establishment for a good while. I also understand that he is the only one amongst us in this House who has a Master of Science. Therefore, his contribution in government forums is very important.The assistance and involvement of research and innovation in rural areas is greatly enhanced by Backing Australia's Ability. It contains everything you need to know about science and innovation - the commercialisation of it, the collaboration, the training and the educational aspects. This is a revolutionary document. It injected $3 billion of new funding into the science and innovation system and it has brought tangible results to both the public and private sectors.For instance, a large part of the research is conducted in regional and rural Australia. Of CSIRO's 6,500 member work force, more than 1,000 work outside our capital cities and two-thirds of their laboratories are located in rural and regional Australia, which means more jobs for local communities and focused research results. More than half of CSIRO's operating expenditure in this financial year is dedicated to research relevant to the industries and environment of regional and rural Australia. Cooperative research centres are also greatly expanded under Backing Australia's Ability. There are some 71 of them, and 11 of them are regionally based. A great many more directly or indirectly work with regional Australia. The Backing Australia's Ability document is 78 pages in length, closely typed, and it sets out the government's vision, policies and actions. I am asked about alternative policies. There is an alternative policy from the Labor Party. It was released on 14 October this year by the invisible, unknown shadow minister for science. I have the Labor Party's policy document here. I will read it:A national research and innovation strategy will be announced over the coming period ...That is their policy. That was six weeks ago and the clock is ticking. The meter is clicking over. Backing Australia's Ability is the government's policy and this is the Labor Party's policy. I table them in conjunction.</DOC>

 - Can I inform the member for Rankin and members of the House generally that this government is committed to choice and flexibility in the workplace. It is that choice and flexibility in the workplace -  -  - They do not like to hear about choice and flexibility in the workplace because they know that that has led to job growth and higher wages in Australia. The Australian Labor Party knows that the Liberal Party and The Nationals in government have been the parties that have delivered to the workers of Australia. They have delivered with 1.3 million extra jobs in the last seven years. They have delivered a real increase in full-time employee wages of over $90 compared to just $12 from 1985 to 1996 under the Labor Party. So this government is about more jobs and higher wages. Part of the way we have achieved that is through better choice and more flexibility in the workplace. We believe that that should apply to all sectors of the Australian economy, including higher education.</DOC>

 - I do put safety and efficiency in the aviation sector at the top of my priorities, well ahead of any political considerations here. Indeed, if you were responding politically, you would do nothing. If we are going to play this game of who says what, who supports this and who does not, let me simply remind the House that the Royal Australian Air Force supports this and CASA has clearly indicated that the systems are safe and able to be proceeded with. Airservices Australia, the deliverer of air services and airspace management in Australia, supports it.   - Nobody agrees with them, he says - what an intelligent comment! The RAAF agrees with them and my department agrees with them -  - I tell you what: I would listen to the secretary of my department on aviation safety before I listened to the Leader of the Opposition - I really would, any day. Qantas agrees with them, Virgin agrees with them, sport aviation agrees with them and so does Air Safety Australia. Let me reiterate the point I made yesterday: the opposition spokesman for transport, when he comments on aviation safety, up until now has always quoted that body - Air Safety Australia - and Bill Pike. That is who he has quoted and that is who he has relied on. Their position has been put on the table up until now. What do they say? This is long overdue and congratulations to the government for standing behind the aviation reformers who believe that these measures are necessary. Air Safety Australia supports it, along with AOPA - which has by far the biggest membership of anyone in the general aviation sector of Australia - as do countless pilots, particularly those pilots who have operated in similar situations in America. But, above all, who agrees with us that this is a safer, more productive and efficient system? The unbelievable number of people, including Australian pilots, who use it in the most populous aviation nation in the world - America.The case is overwhelming. We want to move away from a 1940s and 1950s model. We do not track aircraft any more with slips of paper on great big blackboards. We do not do it that way anymore. We have the world's most sophisticated air traffic management system in TATS. We need to adapt to modern technology and changing circumstances that will not only give us greater safety in the future and greater efficiency but also allow for the more rapid expansion of aviation in Australia. I think those are very desirable objectives.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Corangamite for his question. He is a very staunch supporter of the TCF industry, not only in his electorate but also right throughout Australia. He has brought a number of delegations to my office during the consultation phase, including local mayors, union representatives and owners of TCF industries. All of those owners of TCF businesses will be welcoming today the largest assistance package ever seen for the textile, clothing and footwear industry - some $750 million to boost innovation and assist small business, of which almost $580 million will be delivered in the first five years.As part of the package we will also be maintaining tariffs at 2005 levels for a further five years. Over the life of the package, the cuts in tariffs will be half or less than half of those which we saw under the previous Labor government, when the now Leader of the Opposition boasted that Labor had cut tariffs by 35 per cent. We are going to see through this program a continuation of the strategic investment program. Some $465 million has already been invested as a result of the current program and we will see that investment in innovation continue. As well as that, there is some $25 million for small businesses and some $50 million particularly for regionally based TCF businesses to adjust in terms of the rationalisation as well as to assist their workers. This is an extraordinarily generous package which will build the confidence and assist the growth of this industry through improving its competitiveness. We are doing everything we can as a government to support jobs in the TCF industry, to maintain and increase businesses and grow exports. The one thing that is missing from the assistance to the TCF industry is the support of the state governments. The Productivity Commission identified state taxes and charges as a major impediment to this industry. If those who sit opposite want to do something constructive as part of today's announcement, they need to go and talk to the Victorian ministers -  - The member for McMillan interjects. His state government is one of the worst in terms of imposing taxes on the TCF industry, and if he and those opposite want to do anything they should go and talk to their Labor counterparts and give the TCF industry in Victoria a go.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. You can never have no risk in aviation. I wish it were possible to have no risk in aviation, but you cannot. I hear claims about the inevitability of a mid-air crash and I think to myself that that would be a horrible outcome. It has been in the past; it has happened 36 times since 1961, and it has always been dreadful and it has always been appalling. Of course our objective is to keep our skies as safe as possible. I say quite openly to the parliament, as I have said many times: it is not my job, my responsibility or my training to be able to advise on every technical aspect of safety. That is why we have statutorily independent advisers to keep our skies safe, to advise on procedures and to run safety cases on new proposals.At every point the bodies responsible for determining how to maximise safety and whether new proposals are safe and whether modifications should be made have been fully involved in the design of what is essentially a proven international system and have made adjustments for localised circumstances where necessary. That has been their task. At every stage they have been involved and at every stage they have made themselves available. They are certainly available to the opposition spokesman for transport. I would welcome him setting aside some time to go to where the implementation group is housed and talk to CASA, talk to Airservices, talk to the RAAF, talk to Qantas and talk to whoever he would like to talk to - I have nothing to hide here at all. I want this to be as transparent and as open a process as possible, but I am not going to wimp out on worthwhile reform which I believe will increase safety and help us to grow a bigger aviation sector in Australia, with more jobs and more opportunities for young people, and which has a real chance to increase our export performance, particularly in the area of education. We have attempted these reforms in the past. They have come unstuck because there has been inadequate training, or for whatever reason was given. The process this time has been exhaustive. I understand that by nature pilots in particular and air-traffic controllers are conservative. That is a good thing. There is a saying: there are young bold pilots but there are no old bold pilots. So it is important that their views be taken into account. But I have to say to this House that my conscience is clear and that I have set up procedures for exhaustive consultation. They are still there and I just wish that the member for Batman, who says that he does not believe in politicising aviation safety, would go and talk to all of the people who have put this together. And if he thinks that somebody would like some more consultation, he should take them along to. That would be a great service to aviation.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Boothby for his question and for his interest in health issues. I can assure him and all members of the House that MedicarePlus gives real peace of mind to all Australians because it provides the first effective safety net against potentially crippling out-of-pocket medical expenses. Because it covers the actual fee and not just the prescribed fee, it fills a very significant gap in the existing system. Last year 50,000 concession card holders faced out-of-pocket, out-of-hospital expenses exceeding $500 - that is, expenses for specialists, radiology, pathology, MRIs and radiation oncology. Last year some 30,000 Australian families faced out-of-hospital, out-of-pocket expenses exceeding $1,000. Fourteen per cent of Australians use medical services 20 times a year or more. These are the people whom the new safety net will protect, if only it is not sabotaged by the Australian Labor Party.If the legislation for this safety net is not passed until the end of February, the new safety net cannot become operational until April at the earliest, because you cannot train staff, you cannot inform families and you should not spend large amounts of money on new IT systems until legislation is passed. Even a month's delay means that thousands of Australian families could face millions of dollars in extra expenses.Low-income families who face high medical expenses are the most vulnerable families in our society. These are the people whom the Labor Party want to rip off. These are the people to whom the Labor Party want to deny the first effective safety net in the history of the Medicare system. Only a sick party would deny benefits to sick people. The problem is not Simon Crean; the problem is Labor. Labor are suffering a crisis of belief and a crisis of identity, of which today's crisis of leadership is just a symptom. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. Of course I am aware of that, but a great deal of Australia's landmass sees very little flying over by aircraft - very little indeed. Radar coverage in our heavily trafficked areas is very comprehensive. - One of the things that we have carefully worked through is the differences in Australian operating circumstances. As we work through this - and there is more to be done -  - I sense that the opposition transport spokesman wants to get involved in this debate, and that is a good thing. I trust that he will take up my offer - along with anyone who has contacted him directly and who would like to work through this in more detail - to go down to the implementation group, because there is a long way to go yet.Where there are particular and unique Australian circumstances, one of the things we - the ARG, the implementation group, CASA, Airservices and the private sector - have been very careful about is making sure we have got those covered with localised designs that need to be tailor-made. The opposition spokesman shakes his head in disbelief. As far as I am aware, he has not been down to the implementation group. - I again offer for him -  - and anyone who is interested in this, to go down there and have a talk to them, explain their concerns and interact with them. That would be a very valuable thing.</DOC>

The OECD has forecast that the Australian economy will grow by 3.7 per cent in 2004 and four per cent in 2005, again putting Australia at the top of the league of the stronger growing economies of the developed world. It is noticeable that that even includes countries that are coming out of recession. When a country comes out of recession it generally has a much faster level of growth. Our economy has not been in recession, yet we continue to grow as strongly as the leaders of the OECD. The OECD says that strong consumer confidence and a range of very positive business surveys point to continuing resilience in the domestic economy. Some remarks in the OECD report about housing in the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia note that households remain highly indebted and could suffer wealth losses should interest rates increase. The OECD said that such a back-up in interest rates cannot be ruled out in a context where all large OECD countries are now suffering from historically wide public deficits. But that is not Australia. Australia is not suffering from a wide public deficit. The Australian budget is in surplus for the sixth time under the eight budgets which have been brought down by this government. To compare Australia with the United States, the United States is suffering a budget deficit of about 3½ to four per cent. In Australian terms that would be a $30 billion deficit. It is a point that could be made in relation to the United States and, indeed, in relation to the United Kingdom, but Australia's fiscal position is strong.That is no accident. This is a government that has been driving the Australian budget into surplus, notwithstanding the attempts of the Australian Labor Party to defeat our program. Today's capital expenditure survey also confirmed that there are high levels of confidence being translated into expenditure plans, showing that total new capital expenditure increased by 4.1 per cent in the September quarter, to be 13.9 per cent higher over the year. We see an economy which continues to grow and which has strong consumer sentiment, strong business sentiment and strong business investment. All of that comes from consistent economic policy.You cannot have an economic policy that changes from one day to the next. You cannot have an economic policy where people throw up ideas which they dispense with within 24 hours, where they move from contradictory policy to contradictory policy. It just will not work; you cannot manage an economy like that. And I say this to the Australian Labor Party: when they are looking for an economic spokesman they want somebody who can show some stability in the role, who can take a policy and can defend it.  - The member for Rankin comes in on cue; he is no doubt thinking about who the economic spokesman should be for the -  - The member for Griffith comes in on cue; he is no doubt thinking about who the economic spokesman for the Labor Party should be, in between the photo shoots that he has been conducting over the last 24 hours. It is important that we have consistency in relation to economic policy, and I would urge the Australian Labor Party to think about that quite carefully in the decision making that they are undergoing at the moment.</DOC>

 - I actually have the short-term interest rates from the preliminary edition from the OECD which has a short-term interest rate for Australia in 2004 at five per cent. So the question is premised on a false allegation. Here it is in this table. The short-term interest rate for 2004 is at five per cent. The OECD had a different premise for 2005. Mr Speaker, it is in the table, and it only has to be read to get the question right. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Robertson for his question. He is a very strong advocate for the University of Newcastle, as are the members for Dobell and Paterson. This parliament is on the verge of deciding whether or not we will strengthen this country's future by significant and much-needed reform for Australian higher education. There is significant support for these reforms the length and breadth of Australia's higher education sector. In the Central Coast Express Advocateon 21 November, the Pro Vice-Chancellor of the University of Newcastle, Professor Terry Lovat, said:If we let this package fall through, we are not going to go anywhere. To simply say no to these reforms will be disastrous for the sector. What are we going to say to the young people we won't have places for if this reform is not passed?The article went on to say:The essence of the plan is positive, staying where we are has no future, especially in a region such as this with our booming population, Professor Lovat said. At the heart of the reform, he went on to say, is a plan for growth.I would also point out to the House, and obviously to the member for Robertson, that the University of Newcastle will receive a minimum extra $19 million in the first three years of these reforms. I would also draw the attention of the House to a letter that has been sent by the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Newcastle to every member of the Australian Senate. In part it says: The current Higher Education legislation is a product of more than eighteen months collaboration, discussion and hard work by the Federal Government and Australia's universities, and provides an important map for our future. It represents our best chance for additional funding and some welcome policy changes for more than fifteen years, and if this opportunity is not grasped immediately, then I fear we will be seriously compromised in terms of our future.Australia's future will be driven by many things. This government is absolutely committed to doing what is right for Australia and what is right for Australian universities in driving that future. There is $1½ billion of extra public money that this government is waiting to invest in Australian universities in the first four years to expand HECS places, provide scholarships for students to help them with their living costs at university and provide significant and much-needed resources for regional and rural universities. I urge all members of the Australian parliament, particularly the members of the Senate, to think seriously about the future of this country and the need for university reform. In that regard, I table a letter from Professor Holmes and a letter from Professor Lovat to every senator in the Australian parliament, and I thank at least the members on this side, and in particular the member for Robertson, for putting Australia first.</DOC>

 - What is obvious in the question from the member for Bass, unfortunately, is that she does not understand these reforms. There are a couple of issues -  - What the Leader of the Opposition is doing now is the very reason why he has troubles with his backbench. -  - Firstly, the Victorian College of the Arts will receive an increase in funding under this package. The member for Bass should be informed that I have advised the Director of the Victorian College of the Arts, which is funded through Melbourne University, that it will not only be receiving its current level of funding but the level of that funding will also be increased in proportion to the minimum increase of funding to Melbourne University - which it will not even get if the Labor Party has its way - that is being proposed under these reforms. In addition, the Australian Maritime College will be receiving at least as much and indeed more money than it currently does. The member for Bass will be seriously embarrassed when she is aware of precisely what these reforms propose and the level of funding for the Australian Maritime College.I am asked about the Victorian College of the Arts, and I would like to point out to this House that, in a letter which I have received today which has been sent to the Ballarat Courier by the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Ballarat, the vice-chancellor says:From my perspective as the Vice-Chancellor of Ballarat in this region of Victoria we will have no chance of being a lead city and region in Australia unless appropriate higher education reforms are adopted as a matter of urgency by the federal parliament. Professor Cox says:That is why legislation in the parliament must be passed to inject funds to promote learning by greater numbers of regional and rural Australians - indeed, everyone.Again, I ask all members of this parliament to think very seriously about the importance of making sure that universities receive not only additional funding - $10 billion of extra public funding in the next 10 years - but also much-needed changes to regulation and administration.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member, and I appreciate the interest he shows in this issue. As I explained to the House yesterday, four million people are trafficked or smuggled annually. People smugglers earn in the vicinity of $US10 billion every year. This practice is partly at the expense of the 20 million genuine refugees who are looking for resettlement around the world. Most of those people do not have the resources to pay people smugglers, so they are just pushed aside by the people smugglers. Overnight, the British government announced that it was going to legislate to take much tougher measures against illegal migrants and asylum seekers. All I can say is that it reflects the private conversations that we have had with the British government about this issue. There is absolutely no doubt that, like other European governments and, of course, many others, the British government is determined to do something about this problem. This is a British Labour government. The Labour Party in Britain is absolutely determined to crack down on this problem.We have been reminded of the nature of the problem by the Age newspaper today, with allegations made by that newspaper that an Australian had been involved in trying to smuggle the passengers on SIEV 14 into Australia and that they had paid up to $28,000 for the trip. I cannot comment on that; I do not know if that allegation by the Age is correct or not. But I can say that a spokesman for those 14 Turks said that all 14 had wanted to go to Australia for a better economic future. In other words, he is suggesting that these people were simply looking to migrate illegally. It simply justifies the strong stance that the government takes on this issue.We will maintain that strength and, more than that, I am delighted that the British Labour Party shows that strength. The British Labour Party stands in stark contrast to the Australian Labor Party, which the member for Griffith describes as a `happy bunch of funsters' - or is it not happy? Is it an unhappy bunch of funsters? It is not the Leader of the Opposition that is the problem here, it is the whole of the Labor Party - the funsters. The funsters opposite think we should go soft on border control. These are the people who say that we should abandon the policy of excision, that we should introduce three motorboats in northern Australia to guide boatloads of illegal migrants into Australian ports and that somehow this is going to reinforce Australian borders. The Leader of the Opposition needs to show some strength on this issue before he himself gets excised.</DOC>

 - I do very much thank the member for Barton for his question, because it gives me an opportunity to put beyond doubt what ought to be the priorities in relation to these matters. What we are determined to do is to ensure that people-smuggling does not progress as an activity involving Australia. We took the steps two years ago to put in place a range of measures which have demonstrably worked.  -  - We took four boats two years ago and returned them to Indonesia, with crew, with the people involved, and what we know is that -  -  - We know very clearly that in the interregnum there have not been substantial efforts to bring people to Australia by boat. We had one opportunistic vessel from Indonesia which carried people from Vietnam and which got to Port Hedland, and we have now had the Minasa Bone. It had 14 people, who, I believe from news reports, left Turkey in about August. - Let me just say to the Leader of the Opposition that, if he is suggesting that those people who were returned two years ago were on boats in the meantime, it is demonstrably clear that they were not. The measures that we took ensured that people were not getting onto boats. That saved lives and it brought smuggling to an end. The principal measures that we know work and that have an impact upon the perceptions of smugglers as to whether Australia is a vulnerable source or not are the measures that include excision and returning vessels to Indonesia. So we do not apologise for that at all. It was a value judgment which we took that, in relation to people-smuggling, it was more important to bring the practice to an end than to identify four members of the crew, who would have been bit players in any event.Let me just go on and say: do we take the issue of prosecuting people smugglers seriously? Of course we do. Twenty-seven people are currently serving jail terms - one of them for up to eight years - for smuggling offences. We have other major smugglers before the courts right now. Some 220 people have been prosecuted for people-smuggling offences under the relevant sections since 1999. We are determined to use the mixture of measures necessary to achieve the best public interest outcome. We made a judgment that it was more appropriate that this boat should go back and not encourage people smugglers. I have to say that I am emboldened by the reports that I am receiving from Indonesia that suggest that people smugglers, again, have been very put off by the measures that we have taken.</DOC>

 - More fully today. - I thank the member for Makin for the question, because it gives me an opportunity to add to the knowledge of the parliament about the concern that we have about the growth of litigation and its impact on the courts especially, and the growth that is occurring in the immigration area. I am certainly satisfied that if people had arrived in Australia in the migration zone and had lodged asylum claims - whether they were bona fide asylum claims or not - they would have been in before the tribunals and the courts, and I imagine they would probably have gone before every stage of review that is provided in relation to the way in which judicial review is exercised here in Australia.In 2002-03, over 5,300 new cases - more than double the number we had in 2001-02 and 15 times the number of cases we had in 1994-95 - were pursued. Despite the extension of the jurisdiction of the Magistrate's Court, the volume of cases has been continuing to rise. Magistrates cases in Sydney, I am told now, are listing immigration matters for 12 months time in order to hear them. So we have seen a very extensive increase in costs. I have to say it is not the great cost that has been portrayed by some of the media. I think there were some suggestions of costs of $40 million for external legal firms engaged by DIMIA. I am told that the figure for all of DIMIA's costs is closer to $21 million. But, nevertheless, with court costs, internal departmental costs and administration, that is a very significant burden that the Australian community has to bear. It inconveniences not only the courts but Australians who hope to be able to have access to the courts themselves.The issue is: are there any other policies to deal with these matters? I have heard the Labor Party offer a view that there should be a one-stop shop - that they would restrict litigation to one level. I think that shows that they have an abysmal knowledge of the Constitution, particularly section 75, which gives the High Court an original jurisdiction for applicants to be able to place their matters before the High Court regardless of what we might do in relation to the statutory courts. So unless the Labor Party are saying that every immigration matter should be pursued by applicants before the High Court, you could never have a one-stop shop. You might be able to achieve it in another way, but I think in the Labor Party's policy they might have spelt it out as a constitutional reform - to ask the Australian public whether they would agree to amending section 75 of the Constitution to take away original jurisdiction from the High Court in immigration matters. They may be proposing that. What it demonstrates to me is that, when they sit down and have to think about policy, they are so busy thinking about other issues that they have not got time to think about the detail and working out a proper approach to resolving the problems.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Wills for his question. I can tell him that I am not aware of the letter that the Queensland Premier has sent to him. Thank you for making it known to me. I am sure you will make it available to the House at some time. The Queensland government is the only government which has so far failed to sign a bilateral for the Natural Heritage Trust. The ground on which it has failed to sign that bilateral has been the statement that it is not prepared to protect of concern vegetation on private land in the way that every other state government has done. That is the reason why the Natural Heritage Trust bilateral has not been signed.The Australian government are very committed to achieving vegetation objectives in Queensland, as we are elsewhere throughout Australia. I am aware of the Brigalow declaration by over 400 scientists. Let me say that I welcome that declaration because it shows the great importance in reducing the excessive rate of land clearing in Queensland which has been going on for quite some time. The government believe that a reduction in land clearing in Queensland can achieve very significant greenhouse gas abatement objectives for Australia and can also achieve a number of important biodiversity objectives. The Australian government have been consulting with land-holder groups in Queensland because we believe that any outcome should properly recognise the rights of land-holders as they are the ones who are going to be most affected by any agreement that is reached. I urge the Queensland government to consult directly with land-holder groups so that they can bring this matter to a conclusion quickly.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and his interest in passports. It is obviously something that affects a very large number of Australians. I think I am right in saying that Australians buy about one million passports a year, which is an enormous number. Identity fraud is a significant challenge to global law enforcement and security services, and it is a costly problem: $4 billion annually in Australia's case is what we lose through identity fraud, so it is obviously an issue we need to continue to work at addressing. To do that, we need to ensure Australian passports are issued to and used by only those who are entitled to them.Today I launched the new security enhanced so-called M series passport - the last series of passports, not surprisingly, was the L series - as part of a series of initiatives aimed at improving the integrity of the Australian passport issuing process and the security of the document itself. My department has introduced a new proof of identity and name change requirement for the Australian passport application form, as some members may know. Those initiatives, together with the new M series passport, should play some part in helping to stop people-smugglers, terrorists and other transnational criminals at least misusing Australian passports for activities which could threaten Australia's direct security or threaten Australia or Australians in other ways. The M series passport has a number of new and enhanced security features designed to combat security fraud. Some of those features are visible to the naked eye; some of them require special detection equipment. The passport data page, made of a special laminate of tiny glass beads, laser cut to create floating images of kangaroos, is the latest in tamper resistant technology. This feature will make the document recognisable around the world. Obviously people know kangaroos are from Australia. - The opposition leader, whoever he may be at the time, will be invited to the Kangaroos reception. I do not think you will be invited, but somebody will be. - The majority of these new passports will be produced at the Royal Australian Mint, which, after all, is among the most secure buildings in Australia - at least I hope it is. I am sure it is. The M series passports will be available to the public progressively from 1 December, and obviously the old series of passports - the L series of passports - can still be used beyond 1 December up until their expiry date.</DOC>

There have been a number of investigations into these allegations and so far they have not substantiated Dr Grave's concern.

As to the state of that report, I am happy to look at that matter, and if it is appropriate I will release the report.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for McPherson because this is a very important area of public policy that the people of Australia are rightly concerned about. On this side - the Howard government - people know where we stand when it comes to border protection issues. People understand that we want to make sure that unauthorised boat arrivals are dealt with at offshore centres, and it remains an important part of the government's strategy. This sends a clear signal to those who want to ply a trade and make money out of human misery - the people smugglers. It sends an important signal to them that they will not succeed, and of course our strategy is working because only two boats have approached the Australian shoreline since 2001. So while people know where we stand, those opposite of course are voting down all of our efforts on every occasion; that is when they have some coherency. I have been asked about alternative policies and among those opposite there seems to be a policy development process reminiscent of the sixties sitcom Gilligan'sIsland, because we seem to have Skipper Beazley, the member for Brand, advocating the use of boats something the size of the SS Minnow going out on three-hour cruises. We are all very interested to see how his little buddy will support the use of these boats to try to dissuade people smugglers coming on one day and on the other day to become some sort of `coastguide' to show them how to come ashore, because Skipper Beazley's little buddy wants to process all the unlawfuls here in Australia; he wants the people smugglers to be rewarded. At this stage we are watching the policy development process with a great deal of interest because the new Labor national president, the member for Fremantle, has made it clear she wants a softer asylum seeker policy to work - a bit like Mrs Howell, really. She has said recently in the West Australian the Labor Party does not `seek to represent all the views of the community' - and day in, day out the Australian Labor Party seem to be showing exactly how true those words are. So we will wait with interest to see whether Professor Werriwa or Thurston Howell III - the member for Griffith - actually gets up as the leader of the SS Minnow and we will wait and see whether it is Ginger or Mary Ann that survives as the opposition immigration spokesperson.</DOC>

 - I comprehensively answered this question yesterday, and I will repeat today that the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission is empowered to bring and has brought proceedings in respect of those who have engaged in false or misleading conduct. The Australian Securities and Investments Commission is empowered to bring and has brought proceedings against those that have breached the Corporations Law. So those two agencies have brought proceedings and indeed both of them have used their protection powers to launch proceedings against the Kaye group. So, far from there being no enforcement, both agencies have been very actively enforcing.The question of regulating real estate agents and the real estate agents industry is a matter for state legislation, and always has been, and the Commonwealth is not taking over the regulation of the real estate industry as to whether or not you can make dummy bids at auctions, the licensing of real estate agents and all the rest of it. What has happened in respect of the ministerial council is that this matter has been discussed at the ministerial council - the giving or the pressuring or the advising or the encouragement into the property investment industry - and a working group chaired by the Queensland government is looking at it, because it would require state powers to be exercised, state jurisdiction under the Constitution as well as Commonwealth; presumably the Commonwealth would get its powers under the Corporations Act but you would need more than that under the Constitution. That working group will be reporting back, as I think I said yesterday, in March of next year. So the Commonwealth is enforcing its laws with its agencies. In those areas where you need state constitutional power, there is a working group chaired by Queensland and, as I said yesterday, if the Labor Party believes that it is a slow process it no doubt will be making representations to the Queensland government. </DOC>

I note media reports -  - The only job that members of the Australian Labor Party are interested in is who is going to be the Leader of the Opposition next week. That is all they are interested in. - Strikes cost jobs. I note in the Western Australian newspaper today a headline read `Closed for business.' The article went on to say:Striking public servants will try to bring WA to a standstill today ...This sort of action belongs to a bygone era. Strikes and picket lines are not a method of dispute resolution. In fact, the involvement of Kevin Reynolds of the CFMEU, who said yesterday that Labor politicians should lose their right to represent the party, gives weight to what Justice Cole found in the royal commission: this union was very much at the centre of unlawful and inappropriate conduct in the state of Western Australia. Today's industrial action in Western Australia will disrupt ordinary workers and harm investment in the state. Strikes do cost jobs. Under this federal government, strikes have been at a historic low. What is happening in Western Australia today is an indication of what would happen nationally if the Labor Party ever got back into office.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Brisbane for his question. The MedicarePlus package has four elements: greater convenience to patients, more doctors and nurses in the system, enhanced access to bulk-billing, and a new and stronger safety net. The enhanced access to bulk-billing measures means that 62 per cent of the people who go to GPs will have a new $5 bulk-billing incentive -  - if their doctor chooses to bulk-bill them. It is a carefully targeted incentive and it restores the spirit of Medicare as outlined by Dr Neal Blewett, who said that doctors have a choice. They can charge a fee or they can bulk-bill people, and bulk-billing is directed to needy people - particularly to pensioners.The other aspect of MedicarePlus is a much stronger universal safety net which accepts the fact that you can never guarantee universal bulk-billing. No-one can guarantee universal bulk-billing - the members opposite cannot guarantee universal bulk-billing. The members opposite certainly did not deliver universal bulk-billing, and for those people who cannot get bulk-billed it is important that they have a stronger safety net. That is precisely what we are delivering to the people of the electorate of Brisbane.</DOC>

 - I cannot verify the exact number but I will not argue with the Leader of the Opposition. There are a number. This is a consequence, of course, of the decision taken by their parents or guardians to attempt to travel to this country illegally. That being the case, the responsibility for what happens to them is, in the first instance, the responsibility of those who have chosen to try to come to this country in a way other than by joining the international refugee process or by obtaining the necessary arrangements to be held to enter this country in the legitimate, orthodox fashion.  The House will be aware, as I know the Leader of the Opposition will be aware, that for some time now - I cannot remember the precise date - the government has maintained a program for community release of children in the company of their mothers in circumstances where the families concerned have been willing to take that up. That remains the policy in relation to those held on the mainland. But I can only repeat that the decision taken by the parents of these children is the principal reason that they are in that situation. In those circumstances, with respect to the Leader of the Opposition, the observation should rather be directed to their parents and guardians rather than to the government. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Macquarie for his question. I am aware that this morning the New South Wales Premier expressed surprise at the fact that I had written to him, and indeed to other premiers and chief ministers, drawing attention to the fact that the International Narcotics Control Board has stated that the establishment of drug injecting rooms or similar outlets offers no solution to the problem of drug abuse but rather facilitates drug abuse. The situation is that this government remain tough in an unconditional way so far as their attitude towards drug abuse is concerned. We have invested more than $1 billion in the Tough on Drugs program. It has not only been responsible in a significant way to a reduction in heroin deaths from overdose but also contributed in different ways to strengthening the Australian community's fight against drug abuse. It has three elements: education, prevention and rehabilitation. In all three areas it is working effectively.We do not support the establishment of heroin injecting rooms. Our position remains totally opposed to them. In that way our view is different from that of the New South Wales government. I simply place on the record the fact that the federal government will not in any way assist any of the states or territories or facilitate in any way the opening, extension or maintenance of heroin injecting rooms, nor will we in any way facilitate, support or encourage the conduct by any states or territories of trials of heroin use. We regard that as a defeatist, negative attitude and it is something we will always totally oppose.</DOC>

 - The government is always seeking to improve its IT, and the government is always seeking to improve general practitioners' and other doctors' use of IT. In fact, since 2000 the government has invested more than $400 million in trying to improve information systems, particularly information systems available to general practitioners. The reason HIC Online has not been taken up more widely until now is that until now there have been no specific incentives to take up HIC Online - and software providers have not been specifically encouraged to spread it. I am confident that as a result of the changes in the MedicarePlus package there will be a widespread take-up of HIC Online. I am also confident that, as a result of this, patients will be able to access their Medicare rebate direct from doctors' surgeries and there will be no further need to queue at the Medicare office. </DOC>

 - Firstly, can I thank the honourable member for Cook for his question and acknowledge the interest that he shows in our diplomatic missions and in our consular and diplomatic staff overseas. I suppose all members of the House at one time or another would have had some contact with them and would share with the government our view that we give a very high priority to the security of Australians, as well as locally engaged staff, who work in our missions overseas. We have about 100 of these missions spread around the world.At the end of last week - on Friday - I announced the government's decision to provide a further $70 million to upgrade security across our consulates and embassies. That will bring to a total of $100 million the amount of additional expenditure on security in our missions since 2001-02. The extra spending will allow us to upgrade our mission surveillance and guarding systems, to strengthen perimeters, to put in place wider application of ballistic and bomb blast protection and to improve access control. In a small number of cases, we will be moving our missions from their current locations to other locations because we regard the security of the current locations as unsatisfactory. I think the House will understand if I do not outline which missions they are. We obviously do not want to declare where we have some concerns about the security of our missions. We will keep the security measures under continual review, to make sure that we do everything we possibly can to keep the staff of our missions secure. We cannot guarantee the elimination of all risk - we absolutely cannot do that, and we should be up front in admitting that - but the additional measures to be introduced will enhance the protection of our overseas staff and the locally engaged staff.</DOC>

 - I am aware that bulk-billing rates have declined over the last few years, particularly in Queensland. Let me make three points in response to the member for Oxley. The first point is that no government can guarantee universal bulk-billing. The former government could not guarantee it, and this government will not guarantee it. The second point is that every bulk-billing general practitioner will have his or her income improved by measures in the MedicarePlus package. This is the first time any government has specifically targeted the bulk-billing rate. The third point I would make is that I have in front of me a survey which appeared in the Australian Doctor magazine on 28 November 2003, which said that 33 per cent of doctors would increase their bulk-billing rate as a result of the MedicarePlus package. So there is every reason to think that bulk-billing should increase under MedicarePlus. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Maranoa for his question. I will answer the second part of his question first, because it is particularly relevant to his electorate. Obviously, a key focus of the negotiations is to improve the access for agricultural products into the US market, and that is of great significance to the member for Maranoa and his very large area of representation in Queensland. Last week, I met with my counterpart in Washington, Ambassador Zoellick, the US Trade Representative. We had a broad ranging discussion about the progress to date of the negotiations and about the prospects of getting the negotiations concluded in time to be able to move the necessary legislation through the Congress next year. During those discussions, we also had the opportunity of giving clear guidance to our negotiating teams, who are meeting in Washington all this week - through to Friday - and are confronting a range of issues.Of course our objective in the FTA is to seek out greater market access, particularly for agriculture but also for the automotive sector. A lot of the automotive sector in Australia is also in parts of regional Australia, which the member for Maranoa would be interested to hear, so if we can get improved market access not just for fully built up motorcars but also for components in the auto sector it is going to significantly improve the economy and the job prospects in many parts of regional Australia. There is a very restrictive regime in place as far as shipping is concerned, not just in terms of selling ships into that market but also servicing ships that operate in that market. In the enormous sector of government procurement there are opportunities that we want to pursue in these negotiations.We are seeking a comprehensive and balanced outcome in the negotiations with the United States. We have already completed hundreds of pages of the text. As I said, the fifth round of negotiations is under way in Washington this week, with a key objective of improving opportunities for our farmers. We want to see opportunities, in terms of access into that market for our farmers, that are already enjoyed by other sectors of our economy. For instance, the audiovisual industry enjoys very good access into that market.It goes without saying that there are a number of sensitive issues that we are going to have to confront as we go through these negotiations but, as we have continually said, we will not undermine our ability to deliver on good public policy in Australia in those key sensitive areas as a result of these negotiations. At the end of this week I will talk with Ambassador Zoellick again over the phone about what unresolved issues remain and how we will go about resolving those before we conclude the negotiations in time to get the package through the congress next year. I have always said that this was going to be a challenge and a tough negotiation. We recognise that it is, but it is also an indication that our government is prepared to take on the difficult issues if they are in the national interest. We maintain that concluding a free trade agreement with the United States is unquestionably in the national interest.</DOC>

 - I can indicate that the Australian government will not agree to anything in the pursuit of the proposed free trade agreement with the United States that will prejudice people's access to affordable pharmaceuticals. We will not use the PBS as a bargaining chip in the free trade negotiations. The other point I would make is that people who are living with HIV-AIDS often do face significant out-of-pocket and out-of-hospital medical expenses. They will be significantly helped and protected by the safety net which this government is going to put in place as part of MedicarePlus.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kooyong for his question and I appreciate his concern that the government should do everything it can to try to prevent the further spread of this killer disease. Today is World AIDS Day, and it is important to reflect today on what more can be done to halt this modern pandemic. AIDS now afflicts nearly 50 million people world wide, and it is one of the major causes of premature death, particularly in southern Africa and in some countries of the Pacific. In Australia, AIDS has not become the public health catastrophe experts feared two decades ago, thanks largely to sensible public health policies put in place by successive governments on both sides of politics. This year, the federal government will spend $48 million on AIDS prevention campaigns. We will make $55 million available under the Australian health care agreement to help treat AIDS patients in public hospitals. Through the PBS we will make $81 million available for antiretroviral drugs. Importantly, we will spend $28 million on anti-AIDS campaigns abroad, particularly in PNG and Indonesia. Despite the success of domestic AIDS campaigns, no-one can afford to be complacent, and I look forward to working with the new head of the ministerial advisory committee to build on the strengths of our existing policies.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and appreciate his very great and newfound interest in transport matters in this place. I have heard some fairly interesting claims around but, in a broad sense, the stage 2b phases of the NAS were introduced the other day. There have been around 20 incidents reported and, of those, five relate to the new airspace arrangements. They were not near misses - in the main, they were minor technical glitches involving transponders, and all of them will be assessed by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau.But the House ought to know that in fact the numbers of incidents being reported in controlled airspace are not really terribly different to the sorts of normal numbers you get. It is quite normal to have between two and five incidents a day anyway, and the Australian Transport Safety Bureau has a responsibility for checking those out. These are not, as the opposition spokesman put it, `my' airspace arrangements. These are Australia's airspace reforms. They are strongly supported by industry and industry leaders and, of course, the safety case has been well and truly checked off by those responsible for aviation safety in Australia, as the opposition spokesman well knows. He might want to keep aviation in the 1940s and 1950s, but I do not and the government does not either.</DOC>

 - First of all, I thank the member for Dunkley for his question and his interest. I think the House would be aware that the government has been deeply concerned about the situation in Zimbabwe for quite some period of time, particularly bearing in mind the role that the Fraser government played at the Lusaka CHOGM back in 1979 to help Zimbabwe achieve independence and some dignity in self-government. But since then, particularly in recent times, the situation has deteriorated badly, and it has to be said that President Mugabe has done nothing to encourage the Commonwealth to lift its suspension of Zimbabwe, which was put in place in March 2002. I am very pleased to say that President Obasanjo of Nigeria has maintained his position that President Mugabe of Zimbabwe will not be invited to the CHOGM which takes place at the end of this week, and I think President Obasanjo has done that in order to maintain Commonwealth cohesion in the lead-up to that meeting.Let me also say that it is our view that the situation in Zimbabwe is actually continuing to deteriorate: GDP will shrink by 13 per cent this year, inflation is at 526 per cent - and it is expected that it will rise to some 700 per cent - half of Zimbabwe's population needs food aid and there is insufficient foreign exchange to buy seed, fertiliser or spare parts. The government will maintain a forceful position, pushing for reform in Zimbabwe. We will maintain our support for the Zimbabwean people. Through our food aid assistance we are providing about $38½ million worth to southern Africa, much of which goes to Zimbabwe, during the course of this year. I hope that the international community will join with Australia and not be intimidated in any way by the taunts or the policies of President Mugabe. </DOC>

 - I will have to check, because I do not pretend to know the full answer offhand. My understanding - and I say that in a very conditional way - is that this matter was the subject of some legal process and appeal. But, as to where that stands at the present time and as to where any amendment of the law stands, I will take the question on notice and refer it to my colleague the Treasurer when he arrives, and then will provide some further information.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Petrie for her question and recognise her small business credentials, as she, like so many others in the Liberal Party and The Nationals, has had real-life experience working in small business. -  - Yes, I have actually. The coalition government appreciates franchising in Australia. There are 700 different franchise systems, from real estate agents to printing operators to food and beverage distributors. There are 50,000 franchisees - read `small businesses' - right across Australia, employing over 300,000 Australians, and that has grown by 20 per cent in the last four years. If there were any doubt about the contribution of franchising to the Australian economy, note this: the turnover in franchising is in excess of $80,000 million. It was this government that introduced a mandatory franchising code of practice, which balances up the interests of the franchisors and franchisees and ensures that in this enormously successful and growing sector the interests of all parties will be taken into consideration.As the member for Petrie knows, today is Franchising Appreciation Day. I note that the Franchise Council of Australia are in the gallery, and we welcome them. They are great advocates of small business; importantly, employing thousands of Australians. We say that the government will continue to work closely with the Franchise Council of Australia to grow small business and to provide this increasingly important sector with the infrastructure it needs to employ more Australians and create more wealth.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Rankin for his question. Our government was not responsible for what went on in Victoria that number of years ago when Pyramid collapsed. From memory, I think it was a Labor government in Victoria at the time.  - That is right: it usually is when there is a collapse, just the same as in South Australia. -  - I am aware of the circumstance that the member for Rankin raises. Of course, it goes without saying that the EMDG Scheme is a nondiscretionary scheme that is operated by Austrade. The rules are set out very clearly in terms of access and assessment within the Export Market Development Grants Act 1997. Presumably, similar regulations and criteria were applied by the previous government to export market development grant schemes. These decisions are taken by Austrade according to that act. Section 10(3) of the Australian Trade Commission Act prevents the Minister for Trade from intervening in Austrade's handling of specific grant applications. I am advised that World Wide Entertainment production and sales promotes and sells television programs overseas. That is something we would all support. They have applied for an EMDG under the regulations that apply to anybody else in this country, and that has been approved by Austrade. I am aware that the individual the member alluded to is a director of that company, but presumably there are other directors and shareholders. The entire application would have been assessed on its merits; otherwise, it would not have been paid.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dobell for his question and, along with the members for Robertson and for Paterson, for his very strong support for the University of Newcastle. From this package Newcastle university will receive a minimum of $19 million extra public funding in the first three years, before it even receives additional money for the training of nurses and teachers, before it accesses $138 million for quality teaching and learning and before it even accesses extra money to support payment of its academics. In fact, Professor Terence Lovat, the Pro Vice-Chancellor of the central coast campuses of the University of Newcastle, in writing to all members of the Senate in support of the government's higher education reforms said in part in the conclusion to his letter: It seems to me that the government has come up with the first viable growth plan in 15 years, including one with the inbuilt equity of all places being free at the point of access. This latter feature would continue to see us one of the very few places in the world where one can enter university cost-free until one is secure in employment. The only direct result of Backing Australia's Future failing will be a lot less money for the sector and a lot more eligible candidates missing out on a place. Included among these latter will be some hundreds, if not thousands, of young people from my area of responsibility, one of the neediest areas of Australia. Granted the difficulty of any government moving an issue like higher education through the legislative process as is currently in train, my worst fear would be that there will be no re-entering of the debate for half a decade or more. Under this scenario the damage to the sector and to areas like the one I represent would be untold. Today also the Courier-Mail in Queensland, editorialising on the matter, said:It would be in the best interests of Australian students, current and future, for the legislation to pass. The worst possible outcome, no reform and no extra funding, would be calamitous in terms of overcrowded classrooms and laboratories and shrinking opportunities for school leavers.Finally, the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee, in a media release entitled `The time for agreement is now', said yesterday:Vice-Chancellors have already reached a reasonable agreement with the government involving significant compromises on both sides and have agreed to support the government's overall package with the Vice-Chancellors' amendments incorporated.That includes more than $200 million in enhancements which I announced last week, including 1,400 extra HECS places and 7,500 more scholarships for living expenses for low-income rural students. It is time to support the government in putting Australia's interests first and to support higher education reform.</DOC>

 - In response to the member for Melbourne Ports, I answered this question last week. Melbourne university will next year have a budget approaching $1 billion. In core funding alone, it will receive an extra $23 million in the first three years from this government's higher education reforms. I have assured the Victorian College of the Arts that it will continue to be funded, as it currently is, through Melbourne university and it will receive not only its current level of funding but also a proportionate increase consistent with that of Melbourne university. The member for Melbourne Ports raises this issue about the Victorian College of the Arts but perhaps he, and all members on the Labor side, might explain to the higher education sector in Australia why Labor is voting against Australian universities receiving an extra $2.4 billion in the first five years. The member for Melbourne Ports ought to pick up the phone to the Vice-Chancellor of Melbourne university and tell him in plain language that he, the member for Melbourne Ports, is actually voting against any increase in funding for the university. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Deakin for his question. One of the major advances in workplace relations in the last eight years in this country has been the introduction of Australian workplace agreements. These are agreements which allow individuals and employers to negotiate deals which best suit their needs. Indeed, at the end of October this year more than 400,000 workers in Australia had entered into Australian workplace agreements. In Western Australia, since April 2002 more than 70,000 Australian workplace agreements have been lodged by employers. It was disappointing, therefore, to learn that the chief of the ACTU, Sharan Burrow, last week complained to the United Nations Global Compact program in Geneva about BHP Billiton's industrial relations practices. Indeed, she set forth the furphy that the Workplace Relations Act, because it enables people - some 400,000 to date - to enter into Australian workplace agreements, is in breach of ILO convention No. 98.The convention's provisions are about promoting collective bargaining but they are not mandatory and they do not preclude other forms of workplace arrangements such as AWAs. Indeed, this government wholeheartedly supports the right of companies like BHP Billiton and any other employers to offer workers individual agreements. The interference in this regard by the ACTU is just another example of why union membership in the private sector in Australia is now down to 17 per cent. This government will continue to give individuals the freedom to negotiate the best deals that suit their needs.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Capricornia for her question and for reminding the parliament that unemployment in her electorate was 10.3 per cent in 1996 and is now some 6.2 per cent. Inherent in the question, of course, is clearly outlining to the Australian people just how significantly, economically and in real terms, average workers have benefited from the continuing good governance of Australia under the Howard government. I regret, however, to inform the member for Capricornia that, under the current policies of the Queensland Labor government, the situation for apprentices and trainees next year is likely to deteriorate. That is because over the last year alone the Queensland government reduced apprenticeship and training opportunities by 3,800 in the state of Queensland. Commerce Queensland has estimated that there has been a contraction in user choice, which gives employers and small businesspeople like those in gallery - they know all about user choice - the choice of sending their apprentices and trainees to either a TAFE or a private training provider. In Queensland, the Queensland government is cutting back on user choice opportunities.  The member for Capricornia might like to know that - at the same time this government is offering Queensland an additional $593 million for training over the next three years, with a $43 million real increase for training - the Queensland government has submitted to the Australian government a training plan for next year which will reduce training opportunities in the automotive industry by 12½ per cent and reduce training opportunities in the construction and building industries by 4.4 per cent. Further to that, we had a 2.6 per cent real reduction in the Queensland government's training budget this year. The Labor Party ought to get real and start talking to Peter Beattie. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Ryan for his question, and I acknowledge his strong support for young people working with the environment in his electorate. The Australian government's Envirofund is part of the government's $2.7 billion Natural Heritage Trust which is, of course, the largest environmental rescue program in Australia's history. Around Australia, Envirofund volunteers have been revegetating riverbanks, protecting remnant vegetation, easing erosion problems in the outback and on coastal dunes and protecting wetlands. Last Friday I announced a further round of successful Envirofund grants. These grants went to some 765 projects totalling $11.4 million and they bring to a total of $41.4 million grants made to 3,199 projects under the Envirofund.The Envirofund underlines the Howard government's commitment to community engagement and empowerment in protecting the Australian environment. In fact, in the member for Ryan's own electorate, with $16,240 from the Envirofund, Karen and Lloyd McLean, Marilyn and Max Splelter, Graham and Carol Burns and the Moggill Koala Hospital Association are conserving a significant koala habitat by erecting fencing, revegetating degraded acres, improving fire management and gathering flora and fauna surveys. At the South Pine River project in the electorate of Dickson, volunteers have planted some 9,000 native trees over a 1.5 kilometre area with the $30,000 that they received from the Envirofund. These are just a few of the many thousands of ways in which Australians at the grassroots are showing their commitment to the environment, supported and empowered by this government. I am very pleased to announce today that applications for the next round are open and will close on 30 January next year.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Moncrieff for his interest not only in Work for the Dole but in all the unemployed people on the Gold Coast whom he is working hard to get back into work. Unfortunately, there are still those people who continue to think of Work for the Dole in negative terms. In fact, the Australian Financial Review today had in its editorial `clearing blackberries and weeding nature strips'. The member for Moncrieff's question highlights that this is a diverse program of mutual obligation which, as I pointed out to the House only recently, has racked up some 38,000 man-years of community work. Much of that is, in fact, work on conserving our heritage. You would be aware that, up in the member for Moncrieff's electorate, the first paddle steamer in south-east Queensland has been refurbished, which is a very important part of forming an interpretive centre in Nerang. -  - Mr Speaker, something is titillating them over there today. The refurbishment of this paddle steamer is an important part of Queensland history and just goes to show the diverse range of projects. Of course on a very large national scale, in Adelaide, Perth, Sydney and Melbourne, the Work for the Dole participants are putting our old handwritten records onto a database as part of assisting with our national archives. And on a further diverse program, the first mail-run aircraft, the Bleriot XI, has been touring around Australia since February this year at various airshows and will be housed in the Queen Victoria Museum in Launceston in Tasmania at the completion of that tour. Work for the Dole is not just about such things as cleaning up nature strips, as the Australian Financial Review would have you believe; it is about assisting individuals, building better communities and building Australia's history, which is so significant for future generations. </DOC>

 - I reject the premise of the Leader of the Opposition's question. I would have thought that job security for mum and dad was pretty important to the early years of a child. I would have thought that housing mortgage affordability was pretty important to the early years of a child. - As to child-care places, the reality is that child care is more plentiful and more affordable under this government than it was under the former government. - The truth is that this government has created tens of thousands of additional child-care places. With the introduction of the GST, contrary to the doom-saying predictions of the then shadow Treasurer, the member Hotham, and the then Leader of the Opposition, the member for Brand - and some doom-saying predictions repeated by the then shadow Treasurer and now Leader of the Opposition, the member for Werriwa - child care became more rather than less affordable under this government. Whilst I welcome very much the interest of the new Leader of the Opposition in these matters, he had better get his facts right if he is to make any headway.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Robertson for his question. In his press conference this morning, the Leader of the Opposition said that he would reject opposition for opposition's sake. He said that, if he saw a good idea that was for the good of Australia, he would support it. - I cautiously welcome this -  - as a break from 7½ years of negativity by the Australian Labor Party. In the spirit of that bipartisan reach, I invite the Leader of the Opposition to give flesh to the notion and to practise what he preached at his press conference. I invite him now, before the parliament rises, to reverse the opposition of the Australian Labor Party to the safety net in the new MedicarePlus plan. Anybody who cares about the struggling families of Australia could hardly object to a safety net. How can you hate a safety net if you claim to represent the battlers of Australia? It is open to the Australian Labor Party to support the safety net. If it goes to the next election and is successful, it can then add to what is already in place.By supporting the safety net, they are not in any way inhibiting their freedom of movement - if they were to win the next election - in relation to the implementation of health policy. Therefore, by maintaining opposition to a safety net, which is the only piece of legislation that is needed to give effect to MedicarePlus, the Labor Party is practising opposition for opposition's sake, and the Leader of the Opposition said less than two hours ago that he was not going to be like that. Well, he has an opportunity immediately - on his first day - to practise what he preaches, to give effect to the fact that we now have a new era and that we now have a Leader of the Opposition who calls it for Australia rather than for the negative opportunism of the Labor Party. So he can do that.While he is at it, I invite him to adopt the same approach to our higher education proposals. There is nothing to stop Labor from voting for them now, and if they want to make changes after the next election they can introduce those changes. Finally, for good measure, if he is a man who believes in strong border protection - if he believes in protecting Australia's borders - maybe he will lead the Labor Party to reverse their rejection of the excision of those islands from the Australian migration zone, thus adding to the store of achievements insofar as border protection is concerned. In other words, on his first day, he can really break with the past. Unlike his two predecessors, he can avoid negativity and opposition for opposition's sake, and he can actually give effect to the spirit of bipartisanship that he regards as so important to the quality of public debate in Australia. </DOC>

 - Once again, the premise of the question is absolutely wrong. The reason why we have not been willing to ratify the Kyoto protocol is that, by doing that, we would impose costs on Australia that would not be passed on to countries like China and Russia that might well be our competitors, particularly in relation to resource projects. What the Labor Party wants us to do is sign up to something that would place burdens on Australian industry but not impose the same burdens on the industries of other countries that could well be our competitors. For us to sign the Kyoto protocol in its current form would destroy jobs in many of the industrial areas in Australia - it would be bad news for the Hunter Valley region, it would be bad news for the electorate represented by the member for Hunter, it would be bad news for Australian exporters. Overall, I am not going to be party to something that destroys jobs and destroys the competitiveness of Australian industry.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Gilmore for her question and for the interest she shows in the American alliance. I think that, on this side of the House, we know that the alliance between Australia and the United States is absolutely vital to our national security. That is particularly so in these difficult times. We have the problem of fundamentalist terrorism, including in our own part of the world, South-East Asia; we have the problem of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction - notably, in the case of North Korea, again in our own region; and we have the risk of those weapons systems falling into the hands of terrorists.I do not think there has been any time since at least the end of the Second World War when the United States alliance has been more important to our national security, and there is a component of it which is particularly important - and which is not often spoken of - and that is the intelligence cooperation between Australia and the United States. That intelligence cooperation is one of the strongest weapons we have to use against terrorism.The honourable member for Gilmore asked whether there are any alternative views. The Leader of the Opposition has expressed many alternative views on the subject, but what we are certain of is that he has no enthusiasm for the alliance, unlike the member for Brand, who has a history of being a strong and longstanding supporter of the alliance. The House barely needs to be reminded - but it should be reminded - that in February this year the Leader of the Opposition said of the President of the United States: Bush himself is the most incompetent and dangerous president in living memory.I think it was Bill Hayden, as Leader of the Opposition and then as foreign minister, who said that, in international relations, words are bullets. That sort of language, of course, does nothing to build the support between the opposition and the United States alliance, and it shows a complete lack of understanding of that alliance.More seriously, according to Laurie Oakes, a well-respected journalist, in February this year the Leader of the Opposition said that Australia should be prepared to withhold shared intelligence from the United States if the United States attacked Iraq. In other words, our intelligence relationship should not be fundamental to the alliance; our intelligence relationship should become a bargaining chip on individual policies. I call on the Leader of the Opposition to repudiate that report and to show a strong commitment, as we saw from the member for Brand, and as we have seen from this side of the House, to the American alliance, because it is vital to the security of this nation at this very uncertain time. It does not mean that we always agree with the Americans, but it does mean that we value the friendship, that we value the alliance and that we value the security we get from that relationship.</DOC>

 - I suppose people's views of memory are a little different, depending of course on where they come from in the Australian political spectrum. - Come on, Daryl, don't get too excited. You've had a good day, I know, but don't get too excited. - You can't help yourself, can you, Daryl? - Mr Speaker, a lot of people think this is the 31st anniversary of the election of the worst government this country has had since the end of World War II. But I will put that aside in this new spirit of bipartisanship and say that, as far as we on this side of the House are concerned, once again we reject the fact basis of the Leader of the Opposition's question - for the third time. It does not prove anything of the kind. I go back to what I said in my first answer, and that is: if we are to have an end to the days of opposition for opposition's sake, why do they oppose a safety net? What is wrong with a safety net? How could anybody object to a safety net? I can understand them objecting to other things, but a nice, simple, protective, cuddly safety net - how could they possibly object to it? </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Wentworth for his question. I can inform him that building approvals for the month of October were released today, showing that total building approvals increased by 1.6 per cent. They are down over the course of the year, Mr Speaker, as you would expect, but it was a stronger than expected figure today. Retail trade continues to grow strongly, rising by 1.2 per cent in October to be 8.6 per cent higher than a year ago. We will be receiving the national accounts tomorrow, which will give us a fix on the state of the Australian economy, which, notwithstanding drought and the difficult international situation, continues to outperform most of the developed economies of the world. I take this opportunity to welcome back the member for Fraser as the shadow Treasurer. I can tell him that it will certainly lift the Labor Party's credibility on Treasury matters that he is back as the shadow Treasurer. I congratulate the member for Werriwa on his elevation, and offer commiserations to the members for Griffith, Perth and Lilley on such a bad day. But it could always be said of them that, on this occasion, the roosters voted against an early Christmas! The alternatives that have been put forward by the Labor Party have been many and varied. We had the proposal from the member for Werriwa to abolish negative gearing. He was overruled on that question by the then Leader of the Opposition. However, there is now no Leader of the Opposition to overrule him. So we have negative gearing, which undoubtedly will come back onto the table. We also had the capital gains tax on the family home - another one of the pet projects of the member for Werriwa. Again there is no-one to overrule him on that. Speaking of pet projects, we also had the progressive expenditure tax, another one of the pet projects of the member for Werriwa, which he put forward as an alternative to the GST. And of course we had regional GSTs, which were also put forward by the member for Werriwa.The reality is that there is now no safety net under the Leader of the Opposition. The Leader of the Opposition is now on his own, with no higher authority to overrule him, and that speaks rather ill for the conduct of economic policy in this country. While he is about it, perhaps he could go back on Lateline tonight and resurrect negative gearing - the policy that lasted from Lateline to lunchtime can now come back in his own lifetime! On Lateline tonight, in relation to negative gearing, capital gains tax, PET and regional GST, as somebody said, it is going to be a ride - oh, what a wild ride! We expect to have two leaders for the price of one: both Arthur and Martha!</DOC>

 - The fact is that, even if you did do exactly what the member for Lalor proposes, there would be no guarantee of universal bulk-billing. Members opposite are running around the place saying, `We believe in universal bulk-billing,' but universal bulk-billing is simply undeliverable. It was not deliverable by the former government and it is not deliverable by any government. - The member for Lalor asked me about the registration form for a safety net. I very much suspect that the registration form in question is a registration form for the existing MBS safety net - a safety net which members opposite support.</DOC>

 - I want to make it very clear to the member for Hinkler that this government strongly support private health insurance. In our support for private health insurance, our view is very similar to the view of the member for Brand, Mr Kim Beazley, who, of private health insurance, said:In fact, we see it as complementing the core services funded through Medicare.In this, as in so many other things, the member for Brand has been a voice of decency, commonsense and moderation, which perhaps explains why he has just been rejected by the Labor caucus. Thanks to this government's policies, nearly nine million Australians have access to the choice and the security that private health insurance brings, including one million Australians whose incomes are less than $20,000 a year. I have also been asked about alternative policies, and I have come across a statement from none other than the member for Werriwa. The member for Werriwa, of private health insurance, said:This is a first-rate absurdity.Private health insurance is held by 40 per cent of the electors of Werriwa, and the member for Werriwa calls it a `first-rate absurdity'! He also said:This is the maddest piece of public policy that one will ever see out of the Commonwealth parliament.That is the problem with the member for Werriwa: on any one day you never know whether he is going to be Dr Jekyll or Mr Hyde, and he was plainly Mr Hyde on the day he said that. The Labor Party has had the member for Werriwa as a senior frontbencher in this parliament for two years. I say to the member for Werriwa, the new Leader of the Opposition: state your case, declare your hand; say where you stand on the private health insurance rebate so that the decent working folk of Western Sydney, the aspirational class of Australia, know where they stand with Labor. </DOC>

 - I simply say to the member for Lalor: if AIDS sufferers have significant out-of-pocket, out-of-hospital MBS expenses, they will be covered by the safety net. AIDS sufferers, in common with many other Australians, have to visit GPs and specialists and have to receive out-of-hospital treatment. I noticed today that the new Leader of the Opposition said that his objective is to save Medicare. Well, save Medicare: pass the MedicarePlus package.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Solomon for his question. I recognise the strong support that, on behalf of his local constituents, he has always provided for the government's border protection policy. Regional cooperation with Indonesia is a critical component of our policy. By mid-October this year, about 3,900 potential illegal immigrants had been intercepted and processed under arrangements in place with Indonesia. These arrangements involve the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, and at the moment the UNHCR is continuing the processing of passengers from the Minasa Bone. During that processing, further information is coming to light about the circumstances of their voyage. I understand, according to media reports, that the UNHCR has said that at least six of the passengers have indicated a wish to return to Turkey. The AFP has completed interviews with the Minasa Bone passengers and investigations are continuing into the broader smuggling operation.The government has, in the case of the Minasa Bone, sent a very clear message to the people smugglers that they will be thwarted. They were thwarted by the government's decision to excise Melville Island, they were thwarted by the return of the vessel, they were thwarted by the regional cooperation arrangements we have with Indonesia involving the IOM and the UNHCR, they were thwarted by our Federal Police. This is another example of the government's determined and successful fight against people-smuggling. This is a tough policy, but this is an effective policy. Are there any alternative views? There are a variety of alternative views from the opposition, and I note a report in the Sydney Morning Herald of 26 January last year. The report says that the Leader of the Opposition - taking a line somewhat different from the general opposition line but somewhat similar to the position he takes more generally on foreign affairs - accused Indonesia of behaving `in a highly irresponsible and illegal manner' by trying to `pass on the flow of asylum seekers to our country'. We on this side of the House do not accuse Indonesia of behaving in a highly irresponsible and illegal manner, but we have a policy of being tough on people-smuggling. The Leader of the Opposition once more demonstrates his style of diplomacy, which is to abuse our allies, abuse our neighbours, abuse our friends. Where will that sort of approach - let alone the pulling down of the barriers and the infamous coastguard that the opposition wants to put in the place of the current arrangements - get us in terms of cooperation on people-smuggling?</DOC>

 - I think the people of Lindsay have made the very sound judgment on at least three, if not four, occasions that they are very well represented by the member for Lindsay. The first thing that I should do is to point out to the House some facts in relation to the University of Western Sydney. Firstly, this government is determined to see that Australian higher education institutions are on a sound footing. The government is proposing to invest another $2.4 billion of hard-earned taxpayers' money - extra money - into universities over the next five years and to change the way in which those universities are funded and regulated.The University of Western Sydney will not lose a single dollar over the next three years and beyond; in fact, it will be receiving additional funding. The fact is that universities the length and breadth of Australia argued that we should fund them on the basis of what they actually deliver. It is described as a discipline mix - the Commonwealth Grants Scheme. That process has revealed that over the last 10 to 12 years the University of Western Sydney has moved away from high-cost courses in agriculture and science to lower cost courses. In order to ensure this, as we move to funding universities for precisely what they provide - and the member for Jagajaga refuses to tell anybody this - this government have put aside a $39 million transition fund which will fully compensate the University of Western Sydney over the three years of the transition. It will receive $5.4 million in 2005 and $1.98 million in 2006, and that assumes that the University of Western Sydney does not change a single HECS charge and does not create a single opportunity for an Australian citizen to be a full fee paying student - unlike the 5,000 foreigners it has got there. It also assumes that it does not access $138 million for the Learning and Teaching Performance Fund and that it does not access a single dollar of the $55 million available for a workplace performance pool. It also ignores the fact that it will be receiving almost twice as much for its overenrolled students. I say to the member for Jagajaga: if she is concerned about the member for Lindsay, I think she might ask her leader, the Leader of the Opposition, what his attitude is to the deregulation of universities - a subject to which I will return. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Flinders for his question. The member for Flinders played an active role - along with other government members - in our advocacy of change when, early in 2002, the US administration applied some safeguard measures to Australian exports of steel to the United States. A prohibitive tariff was placed on all steel imports into the United States, including those from Australia; but, through a process of positive engagement and diplomacy, with the assistance of many members of the government, like the member for Flinders, we managed to convince the Bush administration to exclude the overwhelming majority of Australia's steel exports to the United States from those safeguard tariffs.In fact, as a result of that advocacy, over 85 per cent of our exports have from the outset been excluded from the impact of those tariffs. That has secured the jobs of many Australians - like those who work for BlueScope Steel, formerly BHP Steel - in factories across Australia and in the member for Flinders' electorate. It allowed the Australian steel industry to continue to trade into the United States, which is a very important export market for them. That has helped to maintain the jobs and support the families of those steelworkers, and it has supported the communities where those factories exist.We hear news this week, which I am sure all members of the House would be pleased to hear, that the Bush administration is considering repealing the balance of these safeguard measures - repealing the tariffs completely. That would eliminate all tariffs from all Australian steel products going into the United States. I need to underline that point - that the US decision regarding Australian steel in 2002 demonstrated our ability in an unprecedented way, through diplomatic means and positive engagement, to achieve an outcome that had never been achieved before in a trade circumstance where there had been a prohibitive trade measure put on Australian product going into a country, particularly into the United States. As I said, our government have embarked upon a diplomatic exercise of positive engagement with the United States, and that is reaping rewards. We will continue to work with industry and with our counterparts in the US. I had the opportunity last week of meeting with the Secretary of Commerce, Don Evans, on this exact issue, and that is bearing fruit in the early stages and certainly with the prospect of the tariffs being removed.It is important to note that we believe the best way to get quick results and the best results is through positive, constructive engagement in our diplomatic relations. That has proven to be the case and it has delivered results for Australians, particularly Australian workers in the steel industry. It goes without saying that the negative, abusive approach to our bilateral relationships, particularly with the United States, does not work and it will never work. Hopefully, the new Leader of the Opposition, the member for Werriwa, will curb his ways and curb his tongue on these measures. Our international diplomatic relations are very important - and none is more important than our relationship with the United States, especially for the workers of Australia, who rely on it for a lot of the exports we sell across the world. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Bendigo for his question. These are issues which I have discussed directly with him. The first thing that I would say to the member for Bendigo is that he should go back and explain to the Vice-Chancellor of La Trobe University why he has voted against La Trobe University getting an extra $15 million minimum funding in the first three years. The next thing that I would point out to the member for Bendigo is that, if the member for Bendigo is concerned for opportunities at La Trobe University - which will expand under the proposals that are being put by this government to modernise, reform, strengthen and protect Australian universities - then he will support the Leader of the Opposition, who will now be presumably asking Labor senators to pass the government's higher education reforms through the Senate.What the member for Bendigo is doing is seeking to remind the La Trobe University and the people of Bendigo that he has voted against that university receiving additional funding and that the Labor Party is standing in the way of making sure that Australia is internationally competitive and that we have high-quality education the length and breadth of Australia. It is critically important to put, as the new Leader of the Opposition said, Australia's interests first - and I implore him to do that. Higher education is a national interest issue. Many of the policies which have been adopted by this government are policies which you, Leader of the Opposition, in your heart support and have written about. I urge you to persuade your colleagues to those views. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Fairfax for his question and for his long career in support of university education in general and the University of the Sunshine Coast in particular. The government has before the Senate - and it has been opposed by the Australian Labor Party - a $2.4 billion additional investment in Australian universities over the next five years, some $10.6 billion of additional investment in universities over the first 10 years. I announced late last week a further $200 million enhancement to that package, which will include another 1,400 HECS places in the sector. That brings it to 33,000 over the five years. It includes an extra 7,500 scholarships for low-income rural students to help them with their living costs whilst they are at university - worth $16,000 each. In addition, there are a range of measures which include increasing by three times the amount of money for universities to support students with disabilities and doubling the amount of money into the fair go performance program. I am asked about other statements in relation to higher education. The Leader of the Opposition seems to be particularly mindful of what happened 30 years ago, so he should not have much trouble coming a bit closer to 2003. I bring the Leader of the Opposition to 1999 and a paper he delivered to the University of Western Sydney's senior staff conference in the Blue Mountains on 11 November 1999. Let us keep in mind that today the members of the Labor Party have not only chosen a new leader; they have chosen the views and policies that this person represents. The Leader of the Opposition said on 11 November 1999 that he is arguing for a group of institutions with greater emphasis on private revenue sources rather than public money. He argued:They would need to make strong use of their large endowments and positional goods. Their fees would be deregulated, with the equity role of government pursued through publicly funded, means tested scholarships.The Leader of the Opposition believes that there are universities in Australia - and he named them: Queensland, New South Wales, Macquarie, Melbourne, Monash, Adelaide and Western Australia - whose fees would be deregulated. In other words, should he ever be the leader of his party, that would be the policy that would be adopted by his party, yet the Labor Party is opposed to what this government is doing in response to advocacy from every one of the 38 vice-chancellors of Australian universities. This government did not support full deregulation of universities, but what we did say in relation to the leadership of the universities is that, at the same time that we will invest another $2.4 billion of taxpayers' money in the first five years, we will allow the universities to set their own HECS charges between zero and a level which is a maximum 30 per cent above what it currently is, with no change for teaching and nursing.The Leader of the Opposition said this morning, `I am not here as opposition for opposition's sake. I'm here to do the right thing by Australia's national interest.' My challenge to the Leader of the Opposition is to stand by those words, and the Leader of the Opposition can start today. The Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee on 25 November this year said, `Australia's universities need a reform package'. On 28 November they said:We are on the cusp of crucial reform across the higher education sector.Australia's universities deserve a new deal to serve our students well and to make us internationally competitive.That sounds like national interest to me. I ask the Leader of the Opposition and the Australian Labor Party to now stand by those words, support the government and pass the higher education reforms in the Senate.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I am of course aware of those media reports in relation to the review of regional aviation security by the Southern Cross group. I note that they asked neither the government nor my department nor me for any input. I would also think that it is very important to put before this House the fact that the country's intelligence agencies have undertaken a major review of our aviation safety arrangements in this country. They have certainly not indicated that there is any information available to them which would indicate that the very concerning claims made in that report are to be vindicated or acted upon at this stage.The first point that I would make is that there is no distinction between regional and non-regional airports; rather it is between what we call `categorised' and `non-categorised' airports. It is a question of the nature of the types of airports, the types of aircraft that move through them and the security risk that is assessed to pertain to those airports and those aircraft as ascertained - and I think I can say this on the basis that we enjoy bipartisan respect - by Australia's respected intelligence agencies. I can also inform the House that in response to the major overview of our security arrangements in relation to aviation, which was completed a little while ago by our intelligence agencies, the government has formulated a further set of responses in addition to those which were announced last year and which are being implemented as we speak. I will be making a full and detailed explanation of those over the next few days.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Paterson for his question and can indicate to him that I am aware of a report in the Melbourne Herald Sun last Friday which is entitled `Union official bashed'. The report starts by saying:A building union official has been flown to hospital after being viciously bashed during a key strategy meeting.This was a meeting at the Victorian plumbing union planning day at Lorne in Victoria, which resulted in the bashing of one of the union officials and the subsequent transportation of that official to the Geelong Hospital because of the seriousness of the injuries. This comes on top of a recent incident in which a well-known union official, Mr Doug Cameron, was bashed just outside the front door of his own home and it comes shortly after a number of court cases, in both Victoria and New South Wales, where leading officials of the CFMEU were found guilty of intimidation, threatening behaviour and thuggery.I want to say quite clearly that this thuggery and intimidation in parts of the union movement is a disgrace. The Secretary of the ACTU, Mr Greg Combet, is on record as saying recently that he has been trying to clean up this sort of intimidation and thuggery in parts of the union movement for years. Clearly he has failed, because here is yet another example of thuggery and intimidation in the union movement, coming on top of the recent bashing of Doug Cameron, this time in another union in Victoria. This also reinforces the findings of Mr Justice Cole in his Royal Commission into the Building and Construction Industry, in which he found a culture of intimidation and thuggery practised by parts of the union movement in Australia. This government is determined to do something about it. The question for the new Leader of the Opposition is about choice - whether or not he will get behind the measures and legislation of this government to clean up the building and construction industry in Australia or continue to support a culture of thuggery, intimidation and violence in the union movement. He has a choice to do something about it; the time for talking is over. Is the Leader of the Opposition going to do something about it or is he going to reject the needs and the aspirations of ordinary Australians?</DOC>

 - Again, the opposition spokesman for transport is seeking to establish, firstly, that he knows all about aviation safety and, secondly, that he is running the union line. In reality, the people who are responsible for aviation safety in Australia include, first and foremost, CASA - the Civil Aviation Safety Authority. After that comes Airservices Australia, who have to implement the management of airspace in Australia. But, again, if we are going through this exercise of who says what, I remind him that those who have flown in Australia and in America - Qantas, the RAAF, Virgin, Rex and a whole range of others - all say that Australia should update its airspace management and that this is the way to do it. - Let me come to the issue of these incidents. Up until now, I have been charitable. I have said, `Perhaps this is just about the conservatism of air traffic controllers.' But it now has all the hallmarks of a union campaign, so there are several points that need to be made. The first is that it is the responsibility of the agencies that look after our airspace to ensure that what is happening in our airspace is safe. The second is in relation to these incidents that are being reported: pilots are required to report anything out of the ordinary. This can happen on average up to 50 or so times a week: those pilots might stray out of their assigned altitude; they might make an incorrect radio call; they might be concerned about their final approach to an airport and do a second run around; they might have a warning light malfunction; or their radar transponder might not be operating properly.  The first point is that there is a layered approach to safety and protection against all these sorts of incidents. The second point is that all of the incidents I have just mentioned, although they are not life-threatening in any way, have to be reported and are monitored by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau as part of the process of keeping our skies safe. These incidents happen every day. As I said, there are up to 50 a week on average. They are not near misses, and it is irresponsible to claim that they are. I hear this claim again emanating from the unions, who - astonishingly - are saying that it is inevitable that we will have a midair crash. That is irresponsible. It completely ignores groups like CASA. It ignores the reality that we are simply moving to the airspace arrangements used in America. But, above all, the implication is that it has never happened in Australia - tragically, it has happened 36 times since 1961.You cannot rule against every eventuality in our skies. But you can move to a more modern system. You can move to a system which takes advantage of new and emerging technologies. You can set yourself up for the future. That is what aviation in Australia overwhelmingly wants to do and that is what the government is supporting it in doing. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Aston for his question and recognise that he fights for every single one of the 1.1 million small businesses in Australia - every single one! More than half have been created since the Howard government came to office in 1996, and many of them in his electorate. One reason why we have so many small businesses doing well is that we believe in lowering tax. We believe in it, because we have abolished provisional tax; we have abolished wholesale sales tax; we have abolished stamp duty on the transfer of shares; we reduced income tax; and we halved capital gains tax - all with the net effect that it has delivered real benefits to Australia's small businesses. Importantly, we should note that the Labor Party voted against all those initiatives. We live in hope, now that the member for Hotham and the member for Brand are on the backbench. In fact, how cruel it is that it is his first day on the backbench and the member for Hotham is sat next to the member for Lowe. How cruel is that! You will do anything for a vote.The 23,000 Tasmanian small businesses are now being asked by the Tasmanian Labor government to backdate payroll tax, and 23,000 Tasmanian small businesses are now saying, `Why? Why is the Labor Party so determined to increase taxes?' We were hoping that the member for Werriwa as shadow Treasurer would oppose the Labor Party at a state level on issues such as rising land tax. We had hoped that he would oppose higher stamp duties. We had hoped that as shadow Treasurer the member for Werriwa would have opposed higher payroll tax. Unfortunately, he has form. If people are shocked at the election of the member for Werriwa, wait until they see his policies. When it comes to tax, these are the words of the member for Werriwa:It is not too late ... to use taxation policy as a disincentive for growth in Western Sydney. Other options include the extension of the Federal capital gains tax to the family home and the introduction of a local ... betterment tax. And it goes further. He says:The revenue raised from a growth levy could be used to fund infrastructure.The member for Werriwa has shown that he supports higher taxation. Over the last few months he has talked about increasing capital gains tax and abolishing negative gearing. On the record he has previously said he wants a local betterment tax. The Labor Party, true to form, do not like small business. They want higher taxes and they think small business is an easy target.</DOC>

 - In reply to that question can I say to the Leader of the Opposition that I agree with him about reading books to your infant children, something that I did when my children were infants and something that my extremely well-read, literate wife, who is one of the most compulsive, regular readers I have met and whose knowledge of literature far exceeds mine and, I guess, that of many members in this House, also did. I applaud the ancient habit of teaching young children through reading bedtime stories - not only reading stories but making up your own stories to tell your children when they are young. Some of my most vivid recollections of the early years of being a father to my three children were the stories I made up. They were stories of encouragement and love; they were not stories of hatred and bile. - When it comes to the welfare of Australia's children, I will always extend the bipartisan hand. </DOC>

 - I am aware of those statements. They were rather infamously made by the member for Werriwa in an earlier incarnation. When he became Leader of the Opposition yesterday he sought to say that they were purely in the context of his criticism of United States policy in Iraq, yet this morning, interestingly enough, on Melbourne radio, when asked the following question by Neil Mitchell, `You still said he was the most incompetent and dangerous president and you have said today that you don't back away from that,' the answer came back: `No - well, Neil, that's right.' In other words, this is not something in the past; this is something that was repeated this morning.What the Leader of the Opposition was saying this morning was that he still believed that the current President of the United States was the most incompetent and dangerous president in American history. I take the view, and I believe that most Australians take the view, that it is not in Australia's interest, it is not in the national interest of our country, that the alternative Prime Minister of this country should describe the current American President - no matter what that American President's politics may be - as being `the most incompetent and dangerous' in the history of the United States. That is what the Leader of the Opposition sought to do this morning, and by doing that he has demonstrated that in his new position he is dangerous so far as the American alliance is concerned.Let me say at the outset that criticism of American policy and criticism of the policies of an American President are of course perfectly legitimate for any political leader in Australia, but it is not in our national interest to make that kind of damning, personal, generic statement of criticism of the current President of the United States. But it is very interesting that, when you look behind the language and behaviour, you realise that the attitude of the Leader of the Opposition towards the current American President is driven more by tribal political considerations than it is by anything else - because, interestingly enough, you never hear a criticism of the leader of the British government. You never hear a criticism of Tony Blair when it comes to Iraq, and better than anybody in Australia I know how close the views of Tony Blair are to those of George Bush on the subject of Iraq.The reality is that the Leader of the Opposition has allowed his tribal dislike, because of the politics of the current American President, to overwhelm his concern for the national interest. Irrespective of who the president may be, it is never in the interests of this country to have that kind of generic criticism made. By all means, attack American policy on Iraq or anything else - and those criticisms and attacks will be judged according to their quality - but it is not in Australia's interest for the alternative Prime Minister, the man who is only eight seats away from being the leader of this country, to describe the current American President in those terms.It can only be explained by the tribal approach that the Leader of the Opposition takes. Tony Blair is off limits - you never criticise him - but centre right George Bush is the most dangerous American president in the history of that country. I have news for the Leader of the Opposition: I do not think the Australian nation of the 21st century thinks in tribal terms. Australians do not see this country as a nation of tribes; they see it as a nation of 20 million aspiring, gloriously individualistic people. That is the view particularly of the younger generation of this country. </DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for that question. It is interesting that the Leader of the Opposition now feels that it is not appropriate for children to be in that situation. He did not apparently feel that in 1994 when the government of which he was a member introduced the policy. - I am advised by the department of immigration that, in 1994, 342 children had arrived illegally by boat and were held in detention in Australia. I am advised by DIMIA -  - that, as at 28 November 2003 - a bare five days ago - there were 73 children in detention centres in Australia -  - and a further 88 children in an IOM processing centre on Nauru. Back in 1994, when he sat behind the then member for Blaxland and one of his mentors as a member of that government, he was perfectly happy to let that policy go by without rebuke, let or hindrance.I have explained in the past the basis of the policy. It invokes a sense of parenthood and parental responsibility. I can only repeat what I have said earlier: we have endeavoured to make arrangements, and continue to do so, for a situation where children can be released into the community in the company of one of their parents, consistent with the integrity of the policy that was introduced by a Labor government and continued by this government. I also repeat what I said the other day - that is, I believe that the action of parents who bring children into dangerous situations should be the subject of criticism rather than the government. The government is trying to defend a policy of very considerable integrity and something which, it is my understanding, still more or less - although it changes from day to day - has a semblance of bipartisan support. </DOC>

 - Firstly, I thank the honourable member for Deakin for his question. I know he is a strong supporter of the alliance we have with the United States. The ANZUS alliance now goes back some 52 years. There is no doubt that, since this government has been in office, we have strengthened that alliance in a very dangerous and difficult time internationally. We negotiated the Sydney Statement back in 1996 to put the ANZUS alliance into its more modern context and, after the events of 11 September 2001, we invoked the ANZUS alliance for the first time. I think what it gives us in terms of access to leading edge technology and, of course, as I was saying yesterday, vital intelligence from American intelligence agencies is absolutely fundamental to this country's national security. Our reinvigoration and revitalisation of the alliance has been one of our key achievements.There are alternative views. I think the House knows that the member for Werriwa, the Leader of the Opposition, has doubts about the alliance. And these are not new doubts - these are not doubts that have just emerged over the last few months. Not only has he reiterated this by refusing to withdraw his remarks in relation to the current President of the United States but I note that, in a parliamentary debate on a defence white paper on 8 December 1994, the member for Werriwa, the Leader of the Opposition, praised the white paper for `downscaling the significance of ANZUS'. So there we have it: right back in 1994 the Leader of the Opposition made it perfectly clear that he thought one of our objectives in Australia should be to downscale the significance of ANZUS. More recently his language has been the language of a university debating chamber or a student demonstration. For example, on 5 February this year, he referred to the American administration's foreign policy - designed to counter terrorism and to stop the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction - as `American imperialism'.Today, curiously enough, an article written by the Leader of the Opposition appeared in the Age newspaper. There were very interesting references in this article to Iraq. I would have thought that, whatever your position on the issue of Iraq, if you were a reasonable person you would recognise that one of the good things that has come out of American led action in Iraq recently has been the liberation of the people of Iraq. At least Saddam Hussein is no longer there. But the Leader of the Opposition says that what the Americans did was `invade and occupy'. He makes no reference to liberalisation and liberation. He makes no reference whatsoever to the overthrow of Saddam Hussein. He makes no reference to the discovery of 300,000 bodies in mass graves - no. This is the old left-wing argument about American imperialism `invading and occupying'.I thought it was equally curious that, according to the article, in a discussion about the war against terrorism the Leader of the Opposition wrote that this must be a war against terrorists - that the Americans should fight terrorists and `not the women and children of nation-states'. To suggest that the Americans are somehow deliberately going out and targeting women and children instead of fighting a war against terrorism is completely absurd and indeed a very offensive proposition. Now we have the Leader of the Opposition, a bit worried that his inherent anti-Americanism is going to seep through to the Australian public, trying to spin a line about his support for the American alliance, but he has a whole history of disregard for and criticism of the United States and the American alliance. These glib words of the Leader of the Opposition will not reassure the Australian people about a man who says that being a hater is part of what he is about.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for the question. I start by reminding him that when we came to government the childhood immunisation rate in this country was at a Third World level. It was something like 56 per cent and it has now risen to 93 per cent. After 13 years of an allegedly compassionate, caring Labor government we had a Third World standard of childhood immunisation. It was sitting at 56 per cent, and one of the proudest achievements of the former health minister, Dr Wooldridge, was that we lifted that childhood immunisation rate. I am corrected - it actually went from 54 per cent to 92 per cent. As far as meningococcal disease is concerned - pneumococcal, I am sorry. My own mistake reminds me of what we have done in relation to meningococcus as well as pneumococcus. In relation to the former we have already expended hundreds of millions of dollars to embark upon a nationwide immunisation campaign. In relation to the particular affliction that the Leader of the Opposition refers to, the decisions that have been taken by the government will guarantee that all of the seriously at risk groups will be protected.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Macarthur for his question, and can I indicate how much this House appreciates the true representative of Western Sydney, who represents that area so well. - Jackie Kelly, of course, and the member for Parramatta and the member for Macquarie. - I am reminded that the party that represents the western suburbs of Sydney is the Liberal Party. I thank the member for Macarthur for his question on the economy because so far there has been no question on the economy from the opposition, which is no doubt part of a deep and cunning plan - which we are just trying to figure out. To quote the member for Grayndler, `Such a cunning plan that it could grow a tail at any moment.' - Today's national accounts show that the Australian economy rebounded strongly in the September quarter, growing at 1.2 per cent for the quarter. That was coming off the last quarter growth of 0.1 per cent, although that has been subsequently revised. The national accounts are underpinned by strong household consumption, which increased by 1.7 per cent in the quarter, supported by strong consumer sentiment and tax cuts that came down in the May budget.In addition to that, private business investment grew 2.1 per cent and new machinery and equipment grew a very strong 11.5 per cent over the year. This was underpinned by strong corporate profitability and very strong business sentiment. The good news is that there appeared to be a rebound in farm production in the September quarter, and farm production contributed 0.4 per cent to overall economic growth. Although farm incomes rose, we should bear in mind that farm incomes are still 55 per cent below what they were two years ago, which indicates that the farm sector still has an enormous way to go to recover. And, although exports grew, rural exports remain 21 per cent lower over the course of this year.There was some good news on the export front in that travel services came back after the SARS epidemic and we saw a strengthening in relation to the tourist trade. This puts Australia as continuing amongst the strongest growing of the developed economies of the world, with a 1.2 per cent quarterly growth and a low inflation rate - an inflation rate, shown by the national accounts, at 1.6 per cent of the household consumption chain price index. We would expect that over coming quarters, as farm production picks up, exports should strengthen, but exporters will be affected by a very high exchange rate. The exchange rate is now working against Australian exporters - it has appreciated some 30 per cent this year - and the supercompetitive exchange rate that Australia had in 2000-01 no longer applies. This makes things tougher for our exporters. Notwithstanding a global recovery, it is the government's purpose to keep the Australian economy growing strongly with low inflation.</DOC>

 - Today the Reserve Bank board increased official interest rates by 25 basis points, taking the official interest rate to 5 per cent. If that is passed on to standard variable mortgages, it would be a rate of 7.05 per cent. Compared to the 10.5 per cent that applied when this government was elected, that means that on the standard Australian mortgage of $190,000 people are saving - on today's interest rates - $545 per month compared to the rate that applied when the Australian Labor Party thankfully left office. Not only was the rate 10½ per cent when the Australian Labor Party left office, but over the course of the 13 years of Labor government, interest rates averaged 12 per cent and peaked at 17 per cent. Today's interest rate, if the official rate is passed on, will be 7.05 per cent. What that illustrates is that interest rates, which have been at historic lows, are now moving back to more neutral rates, as the Reserve Bank said in its statement today. It named four reasons why it had taken that particular decision. The first was that the world economy was picking up; the second was that the Australian economy was strengthening; the third was that the inflation rate, whilst low, had exchange rate effects in it; and the fourth was that there was no need for monetary policy to continue to have a stimulatory effect on the economy.I will conclude by adding one last thing. Unemployment in this country is now at a 22-year low. We have been working to keep employment growth going in this country so that people who want to work can find a job. There is no reason why Australia should be afraid of low unemployment. The object of economic policy is to so grow the economy that people can find work - and jobs is the end result of good economic policy. Over the last two years, whilst the American economy lost two million jobs, 500,000 new jobs were created in Australia. That did not happen by accident; it happened because this government had the courage to put in place the decisions that were required to keep Australia strong. We were fought every step of the way by the Australian Labour Party, including the member for Werriwa, who was there on the battlements opposing good economic policy. There have been four shadow treasurers in my time as the Treasurer of this country, and one stands out as worse than all the others during that period. -  - No, there was one that was worse than Gareth. There was one that was worse than that one - and blow me down if the Australian Labor Party did not promote him for his efforts. He was hardly a distinguished occupant of that office, and the best thing that could be said about him was the manner in which he left it.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Makin for her question, and I acknowledge all her hard work as chairwoman of the coalition committee on health and ageing. I regret to tell the member for Makin that there is, unfortunately, a very significant gap in the existing Medicare system, and that is why the brand new MedicarePlus safety net is so necessary and so important to help the struggling families of Australia. Last year there were some 50,000 concession card holders who faced out of hospital out-of-pocket medical expenses exceeding $500. Last year there were 30,000 Australian families who faced out of hospital out-of-pocket medical expenses exceeding $1,000. These people deserve a safety net and they deserve a safety net now. Unless the Labor Party has somehow devised a way of guaranteeing universal bulk-billing for everyone for all services at all times, these families are going to be left in the lurch. Labor's policy is to promote the illusion, the cruel illusion, of universal bulk-billing while denying the reality of a strong and effective safety net. Labor's policy is bulk-billing for Kerry Packer, but no safety net for the battlers of Western Sydney.The member for Werriwa said yesterday that he wanted to make a fresh start, that he wanted to end the negativity which has characterised seven years of Labor opposition. Today he said that he thought we should all read stories to our children. Let me read something to the member for Werriwa. It was something he said in this parliament. He said:... the role of government is simple and twofold: first, to maximise choice ... and, second, to establish an efficient system of safety net provision ... to assist socioeconomically disadvantaged families ... Here is another statement from the member for Werriwa in this parliament: let me read it to him, as he reads to his kids every night. He said:The methodology of good health reform is to get effective public safety net provisions in place - That is exactly what this government is doing. This is the member for Werriwa's chance to prove that he is not just a pseudo-intellectual smart alec and an intellectual show-off, to prove that at least some of the words he said yesterday were truly meant and to pass this right and necessary and urgent safety net legislation.</DOC>

 - These are the incontrovertible facts -  - that under the Labor Party home mortgage variable interest rates averaged 12 per cent and peaked at 17 per cent. Under the coalition, home mortgage standard variable interest rates have averaged 7.15 per cent and, if today's 25 basis point rate is passed on, it will be 7.05. That is lower than the average under this government. - The consequence of that is that, on the same borrowing, somebody is paying, as opposed to when the Australian Labor Party left office, $545 per month less. As to the second part, about whether people are actually worse off, the way to measure liabilities is against assets. I can have no higher authority for this proposition than the member for Werriwa. The member for Werriwa - and I have the quotes; I have read them out to the House before - says that the way in which one measures liabilities is in relation to assets. The truth of the matter is that Australians have seen a remarkable increase in the value of their assets over the last 7½ years, and I will give you the figure. Net assets - that is, total financial assets plus other assets less liabilities - have increased by 106 per cent since 1996. So, Mr Speaker, what that is showing you is that -  - The member for Melbourne interjects, `Debt has increased.' I was giving net assets - that is, assets after liabilities. It takes into account debt. That is the whole point. And this is supposedly one of the bright members of the frontbench of the Australian Labor Party. One gives out the answer, `Assets after liabilities,' and he says, `What about debt?' Debt is actually a liability. Strange as it may seem, it is a liability. After we take liability off assets, net assets have increased by 106 per cent, which shows that, whatever the level of borrowings, Australians have enjoyed an increase in their net assets of over 100 per cent since 1996, which, far from making Australians worse off in net terms - that is, after liabilities - makes them significantly better off in terms of assets.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Farrer for her question and acknowledge her real interest in aviation matters. She is a keen pilot herself. The government's policy on the future airport needs of Sydney is clear. It is firmly based on the economic and planning needs of Sydney's future air traffic requirements. After exhaustive examination, it has become clear that the existing airport will be able to handle the air traffic demand for a long time to come. Changes in management and changes in aircraft coupled together mean that, even with the very real constraining arrangements we have put in place in Sydney airport - the curfew, the LTOP and so forth - there is no need to build a second Sydney airport.But I am asked about alternatives to the government's policy, and I have to say that they are not at all clear. The new opposition leader has, over the years, consistently and loudly declared himself to be a champion for the building of a second Sydney airport at Badgerys Creek. He has a history of it - a history he has been proud to promote. He outlined it in great detail in this House not long ago, in 2001. He went back to 1987, when he was on Liverpool council, and he said that, at that time, he started to advocate the construction of Badgerys Creek. He went on to say that he continued that advocacy when he became a mayor and the chairman of WESROC in 1991. Ten years later, he was still advocating the building of Badgerys Creek in the debates in this parliament. In fact, the member for Werriwa remained a staunch advocate for Badgerys Creek as a site for a second airport right up until 1 July this year. From 1987 to 2003 - that is, for 16 years - the member was an advocate for Badgerys Creek. But what happened then? On 1 July, the former Leader of the Opposition, the member for Hotham, suddenly announced that the Labor Party would not build a second airport at Badgerys Creek. Do you know what happened then?  - Suddenly the 16-year advocate of Badgerys Creek wanted us to believe that he had changed his mind, that he no longer supported Badgerys Creek. Other Sydney Labor Party members, like the members for Grayndler, Watson and Sydney, all stuck to their guns. - Yes. Well done. You stuck to your guns, and you had the gumption to criticise your leadership over the decision - but not the member for Werriwa. Not only did he suddenly declare that abandoning Badgerys, that walking away from his position of 16 years, was the right decision for Western Sydney, he even joined the Labor Party squad looking for an alternative airport - and aren't we waiting with great interest to hear where it might be? It has to be said that this was a pretty extraordinary backflip, especially when you think about what he also said in 2001 when he was outlining his support for the second airport at Badgerys. He said then - and I happen to agree with some of the sentiment of this: `One of the things that the public has grown cynical about is inconsistency in politics - people who take a position because of a change in direction in the political wind.' Not a change in direction of the facts, the economic need or the planning needs of a region but because the political wind has changed direction.We all know what happened in July this year. The facts about Badgerys Creek did not change. The gradual encroachment of housing or whatever close to the site did not suddenly change; airport needs did not suddenly change. There was no need to overturn our perfectly responsible policy position. The one thing that did change was the political wind in the Labor Party and, with it, the member for Werriwa. One thing is sure: he has down pat the essential Labor rule for leadership, which is to do `whatever it takes'.</DOC>

 - I do not have that report in front of me. But the member reads out that people are studying longer: they are. Does the Labor Party say that is a bad thing? People have said then that they have HECS debts. That scheme was introduced by the Australian Labor Party. Does the Australian Labor Party say that was a bad thing? I am asked the question: does the fact that people are studying longer and have HECS debts work against them? My view is that, if they are studying longer -   - the probabilities are that they will later be in higher paid employment. If the Australian Labor Party has an objection to HECS we ought to hear about it now, because it introduced it in 1994. This is one of those questions which the Australian Labor Party produces to try and insinuate they have a particular policy when they do not have that policy at all. The old member for Werriwa used to be the absolute champion on this. He would insinuate that he had a certain policy - whether it was on higher income earners, matched savings accounts or share ownership accounts - but when you sat down and costed it, it was never actually a policy; it was always just an idea. It was an idea that could be jettisoned 24 hours, seven days or a month later, or however long it took him to change his mind on that particular issue. I am asked a question about people studying longer with HECS debts. I think studying longer, by and large - not for every Australian - is a good thing. - I think the HECS provisions that this government has put in place -  - will provide for a better tertiary education system. The other thing I would say to young people coming through the educational system is this: hopefully they will not be coming out into a job market where unemployment is at 10 or 11 per cent - because it does not matter what your debt is if you cannot have a job; you will never be paying it. I think it matters in this country that under the Australian Labor Party unemployment was 11.3 per cent and it has been reduced to 5.6 per cent, because that means that millions of young Australians can get a start in life that they would never have had the opportunity to have under Labor and its mismanagement.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Page for his question. The Blair Labour government has recently announced tough new measures to deal with people-smuggling and has introduced legislation into the British parliament to make asylum laws more stringent: to fast-track deportations, to prosecute people who arrive without travel documents and to make people-trafficking itself an offence within the United Kingdom. The fact is that the British government, the Blair Labour government, has been increasingly tough on people-smuggling. One of the consequences of that is that it was able to announce at the end of last month the removal of 27 per cent more failed asylum seekers than in the previous period; in other words, it is having very real success. The honourable member asked if I was aware of any alternative views. The difference between British Labour and the Australian Labor Party is that the Labour government of Mr Blair - the man who supported the coalition of the willing but is never criticised by the Australian Labor Party - has been prepared to take tough action against people smugglers. At one stage, back in September last year, the present Leader of the Opposition liked the policy of the Blair government. He said that the Australian Labor Party needs to:... cross-over and solve the problems of crime, people trafficking and national security. In large part, this explains Tony Blair's success.Why the Leader of the Opposition would be opposed to so many of the sorts of policies that the Blair Labour government introduces and yet praise its success is a mystery to all. After all, when the Leader of the Opposition came back to Australia he joined with his colleagues in voting against excisions. - The Leader of the Opposition interjects about his coast guard. I say `his' coast guard because he was one of the shadow ministers, I understand, who was responsible for authoring the tin-pot coast guard policy. It would cost over $600 million. It would replace the role of the Navy and would lead to three motorboats being purchased to cover 59,000 kilometres of coastline with no excision policy. But what would be the job of those three motorboats? What would they be expected to do? It is pretty obvious. They are not in favour of an excision policy. They have criticised the government for towing the boat SIEV14 back to Indonesia. It is perfectly obvious what the Leader of the Opposition's policy is: it is for the coast guard - if they can find the boats - to bring those boats to Australia. I have said before that this would not be a coast guard; this would be a `coast guide', guiding the people smugglers' boats to the Australian shore.I want to say, finally, that this government does support cooperation with Indonesia. The opposition used to, before the current Leader of the Opposition came along. We now know, from what he said as quoted in the Sydney Morning Herald of January last year, that he believes:... Indonesia, in a highly irresponsible and illegal manner, has tried to pass on the flow of asylum seekers to our country.I also note that, on 10 December last year, the Leader of the Opposition attacked Indonesia for not adopting an Australian Labor Party policy. He said:... our nearest neighbour to the north, Indonesia ... does not have a coastguard either. It is no wonder ... we are vulnerable to people-smuggling over the medium term.So he lectured Indonesia about why they should have a `coast guard' of some kind - telling them that they were irresponsible and behaving illegally - and opposed a policy of excision. It stands in stark contrast to the toughening up of British Labour's approach to these issues and simply demonstrates the confusion of the Leader of the Opposition on most policy issues.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Jagajaga for her question. As the Treasurer reminded the House earlier, HECS - the Higher Education Contribution Scheme - was introduced by the Australian Labor Party in 1989. It was introduced because Labor recognised that if you looked forward to Australia's future - at a time when the Labor Party was thinking about the national interest, as distinct from itself - you would see that it was necessary, if we wanted to expand the size and improve the quality of Australian higher education, to introduce a system where the students as graduates, once they were working, would pay their share of the contribution back. What we now have in Australia is that Australian taxpayers - many of whom have never seen the inside of a university but who strongly support and understand the importance of higher education for this country's future - contribute 75 per cent of all the public money that goes into universities. The students, once they have graduated, then pay about one-quarter of the cost of their education, from which they derive a benefit.It is important to understand that, in terms of HECS changes since 1996, there has been a significant increase in the number of students who are actually in Australian universities. As a result of the introduction of HECS, we have doubled - over the space of almost 14 years - the proportion of Australians who have a university education and almost doubled the size of the university sector itself. I reminded the House yesterday that the Leader of the Opposition himself is an advocate of the full deregulation of university fees. The Leader of the Opposition himself has on at least three occasions, two of them published in reputable international education journals and the other on 18 December 2000 to a million readers in the Daily Telegraph, said that our higher education policy should allow for fee deregulation. To put that in plain language, the leader of the Australian Labor Party is arguing that universities should set whatever fee they think they should set. So I was rather surprised today, when I opened the West Australian newspaper, to see that a spokeswoman for shadow minister Jenny Macklin said that Labor's new education policy - which opposes fee increases and any deregulation - had the support of Mr Latham. Let us be clear about this: the Leader of the Opposition does support any fee deregulation -  -  - and the leader of the Labor Party is opposed to any deregulation of university fees! That is the position of the Australian Labor Party. The leader of the Labor Party does not seem to know whether he is Arthur or Martha - he does not know whether he is leading the Arthurs or the Marthas. I wish to table, for the benefit of the House, an article which he published in the Journal of Higher Education Policy and Management entitled, `The Network University' in 2001. In that well-researched publication the Leader of the Opposition said that the fees of internationally focused institutions, universities, should be deregulated. So two years ago the current Leader of the Opposition was arguing on a sustained basis through newspapers and other publications that university fees should be deregulated. Now that he is the leader of the Australian Labor Party, he is apparently opposed to any deregulation at all. For the record, this government does not support full deregulation of university fees. I table the article by the member for Werriwa, the leader of the Labor Party. I challenge the Labor Party and its leader to rule out any deregulation of university fees and - if he does want to think about Australia's future - to support the government's reform of higher education. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Paterson for his question. Obviously, it is an issue that is very important to him and to all his constituents in his part of the Hunter Valley. In fact, we consider the member for Paterson to be the representative in this parliament of everybody in the Hunter Valley - including the industries - because he knows their interests. This is a very important issue as far as our resource sector is concerned, particularly as far as exports from the resource sector are concerned. It has been made very clear by the Prime Minister - particularly in an answer to a question from the Leader of the Opposition yesterday - that we have decided not to ratify the Kyoto protocol because it is not in Australia's interests. And the member for Paterson knows that it is not in the interests of the people that he represents. If we were to ratify the Kyoto protocol without commitments from all major and potential emitters, we would be giving them an unfair advantage. We would be exposing Australian industry to unfair competition, and that is definitely not in the national interest. If we were to ratify Kyoto, investment in our energy intensive industries would start drifting offshore; they would be leaving Australia. We need to recognise the importance of those interests for the export sector. For example, the coal industry exports about $11.9 billion worth of coal out of Australia - and some of that coal is from the Stratford Coal Mine in the member for Paterson's electorate; aluminium exports are $7.6 billion - and some of that is from the Tomago aluminium smelter, also in the member for Paterson's electorate; and gas exports are $2.6 billion. There are in excess of  317,000 jobs involved in regional Australia, for example, in many of these industries, and we are not prepared to put those jobs at risk by signing up to this international treaty.In the discussions leading up to yesterday's ballot, I wonder what the member for Hunter had to say about the new Leader of the Opposition's implied support for the Labor Party to support the ratification of the Kyoto protocol and what that would mean to his constituents. I wonder what the member for Capricornia in Queensland or the member for Lingiari, as he flew back from New York to cast the deciding vote about the new leadership of the Labor Party, thought of that position. I wonder what they think about Labor's position and what it means for their constituents in their electorates.  We know what Queensland Labor and what Western Australian Labor think. They know that ratification of Kyoto would mean lost jobs in their states. The Queensland Labor government and the Western Australia Labor government are being very silent on this. They know that it is not in the national interest and they disagree with Latham and Labor on this issue.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Canberra for her question. I understand that there are residents from the Goodwin homes in Canberra here today. They have been invited to question time after the launch of the ACSA campaign, and we certainly welcome them here today. The Goodwin Aged Care Services is one of those services in Canberra that has been allocated an extra $1.5 million in recurrent funding under this government. An additional 80 places and capital funding of $1.7 million have been allocated to the Goodwin Aged Care Services under this government. They are a very good provider, and we are pleased to see them here.I am pleased that, on this rare occasion, Labor has asked a question on aged care. It gives me the opportunity to contrast the government's achievements in funding and subsidies, allocated places and innovative practices with Labor's woeful record. But we have heard it all before: there is a such a lack of direction, policy and alternative ideas; it is a policy-free zone over there. Yesterday I saw signs of life. For a moment I thought that it was going to be the emergence of a policy position on the part of Labor. I mistook it. The stirrings on the other side were in fact just the member for Canberra announcing on the floor of this House the launch of this political campaign in aged care. It was not Labor's campaign, mind you; it was a campaign of what has been termed a national political organisation - ACSA. So they have hopped on the bandwagon. That is fine; it is understandable that Labor would want to support a scare campaign - Labor would want to support anyone's campaign, I guess. After all, you get your questions drafted for you on that basis. It saves the tactics committee having to do it.But what is this campaign about? It is a contrived political campaign against the government to, first of all, portray the aged care industry as being in a state of imminent collapse. That is one of the slogans. Secondly - and this is of concern - this scare campaign is designed to undermine the Hogan review. As members would know, the Hogan review into pricing arrangements for residential care is an independent review that has been set up by the government to consider the financial viability of the sector and its short-term and long-term needs. It is yet to report to the government, but it has been an independent review, there has been very wide consultation and key stakeholders, including ACSA, have been invited to provide their ideas and their alternatives. But there has been not a word from Labor. There has not been one submission to the Hogan review from Labor - not an idea from them. The strategy document prepared by the public relations firm for this scare campaign talks about the timing of the campaign to create an appropriate climate prior to the release of the Hogan report. It says, `The most effective strategy will be to undermine the review process and, to work best, this strategy should start before the report is released.' This is what Labor is supporting. In the part of the document that talks about the media strategy and how they will use the media, it says, `This will lay the groundwork for attacking the inquiry as not having been properly conducted' -  - I am speaking about the campaign that was raised by -  - What this government is seeking to achieve with the Hogan review is to have an independent, wide ranging reference and consideration of the issues facing the financing of the aged care sector. I am pointing out that it is part of Labor's strategy to undermine the Hogan review. Supporting this ACSA campaign, which is laying the groundwork for attacking the inquiry before it has been released, is, I think, extraordinarily poor form. The member for Canberra said yesterday, `Boy, am I waiting for that pricing review report to be in my hands.' While she is supporting the review on the one hand, on the other hand she is trying to undermine the report. Essentially, this campaign has acknowledged `the government's line, supported by fact, that it is spending ever-increasing amounts of taxpayers' funds on aged care, combined with its reforms in the area, works well to neutralise arguments that it is not meeting its obligations in the area.' So much for an aged care industry in crisis. Finally, I guess they got something right. In addressing the support that the scare campaign expected from the ALP, it concluded rather sadly, `As in the past, the ALP continues to criticise the government's approach to resolving the issues related to aged and community care funding without proposing any hard solutions.' So say all of us.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Herbert for his question, and I acknowledge his very strong support for the process of rezoning the Great Barrier Reef to offer it greater protection. I have today announced a major environmental initiative to put the Great Barrier Reef on a sustainable basis for the long-term future. The Great Barrier Reef is Australia's greatest natural icon. The Great Barrier Reef is as Australian as the Boxing Day test match, it is as much a part of our identity as Waltzing Matilda. It is the largest coral reef on the planet and it is one of the world's great natural icons. The Great Barrier Reef is the economic powerhouse of northern Australia - responsible for tens of thousands of jobs and nearly $5 billion worth of economic activity. But it is under great pressure, and today the Howard government has accepted a plan to increase sixfold the protected zones and marine sanctuaries within the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park - creating the largest network of protected marine areas in the world. This plan is an insurance for the future to protect the reef. It lifts the area of high protection zoning from some 4.5 per cent of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park to 33.3 per cent. It is a historic plan based on sound science and, internationally, it will be widely hailed. This plan will ease pressures from land-based run-off, from pollution, from coral bleaching and from commercial and recreational fishing. At the same time, it will provide those involved in commercial fishing with much greater certainty for the future. It will lead to more and bigger fish within the Barrier Reef. It will ensure that this huge environmental asset, which is the foundation of the multibillion dollar tourist industry, will be protected for the future, and it will create additional jobs and opportunities in northern Queensland. I want to say that this plan has involved one of the most extensive public consultations on a natural resource matter in Australian history. Some 31,000 submissions have been received. It reflects the desires of the great majority of Australians to see this great national icon properly protected for the future. This is probably the largest environmental Christmas present that we could give the Australian people.</DOC>

 - This shows you why the opposition have no credibility on the environment: they ask me a question on the reduction of protection to the Great Barrier Reef on the very day I am announcing increased protection for it - an increase from 4.5 per cent of the marine park to 33.3 per cent. More than this, the level of protection in the final draft zoning plan is actually higher than it was in the draft zoning plan circulated in June. There has been no reduction whatever as a result of any decisions or recommendations of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority.But the government has made no secret of the fact that we wanted to consult with people. We have consulted with fishers. I have visited Mackay. I have consulted with the fishing industry. I have consulted with the conservationists and environmentalists. I have consulted with the member for Dawson and many other members. Local government officials have put in submissions and state members have put in submissions. At the end of the day, any decisions to put forward recommendations to be tabled in the zoning plan today have been made by the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority and not by me.I hope we see a much better performance on the environment from the opposition under the new leader. But I fear that will not be the case because on flipping through Civilising Global Capitalism I found that virtually every topic under the sun had been covered except one: the environment. There was no mention of it. </DOC>

 - What all Australians need is access to affordable, reliable health care. In the end, we do not actually run a politburo in Australia. Doctors themselves - medical practitioners - should be entitled to determine the extent to which they are going to bulk-bill. We are putting very significant further incentives into Medicare to encourage bulk-billing, but I do not see how the concept of a safety net can be confused, distorted, misrepresented or underestimated in its importance and its benefits. It will protect all 20 million Australians. Everyone will be protected by it. I think it is also worthy of note that the number of people likely to use and need the safety net is not actually terribly large. That is evidence that we have a fundamentally sound health system in this country. We are taking the necessary steps, or offering to take the necessary steps, to ensure that Medicare is secured as a mechanism for delivering health care to all Australians on an affordable basis. The minister's plan, in my view, is an extremely good one. It ought to passed, we need it in place and I would have thought it was one of the first tests of the new-found leadership of the Labor Party and its stated willingness to support this government whenever we put in place proposals which will benefit Australians. The question that must be asked is: why are you failing this test so early on? - </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. I think the House would be aware, and certainly the honourable member is aware, that there has been a proposal for quite some time being worked on by the United States administration and the previous, Clinton, administration to create a ballistic missile defence system. Today Senator Hill and I have announced that the Australian government will, in principle, participate in the United States led missile defence system program. This is a strategic decision to put in place a long-term measure to counter potential threats to Australia's security and its interests from ballistic missile proliferation. There are several countries in unstable regions that are developing longer range and sophisticated ballistic missiles, and in some cases they would have a weapons of mass destruction capability.I want to make this perfectly clear: missile defence systems are purely defensive. This is not an offensive system. It seeks to protect the territory and forces of the United States and its allies from ballistic missile attack and it will help deter rogue states from acquiring ballistic missile technology. Australia is not alone in recognising the value of ballistic missile defence. Countries close to us in the region, such as Japan, are very supportive of it. The British Blair Labour government has signed a memorandum of understanding with the Americans to explore possible future cooperation, and NATO allies of the United States are investigating missile defence for their own needs.Australia has and will continue to keep its regional partners and its friends informed of our participation in missile defence as it evolves. We have taken the opportunity to brief many of the countries in the region about our decision. The United States' keen interest in Australian participation reflects the very strong alliance relationship between our two nations. Access to technology of missile defence, including spin-offs for Australian industry, would not be possible without a robust alliance. I very much hope that this will be an example of a policy initiative which the Leader of the Opposition might like to support as part of his commitment to bipartisanship. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Werriwa for his question and for his new-found interest in Australia's greatest asset - our children and our future generation. The Howard government have got a very proud record on what we have done in the area of child care. Since 2000, when we introduced the child-care benefit, the demand for child care has increased dramatically. One of the main reasons why it has increased dramatically is because we have made it more affordable through the child-care benefit.Since the coalition came to government in 1996, in the area of outside school hours care - which I am glad the Leader of the Opposition is showing some interest in - there has been a 221 per cent increase. Why has that come about? It has come about because of the policies of the Howard government. In the area of family day care, there has been a 17 per cent increase, from around 61,000 places to about 70,000 places. When you look at the number of children today who are using some type of Commonwealth funded child care you see that there has been an increase of 190,00 children, to 750,000. This has been a very good story on child care. Nevertheless, the government is conscious of some of those areas of unmet demand and it will always be responding to assist Australian families. All I can say to the Leader of the Opposition is: watch this space.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Hinkler for his question and I note the importance of regional aviation to the people of his electorate - particularly in Gladstone and Bundaberg, but in other areas as well. As members would be aware, we significantly upgraded aviation security arrangements immediately following the September 11, 2001 attacks in America. Furthermore, about this time last year, we announced a wide-ranging suite of further measures, particularly for our major airports in this country, and we have been putting those in place during the course of this year. More recently, we have heard much of the debate about the security of the regional aviation sector and also about the surplus funds from the Ansett levy. We have listened carefully to that debate, we have considered the review of aviation security by our intelligence agencies and we have developed a package which will invest any surplus - and a lot more money over and above that - from the Ansett ticket levy to achieve the best outcome for the aviation and tourism sectors. The package of measures which I launched this morning - and this is very important - is threat and risk based and driven, to ensure that, in the short and long term, the security of Australian aviation and the travelling public is safeguarded. The aviation security regime will now be extended to cover all airports handling passengers - some 180 airports across Australia. Freight aircraft, charter flights, and private and corporate jets will all have to be more accountable for their approach to security. There will be a much greater presence on the ground at airports. The travelling public will be able to see many, but by no means all, of the changes in security. The government will establish a $14 million grant program to assist smaller regional airports to put in place appropriate security measures. We will meet the total cost of installing hardened cockpit doors for all aircraft with more than 30 seats. There will be greater compliance monitoring and enforcement of air freight security. New freight screening technology will be trialled by the Customs Service and by the CSIRO. All staff at airports servicing passenger and freight aircraft will undergo background checking and will be issued with security identification cards to ensure the integrity of security restricted areas at airports.The likelihood of aircraft theft will be significantly reduced because operators of general aviation aircraft will need to put in place practical measures to guard aircraft against the risk of theft. Pilots and trainee pilots will undergo background checking and be issued with new, tamper proof photographic licences. An inspector of transport security will be appointed to investigate major transport security incidents and an office of transport security - which is an upgrade of the current division arrangement that I have in my department - will be established to deal specifically with the security of Australia's transport systems.These measures constitute a very comprehensive approach based on the best and latest intelligence and proper risk management techniques to secure the level of security that we need across aviation in Australia. I believe that they will be widely welcomed; I certainly believe that they very significantly increase the security of the travelling public.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and I am pleased to give a detailed and comprehensive answer to it, because it is important. It is a serious issue; it deserves a serious response. But I will say at the outset that the opposition spokesman's lack of understanding of this clearly reveals that he ought to accept my invitation of last week to go down and talk to the experts at Fairbairn. By way of preamble, it is very important to put this report and other claims about the new airspace arrangements into context. Firstly, in any week in Australian skies, about 100 incidents are reported to the Australian Transport Safety Bureau. As I explained to the House earlier this week, most of those incidents involve minor equipment malfunctions, minor errors by pilots or repositioning of aircraft during their approach to airports. Very few of them are serious. Only on rare occasions do they become life threatening. They are part and parcel of air traffic control around our skies. In the end we have to face the simple reality that, if pilots never made errors and planes never entered the same part of the sky, there would be no need for air traffic control.All of the types of incidents I referred to are reviewed by the ATSB. They are the body charged with investigating these matters, getting to the bottom of them and, if necessary, making recommendations for changes. Over the course of the year, very importantly indeed - and again, I urge the opposition spokesman to go down and get across the broad facts here - believe it or not, there are about 100 incidents where collision alerts fitted to commercial aircraft are triggered. Every one of those incidents is thoroughly investigated. In the case of the Melbourne incident that is being reported today, the ATSB have decided to conduct a detailed investigation.From what I have been advised at the very early stages of that investigation, I can confirm to the House that at about 10 minutes past 10 yesterday morning, about 50 miles north of Melbourne airport, the collision alarm was triggered on a Virgin flight, involving a 737 aircraft, en route from the Gold Coast. The alarm was triggered by a Cessna 421 that had entered the separation zone surrounding the 737. The aircraft were flying in the same direction at different altitudes and, very importantly in the context of the way that the member asked the question, both aircraft - I emphasise both aircraft - had been and were in contact with air traffic control. As part of the investigation and in accordance with normal procedure, the air traffic controller involved has been stood down while the inquiries progress.In relation to the introduction of NAS, it is far too early to draw any conclusions as to why the Cessna impinged on the 737 separation zone. That is the advice from the Australian Transport Safety Bureau. If the Leader of the Opposition or his transport spokesman believe they know more than the ATSB then I suggest they take up a new role and go and apply for a job with the ATSB!The other thing is that the member for Batman should have learnt from his earlier intervention this week. He claimed in here that a midair collision had only been narrowly averted over Tamworth last Saturday. I was actually in Tamworth at that airport for several hours that day and I must say I did not feel at all threatened. That is what he claimed. They say they are worried about this. That report has been assessed and I have been advised by safety authorities that what actually happened in Tamworth was that, at a little past five o'clock on Saturday afternoon, a privately owned Cessna 172 was making a normal approach to Tamworth airport. As required under NAS procedures, the pilot made radio contact with the tower to seek clearance to enter Tamworth's class D airspace. He was about 500 feet higher than he should have been. He was told to delay his descent, which he did. The tower was aware that a Dash 8 commercial aircraft was also making an approach. It told the Cessna pilot to remain outside class D space until the Dash 8 was clear and then to follow it in, maintaining visual separation. That is exactly what happened. That is a completely normal landing procedure for two aircraft at a regional airport - the sort of thing that happens hundreds of times a day. There was no emergency, no near miss, no incident for either pilot to report. The only thing that went wrong was that the member for Batman came in here with the lines he got from his union mates, scaremongering in the same way as the unions have done with the Tamworth NorthernDaily Leader. The union made up the story. They gave it to the member for Batman and he did his riding instructions. He came into this place, he did not ask any questions and he did not check with air safety authorities; he just did the union's bidding.When NAS was introduced last Thursday and the member for Batman started his daily question from the union, I invited him to go down there - just down to Fairbairn - and get some facts. I invite him to do that again: find out what this is about. - He laughs. He does not want to be bothered. I can understand that last week he was too busy to do that - he did not have time. But I repeat that invitation today: he should go down and visit the implementation group and make sure that he can actually comment on this in an informed way. We are about improving safety in Australia's skies. The question is a serious one; I have given it a serious response.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Indi for her question. I can inform the House that when the First Fleet landed at Botany Bay in 1788 there were 1,000 people aboard, and Australia's population at that time - the Indigenous population - has been estimated at perhaps 300,000, perhaps some more; some demographers have said up to one million. But the Indigenous population was not counted in the census until after the 1967 referendum. From that beginning population growth was initially very rapid, and we reached one million people in 1858. One hundred years later, in 1959, Australia's population reached 10 million people. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, today, 4 December 2003, Australia's population has officially become 20 million people.Over the last 100 years or so, Australia has had some massive achievements. This is a country which has a robust democracy. It has an unshakeable judiciary. It has developed one of the most prosperous economies of the world, and it has given home to many millions of migrants who have come to this country for a better life. Last year, Australia welcomed its 6,000,000th migrant to our shores. There are many people - indeed, in some ways, all of us in this House - who have been part of the migration story of Australia. I think as we look back at the story of Australia on this, the day when our population became 20 million people, there are reasons for great pride at the Australian achievement. Demographers have various projections as to where the Australian population will be going over the next 40 years or so. The medium growth predictions of the ABS are for about 26 million or 27 million in 40 years time.We know from our Intergenerational Report that, with the ageing of the population, we will be opening up a five per cent fiscal gap between expenditures and revenues over the next 40 years unless we can address that with strong expenditure restraint and increased economic growth based on participation and productivity. This is a government which is thinking very much about the long term. That is why we brought down the Intergenerational Report. That is why we are putting a financially sustainable basis on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. That is why we are reforming the Australian welfare system. That is why we gave Australia a competitive taxation system to boost our productivity. But, if we look back at the composition of Australia today and its achievements, its ethnic composition is very different to what it was 100 years ago. We have seen an increase in the number of migrants who have come from Asia as opposed to Europe. But we can say that, in spite of differences of culture or race, this is a very successful country, and today we are 20 million people. </DOC>

 - I am asked whether I can confirm that I am the first Treasurer in history to issue a conclusive certificate. Unfortunately I cannot. My predecessor as federal Treasurer was Ralph Willis. He issued a conclusive certificate under section 36 of the Freedom of Information Act. His predecessor was the Hon. John Sydney Dawkins, who also issued a conclusive certificate under section 36 of the Freedom of Information Act. In 1994, Assistant Treasurer George Gear issued certificates under the Freedom of Information Act. In 1992, Brian Howe issued conclusive certificates relating to taxation matters under the Freedom of Information Act.I asked the Australian Government Solicitor for statistics on how many conclusive certificates have been so issued. They said they kept certificates between 1982 and 1986. People will recall that the Labor government was elected in 1983. The Australian Government Solicitor kept records between 1982 and 1986, and for the bulk of that time the Labor Party was in office. In that time, there were 55 conclusive certificates issued under the Freedom of Information Act. Fourteen were contested in the AAT. Since that time, the Australian Government Solicitor have only kept records of those that have been contested, and since that time a further 13 have been contested, but many, many more would have been issued. I think the record speaks for itself, and I think the question speaks for itself. </DOC>

 - First, I thank the member for Fadden for his question. I know that he shares with many members of the House great concern about the issue of terrorism and the war against terrorism. There is a long way to go in the war against terrorism, but substantial progress has been made against al-Qaeda. Nearly twothirds of its senior leaders and operatives have been either taken into custody or killed. Over 3,000 people who have been involved with al-Qaeda are in custody world wide. In Afghanistan the Taliban regime, which harboured al-Qaeda, is gone. On our own regional front line, in South-East Asia, Hambali, who was like the chief executive officer of Jemaah Islamiah, has been captured and the interrogation is yielding valuable information. About 200 Jemaah Islamiah people have now been retained and, through our cooperation with Indonesia, the Indonesians have convicted 29 people responsible for the Bali bombing. The campaign against terrorist financing is also making headway. Almost $US200 million - about $A250 million - has been frozen in 1,400 accounts around the world. It is also important to say that the end of Saddam Hussein's regime has been the end of a regime which supported terrorist organisations like the Mujaheddin-e Khalq, the Palestine Liberation Front and Abu Nidal, and even accepted the presence of al-Qaeda operatives in Iraq. The last point I would make is that the country carrying the heaviest burden in the war against terrorism is the United States. In the US international affairs budget for 2004 the American administration sought from the congress $4.7 billion in economic, military and democracy assistance to key foreign partners and allies in the antiterror campaign. The honourable member asked whether I was aware of any alternative views. Yesterday there was an article in the Age by the Leader of the Opposition, who questioned and, I believe, ridiculed the US performance and capability in the war against terrorism. He used quotes from a disgruntled former CIA officer. The Leader of the Opposition placed great store on these quotes - quotes suggesting that the CIA lacked the capabilities to fight the war against terrorism.So yesterday the Leader of the Opposition was denigrating the United States efforts in the war against terrorism. But what happened today? A new day dawned and the Leader of the Opposition - I am advised - just before question time held a joint press conference. This press conference, amongst other things, was apparently to demonstrate the Leader of the Opposition - far from being critical of the American alliance, which we all know he has been, in spades, over the last few years, in all of his time in parliament - embracing the American alliance. What is more, the press conference, I am advised - I am not sure, but I am advised - was held in the caucus room in front of not just an Australian flag but also an American flag. The Leader of the Opposition now, after two days of pressure in the parliament, has almost literally started wrapping himself in the Stars and Stripes. Not only is the Leader of the Opposition on this issue phoney and insincere but I think he is showing himself to be - what is a greater offence for a Leader of the Opposition - very weak.  </DOC>

In accordance with the Freedom of Information Act, where that is contested, it will go to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and be argued in the courts.  - I do welcome the member for Hotham back to the front bench, and his interventions.

 - On the day that Latham Labor have voted against a brand-new medical safety net for the battlers of Western Sydney - on the day that they have ratted on the battlers of Western Sydney - I regret to inform the House that Latham Labor are also opposing in the Senate a government bill designed to stop plaintiff lawyers, and the member for Lalor used to be one, from exploiting the Trade Practices Act to subvert and undermine tort law reform. Tort law reform is an essential part of solving the medical indemnity crisis. The state Labor governments support tort law reform, but Latham Labor are sabotaging it in the Senate. Tort law reform is not a party political issue, but Latham Labor are playing politics with this issue in the Senate. The member for Werriwa says that he does not want to engage in opposition for opposition's sake. Well, here is another chance for him to live up to what he says is his principle by joining the Howard government and joining the state Labor governments in supporting tort law reform in the Senate. Let me quote the New South Wales government. The New South Wales government has written of the government's bill in the Senate that it would: ... prefer that the bill be passed without amendment. The intention of the amendment to the bill proposed by the federal opposition is not clear.The New South Wales government knows all about the member for Werriwa. I would like to quote from an article in the Australian earlier this week. It said:In a line worthy of Oscar Wilde, the NSW Premier mused aloud: 'Mark Latham as leader of the federal Labor Party?' ... 'That would be a diverting nine months.'It is not just the New South Wales government which is supporting the Howard government on tort law reform. The South Australian government, the West Australian government, the Tasmanian government, the ACT government and the Northern Territory government - all these Labor governments are supporting the Howard government on tort law reform. It is like Kim Beazley said, it is like the member for Brand put it when he said:Many in the Labor Party await with bated breath for Mark Latham to do more damage to the Liberal Party than he does to the Labor Party and taxi drivers ...  - I simply make the point that the point of order was taken by a former senior partner in a law firm which actually patented the slogan `no win, no fee' - the ultimate ambulance-chasing law firm.</DOC>

 - The Freedom of Information Act provides for certain documents which should be released under the act and certain which should not - or may not - including internal working documents. That is set out in section 36. The issue of a conclusive certificate in relation to section 36, as I have previously disclosed, has occurred on a number of occasions - by Labor treasurers, assistant treasurers and in fact Labor ministers - because internal working documents are considered exempt documents under section 36. - In relation to that, as in relation to all freedom of information requests, where there is a dispute it goes to an independent adjudication by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. This will be argued in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. It will be argued according to law. That is the proper jurisdiction in which to determine the question. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question and inform her that data released this morning by the Australian Bureau of Statistics shows that Australia's trade deficit for the month of October was $1.6 billion. This was an improvement of around $600 million on September's trade deficit. The narrowing of the trade deficit reflected an increase in exports and a decrease in imports. Exports rose 1.7 per cent. Services exports were the key driver, rising eight per cent - boosted by the influx of visitors for the Rugby World Cup and consistent with a rebound in international tourism following the SARS epidemic. I pay tribute to the honourable member because I know that she is absolutely focused on Australia's tourism industry. She represents one of Australia's premier tourist areas and will be quite pleased to see a bounce back in services tourism.Exports of rural goods rose slightly in October, increasing by two per cent, which was the second monthly rise; but rural exports remain 21 per cent lower over the year. We have been through the worst drought in 100 years in Australian history. It looks as if it has bottomed and it may have turned, but it has a long way to come back. There are a number of areas of Australia which are still in deep drought. When you put together the last year - a weak world economy still reeling from the effects of a US recession; the worst drought in 100 years; the SARS epidemic, which affected the tourism industry; the war in Iraq, which was also affecting world confidence and world markets - you find that, despite all of those events, the Australian economy showed remarkable resilience. To have a growth of 1.2 per cent for the September quarter, which was announced yesterday, is testament to the resilience of the Australian economy. This government is determined to continue good economic policy. We know that it is good economic policy that is going to provide the jobs for young Australians, that is going to provide the basis for our health and educational systems. We cannot afford to have the fad policies that some promulgate around this place, that change from hour to hour, from day to day, from Nightline to lunchtime - the kooky ideas that come and go but would do enormous damage to the Australian economy if the person who puts them forward ever got into a position of responsibility. Economic responsibility, economic determination and economic policy require consistent leadership and dedication to the task. That has been a hallmark of the coalition government since 1996, and that hallmark will continue.</DOC>

 - As the honourable member for Rankin knows, this government has put in place a code and guidelines in relation to the building industry. We have done that in addition to putting into place an interim task force, because we are determined that choice, flexibility and freedom for people to be able -  - We are determined that so far as possible in Australia, freedom, choice and flexibility in the workplace and in relations between employers and employees should prevail. That is one of the major trends in workplace relations in this country. It is one to which we are committed and it is one which is delivering real results for Australian workers and their families. Because of the flexibility and choice that this government has put in place through changes to the workplace relations system, we have a situation today where, in the term of this government, there has been the creation of 1.3 million jobs. We have a situation today where the unemployment rate at 5.6 per cent is at a rate which has never been lower for 22 years. - Yes.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Dunkley for his question. I acknowledge his leadership of the government members committee and strong support for the preparation of the zoning plan. The impact of the Great Barrier Reef rescue plan on the coastal communities and particularly on the tourism industry is going to be massively beneficial. It is going to protect one-third of the Great Barrier Reef from extractive activities and it will secure the economic powerhouse of North Queensland. I am very pleased to say that the Queensland tourism industry has welcomed this plan in a very dramatic way. The Queensland Tourism Industry Council has applauded the plan, saying: This plan is a crucial step in protecting one of Australia's greatest natural assets and a milestone in demonstrating our ability to manage our resources. We congratulate Minister Kemp and the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority not only on this outcome but also on the open process of consultation which preceded it.  The executive director of the Association of Marine Park Tourism Operators said:I doubt that I will see a more important conservation effort anywhere in the world in my lifetime. The process of consultation has come in for particular commendation. The Game Fishing Association of Australia Research and Development Foundation said: The minister and the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority have listened to the concerns expressed by hundreds of game fishers from all over Australia and the world, restoring faith in the public consultation process. The recreational fishing body, Sunfish, through its chair, Bill Turner, has also supported the process and said:Just like we have stopped the rape and pillage of the rainforest, we think the same should apply to the reef.It is very satisfying to see that an internationally renowned and respected conservationist such as Sir David Attenborough is quoted in today's press as saying: The Australian people are increasing protection for one of the natural wonders of the world.The Worldwide Fund for Nature and the Humane Society International have commended the government on this plan. The WWF have described it as a stunning achievement and a win for all Australians, while the Humane Society International has hailed it as `an international precedent that will put Australia at the forefront of marine conservation and management.' The Wilderness Society, which has not always been a friend of the government, has described it as `a powerful and major step forward' and states that `Minister Kemp and the Howard government have shown clear environmental leadership.' The world has noticed what Australia is doing here. From al-Jazeera to the Washington Post, to the BBC, from Paris to Durban, people are reading and hearing that the Australian government wants to make the Great Barrier Reef the best-protected coral reef in the world.In conclusion, the Australian government is very aware that this magnificent plan is going to have some impacts on commercial fishing, and we will be putting in place a very fair and equitable adjustment package to assist these particular members of the north Queensland community. I am pleased to say also that there has been support from the Australian Democrats - which I welcome and acknowledge - but from the opposition, for opposition's sake, from Latham Labor, we have had simply more carping. The deckchairs over there have been rearranged, but nothing has changed.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. I am aware of the information that he indicated in terms of the ownership of the company, but the structure is a little bit different, in that I understand that the individuals that he mentioned hold 10,000 shares each. The third party, Mr Bertrand, holds 20,000 shares, so it is a split in that direction. As I indicated in my earlier answer, as far as applicants to the EMDG program are concerned, the scheme is non-discretionary. Grants are accessed and paid by Austrade according to the rules set out in the Export Market Development Grants Act 1997. It is a highly successful scheme. Last year, 3,800 small and medium-sized Australian enterprises received assistance from the EMDG program.  I say again: I understand this scheme was launched - interestingly, given that former Prime Minister Gough Whitlam is in the gallery - by the Whitlam government in 1974. It has been conducted and has had rules applied in a similar manner, at arms-length in terms of the scrutiny of applications, the assessment of the appropriateness of businesses that apply, and ensuring that the objectives are maintained - and that is to enhance opportunities for exports into international markets and to sustain the employment in those businesses. I understand that in this business there are some 20-odd employees whose jobs rely on this area. This issue has been brought to my attention by the member for Corangamite. In asking Austrade during the assessment process that was undertaken, the sorts of issues that have been raised were investigated in terms of the appropriateness of the loan according to the rules and the law at the time.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Forrest for his question.  - I can indicate to him and to the House that there are two significant trends relative to industrial relations and trade unions. The first is a trend towards greater freedom and choice in the workplace, which I referred to earlier. The second is a significant trend in terms of widespread rejection of trade unions in Australia. Indeed, three out of four workers in Australia are no longer members of a trade union.  - If one looks at the private sector, five out of six workers have rejected the trade unions. I have seen some comments in relation to these trends. For example, I came across this quote: It is difficult to understand how, in the long term, centralised wage-fixing has helped Australian workers. Further: The industrial era of big institutions is dying. Big trade unions are approaching their use-by dates. Another comment was:Trade unionism in this country is in crisis. How can unions survive if they fail to appeal to people in newly-created enterprises and workplaces? The union movement needs to find a way of becoming relevant. Otherwise, it runs the risk of becoming yet another dinosaur from the industrial age.Who said this? Was it the Treasurer or the Minister for Health and Ageing? No, each one of these quotes comes from none other than the new Leader of the Opposition. `Centralised wage fixing hasn't helped ordinary Australians,' is what the new Leader of the Opposition said. He said that big unions have approached their use-by date. He said in addition to that - and the workers walking away in their droves are evidence of this - that the unions in Australia, and their bosses, are becoming another dinosaur of the industrial age. We on this side of the House say he is right; we agree. But there is a major difference between what you say and what you do. Now is a testing time for the Leader of the Opposition. Is he going to stand by the trade union movement, which only represents one in four workers today? I noted, incidentally, that most of their bosses were lobbying over the weekend for their members to vote against him. Is the Leader of the Opposition going to stand by the trade union movement or will he support what the overwhelming majority of Australian workers want: flexibility and choice and freedom to negotiate directly with their employers? That is the choice for the Leader of the Opposition. Is the Leader of the Opposition a man of substance who will do what he believes in and what he has said? We have seen many quotes from him. But will he do what he believes in? - Mr Speaker, I was also asked, `What was the government's response to it?' and that is what I am doing: responding to the trends. - What this and the interjection by the member for Rankin show is that there are deep divisions in the Labor Party. We know that. But the question is: is the Leader of the Opposition a man of substance? Will he do what he believes in rather than say one thing and do the other? If he does what he believes in, he will support the government's workplace relations program.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Jagajaga for her question. The facts in relation to the contributions made by Australian students - which are made toward the cost of their education once they are graduates and have left university - are: firstly, students in this country contribute about one-quarter to the cost of their university education, which they pay back through the tax system when they are working; and, secondly, the Australian taxpayer contributes about 75 per cent of the total cost of university education. That continues to be the case under the proposals that have been put before the Senate by this government. Firstly, what is critically important is that Australians recognise that what the member for Jagajaga has just cited includes in Australia revenues which are derived from 118,000 international students, who contribute in total about $1.6 billion in fees to Australian universities. I would also point out that in the United Kingdom course costs are 35 to 100 per cent higher than they are in Australia. In US public universities course costs are 20 to 75 per cent higher than they are in Australia. In US private institutions university fees are four times higher than they are in Australia.I also add that under the changes which are being proposed by the government in relation to HECS, for the very first time in this country, Australian universities will be required to set their own HECS charge. There will be absolutely no change at all for nurses and teachers. The universities will set the HECS charge from zero up to a level which is no more than 25 per cent above what it currently is. I also point out to the House that Australian university graduates have a lifetime unemployment rate which is one-quarter that of those who have not been to university and that 92 per cent of such graduates have a job within four months of leaving university. - In Australia last year, university graduates of the 18 most popular courses earned more in total in their first year of working alone than the maximum possible they would pay for HECS. The Labor Party should remember that this government, opposed by the Labor Party, is trying to put another $10.5 billion of taxpayers' hard-earned money into universities over the next decade and that 42 per cent of Australian men between the ages of 25 and 42 -  - earn less than $32,000 a year. - I say to the member for Jagajaga and all the people behind her in the Labor Party: remember those hardworking men and women who pay for three-quarters of what happens in Australian universities and who will continue to do so and rely on what those universities do. Drop your obsession with those who graduate as doctors, lawyers, dentists, vets and economists - people who have sound careers in front of them. - </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Mallee for his question and recognise his passionate interest in rural communities. The Agriculture Advancing Australia package has certainly made a tremendous contribution to rural and regional Australia, dating back to when the Deputy Prime Minister introduced it in his days as minister for agriculture. Around 58,000 primary producers have participated in FarmBis training programs since July 2001. Those programs, I might add, have been supported on a dollar-for-dollar basis by state Labor governments. A large number of farmers also participate in other elements of the program, such as the Farm Management Deposit Scheme and the welfare program available under Farm Help. The member for Mallee asked a very important question when he asked about alternative policies. The Leader of the Opposition has now been in office for one whole week of parliamentary sittings, and people in rural and regional Australia are still desperately waiting for some kind of signal from him as to what his attitude might be towards rural and regional areas. What does this Western Sydney-centric leader have to say about rural and regional affairs? Frankly, he has said nothing all week. I have had to go back and search through some of his articles to find any comments at all about rural and regional Australia.I had to go right back to an article in the Daily Telegraph of 19 February 2001. If this article is a demonstration of the Leader of the Opposition's attitude to rural and regional Australia, then country people have a lot to be concerned about. In that article he sailed into farmers, claiming that they are the most heavily subsidised part of the economy. That is a completely untrue statement which demonstrated his attitude towards regional areas and underlined the venomous attack on the rural sector that followed. He went on to criticise tax concessions and handouts to people in rural areas. The handouts he was so venomously opposed to included zone rebates; write-offs for water conservation and land care expenses; drought investments; tax concessions for telephones and electricity lines; income tax averaging; the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme; education allowances; and exemptions from capital gains tax. That is the list of items that the Leader of the Opposition thinks ought to go from rural and regional Australia. He went on to write:But wait, there's more. Just last week I uncovered another nice little earner called FarmBis. The Federal Government is spending $38 million on management training for farmers and their families. No other part of the workforce receives assistance of this kind.He put aside the billions of dollars that this government spends on education and workplace training, but he lined up the $38 million FarmBis program for particular attention. If this is to be the new look Leader of the Opposition who is going to develop a new direction, he is going to have to do a lot of policy backflips before anybody in rural and regional Australia will be prepared to trust him.</DOC>

 - We do not have a bulk-billing target because no other government has ever had a bulk-billing target. We understand, as the former government understood, that governments do not set bulk-billing rates; doctors set bulk-billing rates. What would the member opposite think if someone said, `I have never believed nor asserted nor intended that bulk-billing would apply to everyone'? You would think, `That's just that evil, horrible, monstrous coalition government minister for health.' In fact, it was none other than the member for Perth, the rooster become frontbencher, who said earlier today: `Labor has never believed nor asserted nor intended that bulk-billing would apply to everyone.' That is exactly the position of this government, and the member for Perth on his first day back on the front bench has completely sabotaged the attack of the member for Lalor.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Pearce for her question and very strong support for Ellenbrook Christian College and Sawyers Valley Primary School. This government believes very strongly that every one of the 3.3 million students in Australian schools should be supported through Commonwealth and state taxes and, having paid their taxes to support state government schools, that all parents should be and will be supported by this government in making choices for their children should they send them to Catholic and independent schools. However, there are other views on this subject. The member for Werriwa, now the Leader of the Opposition, told the parliament on 29 August 2001, only two years ago:... not every school should be entitled to public funding.I thought perhaps this was just a moment where he was under a bit of duress and he basically lost it - he said something he did not really mean. I had heard a bit of talk about the need to read at night, so last night I picked up a book. I am tucked up in bed and I am reading What Did You Learn Today? by Mr Mark Latham. I got to page 44. I read in paragraph six of the book, under the plan for school resourcing, `Not every school should be entitled to public funding.' So I thought, `Here we are!' So the Labor Party has chosen a leader who believes that some children in this country are so unworthy that they will receive no public funding in support of their education. But then I became confused because the member for Jagajaga in the House only two days ago said:The opposition accept that all schools should receive some public funding ...So Arthur says, `No funding for some schools,' and Martha says, `Some funding for all schools.' So what is it? I will tell you, Mr Speaker. I can tell you what the real agenda is. The real agenda was set out in the Sydney Morning Herald on 7 July this year, under the heading `Unions press ALP over Catholic schools': Public teacher unions have a $1 million fighting fund to campaign before the next federal election for private school funding to be slashed and have already singled out Catholic schools for special attention.The president of the Australian Education Union, Pat Byme, said a group of 12 federal politicians - believed to be mainly Labor - had also been formed to lobby - in support of this particular view. So here we have it. Where are the dirty dozen? Where is the leader? Is it the Leader of the Opposition? I suspect it is not the member for Lowe, but somewhere at the back here are 12 members of the federal Labor Party who are campaigning, in support of the views of the Leader of the Opposition whom they have just elected, to take money from non-government schools and Catholic schools in particular. This government will not under any circumstances accept a situation where some children will receive no money in support of their education.</DOC>
