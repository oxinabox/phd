     Given the substantial failings of the Commonwealth's immigration processes, which left Cornelia Rau, a seriously mentally-ill Australian resident, locked up and deprived of treatment for months, will the Prime Minister now ensure that the inquiry to be conducted by former Australian Federal Police Commissioner Mick Palmer will be public and will be given all the necessary judicial powers to fully investigate the matter?
     Further, can the Prime Minister give a guarantee that there is no other Australian resident or citizen caught up in the immigration detention system in a similar way.

     You can't treat people like this in Australia in 2005.
    Does the Prime Minister agree that Cornelia Rau is entitled to an apology for her detention without proper assessment and without treatment for her serious mental illness?

     Isn't it the case that the Reserve Bank of Australia in its monetary policy statement released yesterday identified that inflationary pressures were being generated in the domestic sector by 'higher labour costs, due to skill shortages' and that 'sharp increases in wages have also been reported in localised parts of the business services sector where skill shortages are particularly acute'?
     Given the substantial reduction in training of Australians in the traditional trades -  - It is.
     Don't these comments show it is the failure of the government to address skill shortages that is now putting upward pressure on inflation and interest rates?

     Government member - He just said that.
     - I repeat: leave out the payroll taxes.
     If this is the case, don't they show that the tax burden for a single income earner on 67 per cent of average earnings has still increased by 2.
    1 percentage points over the last nine years and for a sole parent on 67 per cent of average earnings has still increased by 3.
    4 percentage points over the last nine years?
     If the coalition claims to be low taxing, why has the net tax burden on these individuals and these families increased over the last nine years?

     My question is to the Prime Minister and follows his discussion, in an answer to a previous question of mine, of the article by John Edwards he enjoined me to read, which I can assure him I have done.
     Does the Prime Minister recollect this in Mr Edwards's argument:_ the Howard government and specifically Peter Costello as Treasurer are riding the boom, but doing very little to sustain it.
     They are failing to use the prosperity generated by the boom, the vast increase in tax revenue, and greater willingness to accept change that arises from continued success and the existence of full employment, to entrench growth and build Australia's competitive advantages.
    Prime Minister, are you also aware that Mr Edwards said of you and the Treasurer:_ they have done very poorly in preparing Australia for the issues posed by an extended period of strong growth, and by Australia's increasing integration into a fast changing global economy.
     - I will ask him a question.
     Prime Minister, are you further aware that Mr Edwards singled out your rotten performance on infrastructure and education for the fact that the excellent system which you inherited has now been trashed by you?
     Prime Minister, will you concede -   -  - I am coming to it.

     With recent allegations of drug smuggling, baggage mishandling and heightened concerns regarding terrorism, does the Deputy Prime Minister stand by his comment that the Inspector of Transport Security is a part-time job and that it is acceptable to have it unfilled as, indeed, it was for some 15 months?
     Given the 200 department of immigration cases now referred to the Palmer inquiry, does the Deputy Prime Minister stand by his claim that as Inspector of Transport Security 'Mr Palmer has stepped aside for a short term only'?
     Will the Deputy Prime Minister tell the Prime Minister to return Mr Palmer as Inspector of Transport Security full time, given the manifold problems that have emerged in that area, and to support a royal commission into the department of immigration?

     Can the minister confirm that the government has held since September 2004 a Customs report identifying security breaches at Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport including passengers' baggage containing large amounts of narcotics being diverted to domestic carousels to avoid Customs inspections, 39 security screeners with serious criminal convictions, engineers with unauthorised duplicate keys, black spots not under surveillance in the airport's basement corridors and that Customs checks of aircrew are rare despite evidence showing that they were 'an extremely high risk'?

     Minister, doesn't the government's minimum conditions standard provide four weeks annual leave and eight days sick leave, which is less than the five- to six-week annual leave entitlement in about 30 federal awards and less than the sick leave entitlement in more than 50 federal awards?
     Didn't the minister's spokesperson say on 15 July that they 'did not think drafters had worked out whether award conditions coming over and above the standard would be lost'?
     Does the minister guarantee that employees on these awards will not have their conditions cut to the new minimum conditions standard?

     Does the Prime Minister recall saying to John Laws on 23 January 1996 that he would 'guarantee people would not be worse off - it is an explicit, rock-solid, ironclad guarantee'?
     Prime Minister, is it not the case that on the John Laws program today the following exchange took place:LAWS: Can you guarantee that no worker will be worse off?
    PRIME MINISTER: John, I have been asked that before.
    LAWS: I asked years ago.
    PRIME MINISTER: And I cannot do that.
     I can't do that.

     Is the Prime Minister aware that since 2003 Telstra has spent $1.
    75 billion on buying back its own shares?
     Weren't these buybacks just a short-sighted attempt to prop up Telstra's sale price for privatisation?
     Hasn't the government's focus on dressing up Telstra for sale deprived Telstra of the funds it needs to invest in new services?

     Minister, isn't the deliberate production of false identities in order to gain admission to a country what people smugglers do - not the role of the Australian government?

     I refer to the Volcker report on the United Nations oil for food program and its conclusion that, between 1991 and 2003, the Australian Wheat Board paid nearly $300 million in side payments, a figure corresponding to nearly 15 per cent of the total kickbacks collected by Saddam Hussein's regime.
     Does the Prime Minister accept that these payments were incompatible with United Nations Security Council resolution 661, which requires states to prevent their nationals from making any such payments to the government of Iraq?
     What action did the government take to ensure that the AWB complied with the Australian government's obligations under UNSCR 661 to prevent illegal payments being made to Saddam Hussein's regime in breach of UN sanctions against Iraq?

     Minister, in responding to the Wheat Board did DFAT consult the UN on the AWB letter, given that nearly six months before that the UN Office of Legal Affairs had specifically advised that any payment to a Jordanian trucking company, Alia, without the explicit approval of the UN Sanctions Committee would violate the sanctions regime against Iraq?

    5 per cent, the same as the current community standard?

     I also refer the Prime Minister to the Blue Galah AWA, which contains another clause that states that all rates of pay 'include a loading to compensate for all shift, weekend, overtime and public holidays and other penalties and no additional penalties are payable'.
     Prime Minister, isn't it the case that, under the government's changes, rather than being protected by law employees will in a single line in an AWA lose their penalty rates and leave loadings?

     Prime Minister, isn't it the case that, under your extreme industrial relations legislation, many Australians will have no guarantee of starting and finishing times, no guarantee of minimum or maximum hours, no certainty of rosters, no entitlement to a stable income week by week even for permanent full-time employees, and no entitlement to higher rates of pay for overtime or family unfriendly hours.
     Won't this extreme legislation make balancing work and family tougher than ever before?

    Minister, why did you mislead parliament yesterday when you said that the first time you heard allegations about whether the Wheat Board's contracts with Iraq were in violation of US sanctions was in the Volcker report when in fact 2½ years ago allegations were being raised publicly with the US Secretary of State - allegations which you blithely dismissed out of hand?

     Why is this inquiry not empowered to reach findings as to whether or not the Australian government itself has failed to meet its legal obligations to prevent breaches of global sanctions against Saddam Hussein?
     Prime Minister, if you are not empowering this inquiry to examine the government's own actions in approving this $300 million Saddam Hussein slush fund, aren't you simply establishing, in advance, a 100 per cent rolled gold political whitewash?

     Aside from the letters, did the Treasurer, the Treasurer's office or a representative of the Treasurer have any discussions with the former Attorney-General or his office about this matter?

     Wasn't the Treasurer thoroughly aware that Mr Gerard had, on behalf of his company of which he was the major shareholder, negotiated in the Cayman Islands an insurance scam that had been fought by the tax office for 14 years?
     Isn't it a fact that Mr Gerard should not have been appointed to the Reserve Bank board because of that tax scandal?
     Isn't the Treasurer inventing spurious distinctions in full cover-up mode to try to escape responsibility for having made this grossly inappropriate appointment of a Liberal Party mate?

     I refer the Prime Minister to his statement yesterday.
     He said:The relevant point about the dispute between Mr Gerard and the Australian Taxation Office is that, by hand of the letter from the commissioner, all the outstanding matters were resolved.
    Can the Prime Minister confirm that the Commissioner of Taxation of the Commonwealth of Australia registered a charge over the assets of Mr Gerard's companies for a maximum prospective liability of $250 million?
     Can he confirm that the Commonwealth took this action in September 2003, some six months after Mr Gerard's appointment to the board of the Reserve Bank?
     Why was the Commonwealth forced to take this heavy action to protect its interests in relation to Mr Gerard's tax arrangements if all outstanding matters had been resolved, as the Prime Minister said, at the time of the appointment to the board?

     Is the Treasurer aware that the Australian Taxation Office audit report found that Robert Gerard wrote a letter to the tax office in 1994 that included false or misleading statements as to his tax affairs?
     Treasurer, is it the case that making false or misleading statements to the tax office is a criminal offence punishable by imprisonment for up to 12 months?
     Will the Treasurer now use his power -  - Thank you, Mr Speaker.
     Will the Treasurer now use his power to direct the Board of Taxation to investigate whether the ATO is consistently applying its tax prosecution guidelines?

    Treasurer, did your chief of staff contact the ATO in relation to any other appointments to the Reserve Bank board?
     Did your chief of staff contact any other regulatory agencies in relation to the Gerard appointment?

     It relates to the issue of compensation payable to water entitlement holders who will lose entitlement as part of the National Water Initiative process to achieve sustainable water use.
     Does the Prime Minister recall saying, on 9 June 2005, at the joint $150 million Commonwealth-state-irrigator announcement with the then Premier, Bob Carr, to protect ground water in New South Wales:You can't ask the farmers to take the financial hit of the investment in the changed practices without some help from the Government.
    Prime Minister, it has been determined that the receipt of adjustment funds to farmers announced on that day will now be taxed as income even though the compensation is for loss of a capital asset for environmental good.
     Prime Minister, the government has the power to reverse this decision.
     Will you reconsider the government's position on this issue?

     I refer to his statement to parliament on 8 November, when he said that concerns about the AWB's dealings in Iraq first came to his attention as a result of the Volcker inquiry.
     Minister, isn't this statement simply untrue, now that it has been confirmed that DFAT officials travelled with the AWB to Iraq, that the UN warned your government in the year 2000 of their concerns about the AWB's dealings with Iraq and that the US General Accounting Office warned in May 2002 that Saddam Hussein was illegally charging 10 per cent commissions on commodity contracts under the oil for food program?
     Weren't warning bells ringing everywhere about the AWB but you simply chose to ignore them, thereby allowing $300 million to be paid into Saddam's back pocket?

     Prime Minister, where in the government's 2004 election policy is the commitment that puts working Australians at risk of losing their overtime, their penalty rates, their shift rates, their leave loadings and their redundancy pay?
     Prime Minister, isn't it the case that the last time the Australian people heard of such proposals was in your 1992 Jobsback proposal - a policy that was resoundingly rejected by the Australian people in 1993?

     Prime Minister, isn't it the case that the Western Australian experience of comparable legislation by the Court Liberal government in the nineties saw WA individual contracts where 75 per cent had no pay increase, 67 per cent did not have overtime rates, 74 per cent did not have weekend penalties, 78 per cent had hours of work from Monday to Sunday, meaning a seven-day working week, and only three per cent contained annual leave loading?
     Is this why the Prime Minister will not guarantee that no-one will be worse off?

     Is this what the Prime Minister meant when he said this morning on Radio National, 'I do think the whole thing has lost a sense of perspective'?

     As I was saying to the Deputy Prime Minister, I refer to the 41 contracts between the Australian Wheat Board and Saddam's regime under the oil for food program.
     Given that the minister has refused to table these contracts despite my motion in the House this morning, will the minister now confirm that the secret contracts contain an inflated freight price which provided Saddam's regime with $300 million?
     Doesn't this copy of an Australian Wheat Board contract dated December 2002, which is formally certified with the seal of the Australian government mission in New York, demonstrate that the government approved the contents of these contracts before they were ever submitted to the United Nations?

     - My question is to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry.
     Is the minister aware that between July 2002 and January 2003 the contract price for Australian Wheat Board shipments to Iraq rose from EURO237 per tonne to EURO280 and that this price hike occurred after AWB visited Baghdad in 2002?
     Given the Wheat Export Authority deducts the insurance and freight component from the contract and converts it to free-on-board prices for comparison purposes, wasn't the WEA aware of the extraordinary increase in the amount AWB was paying for freight within Iraq?
     Shouldn't this increase, Minister, which we now know went towards funding Saddam's war machine, have set off alarm bells within the Wheat Export Authority?
     Was the increase reported to the then agriculture minister in reports provided by the WEA to him, as required by the Wheat Marketing Act?

     I refer to the statement of Saddam Hussein's regime in August 2002 that the Australian Wheat Board would lose its contracts with Iraq as a result of the warlike language of the Howard government in the lead-up to the Iraq war.
     I also refer to the trade minister's statement to parliament in 2002 when he said that the outcome of the AWB's mercy dash to Iraq to secure its contracts had:.
    .
    .
     vindicated the federal government's faith in the AWB and its ability to successfully manage its commercial dealings with the Iraqi Grains Board.
    Minister, what was it that changed as a result of the AWB visit to Iraq in 2002, given that the government's pro-war rhetoric on Iraq did not change?
     Is it not the fact that the only thing that did change was the massive increase in the contract price for Australian wheat, thereby increasing the kickbacks for Saddam Hussein to buy guns, bombs and bullets for later use against Australian troops?
