                 (1) A standard NEC manufactured Ethernet 10/100Base T interface Network Termination Unit (NTU)  has been used in Tasmania for the stage 1 'pre release' rollout of the National Broadband Network (NBN) in that State. Stage 1 of the rollout was designed to test network planning and construction techniques under different conditions.                 (2) NBN Co Limited is purchasing Alcatel-manufactured Ethernet 10/100/1000Base T interfaces for the rollout of the NBN nationally. This NTU is capable of supporting speeds of up to 1 gigabit per second.                  Premises in Tasmania currently connected to the NBN via a standard NEC NTU will be progressively migrated to the Alcatel NTU, meaning that all premises in Tasmania connected to the NBN fibre network will have access to speeds of up to 1 gigabit per second.

                 (1) NBN Co Limited (NBN Co) is developing a detailed timeline for the rollout of the National Broadband Network (NBN) to specific locations across Australia.                  NBN Co will provide details of the timing of the rollout to specific locations on its website as they become available.                  According to NBN Co's Corporate Plan, the entire network will be completed by December 2020.                  (2) An indicative list of towns that will have access to an NBN fibre connection has been published by NBN Co and is available at www.nbnco.com.au/our-services/coverage-maps.                 NBN Co is moving as quickly as practical to enable the rollout of the NBN, including to localities in the electorate of Wide Bay. However, consistent with any project of this size and complexity, it is necessary that detailed planning and design phases are undertaken to determine the areas that will have access to a NBN fibre connection.                  (3) See answer to question 2.                 (4) (a) to (c) The Australian Government expects the rollout of the NBN to be as unobtrusive as possible. The need for any aerial deployment of cabling will depend on the availability of underground facilities. Where underground ducting is not available, NBN Co may utilise above ground infrastructure.                  The Corporate Plan released by NBN Co Limited on 20 December 2010 indicates that 25 percent of the local network will be deployed aerially. This represents approximately 31 000 kilometres of aerial deployment. This will typically be in brownfield areas with pre-existing aerial infrastructure. This is subject to the completion of Definitive Agreements with Telstra.                  In new developments where other services are put underground, it is expected that NBN cables will also be underground.                  NBN Co has indicated it will work constructively with councils and communities in rolling out the network.                 (5) The actual cost of providing a NBN connection to households and businesses within the Wide Bay electorate will not be known until after the NBN has been rolled out in that locality.                 (6) A key objective of the NBN Co workforce development strategy is to ensure there is access to the right skills at the right time in the right place.                  NBN Co is working with its partners, contracting companies, vendors, training institutions and private companies to develop a strategy that will identify the supply of qualified people, where they are located around the country, and what skill requirements will be needed to determine the training programs for its workforce.                  (7) The anticipated NBN take up rates for the electorate of Wide Bay have not been determined by NBN Co. The NBN Co Corporate Plan assumes that 13.2 million premises will be passed or covered by NBN Co by the end of financial year 2021 with over 8.5 million premises connected  -  an overall take up rate of 65 per cent across all platforms.                  To provide an indication of NBN take up rates, as at 6 April 2011, the percentage of households which had signed up for a fibre connection was:                 88 per cent at Armidale                  91 per cent in Willunga                 78 per cent in Minnamurra / Kiama Downs                 62 per cent in Townsville; and                 In Brunswick, where the consent process is still underway, 52 per cent have so far signed up.                 (8) According to its Corporate Plan, NBN Co will offer a basic service with a download speed of 12 megabits per second and an upload speed of 1 megabit per second at a uniform national wholesale access price of $24 a month.                 Wholesale broadband prices will be the same for households and businesses regardless of where they are located in Australia.                 Retail pricing levels will be a matter for retail providers that utilise the network and it is anticipated the level and range of retail prices will be comparable to existing prices in the market today.                 (9) The government's objective is to connect 93 per cent of premises with fibre to the premises technology providing broadband speeds of up to 100 megabits per second. Fibre is a very scalable technology, allowing future speeds beyond 1 gigabit per second (1000 megabits per second).                 All remaining premises will be served by a combination of next generation fixed wireless and satellite technologies providing peak speeds of at least 12 megabits per second.                 These technologies represent a significant improvement over speeds currently experienced by users of those technologies today.

                 (1) Australia engages in regular dialogue with China on Iran's nuclear program. Australian officials have discussed with Chinese officials the importance of rigorous implementation by China of UNSC resolution 1929 (2010) and other UNSC resolutions on Iran.                  (2) Mr Einhorn's visit to China in September 2010 is on the public record. The substance of Mr Einhorn's visit is a matter for the US and Chinese governments.                  (3) The UNSC requires all member states to implement UNSC decisions imposing sanctions. China has responsibility to ensure that Chinese firms do not contravene UNSC sanctions. Australia's implementation of UNSC sanctions applying controls on the supply of goods and services and financial restrictions in respect of Iran apply to any person in Australia, any Australian anywhere in the world and to any person using an Australian flag vessel or aircraft to transport goods or provide services that are subject to UNSC sanctions. Australia's sanctions laws also apply to Australians and Australian companies with respect to the conduct of any foreign body corporate they own or control, but not to the foreign body corporate directly. A foreign firm would therefore only be liable to prosecution by Australian authorities for violating UNSC sanctions if it did so on Australian territory, or using an Australian flagged vessel or aircraft. To date there have been no prosecutions of Chinese firms in Australia on the grounds of violating UNSC sanctions on Iran.

                 On 20 June 2010 the Government announced it would provide dedicated funding to USO Co of $50 million per annum for the financial years 2012-13 and 2013-14, and then $100 million per annum thereafter.                  The residual costs incurred by USO Co will be met by industry as is currently the case, including by wholesale providers such as NBN Co.                  On 22 October 2010 the Minister released the discussion paper 'Implementation of Universal Service Policy for the transition to the National Broadband Network environment', which sought industry and consumer stakeholder input on the arrangements to implement the Government's policy, including the funding arrangements for USO Co. The discussion paper raised a number of matters on which feedback was sought, including provisions to expand the scope of possible funding sources to support the delivery of the Universal Service Obligation if required.

                 A detailed National Broadband Network Implementation Study undertaken by McKinsey &amp; Company/KPMG was completed in March 2010 and publicly released on 6 May 2010.                  The Implementation Study provided 84 recommendations for the government to consider, covering technology, financing, ownership, policy and market structure.                  The government is now moving ahead and exceeding its election commitment.                 On 20 December 2010, the government released the NBN Co Limited Corporate Plan, which shows that the National Broadband Network will provide all Australians with world class broadband on a financially viable basis with affordable consumer prices.                 The broader economy-wide benefits of investment in high speed broadband are well understood and accepted globally. Such benefits have been documented and endorsed by the OECD, Access Economics and a range of other studies. The National Broadband Network will future proof the Australian economy, drive future growth and productivity and generate significant economy-wide and social benefits in addition to the return to government.

                 (a) The Government expects the rollout of the National Broadband Network to be as unobtrusive as possible. The location of any aerial deployment of cabling will depend on the availability of underground facilities. The Financial Heads of Agreement with Telstra announced on 20 June 2010 greatly enhances NBN Co's access to underground facilities. The extent to which cabling will be underground will be a matter that NBN Co will need to look at on an area-by-area basis.                 The Corporate Plan released by NBN Co Limited on 20 December 2010 indicates that 25 percent of the local network will be deployed aerially. This represents approximately 31 000 kilometres of aerial deployment. This will typically be in brownfield areas with pre-existing aerial infrastructure. This is subject to the completion of Definitive Agreements with Telstra.                  In new developments where other services are put underground, it is expected that NBN cables will also be underground. (b) The height at which the fibre cable will be deployed will be a matter for NBN Co to consider on an area-by-area basis, consistent with state, territory, and local government planning arrangements.                 Some cabling heights are outlined in a voluntary industry code, the Australian Communications Industry Forum Code C524:2004 External Telecommunications Cable Networks. In NSW, where recent changes to planning laws make installation of overhead cabling an exempt development, meaning installations do not require planning approval, installation must take place in a manner consistent with the Code.(c) The underground installation of electricity cables is a matter for electricity companies to consider.                  NBN Co Limited is engaging with utility companies to understand the possibilities of sharing infrastructure or coordinating rollout plans.                 Clause 51 of Schedule 3 of the Telecommunications Act 1997 requires carriers to remove aerial cabling from electricity poles where the electricity operator has removed electricity lines from the poles.                 Where electricity companies are working with state, territory, and local governments on the possible underground installation of existing aerial infrastructure, they are encouraged to inform NBN Co so this can be taken into account by NBN Co in formulating its rollout plans.

                 (1) Former Government Ministers are on public record as having supported inclusion in Article 3.7 of the Kyoto Protocol a provision allowing reductions in land use change emissions to count towards achieving Kyoto emissions targets.                 Cabinet documents are confidential to the government that created them and it is a long standing convention, accepted by successive governments, that Ministers do not seek access to documents recording the deliberations of Ministers in previous governments.  Therefore I cannot comment on whether there was Cabinet support for Article 3.7 of the Kyoto Protocol and clearly I am not able to comment on whether there was Coalition party support for the clause.                 (2) At the time of the Kyoto Conference in 1997, Australia possessed only rudimentary capability to produce national estimates of land use change emissions and their trends over time. Since then, Australia has invested in a new National Carbon Accounting System which is world-leading in its technical capabilities and which has the ability to construct historic trends in emissions. Our data and reporting is reviewed and verified by the United Nations and independent experts.                 (3) The Commonwealth has not made payments to the states and territories for restrictions on native vegetation management. Under the Australian Constitution, state and territory governments are responsible for land management, including the introduction and implementation of legislation and regulations and any compensation arrangements associated with implementation.                  (4) Article 3.7 refers to those parties for whom land-use change and forestry constitutes a net source of greenhouse gas emissions in 1990. It requires that they shall include in their 1990 emissions base year or period, the aggregate anthropogenic carbon dioxide equivalent emissions by sources minus removals by sinks in 1990 from land-use change.                  According to the most up-to-date published data in the National Greenhouse Gas Inventory, land-use change emissions amounted to 130.8 million tonnes in 1990 and 49.7 million tonnes in 2008. Abatement of emissions from reduced deforestation, combined with emissions abatement measures in other sectors like energy, industry, waste and forestry, make a significant contribution to Australia being on track to meet its 108 per cent Kyoto target.                 (5) I cannot confirm whether the United Nations Association of Australia made the particular statement attributed to them.                  It is correct that electricity generation and transport are two of the major sources of greenhouse gas emissions in Australia.                 The Government believes putting a price on carbon is the most effective way of tackling climate change and beginning to drive the transformation of our economy to a low pollution future. It has recently established a Multi-Party Climate Change Committee to investigate options for implementing a carbon price and to help build consensus on how Australia will tackle climate change.                   In the case of both electricity generation and transport the Government recognises that other measures that complement a price on carbon are also necessary and it has put in place, or committed to, a number of such measures. For electricity generation these include the Renewable Energy Target, the Clean Energy Initiative (which supports the research, development and demonstration of low-emission energy technologies, including industrial scale carbon capture and storage and solar energy), and emissions standards for electricity generators. In the transport sector the Government has committed to introduce emission standards for light vehicles.

                 (a) NBN Co has developed engineering rules that result in a Gigabit Passive Optical Network (GPON) being shared by a maximum of 32 end users. NBN Co expects the practical average across the fibre footprint to be around 28 end users per GPON.                 (b) The expected downstream capacity of these GPON links is 2.488 gigabits per second and the expected upstream capacity is 1.244 gigabits per second1. The total GPON link capacity is shared dynamically amongst end users, according to each end user's instant requirements and their individual access service.                 (c) NBN Co's initial service offering presents individual GPON end users with an aggregate data capacity of up to 100 megabits per second. In addition, the end user hardware that NBN Co is installing supports an aggregate data capacity of 1 gigabit per second.                 Based on these specifications and typical statistical dimensioning employed across the Australian and international telecommunications industry, NBN Co's GPON platform can be expected to support typical household capacities of up to 1 gigabit per second.                  ______________                   1 International Telecommunications Union (ITU) G.948 standard.

                 (a) The NBN Co Corporate Plan 2011-2013 anticipates average data usage per user will increase steadily from 10 gigabytes per month in 2011-12 to around 100 gigabytes per month by 2029-30 (p127). NBN Co referenced its data usage projections against a number of independent sources such as historic data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics and Cisco's internet traffic forecasts.                  (b) Internet data transit pricing can vary widely depending on the amount and nature of the data being transmitted, the source and destination of the data and the commercial arrangements of individual Retail Service Providers (RSPs).                 (i) and (ii) Given the very complex and varying nature of data transit pricing it is not possible for the Department of Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy to calculate a monthly data transit cost per household or the total transit costs incurred by RSPs in providing services over the NBN.                 NBN Co's approach to pricing wholesale services is to provide maximum flexibility for RSPs to design products that best meet the need of their customers.

                 The minimum CVC capacity that can be bought over the NBN fibre access network is 100Mps TC-4 (traffic class 4).                 The contention ratio, capacity and number of end users supplied by any given CVC will be up to each individual Retails Service Provider (RSP) to determine in accordance with the needs of their customers and the level of service they are providing.                 NBN Co's approach is to provide maximum flexibility for RSPs to design products that best meet the need of their customers.

                 I made a public statement regarding these matters on 3 March 2011.                 The Australian Government has undertaken a comprehensive compliance and fraud investigation through a forensic audit of the program. Those investigations resulted in the actions taken by my Department and the Australian Federal Police (AFP) on 2 March 2011.                 My Department has established a team to investigate these matters internally and they have received assistance from the AFP in pursuing those matters.                 At this time it would be inappropriate to make any further comment on matters currently being investigated.                 The information that I have previously announced will no doubt provide an assurance to the people of Australia that this Government is committed to pursuing those unscrupulous operators that chose to take advantage of the Home Insulation Program.

                 Since 2003, work for the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) has been undertaken by Accenture for its Change Program and for other activities.                 (a) (i) The Change Program was a very significant information technology and business improvement program designed to support the community, government and to meet internal ATO needs. The program has delivered improved client service through the introduction of client portals and the replacement of a number of ageing systems with a single system for processing tax and superannuation returns. Through the use of enterprise-wide client relationship management, case management and work management systems and processes, it also improved the way the ATO manages its work. It has delivered significant savings to the operation of the ATO.                  Accenture was contracted by the ATO to deliver the Change Program. Accenture took the lead role to design, build, test and deploy the Change Program releases. The ATO worked alongside Accenture throughout the Change Program and is now managing the new enterprise systems so they are reliable, responsive and able to support and facilitate future change and innovation.                   (ii) and (v) The Change Program Contract was managed via a Head Agreement that provided the terms, conditions and fees. Change Program activities included under the Head Agreement have been reconciled with payment to Accenture of $477 million (excluding GST) between 2004 and 2010 to deliver the Change Program releases.                 (iii) and (iv) Major variations to the contract were incorporated to implement legislation changes for the following at a total cost of $198 million (excluding GST):                 Superannuation Simplification from February 2007,                  First Home Savers Account from January 2009, and                  Removal from scope of Business Activity Statement (BAS) and Super Guarantee.                 (b) Since 2003, other Accenture contracts for various system related work were for a total cost of $167 million excluding GST. The contracts are as follows:

                 NBN Co Limited has advised that access seekers wishing to offer a voice-only service will not need to pay a premium to obtain a CIR product suitable to support voice services. As stated on pages 25-26 of NBN Co's publication, Product and Pricing Overview for Access Seekers (December 2010), NBN Co's entry level product, priced at $24 per month, includes an optional telephone capability in the listed price.                  A CIR of 150 kilobits per second will be allocated to the voice service from the total bandwidth offered as part of NBN Co's entry level product. Traffic using this service will be given the highest network priority. Access seekers wishing to supply a voice-only service can do so using NBN Co's entry level product and can choose to deliver the service through a data port on the network termination unit (for voice over internet protocol, or VoIP, enabled customer equipment) or through a voice port on the network termination unit (for legacy, or standard telephone service, customer equipment).

                 (1) Financial resources do not preclude the establishment of new Australian Defence Force Cadet units in schools or communities.                 Defence closely assesses applications for the establishment of new cadet units in order to ensure their enduring viability and to justify the significant Defence investment in time, money and resources.                 Funding is not the sole determinant of the ability to establish or maintain a successful cadet unit. Other key factors include the need for strong community support for the establishment and ongoing operation of the cadet unit, appropriate facilities and sufficient young people interested in becoming cadets and adult volunteers interested in devoting the time to supervise these cadets.                 The Government has continued the commitment of the former Government in providing an additional 10 million dollars per year for ten years commencing in 2007 with the specific aim of increasing the number of cadet units and cadets.                 As a result of this commitment, the number of Navy, Army and Air Force Cadets grew by around 1900 between December 2005 and June 2010.                  (2) It is considered that the funding provided by Defence is sufficient to meet the expected growth in Australian Defence Force Cadet numbers and units in the near future. Examples of this growth include the establishment of an Australian Army Cadets school-based unit in Werribee, Victoria; and an Australian Air Force Cadets unit in Murray Bridge, South Australia; both of which will soon become fully operational.                 Where the support is present to establish new units beyond those planned by the Services in their annual budget forecasts, Defence would consider this sympathetically in light of competing Defence budget priorities.

                 The Australian Government provides in excess of $1.2 billion per annum in financial support to employers and Australian Apprentices through the Australian Apprenticeships Incentives Program, a demand-driven program based on applications from eligible employers and Australian Apprentices.                  Under the Australian Apprenticeships Incentives Program, employers of eligible apprentices and trainees at the Certificate III or IV level may attract a Commencement incentive of $1500, a Recommencement incentive of $750 and a Completion incentive of $2500. Employers of eligible apprentices and trainees at the Certificate II level may attract a Commencement incentive of $1250.                 In addition to these standard incentives for employers, the Australian Apprenticeships Incentives Program also offers a range of special and additional incentives. Many of these are targeted at those in traditional trades identified as experiencing a national skills shortage. These include a Rural and Regional Skill Shortages commencement incentive of $1000, the Support for Adult Australian Apprentices (aged 25 and over) weekly wage supplements, the Declared Drought Area commencement and completion incentives totalling $3000, the Mature Age Worker (aged 45 and over) commencement and completion incentives totalling $1500, the Australian School-based Apprenticeships commencement and retention incentives totalling $1500, the Assistance for Australian Apprentices with Disability weekly wage supplements and tutorial/mentor/ interpreter assistance.                 Personal benefits payments available for eligible Australian Apprentices include the Living Away From Home Allowance payments, the Tools for Your Trade payments totalling $5500, and the Support for Adult Australian Apprentices wage supplements if not going to the employer.                  In addition the Queensland Natural Disasters Jobs and Skills Package released on 6 March 2011 will help employers and Australian Apprentices in disaster affected areas in Queensland. Initiatives include the Disaster Recovery Start-up Bonus payment of $3350 made to small and medium-sized employers (with less than 200 employees) and registered group training organisations in rural and regional flood and cyclone affected areas in Queensland who take on a new apprentice aged 19 years and under in a skill shortage trade apprenticeship, the Relocation Payment of $3000 to eligible, registered, out-of-trade Australian Apprentices who relocate to a flood or cyclone affected area to recommence their Australian Apprenticeship, and the Tools and Work Equipment Payment of $800 for eligible Australian Apprentices whose tools or work equipment have been lost or damaged due to a flood or cyclone related event in a declared natural disaster area in Queensland.                 The Government also provides funding support to Queensland group training organisations to employ teams of out-of-trade apprentices in trade projects that benefit both their industry and the wider community.                 Assistance for employers and Australian Apprentices in understanding the full range of incentives and payments available is provided by Australian Apprenticeships Centres who are contracted by the Australian Government specifically for this purpose.  Australian Apprenticeships Centres have been providing support services to stakeholders since 1998.                  Australian Apprenticeships Centres also help employers and Australian Apprentices select appropriate qualifications and registered training organisations, and provide ongoing mentoring and support throughout the duration of the Australian Apprenticeship with a view to successful completion.                 Further details on the Australian Apprenticeships Incentives Program and advice on how to contact an Australian Apprenticeship Centre is publicly available at http://www.australianapprenticeships.gov.au/.

                 The Australia's Future Tax System (AFTS) Report provides a long-term blue print for the tax and transfer system. As the report states, it was not designed to be implemented as a '...one-off tax policy package.'                 The Government's Stronger, Fairer, Simpler tax plan has acted on a number of the AFTS recommendations and is a substantial first step towards improving our existing tax system. The following measures tackle the need for reform in the areas of personal tax, superannuation, business tax and resource taxes.                    Personal Tax                 An optional $500 standard deduction to replace deductions for work-related expenses and cost of managing tax affairs. This deduction will be available from 2012-13 and will increase to $1,000 from 2013-14.                 A fifty per cent tax discount will be available to Australian resident individuals for up to $500 of interest income earned in 2012-13, including interest on deposits, bonds and debentures and annuity products.  The cap will be increased to $1,000 from 1 July 2013.                    Superannuation                 A higher concessional contributions cap of $50,000 per year will apply from 30 June 2012 for those aged 50 or over who have total superannuation balances of less than $500,000.                  Up to $500 per annum will be paid into low income earner super accounts from 2012-13.                 There will be a staged increase of superannuation guarantee contributions to 12 per cent beginning in 2013 - 14 and increase in the superannuation guarantee age limit from 70 to 75 from 1 July 2013.                   Business Tax                 The company tax rate will be reduced from 30 per cent to 29 per cent from the 2013-14 income year. For small companies, the cut to the company tax rate will apply from 2012 - 13.                    Existing small business capital allowance concessions will be expanded by allowing small businesses to immediately write-off assets costing up to $5,000 and to write-off most other assets in a single depreciation pool at a rate of 30 per cent.                 Interest withholding tax incurred by financial institutions on most interest paid on offshore borrowings will be phased down from 2013-14.                   Resource Taxes                 The Minerals Resource Rent Tax (MRRT) and Petroleum Resource Rent Tax (PRRT) will improve the taxation arrangements of Australia's biggest and most profitable commodities.                 The MRRT regime will apply to the mining of iron ore and coal in Australia.                 The current PRRT regime will be extended to all Australian onshore and offshore oil and gas projects, including the North West Shelf.                 The Stronger, Fairer, Simpler package demonstrates the considerable progress the Government has made on tax reform.                 The Government has also announced other tax measures consistent with AFTS recommendations including:                 An increase to Family Tax Benefit (FTB) A for older children. FTB is to become the primary payment for dependent full-time secondary students aged 16-19.                 Improvements to the taxation and regulation of the Non-Profit Sector through the establishment of a new Office for the Non-Profit Sector within the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, supported by a new Non-Profit Sector Reform Council.                   An increase in the excise and excise-equivalent customs duty rate applying to tobacco products of 25 per cent from midnight 29 April 2010.                 When the Government released its initial response to the AFTS Review, we said very clearly that there would be a wide-ranging discussion about many of the issues it raised.                 The upcoming tax forum and subsequent parliamentary debate will be an opportunity to continue this public discussion and contribute to the consensus building process that is essential to ensuring support for long-term tax reform.

                 The Australian Government has acted swiftly to implement financial sanctions against individuals and entities of the Libyan Regime as part of United Nations sanctions and Australian autonomous sanctions.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs is responsible for leading the Government's implementation of these sanctions.                  Following the announcement of sanctions, I wrote to the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia directing him to take action under the Banking (Foreign Exchange) Regulations 1959 to impose autonomous financial sanctions against certain Libyan individuals whom the Minister for Foreign Affairs is satisfied have connections to the Libyan regime.  Subsequently, the Reserve Bank created the necessary legislative instruments to impose these financial sanctions.  The Reserve Bank publishes information on sanctions at: http://www.rba.gov.au/mkt-operations/fin-sanctions/index.html#libya                 At the request of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, I asked Treasury to conduct an exhaustive review of the foreign investment proposal data for possible acquisitions of Australian assets by those subject to the sanctions, and to continue to monitor the situation.  The results of this search have been provided to the Minister for Foreign Affairs.

                 (a) Future allocations of Australian Official Development Assistance, including for water, sanitation and hygiene, will be considered in the context of the 2011-12 Budget.                 (b) Australia's approach to development assistance in education emphasises that school infrastructure should meet basic standards, including separate sanitation facilities for girls and boys. This is integrated into the design process for AusAID programs. The inclusion of appropriate sanitation facilities in schools will contribute to achieving education targets and should decrease the incidence of diarrhoeal disease, which prevents children from attending school. Appropriate facilities also assist greater enrolment of girls in education. Water and sanitation programs are part of a broader approach to improve children's health, which also includes supporting vaccine initiatives and access to basic health care.                 (c) While AusAID does not collect statistics on the number of schools with child-friendly toilets and safe drinking water supplies constructed using Australian Official Development Assistance, toilets and water supplies are typically included in the construction projects. For example, in Kiribati, AusAID supported the construction of a specially designed toilet block which has made it safer for technical and vocational education and training students and teachers to attend school, including students with disabilities. Also in Kiribati, AusAID has commenced an education program which includes rehabilitating government schools to meet the National Infrastructure Standards and is working jointly with United Nations agencies to improve water and sanitation facilities on schools on the Outer Islands. In Nauru, all six infant and primary schools have been fully refurbished with improved water and sanitation facilities. In Laos Australia contributed to the construction of 125 primary schools with toilets and water supplies between 2007 and 2010. Additionally, Australia funded the construction of 258 latrines and 300 water supplies for primary schools in Laos through the Access to Basic Education program between 2006 and 2011. In Indonesia schools built with Australian support include separate toilet facilities for girls and boys. Since 2008 all schools built in Indonesia with Australian support have ramps and accessible toilets for children with disabilities, making more than 1,000 schools more accessible. The Government of Indonesia now requires all new schools to have disabled access, including toilets, as a result of Australia including disability access in Australia Indonesia Basic Education Program schools.

                 (1) No communities will be left without easy access to digital television when digital switchover happens in regional Queensland in late 2011. Residents in areas without access to a broadcaster operated transmitter, such as Dingo Beach, Hideaway Bay and Guthalungra, will be able to receive the full range of 16 digital television services and a local news service by way of the new government-funded direct to home Viewer Access Satellite Television (VAST) service.                 (2) The government is not generally funding the upgrade of self help towers. The government is providing funding for the delivery of digital television to people throughout Australia without access to broadcaster-operated transmitters through the VAST service.                  There is no local black spot transmitter designed to serve the area in which Guthalungra lies however viewers here will be able to receive digital television via VAST.                 Hideaway Bay and Dingo Beach both rely for their analog television on a terrestrial retransmission of the remote broadcasters' Aurora satellite service. This means they currently only receive four television channels: ABC Queensland, SBS Queensland and the remote area commercial channels of Southern Cross Seven and Imparja Nine, with none of the local regional news services broadcast by the commercial broadcasters in the Queensland Central Coast and Whitsundays licence area. Under VAST, they will have access to their local news on WIN, SCM and 7 and receive the full range of 16 digital channels. This is the equivalent level of content as Australia's metropolitan centres and most regional areas.                  In addition to the significant improvement in their television content, VAST will also alleviate the financial burden on local communities such as Hideaway Bay and Dingo Beach in running and maintaining a local terrestrial self-help transmitter.                  Broadcasters are converting some self help facilities to digital. The choice of facilities to be converted is a matter for broadcasters. Communities will retain the option of converting their self-help facilities to digital themselves because they are not being converted by the broadcasters, rather than accessing the VAST service, but must make their own arrangements to assess and implement this option.                 (3) Residents in communities that currently receive their television services through self help facilities that are not being converted to digital by broadcasters, such as Dingo Beach and Hideaway Bay, will be eligible to receive assistance to convert to the VAST service under the government's Satellite Subsidy Scheme.                  Under the Satellite Subsidy Scheme, eligible households will pay a predetermined co-payment - which is expected to be between $200 and $350 - directly to the installer. The co-payment will be fixed as part of the contract between the Government and the service providers, and households will be clearly advised of this co-payment in advance of the installations taking place. Contracts have not yet been entered into for installations in regional Queensland, so final co-payment amounts have not yet been determined.                  After this initial outlay, Dingo Beach and Hideaway Bay residents will face few if any further costs to receive the VAST service, and the Whitsunday Shire Council, which operates the Dingo Beach retransmission facility, will no longer have to bear the capital and ongoing costs associated with the retransmission of all commercial and national channels.                 Guthalungra is an area which has always had poor terrestrial television coverage because broadcasters have not established a local transmitter to serve the area. Some people in the area may already be receiving their television services through the existing Aurora direct to home satellite service. These people may convert to VAST now for the cost of the VAST set top box. Other viewers in the area will have to purchase a satellite dish and a VAST set top box to receive the VAST service. This is no different from the situation for viewers in metropolitan areas who have to go to the VAST service because they are unable to receive a terrestrial signal.

                 In June 2010, the Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (Digital Television) Act 2010 (the Digital Television Act) amended the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 (the BSA) to facilitate the delivery of commercial digital television services by satellite to viewers in areas of inadequate digital terrestrial reception. The services licensed under section 38C of the BSA are collectively known as the Viewer Access Satellite Television (VAST) service.                 To preserve the integrity of existing commercial television licence areas, access to the VAST satellite service is subject to conditional access arrangements.                  The Digital Television Act introduced policy objectives for a conditional access scheme for the VAST service. The policy objectives identify several categories of access to the VAST service as follows:                 Category A  -  viewers in remote licence areas and all viewers in non-remote areas that currently receive free-to-air services under an out-of-area service authorisation;                   Category B  -  areas in regional and metropolitan areas that are deemed to have inadequate reception of terrestrial commercial television broadcasting services; and                  Category C - areas that are neither Category A nor Category B.                  Viewers in Category A can access the VAST service from its commencement. Viewers in Category B or Category C cannot be granted access to the VAST service until six months before switchover in their area.                  The purpose of these timeframes is to allow commercial terrestrial broadcasters time to rollout their planned digital terrestrial infrastructure before switchover. The commercial broadcasters have agreed to upgrade a number of analog self-help retransmission sites to digital and to rollout a number of gap-fillers to improve the coverage of digital television. The commercial broadcasters will upgrade the self-help retransmission sites at Long Flat and Telegraph Point on the mid-North NSW Coast and rollout a gap-filler at Bonny Hills. The final list of sites to be converted by the broadcasters is subject to negotiation between the licensee of the site and the broadcasters, and will depend on detailed assessments of the commercial or technical viability of the sites. If, six months before switchover in a licence area, a viewer is still unable to receive adequate digital terrestrial reception, they will be eligible to apply to access the VAST service.                  This means that viewers on the mid-North Coast that reside in the Remote and Central Eastern Australia licence area are able to immediately apply to the scheme administrator to access the VAST service. Viewers on the mid-North Coast that reside in the Northern New South Wales licence area will be eligible to apply for VAST service six months before switchover in their licence area which is in the second half of 2012. Viewers are able to check their eligibility for the VAST service, by visiting the mySwitch website at:                   www.digitalready.gov.au/MySwitch.aspx.                 As the Mildura/Sunraysia licence area switched to digital-only television signals on 30 June 2010, residents in the Mildura/Sunraysia licence area who are unable to receive adequate reception of terrestrial digital commercial television services are eligible to apply to access the VAST service now. Similarly, viewers who cannot receive adequate digital terrestrial reception in the regional South Australia licence areas and the regional Victoria licence areas, which are due to switchover on 5 May 2011, are also eligible to apply to access the VAST service.

                 There are currently 10 operational GP Super Clinics. The Department of Health and Ageing provides self reported numbers of service presentations at an aggregated level only. Self reported services numbers for individual clinics are not made publicly available as:                 (i) there are commercial-in-confidence and privacy protection considerations around releasing data at the individual clinic level; and                  (ii) service numbers are not comparable (depending on when the Clinics commenced services, the size of the community, the number of service providers engaged etc) and could be open to misinterpretation.                 (a) As at the end of January 2011, the GP Super Clinics reported over 280,000 presentations at these clinics. This includes those clinics which have offered early services prior to officially opening.                 (b) Of the services at (a) above, over 196,000 were GP services.                 (c) Of the services at (a) above, approximately 84,000 were allied health services. The self reported data is aggregated at an overall allied health level and does not specify the types of allied health care.                 (d) The GP Super Clinics program is aimed at supporting integrated, multidisciplinary, patient centred, primary health care services. Medical specialist services are not classified as primary care and are therefore not specifically captured.

                 (1) Mental health is an important component of the Government's second term agenda. At the COAG meeting of 13 February 2011, COAG agreed to consider mental health at its next meeting. Work on future mental health reform options for discussion by COAG is currently underway. To assist in informing Commonwealth consideration of reform options, the Government is undertaking a broad stakeholder engagement strategy (including consulting with the National Advisory Council on Mental Health, establishing a Mental Health Expert Working Group, national forums with mental health consumers and carers, and receiving written comment and feedback). This will assist in informing the development of a cohesive strategy for mental health reform to provide a more effective and sustainable system over the long term for all Australians affected by mental illness.                  Under the Access to Allied Psychological Services (ATAPS) initiative the Department of Health and Ageing engages Divisions of General Practice to allow GPs to refer patients who have been diagnosed as having a common mental disorder such as depression or anxiety, of mild to moderate severity, to an allied health professional to provide short term focused psychological strategies services.  Under its current funding agreement, Mackay Division of General Practice will receive $418,632.63 (GST Inc) to provide ATAPS services for 2010-11.                 New arrangements under a second tier of funding have been introduced to allow ATAPS to be more flexible and target particular situations and needs, including the need for psychological services associated with disasters. On 2 March 2011 Mackay Division of General Practice submitted a proposal for additional funding to assist people affected by the 2010 Queensland floods and cyclone Yasi. This proposal is currently being considered by the Department.                 In the 2010-11 Budget the Government committed $58.5 million to provide funding for flexible care packages of clinical and care coordination services to better support up to 25,000 people with severe mental illness in the community. An additional $60 million was committed under the Mental Health: Taking Action to Tackle Suicide election commitment package for non-clinical support services such as structured social activities, personal helpers and respite services for carers to enhance the flexible care packages and to enable wrap around care to be tailored to the needs of the individual.                 The Government has also begun to roll out eight highly-targeted programs ($113.2 million) as part of the $274 million (over four years) Mental Health: Taking Action to Tackle Suicide election commitment package. This package includes $115 million to boost frontline services and provide more services to those at greatest risk of suicide, including psychology and psychiatry services and including the non-clinical support to assist people with severe mental illness and carers with day-to-day needs. The Mackay Division of General Practice is expected to receive additional funding under this new measure in 2011-12.                 (2) I have held 14 face to face forums around the country with mental health consumers and carers to hear their views on options for progressing mental health reform into the future. The Mental Health Council of Australia (MHCA) coordinated the arrangements for the forums including invitations. A list of the dates and locations of the forums is below:                                   I also heard views from young people during an online forum hosted by the Inspire Foundation on 8 December 2010.                  There was a high level of interest in attending these forums, and to ensure those who could not attend had an avenue to express their views, members of the public and interested organisations were also invited to provide submissions about future mental health reform options. The closing date for submissions was 15 February 2011.                 (3) The Mental Health Nurse Incentive Program provides incentive payments to eligible organisations, including Divisions of General Practice and private psychiatry practices, that engage mental health nurses to provide coordinated clinical care to patients with severe and persistent mental illness.                 The Program is structured as an incentive based program to encourage eligible organisations to engage the services of mental health nurses and is not intended to provide a full wage subsidy.                 The Program continues to grow under the current level of incentive payments.                 (4) Under the Mental Health Nurse Incentive Program, incentive payments are made to the eligible organisation. Wages are negotiated between the organisation and the mental health nurse.

                  I am advised by the Insolvency and Trustee Service Australia (ITSA) that a debtor's petition signed by the bankrupt (Bankruptcy Number 5091/1998) and dated 7 October 1998 was presented under subsection 55(1) of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 ('the Act') to ITSA on 9 October 1998 and accepted by the Official Receiver's delegate at 9.48am on that date. The petition was endorsed accordingly as required by subsection 55(4A) of the Act.                 The petition was not rejected under subsection 55(3) of the Act, which sets out when the Official Receiver may reject a petition, as it complied with the approved form, was accompanied by a Statement of Affairs which the Official Receiver's delegate did not consider to be inadequate. I am advised there were no grounds on which it could be legally rejected by the Official Receiver.

                  In respect of the matters raised in parts (a) and (b)  -  Yes.                 In respect of the matters raised in parts (c) to (d) of the question, Mr Dunwoody was charged and found guilty by the District Court of Mackay of two counts of disposing of property with the intent to defraud creditors and was sentenced to two years' imprisonment on each count . This followed lengthy investigations by ITSA and the Australian Federal Police.                 As to the matter raised in part (e) of the question, I am advised that the judgment of the Federal Court delivered by Drummond J on 20 August 1999 (Q 7131 of 1999) involved proceedings between Bechrose Pty Ltd ('Applicant') and the initial trustees of the bankrupt estate ('Respondents'). The initial trustees were subsequently removed by the creditors and the Official Trustee was appointed by operation of law under section 160 of the Act.                  The Federal Court proceedings brought by the Applicant sought a review of the Respondents' ruling to admit their claim to vote at a meeting of creditors called to consider a composition proposal by the bankrupt under subsection 73(2) of the Bankruptcy Act 1996. The only order made by the Court was to dismiss the application. The Official Trustee was not a party to the proceedings and no directions were made with which it was required to comply.                  As to the matter raised in part (f) of the question, a final report to creditors by the Official Trustee was issued to creditors on 14 August 2006. A copy of that report was reissued to certain creditors by the Official Trustee on 10 November 2009, following a request by the former Member for Dawson, the Hon Mr James Bidgood MP, on their behalf on 9 October 2009.

                 The Australian Government is supporting the Queensland Government in providing a range of assistance to all eligible businesses and primary producers that have been affected by Tropical Cyclone Yasi under the Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements.                  Assistance includes concessional loans of up to $250,000 to support businesses that have suffered direct damage from the cyclone. Enhanced concessional loans of $650,000 with grants of up to $50,000 are available for businesses that have suffered extreme damage. Businesses may also be eligible for clean-up and recovery grants of up to $25,000.                 The Australian Government is also providing wage assistance for up to 13 weeks for businesses in the areas most heavily affected by Tropical Cyclone Yasi and who are unable to pay full wages for their employees during the recovery period. This assistance complements the Disaster Income Recovery Scheme, which provides income support to small business owners and employees whose income has been reduced as a result of the cyclone.                 Fishing businesses are not specifically excluded from the Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements. They are able to access the same types of assistance with the same eligibility criteria as other businesses in disaster affected areas.

                 While there are no statutory requirements to process asylum claims for irregular maritime arrivals within a prescribed timeframe, the 90 day statutory timeframe for assessment of onshore protection claims has been used as a standard operating guide for the Refugee Status Assessment (RSA) process.                  The 90 day target is calculated from the time the Department receives a Refugee Status Assessment request.                 As at 23 November 2010, the average number of days Sri Lankan irregular maritime arrivals subject to the suspension were in detention was 188 days, 107 of which were taken up with RSA processing. This is 17 days above the 90 day processing target.                 As at 23 November 2010, the average number of days Afghan irregular maritime arrivals subject to the suspension were in detention was 177 days, 54 of which were taken up with RSA processing. This is within the 90 day processing target.                 The cost of detention is dependant on the specific circumstances of each detainee and as such the costs of the suspension cannot be adequately estimated.

                 (1) Widespread coral bleaching incidents are typically caused by extreme sea temperatures; however localised bleaching can also be caused by exposure to freshwater (rain and flood waters) and pollutants.                  (a)                   Great Barrier Reef                  I am advised that three significant coral bleaching incidents have occurred within the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park since 1997 as a result of prolonged elevated sea temperatures. Two widespread incidents occurred in the summers of 1997/8 and 2001/2 and a localised but severe incident occurred in the summer of 2005/6. Some localised patchy coral bleaching has also been reported at individual reefs across the Great Barrier Reef each summer since 1997.                   2010-2011 Floods:                 Bleaching has been reported on some fringing reefs in the Keppel Island Group as a result of the recent flooding.                 (b)                   Ningaloo Reef                  I am advised that the coral reef communities of Ningaloo Marine Park that are susceptible to coral bleaching occur in State waters which are managed by the Western Australian Department of Environment and Conservation. Water depths within the Commonwealth waters of the Park range from about 30m to greater than 500m.                 Since 1997, there have been three bleaching episodes recorded on Ningaloo Reef. A cold water bleaching event occurred in 2006; bleaching related to anoxic water after coral spawning occurred in 2008; and the first recorded warm water bleaching event occurred in February 2011.                 (2) Widespread coral bleaching incidents typically develop over the course of several months as a result of prolonged elevated sea temperatures, but can also result from other factors affecting water quality.                  (a)                   Great Barrier Reef                  I am advised that in the summers of 1997/98 (January-March) and 2001/2 (January  -  April) 50 per cent of the 2900 reefs within the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park were affected by widespread coral bleaching incidents. In each case five per cent of reefs suffered lasting damage. In 2006 (January  -  February) a severe localised bleaching event focused at the southern end of the Marine Park caused 40 per cent mortality of reefs in the Keppel Bay area.                   2010-2011 Floods:                 The 2010-2011 Queensland summer (December to March) was the sixth wettest since records began and heavy flooding has persisted for several months throughout most of south-eastern Queensland. These floods have caused high turbidity and increases in sedimentation and chlorophyll levels in inshore areas exposed to the flood plumes. Corals stressed by decreased salinity and high turbidity can bleach, although salinity-induced bleaching is usually localised and confined to shallower areas where the largest salinity decrease occurs.                    Ningaloo Reef                 I am advised that the cold water bleaching occurred during winter (July) 2006. The bleaching event related to anoxic water after coral spawning occurred in late March 2008. The only warm water bleaching event began in February 2011.                 (b)                   Great Barrier Reef                  I am advised the1997/8 incident primarily affected the inshore and mid-shelf reefs between Cooktown and Townsville and the inshore reefs between Ayr and Gladstone. In 2001/2 a larger proportion of mid-shelf reefs were affected by bleaching between Port Douglas and Rockhampton.                   2010-2011 Floods:                 Bleaching has been reported on some fringing reefs in the Keppel Island Group as a result of this current flooding, however, as rainfall has continued to occur in this area, it is too early to assess the full extent of the bleaching. Localised coral bleaching has also been observed on the reef flat at Heron Island although reports from the research station indicate this is a result of intense rainfall during very low tides.                    Ningaloo Reef                 I am advised that in July 2006 bleaching affected the entire length of Ningaloo Reef. Good coral recovery was observed at all sites with very minor mortality. The anoxic bleaching event in 2008 occurred in Bills Bay (Coral Bay) and coincided with fish kills. Between 20-40 per cent of coral in a 1.2km2 area was affected and did not recover. Bleaching in February 2011 was observed along the entire length of Ningaloo Reef. Areas in the Exmouth Gulf (100 per cent of coral affected), the Muiron Islands    (50-80 per cent coral affected), and Coral Bay (40-60 per cent of coral affected) had higher percentage bleaching than other areas along the reef system. Detailed assessments will be finalised in the coming months and will provide a basis for assessing recovery.

                 (1) In NSW, 3,079 Government, Catholic and Independent schools received funding under the Building the Education Revolution (BER) program.                 (2) The table below shows the number of Primary Schools for the 21st Century (P21) projects in NSW with a facility type of 'Classrooms'. Some of these projects may have involved the construction of more than one classroom.                                   Under the National School Pride (NSP) or Science and Language Centres for 21st Century Secondary Schools(SLC) elements of the BER, 'Classrooms' are not specified as a reportable facility type. Accordingly, data is not available on the number of classrooms built under these elements of the BER                 Under NSP, the projects undertaken were small scale infrastructure and/or minor refurbishment in nature and hence are unlikely to include the construction of classrooms.                 Under SLC, it is possible that the construction or refurbishment of science and language learning centres could be classified as 'classrooms'. The number of projects provided under the SLC element in NSW is 159.                 (3) Under the BER reporting guidelines, jurisdictions are not required to report on the provision of air conditioning in BER facilities.

                 (a) In areas where the National Broadband Network will operate over wireless, NBN Co will deploy next generation wireless technologies that are capable of providing reliable broadband services enabling the delivery of high quality services, such as e-health services and in-home tele-monitoring.                  While fibre optic is the most future-proof technology available, with the capacity to deliver broadband speeds far beyond the government's stated 100 megabits per second objective, next generation wireless technologies will still play an important role in Australia's broadband landscape and are well suited to providing services to areas with low population density.                   In lower population density areas, where the NBN will operate via next generation wireless or satellite technologies, NBN users will still be able to access broadband services with peak speeds of at least 12 megabits per second downstream and 1 megabit per second upstream, which is faster than the average fixed broadband service experienced by most Australians today.

This includes those clinics which have offered early services prior to opening.                 (b) Over 256,000 presentations were reported to have been with a general practitioner.                 (c) Under the GP Super Clinics Program, self reported data is collected on patient presentations to GPs and allied health professionals. This data is not collected on the basis of Medicare/non-Medicare services. This reflects more completely the multidisciplinary nature of the services being provided in GP Super Clinics, some of which are not Medicare eligible services.

                 (1) The Government has committed $1.8 billion to regional health infrastructure through the Health and Hospitals Fund (HHF). Funding of $1.33 billion was announced in the 2011-12 Budget for 63 projects arising from the Regional Priority Round. A further $475 million has been committed to a further regional round to commence before the end of 2011.                 (2) An initial allocation of $315 million was made at the 2010-11 Mid Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook for the Royal Hobart and Port Macquarie Hospitals, subject to the HHF Advisory Board assessing these projects as eligible under the HHF evaluation criteria and Regional Priority Round additional guidance. This comprised $240 million for the Royal Hobart Hospital and $75 million for the Port Macquarie Hospital as follows:                                   The Government announced on 11 March 2011 that it would fund the Port Macquarie Hospital project at the $96 million assessed by the Board as eligible. This includes $75 million appropriated in the 2010-11 Mid Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook and $21 million approved by the Acting Prime Minister on 10 March 2011, with this latter amount to be appropriated in the 2011-12 Budget.                  The Government has announced the other projects to be funded under the Regional Priority Round and the funding profile is at page 218 of Budget Paper number 2.                 (3) No. However, the grant guidelines provided for funding of RA1 proposals only where they would exclusively or predominantly service the health needs of regional patients.

                 (a) The Australian Government is committed to a sustainable Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) as a key to keeping medicines affordable and accessible, and delivering better health services for all Australians.                 The cost of the PBS has continued to grow over the past ten years, averaging growth of about nine percent a year, and it is estimated it will cost about $9 billion this financial year. This growth rate is higher than the six percent annual increase for general hospital and medical services, and of course much higher than the Consumer Price Index.                 A fiscally responsible Government cannot continue to increase funding for one program at the expense of other pressing health needs, in the hope of a reduction in costs at some point in the future. The Government must deal with the fiscal circumstances and health priorities now, as well as assessing future growth patterns.                 Consequently, the Government is concentrating on listing medicines on the PBS that treat serious and life threatening conditions where there are no alternative treatments on the PBS.                 (b) The Government relies upon information provided by the PBAC in relation to clinical need for each medicine or vaccine, including whether alternative treatment options exist, and whether there were comparable listings in the past three years. Additional information taken into account is whether the listing provides expenditure savings and other technical information that the PBAC considered. The Government also relies on the expert advice from the Department of Health and Ageing and the Chief Medical Officer.                 (c) and (d) The costs of measures considered by the Cabinet, including potential PBS listings are Cabinet in Confidence.                  (e) (i) Any PBS listings with a financial impact are considered by the Cabinet.                 (ii) When circumstances permit, the Government will reconsider those applications.                   (f) The number of patients who may have been prescribed the deferred PBS listings in the first full year of listing is commercial-in-confidence.

                 (1) (a) and (2) (a) and (c) The following table summarises the numbers of suicides of Australian Defence Force (ADF) members by Service, from 1996 to 2011.                  Table 1: Australian Defence Force Suicides From 1997-2011.                                   (i) It should be noted that a number of cases from recent years are suspected suicides that require coronial confirmation of cause of death, and as such, these figures are subject to change.                 (ii) This information does not include Reserve personnel, unless on full-time service at time of death.                 (b) Management and reporting on ex-service personnel falls under the jurisdiction of the Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA).                  DVA only records a reason for death where the cause of death is relevant to a claim for compensation. DVA's data is based on accepted claims under the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986, the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2004 and the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988.                  There are circumstances in which the cause of death is not relevant for provision of compensation (eg an automatic grant of war widows pension), and other circumstances where no claim is received relating to a death (eg where a deceased veteran has no dependants). In such circumstances DVA does not record the cause of death.                 Within the caveats listed above, to date DVA has recorded a total of 88 deaths by suicide occurred during the period 1 January 1996 and to 30 April 2011. As these statistics are based on death claims determined, should further claims for compensation for death by suicide be lodged in respect of any death that occurred during the period in question, the numbers may change in the future. In respect of each calendar year, the number of recorded deaths by suicide are as follows:                                    Some of these deaths would have occurred whilst the deceased was still serving in the ADF, which means that they would also be included in Table 1. However, to determine which of these deaths occurred whilst the deceased was serving in the ADF would require interrogation of individual files.                  (3) (a) and (b) As the ADF does not currently have a centralised electronic health record, it is not possible to identify how many individuals have been diagnosed with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) over the past 15 years. The following data is however provided:                 (i) Data are collected centrally regarding the medical conditions for which individuals are referred to the Medical Employment Classification Review Board (MECRB) of their Service. When ADF members are considered to be no longer medically fit for deployment, they are referred to the MECRB for consideration of their continued service.                 (ii) Data collection within Joint Health Command commenced in 2002 with the primary aim of workflow monitoring. The data collected under that system have limited utility in analysing trends in particular medical conditions, so are indicative only.                  (iii) The following table summarises the numbers of Medical Employment Classification Review Board (MECRB) Determinations for individuals with a diagnosis of PTSD by year (2002 to 2007) and Service.                 Table 2: Number of MECRB Determinations for individuals with a diagnosis of PTSD by year and Service.                                   (iv) Throughout 2007, data collection was transitioned to a more robust system which was better designed to monitor medical conditions being presented to MECRB as well as workflow.                 (v) The following table summarises the numbers of members presented to MECRB with PTSD between 2007 and 2010.                 Table 3: Number of members presented to MECRB with PTSD between 2007 and 2010.                                   (vi) Fluctuations or variations in figures over specific time periods need to be interpreted with caution. A spike in any one period does not necessarily mean that there has been an increase in cases of illness in any given period of time. It means that there has been an increase in the number of individuals receiving determinations from their MECRB in that time period and nothing more. From time to time, MECRB clear back logs of cases, resulting in increased determinations over the following time period.                 (vii) It must be noted that these data represent the cases determined by MECRB in each year, and may contain some duplicates i.e. an individual may have been presented to MECRB more than once. Approximately 85 per cent of these cases involved multiple medical conditions, of which PTSD was one.

                 (a) The NBN Co Corporate Plan 2011-2013 and business case assumptions do not distinguish between premises which are rented or owned.                 (b) (i) and (ii) The NBN Co Corporate Plan 2011-2013 and business case assumptions relating to likely connection rates are informed by trends relating to fixed line services, rather than rental or ownership of residential premises. Quality of broadband access is an increasingly important criteria for selection of a residence and NBN Co expects owners will value the benefits of an installation of a fibre service and ensure connection to avoid compromising a property's attractiveness to future tenants or buyers.

                 (a) Yes, the architecture of the National Broadband Network will require installation of external street cabinets referred to as Fibre Distribution Hubs.                 (b) The number of end users to be served from an individual fibre splitter is consistent with Gigabit Passive Optical Network (GPON) capability. NBN Co has developed engineering rules that result in a GPON being shared by a maximum of 32 end users. NBN Co expects the practical average across the fibre footprint to be around 28 end users per GPON. Refer to Question HQIW178 (a).                 (c) NBN Co Limited anticipates that 55,000 external street cabinets or Fibre Distribution Hubs will be required to be installed around Australia.

                 (a) The Government's 20 June 2010 policy statement1 outlined a new institutional, regulatory and funding framework for the delivery of USO and other public interest services. This includes the establishment from 1 July 2012, of a new entity, provisionally called USO Co, which will take on responsibility for delivery of universal service outcomes and other telecommunications public interest services. As part of USO Co arrangements, customers outside NBN Co's fibre footprint that have access to Telstra's copper network will continue to be able to receive a standard telephone service over that network if they wish.                   (b) Changes to Telstra's net costs of meeting the USO over its copper network outside NBN fibre areas is one of the considerations that are part of the contractual negotiations between it and the Commonwealth on the delivery of the USO.(c)    (i) Compared with the current costs of Telstra's copper network, it is anticipated that the per customer cost of Telstra's copper network will continue to vary over time subject to a number of factors including the network footprint and the number of services in operation. (ii) Under the proposed USO Agreement, Telstra will receive payments from USO Co that will go towards meeting the net costs of meeting the USO. As is currently the case, Telstra will also obtain payments from its customers for provision of USO services.                   1 www.dbcde.gov.au/broadband/national_broadband_network/nbn_policy_statements#uso

                 (1) 7 April 2009.                  (2) (a), (b) Over the course of the National Broadband Network (NBN) Request for Proposals (RFP) process and in developing its fibre to the premises (FTTP) policy, the Government received extensive advice on a broad range of issues relating to the capacity, marketing and viability of broadband networks in delivering broadband applications. The Government extensively tested the market through the NBN RFP process. It drew on advice from the Panel of Experts, specialist economic, commercial and technical advisers appointed to assist the NBN Taskforce and the Panel (Frontier Economics, KPMG and Gibson Quai AAS) who have extensive expertise in the telecommunications market, the ACCC, relevant government agencies, advice contained in research reports and provided through public consultation processes.                  (c)  Preliminary cost estimates were developed using a range of available information and assumptions were analysed, as part of the Government's decision making process. Further financial modeling was conducted in the course of the NBN Implementation Study.                 (3) No specific commitments were obtained from Commonwealth departments and agencies in relation to the delivery of additional services and applications for the 100 Mbps National Broadband Network.

                 The Panel of Experts was appointed by the Government in April 2008 to assess proposals received by the Commonwealth in response to the Request for Proposals (RFP) to rollout and operate a National Broadband Network for Australia and provide a report to the Minister. Following an extensive assessment process, the Panel of Experts advised the Government that none of the national proposals offered value for money. Instead, the Panel of Experts encouraged the government to invest in fibre technology, supplemented by next-generation wireless and satellite technologies, however, it did not consider costings for such a network. Preliminary costing was carried out by government agencies, drawing on advice from a range of sources including technical advisers who have extensive expertise in the telecommunications market. Detailed costing was undertaken in the course of the NBN Implementation Study.

                 Since January 28, 2011 my department and Tourism Australia have intensified their work with the Queensland Government to deliver a $12 million Tourism Industry Support Package in response to the Queensland floods and Cyclone Yasi.                 The Tourism Industry Support Package marketing campaign has included:                 a global media mega famil, where almost 200 international and domestic travel writers, news journalists and bloggers from more than 20 countries were taken on familiarisation tours of some of Queensland's top destinations;                 marketing activities targeting Queensland's key markets, including New Zealand, China, Japan and the United Kingdom;                 an international youth and adventure traveller campaign;                 domestic marketing activity, including a brand and retail campaign telling Australians that Queensland is open;                 a multi-faceted interstate marketing campaign under the theme 'Nothing Beats Queensland' which includes seven different commercials being run nationally and television networks broadcasting nationally from various Queensland destinations; and                 intrastate marketing encouraging Queenslanders to support their mates by holidaying at home.                 As part of the Queensland mega famil, 10 domestic media visited Townsville and Tropical North Queensland.  The media experienced, first hand, local activities such as jet skiing at Palm Cove, walks along Williams Esplanade, day spa experiences, visits to Magnetic Island, snorkelling and diving on the Yongala shipwreck.                 The Tourism Industry Recovery Forums program was jointly funded through my department and the Queensland Department of Employment, Economic Development and Innovation.  The program offered workshops for tourism businesses in areas directly and indirectly affected to provide information on what assistance is available, as well as to deliver existing content on business resilience.  The objective of the forums was to build tourism business resilience and capability in the recovery phase and beyond.  A forum was held in Townsville on 13 April 2011 and 32 operators attended.                 Under the 'Servicing the China Market'  CEO Workshops program, my department has engaged an experienced consultant to conduct a series of workshops from May through July across five Queensland regions where Chinese tourism is most concentrated.  The objective is to develop the product currently being offered to the China market in these regions.  The regions in which the workshops are being conducted are the Gold Coast, Tropical North Queensland, the Whitsundays, the Sunshine Coast and Brisbane.                 My department will also provide support for up to 100 tourism industry representatives to attend the Australia-China Tourism Summit 2011 in Cairns from 7-9 June 2011.  This will include a Queensland tourism industry networking function on 7 June 2011.  A number of businesses and industry organisations from North Queensland have been invited to take advantage of this opportunity, including Townsville Enterprise.                 The Trade Advisory Support program, funded by my department, will be delivered by Enterprise Connect, through a Memorandum of Understanding with the Department of Innovation, Industry, Science and Research who administer the Enterprise Connect program.  Known as the Queensland Tourism Service, the Service will provide a Tourism Business Review to eligible tourism businesses which will be carried out on-site by skilled and experienced Business Advisers at no financial cost to the business.  The Business Adviser will work with the business to understand the business' strategy and operations; identify strengths and opportunities, including benchmarking against best practice; assess potential areas for growth and improvement; and help firms access world-class business tools, processes and technology.  In addition to the Tourism Business Review, tourism businesses will be eligible for:                 Tailored Advisory Service  -  providing matching funding of up to $10,000 to implement changes identified through the Tourism Business Review;                 Enterprise Learning  -  informal peer-group learning sessions to assist clients to maintain and embed improvements set out in the Tourism Business Review; and                 Workshops, Industry, Intelligence and Networking (WIIN)  -  an events program aiming to improve awareness of relevant innovations, technologies, expertise and best practice amongst small and medium-sized businesses.                 A further element of the Tourism Industry Support Package was providing support for tradeshows.  Support was made available to assist in the attendance of 300 Queensland tourism businesses at the Australia Tourism Exchange in Sydney on 1 8 April 2011.  Seven of these businesses were Townsville operators  -  Townsville Enterprise Limited, Tropical Horizons Tours, Vision Hotels and Resorts, Wildlife Island and Bush Safari, Reef HQ Great Barrier Reef Aquarium, Dreamtime Journey by Kookaburra Tours and Adrenalin Snorkel &amp; Dive.  The subsidy helped many operators attend, who would have been unable to otherwise attend.                 In addition to my department's activities, on 6 April 2011the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Hon Kevin Rudd MP, welcomed a group of over 70 Heads of Mission and Consuls-General and their spouses to Queensland.  The purpose of the visit was to demonstrate to the world that Queensland is well and truly back in business and to assist the diplomats in knowing first-hand, and being better able to share, the tremendous opportunities on offer there.  The visit included a day in Cairns, finishing with dinner in Port Douglas.                 It should be noted that the assistance being provided by my department and portfolio agency, Tourism Australia, is in addition to measures taken by the Commonwealth Government under the Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements and the Commonwealth and Queensland Government funded Rural Resilience Fund.  It is also over and above other support such as TQUAL Grants and funding for Regional and Local Community Infrastructure Projects.  In the 2009 round of TQUAL grants, $100,000 was provided to Mount Flagstone Station Pty Ltd, 45 kms southwest of Townsville, to assist with the refurbishment of the historic homestead to provide quality farm-stay accommodation in the Townsville region.  In the first round of Regional and Local Community Infrastructure Projects in 2008-09, over $16 million of funding was provided to the Townsville City Council for redevelopment of the Townsville CBD.

                 Analysis and modelling has been undertaken to determine the impact of the Home Insulation Program on Australia's greenhouse gas emissions as part of the 2010 emissions projections. The results of the modelling were released in the report Australia's Emissions Projections on 9 February 2011. This modelling was undertaken by SKM-MMA and ACIL Tasman. The modelling and analysis estimated that the program will reduce emissions by 2.4 megatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (Mt CO2-e) in 2010-11, coinciding with the first full year of benefits to the 1.2 million homes insulated, and will result in cumulative emissions reductions of more than 14 Mt CO2-e in the period to 2020.                  Modelling and analysis of the impact of the Green Loans program on greenhouse gas emissions has not yet been undertaken, pending the completion of an evaluation of the program's outcomes.

                 Within the foreign aid budget, the Australian Government offers long-term and short-term awards, administered under the Australia Awards.                  Long-term Australia Awards are tertiary scholarships for study towards undergraduate and post-graduate qualifications. In the calendar years 2009, 2010 and 2011, Indonesian citizens were awarded a combined total of 1,041 long-term Australia Awards, including 688 public servants and 617 residents of Java.                    Short-term Australia Awards include fellowships and professional development programs at a range of organisations, including tertiary institutions. Short-term awards do not necessarily result in a formal qualification. In the calendar years 2009, 2010 and 2011, Indonesian citizenswere awarded a combined total of 362 short-term Australia Awards for placement at tertiary institutions. This includes 210 public servants and 207 residents of Java.                    The majority of Australia Awards awarded to Indonesia are administered by the Australian Agency for International Development, with the remainder administered by the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations.                    The yearly breakdowns of the long and short-term Australia Awards are shown below:

                  (1) As set out in the judgment of His Honour Justice McKerracher in Zentai v Honourable Brendan O'Connor (No 3) [2010] FCA 691, prior to making a surrender determination in respect of Mr Zentai, the Minister was provided with a submission (annexing relevant documentation) prepared by the Attorney-General's Department.  The submission discussed advice provided by the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions to the Australian Federal Police on evidentiary issues relating to the allegations against Mr Zentai and also discussed the basis on which the Republic of Hungary sought Mr Zentai's extradition.  As the issues raised by the honourable member are the subject of proceedings currently before the Full Court of the Federal Court, it is not appropriate to comment further.                  (2) The submission prepared by the Attorney-General's Department referred to in response to Question (1) above was before the Minister at the time he determined that Mr Zentai was to be surrendered to Hungary to face prosecution for a war crime.  In view of the issues raised in litigation presently before the Full Court of the Federal Court in this matter, it is not appropriate to comment further.                  (3) The decision of Mr Justice McKerracher of 2 July 2010 raises significant and complex issues for the administration of Australia's extradition scheme.  It is appropriate that an appeal be pursued.

                  (1) The Republic of Hungary made a formal request under the Treaty on Extradition between Australia and the Republic of Hungary for the extradition of Mr Zentai to face prosecution for a war crime.

                  (1) As at 20 April 2011, the approximate amount of costs billed to the Commonwealth relating to litigation in the matter of Mr Zentai's extradition is $505,400 (including GST and disbursement). This figure includes costs of approximately $247,000 incurred in earlier proceedings instituted by Mr Zentai challenging various aspects of the extradition process, including the constitutionality of the Extradition Act 1988.  Mr Zentai was unsuccessful in those proceedings.  The Australia Central Authroity for extradition in the Attorney-General's Department does not maintain records of the time particular officers spend on particular matters.                 As at 20 April 2011, the approximate amount of costs billed to the Commonwealth in the appeal proceedings is $105,400.

                 The Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency advises that:                 No modelling simulation has been done that would provide answers to the honourable member's questions.                  Almost without exception, the major emitting countries of the world are beginning to take measures to reduce their emissions from business as usual, so the question refers to a hypothetical scenario that will never happen. Modelling has therefore not been undertaken to establish the impact of such a scenario on global temperatures or its cost to Australia.                 Some 89 countries, that together account for more than 80 per cent of global emissions and more than 90 per cent of the global economy, have pledged to reduce or limit their emissions by 2020 under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.                  Key economies already have substantial policies in place restraining emissions or emissions growth. Emissions trading schemes (ETS) already operate in 31 European countries and New Zealand, and in 10 United States (US) states. California will commence their ETS in January 2012.                 The US is committed to achieving its target to reduce its emissions by 17 per cent by 2020 (on 2005 levels). As part of this effort, from January 2011, the US is regulating large stationary sources of greenhouse gas emissions to incentivise the uptake of advanced technology and reduce emissions.                 China's Five-Year Plan for 2011-2015 includes targets to reduce its energy and carbon intensity including through introduction of emissions trading in several major provinces and cities. China is leading the world in the production and installation of a range of renewable and green technologies. In 2009, China added 37 gigawatts of renewable power capacity, more than any other country in the world.                 In India, a tax on coal took effect last July. Expected revenue of over half a billion dollars annually will be used to fund research into clean energy technologies.                 Emission reductions by Australia, or any other single country, would have only a limited impact on the expected average global temperature: only collective action by a majority of the world's major emitting countries can have a significant impact on this.

                 The Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency advises that:                  This is an extremely unlikely scenario because if the rest of the world had halved its greenhouse gas emissions while Australia had not made commensurate reductions in its greenhouse gas emissions, it is very likely that the rest of the world would also have taken economic or other action to persuade Australia to contribute its fair share to the global effort.                 However, in the unlikely event that Australia's emissions did grow by 2 per cent a year until 2050 while the rest of the world reduced their emissions to half what they were in 2011, in 2050 Australia's emissions would be a little over 1 gigatonne of carbon dioxide equivalent compared to the global total of about 25 gigatonnes. Under this scenario, in 2050 Australia's annual emissions would be about 5 per cent of total global emissions, a significantly larger proportion than they are now. Emission reductions by any single country have only a limited impact on the expected average global temperature. This applies to Australia as much as to any other country. Only collective action by a majority of the world's major emitting countries can have a significant impact on the expected average global temperature. Almost without exception, the major emitting countries of the world are taking measures to reduce their emissions from business as usual.                 The Government's modelling of domestic action to reduce emissions (published by Treasury in 2008) indicated that reducing Australia's national carbon emissions to 60 per cent below 2000 is consistent with gross national product (GNP) per capita being roughly 1.5 times larger in 2050 than in 2008. The modelling indicated that making emissions reductions of this magnitude would reduce average growth in GNP per capita by only 0.1 per cent per annum  -  from 1.2 per cent per annum down to 1.1 per cent per annum.                 If, as posited by the honourable member, Australia alone did not act to reduce emissions it would be possible that other countries would adopt policies that would impact adversely on Australia's economy. The cost of this to a small, open economy like Australia could be considerable.

                 (a) The Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations used information collected through a Preliminary Survey conducted in early 2008 to establish that approximately 780,000 computers would be required to achieve a one to one student to computer ratio in Years 9 to 12. Since the Preliminary Survey, there has been some movement in the number of computers required as a result of:                 schools seeking to join the Fund that had not responded to the survey;                 schools with Years 9 to 12 that were not offered at the time of the survey;                 new schools being established; and                 conversion of funding for computers to flexible funding to better accommodate the needs of students with disabilities.                 The total number of computers now required is 786,848. This figure has not been broken down by electorate.                 (b) The list below outlines the total number of computers installed by electorate as at 31 March 2011.

                 (1) The location of overhead and underground cabling will be determined by NBN Co Limited (NBN Co) on an area-by-area basis. Factors that will influence whether overhead or underground cabling will be used include availability of existing infrastructure and the completion of Definitive Agreements between NBN Co and with Telstra which will provide NBN Co with access to Telstra's underground pit and pipes.                  (2) NBN Co's Corporate Plan indicates that 75 per cent of the network will be deployed underground. NBN Co has attended community meetings in first release sites to discuss details of the proposed network rollout and receive community feedback. NBN Co will contact residents and property owners in Bradfield when the NBN rollout commences in that area.

                 The department does not centrally maintain records of briefings provided to individual Members of Parliament. The department regularly provides assistance, including briefings, to Members of Parliament who travel overseas. To provide the information sought would entail a significant diversion of resources and I do not consider the additional work can be justified.

                 According to McKinsey &amp; Co and KPMG, the data supporting the claim that 'Australia's broadband services are the third slowest among OECD countries' is based on the information provided to Technology and Innovation Foundation (ITIF) Broadband rankings 2008, which may be found at: www.itif.org/files/2008BBRankings.pdf                  The ITIF data indicates that in 2008 Australia's average advertised download speed was 1.7 Mbps, ranking Australia's broadband services the third slowest out of the 30 countries surveyed.                  By way of comparison, Japan recorded the fastest average advertised download speed of 63.6Mbps and Greece recorded the slowest average download speed of 1.0 Mbps.                 The primary source for the ITIF speed ranking is a 2006 OECD report, Multiple Play: Pricing and Policy Trends.                 More recent data published on 21 April 2010 suggests that in the fourth quarter 2009, Australia ranked 28 out of 33 OECD member countries in terms of actual average broadband speeds (www.akamai.com/stateoftheinternet).

                 The total value of depreciation expenses is as follows:                 Table 1: Consumption of Fixed Capital by the Accommodation and Food Services Industry (chain volume measure, $ millions)                                   Source: ABS Cat. No. 5204.0                 The table shows the consumption of fixed capital, or economic depreciation. The ABS defines economic depreciation as the difference between the real economic value of the asset at the beginning of the period and at the end of the period (Australian System of National Accounts, Concepts Sources and Methods, ABS, 2000). Therefore the data may not reflect actual depreciation 'expenses' (book value).

                 The Gillard Government is committed to building Australia's future workforce.  As part of this commitment, the tax exempt Tools for Your Trade payments available to eligible apprentices were increased from 1 January 2011 to provide up to $5,500 per apprentice over the duration of their apprenticeship.                 The Tools for Your Trade payments are available to eligible Australian Apprentices in critical or skills shortage occupations, including shearing, tree surgery and landscape gardening.  These payments have also been extended to other Certificate II, III and IV Australian Apprenticeships in an agricultural occupation, and if in rural and regional Australia, a horticultural occupation.                 In addition to commencement and completion incentives totalling up to $4,000, employers of agricultural and horticultural Australian Apprentices in skills shortage occupations may be eligible to receive a special rural and regional commencement incentive of $1,000.                  Employers of eligible Certificate II Australian Apprentices in declared drought areas may also receive special drought area incentives totalling up to $3,000.

                 (1) The Australian Government currently supports the provision of after hours primary care services through:                 Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) After Hours Rebates -  higher rebates are offered for after hours consultations by GPs and other medical practitioners;                 the General Practice After Hours (GPAH) Program  -  competitive based program that provides funding to organisations wishing to provide after hours GP services; and                 the Practice Incentives Program (PIP) After Hours Incentive  -  payments are made to eligible general practices which arrange for, or provide, after hours care to their patients.                 In the 2010-11 Budget the Australian Government announced reforms to after hours primary care under the 'Establishing Medicare Locals and Improving Access to After Hours Care' measure. This will involve:                 the establishment of a national telephone-based after hours GP medical advice and diagnostic service as an additional service to the nurse triage, information and advice services currently provided by the National Health Call Centre Network, trading as healthdirect Australia; and                  the introduction of new Australian Government funding arrangements through Medicare Locals to support the provision of face-to-face after hours primary care services at the local level.                                     * Expenditure for the PIP After Hours Incentive is demand driven, at approximately $58 million per year.                 (2) (a) PIP After Hours Incentives will cease on 1 July 2013.                  (b) The GPAH Program will cease on 1 July 2012. No new grants will be offered under the program from this date.                  (c) The after hours telephone-based GP advice service will be operational from 1 July 2011.                  (d) From 1 July 2013 Medicare Locals will be provided with funding to support the provision of comprehensive face-to-face after hours primary care services at the local level.                  As announced as part of the Council of Australian Governments' (COAG) Heads of Agreement on National Health Reform, the establishment of Medicare Locals and their role in planning and supporting after hours care provision in their region has been brought forward. Medicare Locals will now be established in three tranches with the first tranche to be operational from 1 July 2011, the second tranche by 1 January 2012 and the remainder by 1 July 2012. As they are established, Medicare Locals will be funded to review the after hour primary care need of their region and to develop and implement a plan to address gaps in after hours care.                 (3) The most recent advice from GP Super Clinic operators for the ten currently opened GP Super Clinics is as follows.                                   An additional 28 GP Super Clinics were announced as part of the 2010-11 Budget and will offer an extensive array of primary care services in a single location, with integrated services delivered by teams of health professionals.                  All of these 28 GP Super Clinics, including hub and spoke model clinics, will offer hours of opening that extend beyond 8am-6pm weekdays and 9am-12 noon Saturdays. Further after hours services provided by the GP Super Clinics will be determined depending on the local needs and priorities of the community, taking into account the availability of existing after hours GP services.                 (4), (5), (6)                 Home Visit Services Provided by General Practitioners                                     Home Visit Services Provided by Medical Deputising Services (MDS)                 Current MBS item billing does not differentiate between after hours home visit services provided by standard GPs and those working for MDS. As such an accurate estimate of the number of MDS services provided, including in aged care facilities, in 2009-10 and until 2012-13 cannot be provided.                  The National Association for Medical Deputising (NAMDS) estimates that MDS provided approximately 600,000 after hours home visits in 2009-10. This figure has not been validated by the Department.

                 (a) The Skilling Australia's Defence Industry (SADI) Program has created 20,578 training opportunities since its inception in 2005. Eight hundred and thirty two training opportunities have been created through the Defence Industry Innovation Centre since 2010.                  (i) The average cost per SADI opportunity, calculated by dividing total funding committed to the Program by the number of opportunities, is $2,646. However these training opportunities encompass everything from short one-day courses to Masters and Doctoral degrees over several years.                  (ii) Total funds committed to the SADI Program from inception to end of financial year 2010-11 is $54,445,428.                 (b) Seven hundred and seventy school students have participated in the Industry Pathway Programs to date (99 in SA; 400 in NSW; and 271 in WA).                 (i) The cost per participant varies from state to state: $754 in SA; $350 in NSW; and $38 in WA. While the WA figure is comparatively low, WA has requested additional funding of approximately $2 million which, if agreed, will expand their program and alter the cost per student in WA.                 (ii) Total cost per state: SA $74,646; NSW $140,000; WA $10,298. The total cost across the three states to date is $224,944.

                 Under Australia's foreign investment review arrangements, proposals are assessed on a case-by-case basis to determine whether a particular proposal would be contrary to Australia's national interest. This assessment takes into consideration a range of factors that vary from case to case.                 I found that the proposed acquisition of ASX Limited by Singapore Exchange Limited would be contrary to Australia's national interest. The reasons for my decision are set out in my media release dated 8 April 2011.                   I found that the proposed acquisition of Ricegrowers Limited (SunRice) by Ebro Foods S.A was not contrary to Australia                   '                   s national interest                   .                    In reaching this conclusion I took into account a range of national interest considerations which are set out in Australia                   '                   s foreign investment policy and took advice from a range of sources including the Foreign Investment Review Board.

                 (a) In respect of the 105mm Hamel artillery pieces:                 (i) There are currently 101 Hamel guns in the fleet.                 (ii) The Hamel fleet will be withdrawn from service in 1 Regiment and 4 Regiment from February 2012. A fleet of six Hamel guns will be held at the School of Artillery to be used in support of observation of fire courses.                 (iii) The current end of service life date is 2012.                 (iv) The end of service life date can be extended, however the Hamel gun will be unable to be used as part of the digitised offensive support network established by Project Land 17. The cost to continue a maintenance and spares program for a reduced fleet of 61 Hamel guns (not including the initial quantity of 40 Hamel guns being readied for disposal) is estimated to be approximately $0.5m per annum. This cost does not include training and ammunition requirements.                  (v) All guns will eventually be withdrawn to Joint Logistics Unit  -  Victoria (Bandiana) before disposal. An initial quantity of 40 Hamel guns is being readied for disposal.                  (b) In respect of the 155mm M198 Howitzer artillery pieces:                 (i) There are currently 33 M198 guns in the fleet.                 (ii) The final M198 guns will be withdrawn from service to coincide with the issuing of M777A2 in February 2012.                 (iii) The current end of service life date is 2012.                 (iv) The end of service life dates can be extended. The cost to continue a maintenance and spares program for a fleet of 33 M198 guns is estimated to be approximately $0.75m per annum. This cost does not include training and ammunition requirements. A re-build of the M198 fleet would be required if the service life was extended beyond 2015. Re-building the fleet is estimated to cost an additional $0.15m per gun commencing from 2015 at a rate of five guns per year until 2020.                 (v) All guns will eventually be withdrawn to Joint Logistics Unit  -  Victoria (Bandiana) for long term storage. The M198 fleet is expected to be retained in long term storage until 2020.

                 (1) Yes, the Australian Defence Force is in the process of converting all regular field artillery batteries to 155mm guns. This is being done under LAND 17 Phase 1 which will deliver both self-propelled and towed guns able to fire precision munitions at very long ranges, and at high rates of fire.

                 (1) Defence plans to seek Government's agreement for Second Pass in 2012.                 (2) The Australian Defence Force intends to acquire under LAND 17 the following guns:                 (a) Defence is in contract for the delivery of 35 M777A2 Lightweight Towed 155mm Howitzers.                 (b) The request for tender for the Self Propelled Howitzers sought 18 systems for Defence.                 (3) There were two submissions received in response to the request for tender, from Krauss Maffei Wegmann and Raytheon Australia/Samsung Techwin. Defence is now finalising further work to address the capability's support arrangements that were outside of the Self Propelled Howitzer tender. These elements are critical to having a workable and fully costed capability that Government can consider for approval.

                 (1) The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare has reported that 74,365, 74,380 and 73,033 admitted patients died in hospital in 2007-08, 2008-09 and 2009-10 respectively. Data on their causes of death are not available.                  (2), (3) and (4) No national data are available for the past ten years, and no surveys have been published on these matters since 2003.                  (5) No national studies have been conducted concerning the cost implications of caring for terminally ill patients in different care settings.                  (6) The Australian Government has policies in place to increase patients' access to subacute care services, including palliative care, to help manage the needs of the terminally ill.                 Through the subacute care component of the National Partnership Agreement on Hospital and Health Workforce Reform, the Australian Government provided $500 million in June 2009 to expand states and territories' provision of subacute care, including palliative care, over the period 2009-10 to 2012-13.                  The Australian Government has committed a further $1.623 billion over the four years 2010-11 to 2013-14 through the subacute care element of the National Partnership Agreement on Improving Public Hospital Services, for states and territories to deliver and operate at least 1,300 new subacute care beds and equivalent community-based services nationally, including for palliative care.                  The National Palliative Care Strategy released in February 2011 outlines a number of action areas. The initial priorities for implementation of the Strategy include work on:                 advance care planning;                 an integrated care pathway for end of life care;                 improving data collection for palliative care;                 bereavement and palliative care; and                 palliative care workforce analysis and planning.

During the period March 4, 2011 to June 9, 2011 there were 862,326 visits, representing 503,801 unique visitors.                 The geographic breakdown of unique visits to My School 2.0 covering the top 20 visitor locations is as follows:                                   These visits include 491,387 views of the school finance pages during the reporting period.                   (b) ACARA reports website statistics as page views per visit, rather than hits. This is regarded as more meaningful in terms of usage. Data on the breakdown of the number of page views by each unique visitor to the first version of the My School website are not available. For My School 2.0 since its launch date of March 4, 2011, monthly averages of page views per visit have been as follows:

                 In February 2010, the Government asked the Productivity Commission to conduct an independent Inquiry into the costs, benefits and feasibility of a national long-term care and support scheme for people with disability. This included consideration of a national disability insurance scheme.                 A national disability insurance scheme would be a complex and transformative reform that requires detailed consideration. The Productivity Commission's Inquiry is assessing whether a national disability insurance scheme would be appropriate, practical and economically responsible in the Australian context.                 The Productivity Commission has consulted widely, including with people with disability, their family and carers, governments and service providers. As part of this process, it released a draft report on 28 February 2011. The Productivity Commission is due to deliver their final report to Government on 31 July 2011.                 The Government looks forward to the final report and will respond after carefully considering its findings.

                 (1) My Department does not collect the data sought in the question. The Department considers the preparation of an answer to the question would involve significant diversion of departmental resources in the seeking of information from each state or territory and the Australian Federal Police and, in the circumstances, does not consider that the additional work can be justified.                 (2) My Department has in place some information sharing arrangements with state, territory and other Commonwealth agencies. Such agencies are not required to report to my Department on charges laid and convictions recorded against non-citizens. No proposals have been made to change this arrangement.

                 The Government has responded to the AFTS report on 2 May 2010 and in a number of subsequent policy announcements. The Government acted on some of the AFTS review recommendations and ruled out some recommendations that were inconsistent with our policy priorities.                  The AFTS report observes that 'it is neither possible nor desirable to make all of these changes too quickly.' A number of the recommendations in the AFTS report require further community debate, which is why the Government will hold a public tax forum in October to continue the national conversation on tax reform that we started with the release of the report.

                 The Howard Government funded a study into potential realignment options for the Bruce Highway through Burdekin. It was finalised in 2001. Following the completion of the study, the Howard Government had six years to commit funding to the project but never did.                  Meanwhile, the Gillard Labor Government is investing $2.8 billion for work on the Bruce Highway through the Nation Building Program. That is in stark contrast to the $1.2 billion the Howard Government spent on the Bruce Highway during its entire 12 years in government.

                 (1)  At the 2007 election, Labor supported a proposal from the Police Federation of Australia to create a National Police Service Medal while the Coalition refused to support the proposal.                 On coming to Government, Labor engaged in an extensive consultation process with Federal, State and Territory Police Commissioners and policing unions to formulate the criteria for awarding the NPSM. All these parties contributed their views about the qualification criteria for recipients of the medal and all agreed on the final eligibility criteria.                 On 30 October 2008, the Queen gave in-principle approval to create a new Australian police medal. As this was the earliest date that the NPSM had any formal existence, it was decided that a person would need to be a sworn member of an Australian police force on or after this date to be eligible to receive the medal.                 I am very pleased that Labor will be the party to deliver on such an important recognition of the fine work Australia's police forces do every day.                  (2)  Police who retired prior to 30 October 2008 are not eligible for the NPSM. They may however, be eligible or able to be nominated for other awards in the Australian honours system. More information about awards in the Australian honours system, including application and nomination processes, is available at www.itsanhonour.gov.au

                 In the 2010 Budget the Federal Labor Government introduced a system of milestone payments according to actual delivery and construction of projects. I am pleased to inform you that we are getting budget efficiencies by applying these measures. The Queensland Government concurred with the reallocation of cost savings that has been achieved through this measure, in order to reinstate five projects that had to be deferred on the Bruce Highway following last summer's flooding events.                  The planning on the deferred projects in Queensland was never halted and we always said we would bring them back to the original schedule if possible. That is exactly what we have done.

                 In 2001 the Coalition Government introduced cost recovery arrangements to recover the full cost of export certification. Shortly after transitioning industry to full cost recovery the Coalition Government introduced a 40 per cent subsidy, which was maintained for eight years.                  The independent review of quarantine and biosecurity arrangements: 'One biosecurity: a working partnership' (the Beale Review), recommended that the export certification function return to full cost recovery from 1 July 2009.                  In 2009, Labor acknowledged that the subsidy had supported a cumbersome system, rather than drive flexibility and systemic efficiencies legitimately sought by exporters. Therefore the government agreed to provide a further transitional rebate of fees  -  along with $42.1 million to fund staff redundancies, implement market access activities and commission essential projects to inform the work of the Ministerial Task Forces whose function has been to develop and drive reform.                  The Australian Meat Industry Council agreed to the establishment of the Export Certification Reform Package (ECRP) with the clear understanding that the government's generous 40 per cent rebate would expire on 1 July 2011. The government and members of industry on the Ministerial Task Forces have all been working hard to find efficiencies in the certification system and has developed the Australian Export Meat Inspection System (AEMIS).                 This system is ready for implementation during the 2011-12 financial year and supporting fee orders and regulations are being developed.

A number of other aircraft are currently being assessed to determine if they can be preserved by public or private museums for heritage purposes.                 Providing aircraft to public or private museums requires two things: United States Government approval and finding a way to deal effectively with the asbestos on the aircraft.                 The F-111s were produced in the United States and are subject to United States legislation. This requires the Australian Government to seek United States Government permission to transfer the aircraft to non-Government or non-Defence organisations. Based on previous experience this is difficult and takes some time.                 I am advised by Defence that over 80 per cent of the aircraft's surface panels have the potential to contain asbestos                 Defence is currently assessing how asbestos could be removed, remediated or safely contained, so that the aircraft could be safely displayed in public and private museums.

                 As at 16 June 2011, there are currently 11 operational GP Super Clinics.                 As advised previously, the Department of Health and Ageing provides self reported numbers of service presentations at an aggregated level only. Self reported services numbers for individual clinics are not made publicly available as:                 (i) there are commercial-in-confidence and privacy protection considerations around releasing data at the individual clinic level; and                  (ii) service numbers are not comparable (depending on when the Clinics commenced services, the size of the community, the number of service providers engaged etc) and could be open to misinterpretation.                 The current presentation data collection framework was implemented from 1 February 2011. The framework provides for the identification of GP, nursing and allied health presentations and the collection of data every two months by the Department from operational GP Super Clinic sites and those delivering early services.                  (a - b) Noting that a number of sites providing early services became operational part way through a reporting period, it is estimated that of the approximately 428,000 presentations at the 11 operational GP Super Clinics sites as at 31 May 2011, approximately 371,000 presentations were while sites were operational and 57,000 were early services provided prior to clinics becoming operational.                 (c) Prior to 31 January 2011, there were approximately 289,000 presentations at the eight operational GP Super Clinic sites, including early services that had been delivered, if any, at those sites.                  From 1 February 2011 to 31 March 2011, there were approximately 66,000 presentations at the operational GP Super Clinic sites.                 From 1 April 2011 to 31 May 2011, there were approximately 73,000 presentations at the operational GP Super Clinic sites.

                 The $280.2 million allocated over 5 years to the 2007-08 GP Super Clinics Program included:                 $184.3 million for the GP Super Clinics Program (including $2.6 program support costs);                 $36.8 million for Pharmaceutical Benefits flow on costs;                 $50.0 million for Medicare Benefits flow on costs; and                 $9.2 million for Veterans' Entitlements flow on costs.

                 (1) Defence is not aware of a Parsons Brinkerhoff study in 2002. There was a study by PPK Environment and Infrastructure ((PPK) a Parsons Brinckerhoff Company) in 2000. This study was provided to the Community Consultative Committee which comprised representatives of Defence, Port Stephens Council and residents. The study was also included as an appendix to the 2002 Hawk Aircraft Environmental Impact Statement which was made available to the public and the National Library of Australia. Defence has no record of providing the PPK report to the Auditor General.                  (2) Information used to determine the continued use of Salt Ash Weapons Range is safe for the surrounding community includes:                 Range standing orders - control procedures of activities specific to Salt Ash Air Weapons Range,                 Air Force publications on procedures for safe use of weapons on all air weapons ranges: and                 The Defence Training Area Management Manual  -  a Tri-service publication on   training area management.                  Air Force also review post activity performance reports every three months on the performance of weapons practices.                  (3) No. The Environmental Impact Statement for introduction of the F/A-18 Hornet, including its use of Salt Ash Air Weapons Range, was approved by the (then) Minister for Home Affairs and Environment on 5 July 1983. The Pollution Control Commission statement was made on 13 July 1983 as part of its submission to the Public Works Committee for the F/A-18 facilities development at RAAF Base Williamtown.                  (4) According to the 2000 PPK study, considerable residential development was predicted in the Tea Gardens study area and would likely result in a higher number of complaints than was occurring at Salt Ash. The study also found that disturbance to internationally important habitats and a breeding colony of Goulds Petrel could be significant impacts. Additional costs to transport personnel were considered to be minimal and were not a factor in deciding where to conduct testing.                 (5) The operation of aircraft with a single engine has been considered for all military operations, including those conducted at Salt Ash Air Weapons Range. All strafe passes developed by military aircraft, which include those conducted at Salt Ash Air Weapons Range, are designed to avoid the fragmentation envelope of delivered weapons. At no time are aircraft planned to fly through areas that could be affected by ricochet from the ground. Aircraft operations at Salt Ash Air Weapons Range are such that if a catastrophic engine failure was to occur, for any reason, sufficient energy is available to ensure the pilot can manoeuvre the aircraft safely away from populated areas. The RAAF operates, and has operated, single engine aircraft throughout its history, such as the Hawk, Macchi, Mirage and Sabre.

                  The criteria used to assess Family Tax Benefit eligibility for those families with more than $1,000,000 in annual income was the same as that used for all other eligible families, as outlined in the Family Assistance Act 1999.                 Key factors taken into consideration when assessing eligibility to Family Tax Benefit include family income throughout the financial year, changing circumstances such as a new birth, separation or partnership, receipt of income support payment, child age and the residential status of the claimant.                 As stated in the explanatory notes for Table J-5 in my Department's 2009-10 Annual Report, there are a number of reasons families with high incomes can receive payment.                 These include customers receiving income support for part of the year and earning higher incomes for the remainder of that year, customers whose partnership status changes during the year and whose new partner's income is high enough to preclude payment for the remainder of the year, Disability Support or Age Pension recipients who are legally blind and not required to declare their income or assets and customers who were eligible for a minimum rate of Family Tax Benefit for a specified Carer Allowance or Double Orphan Pension child.                 The six families with income over $1,000,000 who received Family Tax Benefit A and the three families with income over $1,000,000 who received Family Tax Benefit B all fall into one or more of the above categories.

                 As outlined in the Budget papers, the Government will invest $3.1 billion in 2011-12, and $18.2 billion over the period 2011-12 to 2014-15, in NBN Co. This investment is in the form of an equity injection to a public non-financial corporation (PNFC), and therefore has no direct impact on the underlying cash or fiscal balances. This is because the equity injection involves swapping one financial asset (cash) for another (equity).                  The classification of NBN Co as a PNFC is determined by the Australian Bureau of Statistics in accordance with the guidelines set out in the Australian System of Government Finance Statistics Concepts, Sources and Methods 2005.                 Additional public debt interest (PDI) costs associated with debt issued to finance the equity injections will impact on the underlying cash and fiscal balances. The Australian Office of Financial Management undertakes a single PDI calculation on the basis of the Government's overall financing requirement, which is outlined in Note 10: Interest Expense on page 9-21 of Budget Paper No.1 2011-12.

                 (a) The following clinics are offering/have offered early services since November 2007:                                   (b) As at 31 May 2011, the sites that were providing early services and were not yet operational had provided approximately 360,000 presentations. Of these, approximately 207,000 were GP services and approximately 153,000 were nursing and allied health services.                 In addition, as at the end of May 2011, the 11 operational GP Super Clinics reported approximately 428,000 presentations, including early services, if any, at those sites. Of these presentations, approximately 318,000 were GP services and approximately 110,000 were nursing and allied health services.                  Noting that a number of sites providing early services became operational part way through a reporting period, it is estimated that approximately 57,000 of the 428,000 presentations were early services provided prior to clinics becoming operational. These are estimated to include approximately 47,000 GP services and approximately 10,000 nursing and allied health services.

                 The purpose of the Implementation Study was to advise the government on how best to implement its stated policy objectives, not to evaluate those objectives, given that the policies had already been agreed by the government. The report focused on translating high-level policy objectives into tangible actions for both the government and NBN Co to implement.                  Specifically, the Implementation Study did not:                  evaluate the government's policy objectives;                 evaluate the decision to implement the NBN via the establishment of NBN Co;                  undertake a cost-benefit analysis of the macro-economic and social benefits that would result   from the implementation of a superfast broadband network.

                 (1) Defence is aware of an offer by the Parents' Committee to provide funding to air condition the dormitory. Defence does not generally accept funds from third parties to undertake facilities works on Defence owned buildings. Defence has agreed to fund the purchase and installation of an air conditioning system into the dormitory.                 (2) Defence does not have a copy of the quote obtained by the Parents' Committee but understands that it was for the purchase and installation of off-the-shelf split air-conditioning systems. The Defence cost estimate of $80,000 is for an engineer designed solution that meets the requirements of Commonwealth and Defence building codes that apply to all Defence facilities and are stringently applied to sleeping areas.                 (3) Defence is unaware of the process, design parameters, or compliance requirements that the Parents' Committee may have used to obtain their quotation and is therefore unable to discuss a direct comparison between the Parents' Committee quote and the Defence project costs.                 Defence is required to follow a very prescriptive process through design and procurement to ensure that the designed solution achieves compliance with the Building Code of Australia, Defence fire protection engineering requirements, energy efficiency and environmental regulations, and competitive tendering. Defence needs to ensure maintainability and fitness for purpose for the life of the systems. This discrepancy is assumed to be a result of the differing approach taken by the Parents' Committee.                  (4) The air-conditioning installed in the mess area at Komiatum Barracks was a maintenance upgrade to an existing system not a new installation. This upgrade was part of a separate project for refurbishment of the existing structures at Komiatum Barracks.                 (5) The Komiatum Barracks' dormitory is designed to be cooled with flow through ventilation and ceiling fans. Defence is not aware that the temperature reaches 36 degrees Celsius inside the Komiatum Barracks' dormitory.                  (6) Defence has approved funding and a project to air condition the Komiatum Barracks' dormitory for the financial year 2011-12.                  (7) A procurement process will be undertaken shortly and once a sub-contractor has been identified the purchase of the air conditioners and installation works can commence. The works are planned for delivery in the July to September 2011 quarter.

This includes costs of event management services (including venue and equipment hire, technical staff, filming and onsite editing, security and host fees), forum catering, travel costs for Commissioners and GST.                  (2-3) I understand that the Commission is monitoring emissions generated by its airline travel and will review its total emissions at the end of 2011 to consider options for purchasing appropriate offsets.                 (4) The Commission is an independent body and, as stated in the Commission's Terms of Reference, will not comment on policy matters nor provide policy advice or recommendations.

                 (1) The removal of the polyester uniforms from the cadet block scale was identified as a part of the rationalisation of garrison uniforms which has been undertaken by the Army. The decision was made to remove this uniform due to its infrequent use by Cadets and to reflect the reduction in the overall issue within Army. Cadets are still able to perform ceremonial activities in the standard Disruptive Patterned Camouflaged Uniform (DPCU). Cadets will continue to maintain access to polyester uniforms if requested for specific activities such as representational duties. Each request will be assessed by Army Headquarters on a case by case basis.                 (2) All existing, unused stock will be returned to the supply chain for use by Army.

                 The Government does not provide funding to Malaysia and Indonesia. The Government provides technical assistance to these countries through the provision of training and capacity building activities. Under the Regional Skills Development Program (RSDP) my Department provides training to immigration officials on document examination, intelligence, facial recognition and investigation.                  My Department has also supported the installation of Indonesia's border management system which has delivered sophisticated border management systems to 30 ports in Indonesia to enable reliable detection of people of concern to Indonesian authorities. This work includes the installation of bio-metric technology. My Department has been working with Indonesia since 2006 on this project.                  In 2010 - 11, the Department and the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service provided the Immigration Department of Malaysia with document examination equipment that is being used on a daily basis at the Kuala Lumpur International Airport.

                 The Government's Better Start for Children with Disability program commenced on 1 July 2011. It will help ensure children with disabilities that affect their development have access to early intervention therapies and treatments. Around 9000 children diagnosed with cerebral palsy, Down syndrome, Fragile X syndrome and sight or hearing impairments will be eligible to receive up to $12,000 for early intervention services.                  The categories of disability included in the Better Start initiative were based on existing evidence that targeted early intervention in the preschool years is effective in preparing this cohort of children for school.                   The Parliamentary Secretary for Disability and Carers has asked my Department to seek expert advice about evidence for early intervention in relation to other types of childhood disability and developmental delay, including an analysis of current research. Along with the planned evaluation of Better Start program, this will help inform the future direction of the program, including consideration of extending it more broadly.

                 (1) There is no evidence currently available to the Government which states that in five years time, other than a few specialty bookshops in capital cities, bookstores will cease to exist because of online distribution. However, an unpublished study conducted by PriceWaterhouseCoopers (PwC) on behalf of the Department of Innovation has estimated that up to 24.6 per cent of total book sales could be made online by 2014.                 At the core of my comments was that businesses need to recognise and adapt to the changing marketplace to ensure that they stand out among their competitors. They need to be innovative, develop new niche markets and new business models. Many bookstores are already being proactive and adapting to the digital and online age by building their capacity to sell online and providing the capacity for customers to access digital books in store.                  Bookstores that set themselves apart from their competitors by offering services that are not available online are already cementing their future success. Many bookstores, particularly in regional and rural areas, act as a community hub, offering personal book recommendations and reviews; book clubs; live readings; and author events. Many also contribute to local literacy programs by providing free books to schools, hospitals and other community groups.                 The Government is committed to ensuring that Australia's book industry remains sustainable and thrives in the digital economy. Senator the Hon Kim Carr, Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research formally established the Book Industry Strategy Group (BISG) in April 2010 to address the challenges of the increasingly digital industry. The BISG has undertaken extensive consultations with the public and industry and will present its final report to Minister Carr in September 2011. I congratulate the retail book industry for working closely with the BISG to ensure that retail bookstores adapt to technological change and remain sustainable into the future.                 (a) As stated in response '1' above an unpublished study conducted by PriceWaterhouseCoopers (PwC) on behalf of the Department of Innovation has estimated that up to 24.6 per cent of total book sales could be made online by 2014 but there is no evidence to prove that all of these sales will be transferred from bookstores. Studies in the United States and Europe have provided evidence which show that the growth of e-books, in particular, expand the entire market for books and therefore the impact on print book sales is not proportional to the growth in e-books. However, the full impact of these changes, including the impact of the online sale of printed books is still unknown and unquantified.                  (b) There is no information available that projects and quantifies the number of bookstores that will close down in the next five years.                 (c) There is no information available that projects and quantifies the number of jobs in bookstores that will be lost in the next five years.                 (d) There are no projections on what proportion (as a percentage) of bookstore sales will be lost to online retailers based (i) overseas, and (ii) in Australia from any increase in online sales.                 (2) No.

                 (1) Yes.                 (a) The Department has been concerned about MDGP's financial position since late 2009 as a result of losses incurred in property transactions and business ventures reflected in audited financial statements for MDGP, submitted to the Department under the Divisions of General Practice Program (DGPP) funding agreement. These concerns resulted in a monthly payment and financial reporting regime being instituted for MDGP in 2010.                  (b) The substance of the allegations was ongoing financial problems and inappropriate use of Commonwealth funds.                  (c) A review of MDGP's financial records was undertaken by the Department's Audit and Fraud Control Branch. The review concluded inappropriate allocation of Commonwealth funds. A Debtor Tax Invoice was provided to MDGP for unspent/inappropriately used Commonwealth funds.                 (2) Yes, staff confirmed the Department's concerns.                 As outlined in 1(a), the Department's system for monitoring expenditure had already identified MDGP as a concern and had already put additional monitoring in place.                 (3)                 (a) Funding was suspended as a result of the Department's investigations.                 (b) The Board of MDGP indicated to the Department their intention to cease trading on Friday, 6 May 2011 and recommended that General Practice Queensland (GPQ) would be an appropriate organisation to continue providing Commonwealth funded services which were currently provided by MDGP. The Department and GPQ agreed and entered into a contract with GPQ to assume responsibility for auspicing Commonwealth funded services in the Mackay region.

                 The Request for Tender for the Provision of the Adult Migrant English Program and Related Services was released on 25 November 2009 and closed on 22 February 2010.  The successful tenderers were announced in April 2011.                 The NSW Adult Migrant English Service, under consortium arrangements with the NSW Department of Education and Communities, successfully won contracts in three NSW contract regions: Northern Sydney and Other Rural, Hunter/Newcastle and Illawarra/Wollongong.  They were not selected to provide services in the other NSW contract regions.                 The selection of preferred tenderers was made in line with the principles of Commonwealth procurement policy which include: value for money, the need to encourage competition, ensuring the efficient, effective and ethical use of resources, and consideration of the need for accountability and transparency.  All tender responses were evaluated against publicly advertised evaluation criteria, taking into consideration the technical merit, relative risk, price, and financial viability of each tenderer.

                 (1) All Immigration Detention Centres (IDC), with the exception of Scherger IDC, have X-ray scanners installed. X-ray scanners were installed at most IDCs in 2006. The X-ray scanner at Christmas Island IDC was installed in 2007 and at Curtin IDC in 2011.                 An X-ray scanner will be installed at Scherger IDC in the near future.                 Alternative Places of Detention (APOD) do not have X-ray scanners as they are considered low-risk facilities. Goods entering APODs are manually inspected.                 (2) X-ray scanners are used to scan all items brought into IDCs. This includes items brought into the centre by staff and visitors, mail and commercial deliveries such as food.                  If items are too large to fit through the X-ray scanner they are manually inspected and scanned with a hand held metal detector.                 (3) Official protocols do exist to govern the use of X-ray scanners at detention facilities. These are:                 Ministerial Direction No. 20  -  Powers concerning the entry of visitors to immigration detention centres (Attachment A) can be obtained from the House of Representatives Table Office.                 Ministerial Direction No. 26  -  Screening procedures in relation to immigration detainees (Attachment B) can be obtained from the House of Representatives Table Office.                 Detention Services Manual, PAM 3  -  Chapter 4  -  Communication and visits  -  Screening and inspection powers: Entry to immigration detention centres (Attachment C) can be obtained from the House of Representatives Table Office.                   Detention Services Manual, PAM 3  -  Chapter 8  -  Safety and security  -  Screening of persons in immigration detention (Attachment D) can be obtained from the House of Representatives Table Office.

                 (1) The Australian Government is not responsible for electrical safety. This responsibility lies with state and territory governments. The Department worked closely with state and territory authorities to ensure any issues concerning non-compliance with electrical standards are brought to their attention for appropriate action.                  (2) As part of standard program administration, the Department maintains records of the installer for each solar system installation funded under the Government's solar programs.                  (3) To have been considered eligible for a rebate under the Government's now closed Solar Homes and Communities Plan, solar panel installations must have met stringent safety standards including adherence to Australian Standards and all relevant Commonwealth, state, territory and local government laws and regulations. Program guidelines also required certification by the installer that the installation had met relevant standards, building codes and local council requirements and that they, as the installer, were accredited by the Clean Energy Council (CEC) to install solar panel systems.                 The responsibility for arranging installation and choosing a suitably qualified installer rested with the applicant. Contractual arrangements concerning the installation are made between the applicant and the installer. The Department has no involvement in this arrangement.                 (4) The Department has been advised that the Electrical Safety Office (Queensland) conducted inspections of solar installations at the Parkhaven Garden Retirement Village and shut down all systems found to have incorrectly wired DC circuit breakers. The Department has been advised that all systems found non-compliant due to incorrectly wired DC circuit breakers have now been rectified by a CEC accredited installer.                   (5) The Government is not responsible for electrical safety or the rectification of technical faults associated with installations of solar systems. Any issues concerning faulty parts or an incorrect or incomplete installation are reported to the appropriate state or territory authority and the CEC. If a satisfactory outcome is unable to be reached through these avenues, the householder's remaining option is to engage an accredited installer, at their cost, to have the outstanding issues rectified.

                 (1) Total administered funding currently allocated for the Reward for School Improvement initiative from 2010-11 to 2014-15 is $252.094 million.                 (2) The administered funding allocated for each year is as follows:                                   In line with the Government's announcements, it is intended that $86.250 million in funding for reward payments will be available each year for 2015-16 and 2016-17, totalling $172.500 million outside the current forward estimates.                 (3) As part of the Government's agreement with independent MPs, of the total $388 million in reward payments to be made available through the Reward for School Improvement program, at least $125 million will go to schools in regional Australia, defined as schools located in all Australian Standard Geographical Classification  -  Remoteness Areas except RA1-major cities.

                 As referred to in the answer to HQIW 178 (b), the downstream capacity of a Gigabit Passive Optical Network (GPON) link is expected to be 2.488Gbps. This capacity is available and is shared dynamically amongst the connected users active at any point in time. Addition of an end user to a link does not assign a specific 'block' of capacity to that user. NBN design rules ensure there is sufficient flexibility so that all end-users can access the bandwidth ordered via their RSP. Should demand for aggregate bandwidth amongst end users connected to a GPON link prove likely to exceed link capacity, the design of the NBN allows the option to reallocate end users to another link.

                   On 23 June 2011 the Australian Government announced that it had entered into an agreement with Telstra for the ongoing delivery of the Universal Service Obligation for voice and payphone services and other public interest services. At this time the Government also provided detail on the new arrangements through the release of a policy statement, Universal Service Policy in the National Broadband Network Environment, available at the Department of Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy website.                    The residual costs that will be met by industry are the costs of the Telecommunications Universal Service Management Agency, or TUSMA (previously referred to as USO                   Co), minus the Government                   '                   s dedicated funding. These costs will include the costs of agreements with Telstra and NRS providers that will be managed by the CEO of the TUSMA in accordance with the proposed TUSMA legislation.                   As outlined in the policy statement, the agreement with Telstra will cost approximately $290                   million annually (for the delivery of the standard telephone service USO, the payphones USO, and the Emergency Call Service), plus costs relating to migration of voice-only customers from the copper network to the fibre network, and costs if necessary for developing technological solutions for public interest services (public alarm systems and traffic lights).                   To facilitate the smooth transition to the new arrangements the Government and Telstra have agreed to interim funding arrangements for the first two financial years to provide certainty to industry. This interim arrangement will mean the aggregate levy contribution that is made by telecommunications firms other than Telstra will, for the first two years, remain at the amount non                   -                   Telstra contributors are assessed as being required to contribute under the USO and NRS schemes for the 2011 - 12 period                   .                    As part of the announcement the Government also stated that it will review the industry levy arrangements and the need for any additional Budget funding, over and above the Government's committed base funding, during the course of the first two financial years of the Telecommunication Universal Service Management Agency's operation.

The Telecommunications Universal Service Management Agency, or TUSMA (previously referred to as USO                   Co), will not be directly responsible for operating or maintaining telecommunications networks.                   As outlined in the Government                   '                   s policy statement,                    Universal Service Policy in the National Broadband Network Environment                   , the TUSMA will administer the agreement with Telstra, which requires Telstra to deliver the standard telephone service universal service obligation (the STS USO). The agreement also requires Telstra to continue to operate its copper network in areas outside of NBN Co                   '                   s fibre footprint for 20 years. Under the agreement Telstra will be paid $230                   million annually (not indexed to CPI) for the delivery of the STS USO. The policy statement also notes that payments may vary if standards or requirements are changed, or if cost savings are identified.

It should be noted that a turnover of some 240 rainfall stations in a network of some 7000 such stations during this period equates to an annual turnover of around one percent per annum. The number of new stations opened was about the same as the number that ceased reporting so the overall network was held at close to the same size.

Service with the Enhanced Co-operation Program (ECP) in Papua New Guinea between 2004 and 2005 was deemed as a capacity building mission and not a peacekeeping mission. Subsequently, members who participated in the program are not entitled to the POSM. There are currently no awards within the Australian Honours system for police officers serving overseas in a capacity building role. AFP members may be nominated and receive awards under the AFP's Internal Awards Framework.

                 Yes. Defence is examining pelvic and groin protection equipment as part of a broad program responsible for the development and delivery of a new soldier combat ensemble that includes body armour, load carriage systems and personal protection equipment.                  The Modular Combat Body Armour System issued to some personnel deployed to the Middle East, Timor Leste and Solomon Island areas of operations includes an add-on groin protection apron. This can be worn when required and on the direction of in-theatre commanders                 With the roll out of the Tiered Body Armour System, other options to improve pelvic and groin protection are being acquired and further investigated. Defence has begun a trial of a tiered pelvic protection system currently used by the British Army in Afghanistan. The first tier is a light weight garment that is worn as protective underwear. It is designed to help protect the groin areas from the fine dirt and shrapnel particles that result from explosions. Personnel in Afghanistan will be issued with this protective underwear by November this year. Sufficient stocks are being procured to issue to the next rotation of troops occurring in early 2012.                 The second tier is a heavier and more rigid ballistic groin protection system worn on the outside of the combat uniform and is designed to provide increased protection against larger shrapnel fragments. It can be worn together with the protective underwear or separately. A small number have been purchased and will be provided to Mentoring Task Force Three this month as part of a trial to obtain user feedback on the performance and ability to integrate with the current soldier combat ensemble.                  Based on results of the trial, a wider acquisition of pelvic protection systems is likely to be conducted                 .

                 The Group Rent Scheme (GRS) (including rent allowance, Service residence and living-in accommodation) member contributions are reviewed annually and adjusted in line with the increase in the cost of Defence housing assistance. It is a long standing policy that Defence should subsidise 50 per cent of the national cost of housing for Australian Defence Force members and their families with members meeting the remaining 50 per cent.                 In past years the level of subsidy provided by Defence has increased due to greater than expected fluctuations in the Australian housing market and in 2009 the Defence subsidy was at 56.53 per cent. In the same year, the CDF and Secretary committed to a subsidy correction program to return the Defence subsidy to 50 per cent. In 2010, Rent Bands 4 and 51 were adjusted to achieve the 50 per cent subsidy and in 2011 Rent Bands 2 and 3 achieved 50 per cent subsidy. It is anticipated that the final subsidisation for Rent Band 1 (currently at 53.32 per cent) will be corrected in 2012.                  The GRS updates broadly reflect the annual market rent cost changes faced by the wider Australian community.                 (a) The amount payable for Service residences (married quarters) has changed once every year since 2001. The proportion of change as a percentage for specified contributions for:                 (i) Service Residences for Members with Dependants;                 (ii) Service Residences for Members without Dependants 'not sharing'; and                 (iii) Service Residences for Members without Dependants 'sharing'                 are provided in the table at Attachment A can be obtain from the House of Representatives Table Office.                 (b) The amount payable for rent allowance has changed once every year since 2001. The proportion of change as a percentage for specified contribution for rent allowance for:                 (i) Members with Dependants; and                 (ii) Members without Dependants                 are provided in the table at Attachment B can be obtain from the House of Representatives Table Office.                 The amount payable for Living-in Accommodation has changed 12 times since 2001. The contribution is based on rank, sharing arrangements and the level of accommodation. The proportion of change for these figures are set out in the table at Attachment C can be obtain from the House of Representatives Table Office.                 __________________                   1 Rent Band 1  -  PTE to LT (excluding WO2 and WO1) Equivalent                   Rent Band 2  -  WO2, WO1 and CAPT Equivalent                   Rent Band 3  -  MAJ and LTCOL Equivalent                   Rent Band 4  - COL and BRIG Equivalent                   Rent Band 5  -  MAJGEN and above Equivalent

                 (1) Defence is not charging the Department of Immigration and Citizenship (DIAC) rent for the use of the 81 Defence owned houses at Inverbrackie, South Australia. A Handover/Takeover Plan is in the final stages of development between Defence and DIAC from which a Memorandum of Understanding will be developed. DIAC will be responsible for maintenance, refurbishment and utility costs associated with these properties.                 (2) As these houses are not at the required standard for housing ADF families, they would not be sold to Defence Housing Australia. The notional value of the sum of these houses is between $29 - 32 million, based on the median house prices in the Inverbrackie area.                 (3) While these houses remain on Defence land they would not be leased to the public. The estimated rental costs for houses in the Inverbrackie area as provided by Defence's Property Services Consultants, United Group Limited, are:                 (a) approximately $310 - $320 per week (average rent of $16,300 per annum) for a three bedroom house; and                  (b) approximately $330 - $350 per week (average rent of $17,700 per annum) for a four bedroom house.

                   (a)                    The Queensland Department of Education and Training (QDET) has advised that:                   There is no single contract for the                    National School Pride                    (NSP) project. Total funding for the NSP project at this school is $75,000 and it is recorded as financially acquitted.                   The value of the building contract associated with the                    Primary Schools for the 21st Century                    (P21) project is $561,000 (ex GST). This price does not include costs such as design fees, contract management fees, fire and rescue inspections, OH&amp;S auditor and Geotechnical investigations, site services including upgrades, furniture, fittings, network hardware and wireless equipment. The approved P21 amount for this project is $850,000 and the last reported spend is $832,915.                   The Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations (the Department) does not hold details of the contracts as the Commonwealth was not party to them.                   (b)                    The                   NSP project                    was completed on 29 January 2010                   The                   P21 project achieved practical completion on 24                   November                   2010.                    (c)                    There have been no scope variations from QDET to the Department for these projects.                   (d)                    Payments to state education authorities under the BER are made according to payment schedules within the bilateral funding agreements                   .                    Payments are not made to education authorities based on progress at an individual project level. It is the responsibility of each state education authority to manage payments at an individual project level. The amount of funds spent against each project is reported on a monthly basis to the Commonwealth.                   Total spend against the NSP project is currently reported as $75,000. The final acquittal is yet to occur.                   The P21 project achieved practical completion on 24                   November                   2010 and has not yet been acquitted. As at 31 May 2011, the total spend against this project is reported as $832,915. To achieve practical completion, the building must have a Certificate of Classification which is a requirement of the Queensland Building Act  -  this certificate can only be issued by a Building Certifier.

                 (1) The Regional Sponsored Migration Scheme (RSMS) allows employers operating in regional and low population growth areas to sponsor skilled workers to fill full-time vacancies in their business. Applicants gain permanent residence through this scheme.                  My department uses the Australian and New Zealand Standard Classification of Occupations (ANZSCO) framework to identify the skill levels required for the appointments nominated under the RSMS. The ANZSCO is skill-based and classifies all occupations and jobs in the Australian and New Zealand labour markets. Occupations are organised into five skill levels:                 Skill level 1 occupations require skills commensurate with a bachelor degree or higher qualification;                 Skill level 2 occupations require skills commensurate with an Australian Qualification Framework (AQF) associate degree, advanced diploma or diploma;                 Skill level 3 occupations require skills commensurate with an AQF Certificate IV or an AQF Certificate III including at least two years of on-the-job training;                 Skill level 4 occupations require skills commensurate with an AQF Certificate II or III;                 Skill level 5 occupations are considered 'semi-skilled and require an AQF Certificate I or compulsory secondary education.                   According to legislation, the work to be performed under the RSMS must warrant the appointment of a person with a qualification equivalent to an Australian diploma or higher. This means that occupations classified as skill level 1 or 2 under ANZSCO meet the RSMS skill requirement and are considered 'normal appointments'. If an occupation is classified as skill level 3 or 4, the nomination may still be approved but only if the nominating employer can demonstrate that the appointment is exceptional.                  Under policy, occupations with a corresponding skill level of 5 are considered insufficiently skilled for RSMS purposes. In these cases, the Labour Agreement program is a better pathway for employers seeking to engage foreign skilled workers to fill these occupations. Where a specific labour market shortage is identified or is emerging, a company or an industry body can negotiate an arrangement with the government to bring in overseas workers to fill this shortage.                 The occupations identified by Mr Christensen are classified as skill level 2, 3 or 4 in the ANZSCO framework as follows:                                   According to ANZSCO and the RSMS nomination regulations, hotel and motel managers and hospitality managers can access the program and will be considered normal appointments because they are skill level 2. The occupations of sail guides, outdoor activity leaders, retail shift supervisors and aged carers are classified as skill level 3 or 4 and their nomination may be approved if the employer can demonstrate that the appointment is exceptional.                  (2) Where a business seeks to nominate a skill level 3 or 4 occupation, the employer must demonstrate that the appointment is 'exceptional' for it to be approved under RSMS. Departmental officers consider the following elements when assessing the exceptional nature of an appointment:                 Whether the nominee has already gained experience working with the business in the occupation over the past two years while holding a Temporary Business Long Stay (subclass 457) visa;                  How the nominated position differs from other similar positions. This could include the location of the business and related labour market challenges or the nature of the position and its importance to the continued growth of the business; and                 The criteria set out in Regulation 5.19(4) of the Migration Regulations must be met.                  Time spent by a nominee working in the nominated position on a subclass 457 visa serves as proof that there is a genuine need for the occupation and supports the 'exceptional' nature of the appointment under the RSMS. It also supports the view that the subclass 457 visa offers a pathway to permanent residence through the RSMS.                 The subclass 457 visa is a very successful program and the one most commonly used for employers to sponsor overseas workers to work in Australia on a temporary basis. It provides streamlined entry arrangements for employers needing to fill skill shortages that cannot be met from the local labour market.                  As such, removal of the subclass 457 requirement when assessing exceptional appointment for skill level 3 and 4 occupations is not being considered. Employers who cannot satisfy this requirement are encouraged to explore alternative options, such as through the subclass 457 program, labour agreements or the upcoming Regional Migration Agreements (RMAs). RMAs are a new initiative announced as part of the Budget 2011-12 and will be custom-designed for high growth regional areas where local labour is in short supply. As such, they will set out the occupations and the numbers of overseas workers needed in negotiated areas. They will also allow concessions for semi-skilled overseas workers where there is a demonstrable and critical labour need.                    I would also like to advise the honourable member that my department is currently conducting a review of the permanent employer sponsored visa program, which includes the RSMS                   .                    As part of the review my department will be running a comprehensive public consultation process, which will include the release of a discussion paper                   .                    Members of the public, including the honourable member and his constituents, are encouraged to provide their feedback on the permanent employer sponsored visas programs through this process.

                 Patients in Campbelltown already have access to Medicare-eligible MRI services at the unit located at the Campbelltown Private Hospital.                 In addition, it was announced in the Budget that a second MRI unit in Campbelltown will be granted Medicare eligibility for some Medicare items from 1 November 2012.                 Further, Campbelltown Hospital's MRI unit has also been identified as a unit that may be granted partial Medicare eligibility for some Medicare items from 1 November 2012. The new MRI unit at Campbelltown Hospital, a 2010 election commitment, is already in place and is being used to provide services to inpatients. The Government provided over $3 million for the new MRI machine and other equipment for Campbelltown hospital.                 The Department of Health and Ageing is working with providers, including the Campbelltown Hospital, where more information is required to determine eligibility for their machine. The final list of Medicare-eligible MRI units will be available in the near future.                 These additional licences for Medicare eligibility for MRI units are part of the 2011-12 Budget measure to expand patient access to MRI services by increasing the number of units where patients are able to receive a Medicare rebate, and allowing GPs to refer patients for certain conditions without needing to see a specialist first.                 Further details about the reforms can be found at:                 http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/pathol-di-mri-index

                  (a) The States and Territories are responsible for delivering emergency warning messages to their communities and the means by which these messages are delivered. The Commonwealth does not determine which warning mechanisms or systems are adopted or tested by States and Territories, as they are best placed to determine their needs.                 At its April 2009 meeting, the Council of Australian Governments (COAG) agreed to take immediate steps to enhance Australia's natural disaster arrangements through the development of a telephone-based emergency warning system. The Emergency Alert system enables participating States and Territories to deliver warnings to landline and mobile telephones based on the subscriber's address. The COAG decision to prioritise the implementation of a location-based mobile telephone warning capability recognises that most Australians use and have access to mobile telephones. In 2009, the Commonwealth Government committed $26.3 million to assist States and Territories develop this capability.                 In relation to the delivery of emergency services over radio data systems, Australian public safety agencies currently use, and will for the foreseeable future, radio networks for their mission critical voice communications. These networks are built to high standards and have been 'hardened' to withstand the rigours of various emergency situations and natural disasters. In December 2009 COAG endorsed the National Coordinating Committee for Government Radiocommunications (NCCGR) National Framework to Improve Government Radiocommunications Interoperability to enhance radiocommunications interoperability for public protection and disaster relief by 2020. The Commonwealth Government is working with the NCCGR in its efforts to implement the Framework.                  On 10 May 2011, the Commonwealth Government convened a roundtable discussion with key public safety stakeholders to examine the issue of public safety mobile broadband. As a result, the Commonwealth Government established the Public Safety Mobile Broadband Steering Committee to investigate the mobile broadband communications requirements of public safety agencies, which includes a potential allocation of radio-frequency spectrum from the  800 MHz spectrum band. The Committee anticipates providing a final report on this matter to the Standing Council for Police and Emergency Management by 29 February 2012.                  (b) See (a)                 (c) You may be aware that a Senate Inquiry into [T]he capacity of communication networks and emergency warning systems to deal with emergencies and natural disasters is expected to report on 2 November 2011 on this matter. My Department provided a written submission to, and appeared before, the Inquiry. Those records are publically available.

                  (1) Recruitment advertisements for the positions in the International Trade Remedies Branch appeared in:                 (a) national papers on Friday 8 July and Saturday 9 July 2011;                 (b) the APS Jobs website on Thursday 7 July 2011; and                 (c) the Customs and Border Protection e-Recruitment online system on Thursday 7 July 2011.                 The closing date for all applications was 24 July 2011. Applications were received from individuals from a range of backgrounds, including industry, private sector, and government.                  (2) (a) It is essential that staff members involved in anti-dumping investigations are qualified across a range of key skill areas, including accountancy. Skilled accountants are required to 'forensically' delve into often complicated overseas company accounts to ensure the veracity of data that is produced. The recent job advertisements have focussed on recruiting further staff with qualifications in, and experience as, accountants to supplement the current International Trade Remedies Branch staff who, as at 26 July 2011, have tertiary qualifications in accounting.                 (b) As at 26 July 2011 ten International Trade Remedies Branch staff members have foreign language skills. However, it is not practicable to require staff in the International Trade Remedies Branch to have all of the language proficiencies that reflect those spoken in the wide range of countries against which anti-dumping applications may be made. The International Trade Remedies Branch will also continue to use interpreters as required in anti-dumping investigations                 (3) (a) Budgeted funding across the forward estimates to employ the 14 additional staff is $7.3 million including salary and on-costs.                 (b) Budgeted funding across the forward estimates for independent experts totals $1.045 million. Actual expenditure on independent experts will be dependent on the number and complexity of anti-dumping applications received by the International Trade Remedies Branch.                 (4) The Government announced in a media release on 22 June 2011 that the International Trade Remedies Forum (ITRF) would be comprised of representatives of manufacturers, producers and importers as well as industry associations, trade unions and relevant Government agencies. The Government is currently considering the composition of the ITRF and how it will operate.                  (5) The Australian Government has provided funding for a pilot program for the employment of the Small and Medium Enterprise Support Officer (SSO) totalling $367,000 over the forward estimates. These costs are based on a 1 January 2012 commencement date for the SSO. Should the successful candidate for the SSO position be able to commence prior to 1 January 2012, the total costs for this position will be adjusted accordingly.

                 The Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (AHPRA) is an independent statutory agency which administers the receipt and processing of applications for registration and maintains a public register of registered health practitioners.                 AHPRA began operating on 1 July 2010 and a number of individuals and organisations have experienced problems with AHPRA's communication processes, documentation, and processing times for applicants during the transition to the new arrangement. AHPRA continues to make changes to improve and streamline its procedures and my Department is working with AHPRA's management to assist in this process.                  On 17 February 2011, Health Ministers agreed to provide additional support and expertise to assist AHPRA and AHPRA will be required to report to future meetings of Health Ministers.                 AHPRA has advised that the recent renewal of registration of close to 320,000 health practitioners in May and June went very smoothly, with up to 98% of practitioners renewing on time. The majority of the practitioners due to renew in May and June were nurses and midwives around Australia.                 The Medical Board of Australia has advised that there are around 65,000 medical practitioners due to renew their medical registration by 30 September 2011. AHPRA has taken extra steps to remind practitioners of their obligations to renew. After posting the initial renewal reminder notice, AHPRA issues additional reminders including updates on websites, emails (where AHPRA has email contact details), SMS messaging, board newsletters, briefings to professional groups and media promotion. AHPRA also writes to practitioners who do not renew their registration on time, warning them that their registration will lapse after a one month 'late period'.

                 (1) Each year, smoking kills 15,000 Australians and costs Australia $31.5 billion.  Approximately three million Australians still smoke regularly.  The Australian Government is committed to reducing smoking rates to 10 per cent by 2018. To achieve this, the Australian Government has subsidised a range of smoking cessation aids and nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) products (including nicotine patches) on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme.  Although there are risks associated with the use of any product containing nicotine, due to the harm to public health associated with tobacco smoking, the Australian Government supports the broad availability of NRT products to help the public to quit smoking.                 (2) Yes.                 (3) Yes.                 (4) The Australian Government believes that it is in the interests of all Australians wanting to quit smoking to be able to access NRT products as quickly and easily as possible.  The more widely available the products are, the more beneficial to those smokers who have decided to quit or who are contemplating quitting.  Since 2004, a range of NRT products have been available from supermarkets and other retail outlets.  These include NRT products in the form of chewing gum, lozenges, transdermal patches and sublingual tablets.

                 (1) (a) Pensioners and concession card holders can access the Chronic Disease Dental Scheme (CDDS) and the Medicare Teen Dental Plan (MTDP) if they meet the eligibility criteria.  It is not possible to link information about pensioners and concession card holders who access these Commonwealth programs with public dental waiting list information.  Public dental waiting lists are managed by state and territory governments and questions about them are best directed to the relevant state or territory government.                 (b) In 2008-09, 2,381,277 services were provided under the CDDS and 459,691 preventative dental checks provided under the MTDP.                 (2) The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) undertakes a National Survey of Adult Oral Health.  The results are analysed by a number of socio-demographic characteristics, including eligibility for public dental care.  As the last National Survey of Adult Oral Health occurred between 2004 and 2006, data is not available on the periods of CDDS and MTDP operation as these programs commenced in 2007 and 2008 respectively.  A future National Survey of Adult Oral Health has not been scheduled to date.                 (3) The Gillard Government has announced its intention to close the CDDS in order to make funding available for the introduction of the Commonwealth Dental Health Program (CDHP).  The CDHP would provide additional public dental services for pensioners and concession cardholders.  An evaluation of the CDDS has therefore not been undertaken.                 As required by legislation, a review of the operation of the Dental Benefits Act 2008 (the Act), which sets up the MTDP, was conducted shortly after the first anniversary of the commencement of the Act.  The Report on the Review of the Dental Benefits Act 2008 was tabled in Parliament on 15 March 2010.  The Review committee found that the introduction of the MTDP has been successful, and utilisation of vouchers was highest in metropolitan areas while bulk billing rates were highest in areas of relatively greater disadvantage and remote areas.  The report is publicly available at: http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/Dental_Report_on_the_Review_of_the_Dental_Benefits_Act_2008                 Information on benefits paid and services provided under the CDDS and MTDP is available to the community on the Medicare Australia website.                 (4) Each state and territory is responsible for public dental services, including the management of patient arrangements for appointments and waiting times.  Questions about public dental services are best directed to the relevant state or territory government.                 (5) Co-payments form part of existing state and territory arrangements for public dental care, including the provision of dentures.  These arrangements vary between state and territories.  Co-payment charges for public dental services are a matter for each state and territory government.

                 (1) Yes. Depending on the application, transit capacity is required to connect from the NBN Point of Interconnect (POI) to other parts of the internet. The cost of this connectivity is the responsibility of the retail service provider.                 (2) The cost of this capacity is the responsibility of the retail service provider.                  (3) NBN Co considered a range of inputs when developing the wholesale costs for the NBN, including the prices in the ACCC's Declared Transmission Capacity Services Interim Access Determination. Whilst NBN Co can model a number of likely cost scenarios, it cannot know precisely all retail service provider's costs as these will depend on a range of commercial choices made by the RSP.

                 The question relates to the carriage of alerts via the short message system (SMS), with a supplement being via an L or S band transponder on the National Broadband Network satellite. The ACMA advises that there is no planned L or S band transponder on the NBN filing and notes that it has not had discussions with NBN Co. Limited on this issue. The ACMA advises that the management of emergency alerts is a matter for the Attorney-General's Department.

                 The Australian Government understands the importance of mobile telephony to Australians, in particular in emergency situations.                  In recent years the mobile phone carriers have significantly expanded their terrestrial mobile networks. Vodafone Hutchison Australia claims its networks currently cover more than 94 per cent of the Australian population. Optus claims its 3G network provides services to 97 per cent of the Australian population. Telstra claims its Next G network now provides mobile coverage to 99 per cent of Australians.                 For the most part the recent extension of mobile coverage across Australia has been based on commercial decisions by carriers. In making a decision to extend coverage to a particular area, carriers will consider a range of factors, including site availability, cost structures, likely levels of demand from users and overall economic viability of the service.                 Local governments can assist in identifying potential demand for mobile services in the area. Information such as projections of population growth, visitors to the region and records of traffic volumes can be helpful in assisting carriers to make informed decisions about whether to extend coverage to certain areas.                 There are a number of factors that can interfere with mobile reception and, therefore, affect a user's ability to obtain or maintain a mobile phone signal at any given time or in any particular place. These factors include mountainous or hilly terrain, road cuttings, buildings and tunnels. While not all potential sources of interference can be overcome, service providers should be able to advise of ways to minimise interference.                 I understand there is unreliable mobile phone reception in the Bowling Green Bay National Park.                  In areas where no terrestrial mobile coverage exists, satellite mobile phones provide an alternative means of accessing communications. Satellite phones are not as reliant on the local power supply infrastructure and are more reliable than ground based systems during an emergency. Satellite mobile phone services cover the entire Australian landmass and are available from a number of providers.                 Residents of Alligator Creek may be eligible to apply for a subsidy under the Satellite Phone Subsidy Scheme. The scheme improves the affordability of mobile communications for people living and working in areas without terrestrial mobile coverage, by providing subsidies for the purchase of satellite phone handsets.                  The scheme provides up to $1000 for eligible applicants who live in areas without terrestrial mobile coverage or up to $700 for eligible applicants who live in areas that have coverage, but spend more than 180 days across a two year period in non-coverage areas.                  Under the scheme's rules, those eligible to apply include individuals, small businesses, community groups, not-for-profit organisations, Indigenous corporations, emergency service organisations, health organisations and educational institutions.                 Information on the scheme is available from the Department of Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy website at www.dbcde.gov.au/satphone. An information kit can be obtained by contacting the scheme administrator on 1800 674 058 or via email at satphone@dbcde.gov.au.                  An alternative to telephone communications is the use of distress beacon units, such as Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacons (EPIRBs) or Personal Locator Beacons (PLBs). These devices are designed to assist in an emergency by alerting rescue authorities and indicating location. More recent models in corporate Global Positioning Satellite (GPS) technology, enabling much more accurate determination of the location compared with earlier models.                  These devices are not as limited by terrain as mobile phones and, by providing the location, will speed up any rescue effort. A variety of providers around Australia offer these for sale or hire.                 Other technologies that could operate in areas without terrestrial mobile coverage include Citizens Band or ultra-high frequency (UHF) radio. It is important to be aware that these technologies cannot connect to the telephone network.

                 The Government and NBN Co are aware that all telecommunications platforms are potentially susceptible to catastrophic weather events, such as cyclones. In developing the Ka-band satellite platform, NBN Co is also working to develop strategies to minimize disturbances caused by such events.                 The C-band currently supports a number of uses including fixed wireless and satellite services. As such, there are a number of arrangements already in place to allow services to share this spectrum band.                 In May 2011, the Australian Communications and Media Authority outlined that, while under consideration, the C-band is not yet formally included as a potential band for mobile broadband. However, it is standard ACMA procedure for any band replanning activity to take into consideration many factors including the operation of existing services and would involve consultation with interested stakeholders prior to any new arrangements being adopted.

                 To provide the detailed information sought on overseas delegation visits would entail a significant diversion of resources requiring input from all departments and agencies and all overseas posts.  I do not consider the additional work can be justified.

                 It is not possible to provide authoritative and reliable information in response to these questions.                 I am advised that PNG authorities do not aggregate data on cases of alleged corruption. Therefore, there is no accurate information available from PNG to answer these questions. International organisations and their affiliates, such as Transparency International and Transparency International PNG Inc, provide general assessments of corruption related activity in PNG. However, detailed case information is not available.                 In March 2010, the PNG Government tabled an 800-page Commission of Inquiry report on the management of public monies by the PNG Department of Finance.  The Commission of Inquiry concluded that statutory processes had been grossly abused allowing improper claims for payment to be made on the State, and excessive payouts to be legitimised, over the investigation period of 2000 to 2006. However, corruption covers a range of offences wider than the misuse of public money covered in the Commission of Inquiry report.

                 (1) Documents in the possession of the Department of Defence, including personnel records, in relation to Australian Defence Force members and Defence employees can be sought under subpoena or summons issued by a Court or Tribunal or under a statutory Notice to Produce. The type of documents that can be sought under subpoena, summons or statutory notice to produce in respect of Australian Defence Force members include health records such as a member's medical assessments, psychological assessments and counselling interviews and records.                 Subsection 138(2) of the Defence Force Discipline Act 1982 (Cth) allows the Registrar of Military Justice to issue a summons ordering production of documents held by the Department of Defence for the purposes of a proceeding before a service tribunal. Summonses under subsection 138(2) can be issued at the request of either a defending officer or a prosecutor in the particular proceeding.                 However, no medical assessments, psychological assessments, or counselling interviews and records, were subpoenaed or seized by either civilian or military prosecutors or other legal authorities as part of the general court martial proceedings brought against Sergeant J and Lance Corporal D in relation to the 12 February 2009 Civilian Casualty Incident in Afghanistan.                 (2) Consistent with the Privacy Act 1988, access to information from health records of Australian Defence Force members may also be given to Service police engaged in the investigation of a service offence under the Defence Force Discipline Act.                  There is a Defence Instruction (General) which addresses the privacy of health information in Defence and, among other things, sets out the process for the Service Police to request access to health information of Defence members. This process includes criteria which are to be taken into account by an investigator in deciding to make request and a process to make the request. This process does not allow Service Police unlimited access to health information, such as psychological records, of members of the Defence Force. In effect the only information accessible by Service Police is information that serves a legitimate forensic purpose in respect of a particular Defence Force Discipline Act investigation.                  During the investigation of possible service offences arising from 12 February 2009 Civilian Casualty Incident in Afghanistan, the Australian Defence Force Investigative Service (ADFIS) requested access to the psychological records of Sergeant J and Lance Corporal D in accordance with the guidance contained in the Defence Instruction. In requesting these records, ADFIS determined they were pertinent to the pursuit of an authorised Defence Force Discipline Act investigation and limited their request to documents concerning the deployment of these members to Afghanistan and to any subsequent treatment that could be related to their deployment. Relevant psychological records of both members were subsequently included in the ADFIS Brief of Evidence provided to military prosecutors.

                 (1) Australia Post has advised that the Licensee at Bucasia is seeking to relocate the Licensed Post Office (LPO) to a new shopping centre in the neighbouring suburb of Eimeo in March 2012.  Australia Post is supporting the relocation of the LPO for the following reasons:                 the lease on the current LPO premises expires in March 2012 and there is no option to extend;                 the current LPO premises are cramped and unable to cater for storage of carded articles and parcels;                 customer numbers in Bucasia are declining and relocating the LPO to alternative premises in Bucasia would not provide sufficient opportunity for growth;                 the Licensee wants to address declining customer numbers and to make postal services available to more residents in the Mackay area; and                 the proposed location for the LPO is the focal point for the Northern Beaches area of Mackay and will allow a strong postal business to develop.                 (2) No.  As a Government Business Enterprise, Australia Post is responsible for the day-to-day running of the organisation, which includes making decisions about the opening, closing and relocating of postal outlets.  Australia Post has advised that it invited more than 350 local residents to a community meeting on 29 June 2011 to discuss the proposed relocation of the LPO and seek feedback.  The 13 residents who attended the meeting were advised a large proportion of Bucasia residents already travel to other areas for work and shopping and, consequently, use the postal services in those areas.  The street posting boxes will be retained in Bucasia so local residents can continue to post their mail.  The proposed location for the LPO is easily accessible by bus and will have dedicated parking for LPO customers.

                 The broad framework for the management of public money and property is contained within the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997 which includes the requirement that agency Chief Executives manage agencies' affairs in a way that promotes the efficient, effective and ethical use of Commonwealth resources.                 Investment policies are the responsibility of the relevant investment bodies, subject to the legislation applying to these bodies.  For example, the Commonwealth Superannuation Corporation, which is the consolidated trustee board for Commonwealth superannuation schemes, details its environmental, social and governance practices on its website (http://www.aria.gov.au/about/governance/esg.html).                 The Future Fund Act 2006 sets out the main objective of the Fund, which is to enhance the Commonwealth's ability to discharge unfunded superannuation liabilities.                 The Government expresses its broad expectations for the investments and management of the Future Fund through the issuance of Investment Mandate Directions (the Investment Mandate).  The Investment Mandate was issued by the previous government in 2006.                 The Government is committed to ensuring that the investment activities of the Future Fund Board of Guardians (the Board) remain independent of Government and for this reason does not interfere in its investment decisions.  This is in the best interest of the tax payer.                 The Board has a Statement of Investment Policies for the governance and management of the Future Fund.  This is a public document and the current version is available on the Future Fund website (www.futurefund.gov.au) under 'Investment'.                 Among other matters included in its Statement of Investment Policies, the Future Fund has made it clear that it expects to consider investments across a wide variety of economic activities, provided they are legal in Australia and do not contravene international conventions to which Australia is a signatory.

                 (1) Yes. Notwithstanding the US Department of Agriculture export statistics, the United States (US) Government has publicly confirmed that no US-sourced cattle, or fresh, chilled or frozen US beef has been exported to Australia since December 2003.                 Australian official import statistics are the source of information on beef imports on which the Australian Government relies. These are based on documentation accompanying product cleared at the border. This is supported by import permit information held by the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service.                 (2) Australia has not imported beef from cattle slaughtered in the US after December 2003.                 There are valid import permits for beef that is processed in the US, but only where the beef is sourced from the following approved countries: Australia, New Zealand, Brazil, Argentina, and Uruguay. Australia's import permits for these beef products set stringent conditions to ensure that beef from approved countries does not co-mingle in the production process with beef from the US.                 (3) The Government will not permit the importation of BSE contaminated beef from any country.                 (4) Australia has not imported beef from cattle slaughtered in the US after December 2003.                 Under Australia's new BSE policy for imported beef, countries that have had one or more cases of BSE in their cattle herd (such as the US) can apply to be assessed for access to Australia's beef market. Applications to import beef will be assessed by Australian authorities under two procedures  -  a food safety risk assessment by Food Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ) and an import risk analysis (IRA) by Biosecurity Australia for animal health issues.                 Biosecurity Australia commenced a regulated IRA of all animal health issues (not just BSE) for beef and beef products from the US on 8 April 2010. Work on the IRA for beef and beef products from the US was paused on 4 February 2011 pending the US providing complete information on its cattle health status, beef production, inspection and certification systems. As at August 2011, this information has still not been provided.                 FSANZ commenced a BSE food safety risk assessment in August 2010. Completion of the US assessment is on hold pending an in-country inspection of US beef production systems at a date yet to be agreed with the US authorities.

                  The Australian Government is aware of the Australian Red Cross' proposal to publicly support and advocate for an international convention to prohibit the use of nuclear weapons.                   Australia is a steadfast supporter of nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament, including through support for the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, the International Atomic Energy Agency and the multilateral United Nations disarmament machinery. The Government is firmly committed to the goal of a world free of nuclear weapons. The international community may need to explore possible legal frameworks for the eventual abolition of nuclear weapons, such as the convention proposed by the Australian Red Cross, as prospects for multilateral disarmament improve. The Government places priority on promoting: an immediate start to negotiation of a Fissile Material Cut-off Treaty; entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty; stronger international nuclear safeguards, particularly through universalisation of the International Atomic Energy Agency Additional Protocol; and greater transparency in nuclear disarmament reporting. The Government sees these measures as collectively contributing to nuclear non-proliferation and to achieving the goal of a world free of nuclear weapons.

                 (1) (a) Neither a restricted nor an open tender for the DECO replacement IT system were conducted. A feasibility study has been conducted by the Defence Chief Information Officer Group and it is intended that the Request for Tender will proceed in the upcoming weeks.                 (b) Neither a restricted nor an open tender for the DECO replacement IT system were conducted. IBM Australia Limited were approached to submit a quote for the DECO replacement IT which was not accepted. The Defence Chief Information Officer Group will be proceeding to Request for Tender in the upcoming weeks.                 (2) Neither a restricted nor an open tender for the DECO replacement IT system were conducted. IBM Australia Limited were approached to submit a quote for the DECO replacement IT which was not accepted. The Defence Chief Information Officer Group will be proceeding to Request for Tender in the upcoming weeks.                 (3) DECO has not begun transition to the DECO replacement IT system as it has not yet been developed.   It is estimated that the new system should be operational in the first half of 2012.                 (4) (a) The cost per annum of delivering the DECO replacement IT system will be determined as part of the Request for Tender process.                 (b) The cost per annum of running the DECO replacement IT system will be determined as part of the Request for Tender process.                 (5) Defence decided to replace the DECO IT system because the DECO IT system:                 Is now obsolete having been introduced in 1992.                 Is very difficult to support with little effective back up available.                 Has not kept pace with changes to legislation, including the introduction of the Weapons of Mass Destruction (Prevention of Proliferation) Act 1995.                 Does not support an optimal staffing structure and provides an ineffective paper-based and labour intensive system.                 Is a 'stand-alone' system that runs on separate hardware and networking infrastructure,                 independent from all Defence Chief Information Officer Group governance and sustainment arrangements.                 The DECO replacement IT system offers the following advantages over the DECO IT system:                 It will be supported by the Defence Chief Information Officer Group on existing Defence Restricted Network and Defence Secret Network infrastructure, hence supporting the ICT savings stream of the Defence Strategic Reform Program.                 It will offer an approved assessment process which will allow DECO staff to more easily focus on analysing the policy issues in export cases and to assess them more thoroughly, consistently and quickly. This would allow existing DECO staff levels to accommodate a rising volume of export applications, and would accommodate expected additional work under legislative amendments currently being proposed.                 It will deliver an e-business approach for Exporters who will be able to submit applications and other required documentation online.                 It will better facilitate coordination of complex cases which, require classified input                 from other government departments and specialist areas within Defence.                 It will offer an updated modern database which will improve reporting and analysis for DECO and other specialist areas within Defence.                 (6) The DECO replacement IT system has not yet been developed, however it will be built to meet the requirements of the DECO which include the requirements of the Defence Trade Controls Bill 2011.   It is also planned to ensure that the DECO replacement IT system will be flexible enough to cope with evolving United States requirements and Australian legislation.

                 (a) Negotiations between the Department of Resources, Energy and Tourism and Solar Oasis Pty Ltd are continuing in accordance with the Renewable Energy Demonstration Program (REDP) Administrative Guidelines to finalise a Funding Deed for the Whyalla Solar Oasis project.                  (b) The REDP aims to assist the demonstration and deployment of new renewable energy technologies. The Department has been working in good faith with SolarOasis, as it has with all REDP funding recipients, to ensure the proposed project is viable. This project is large, complex and attempts to deploy new and exciting technologies and production methodologies. This has resulted in some technical and commercial considerations that require resolution before the funding deed can be signed.                  (c) Finalising the funding deed is a matter for the Department of Resources, Energy and Tourism. I am satisfied the course of action being undertaken is appropriate and consistent with the Program Administrative Guidelines for the REDP. The Government remains committed to its $60 million offer to the project.

                 (1) Private health insurance premiums have been rising mainly because of current and forecast increases in benefit outlays. This includes the increasing costs of treatments and services and higher utilisation of treatments and services.                 Medibank Private premiums have risen by 26.41% over the last 5 years, compared to the weighted industry average of 26.82%, and the Health Services Index average of 28.2%.                  (2) No. Different policies offered by the same insurer will have different premiums and different premium increases. Premium increases vary between policies for a range of reasons.                 (3) The Minister for Finance and Deregulation is the Government's sole shareholder in Medibank Private. Therefore, all questions regarding Medibank Private's performance, returns and ownership should be addressed to the Minister for Finance and Deregulation.

This includes the profession of the Board Chair.                 These transitional Board arrangements will be in place for a time-limited period after the establishment of each Medicare Local. Each Medicare Local will take its own approach to appointing both transitional and final Board members, to reflect local skill needs and in accordance with each company's constitution.                  The governance arrangements for Medicare Locals are outlined in the 'Guidelines for the establishment and initial operation of Medicare Locals'.

                 (1) By way of background, when an employer makes a car available to an employee for private use, a car fringe benefit will generally arise and be subject to fringe benefits tax (FBT). Car fringe benefits are valued under either the 'operating cost' (or 'log book') method or the 'statutory formula' method.                 Under the log book method, the taxable value of the benefit is based on the cost of owning and operating the vehicle, reduced by the portion which relates to the business use of the vehicle. Employers are required to substantiate the business use of the vehicle by maintaining a log book for a specified period.                 The statutory formula method is designed to provide employers with a low compliance cost alternative to the log book method, eliminating the need to maintain a vehicle log book. The statutory formula method removes the need to explicitly distinguish between the business and private use of a vehicle.                  The Government announced on 10 May 2011 that it will reform the statutory formula method by replacing the sliding scale of statutory rates with a single rate of 20 per cent that applies regardless of the distance travelled. Previously, the taxable value of a car fringe benefit was reduced as a car travelled more kilometres, as a greater business use element was assumed.                 Replacing the sliding scale of statutory rates with a flat statutory rate of 20 per cent removes the unintended incentive for people to drive their vehicle further than they need to, in order to obtain a larger tax concession.                 The changes do not apply to existing contracts, and will be phased in over four years.                 People who use their vehicle for a significant amount of work-related travel will still be able to use the log book method to ensure their car fringe benefit excludes any business use of the vehicle.                 The reforms do not fully remove the FBT concession for cars, and the benefits from salary packaging will still be greater for employees with higher variable costs of car ownership (e.g. fuel and maintenance) as a proportion of total costs. This is because these variable costs are salary sacrificed and are therefore paid from pre-tax dollars rather than post-tax dollars, and don't affect the amount of FBT payable.                  Some types of cars, in certain circumstances, are exempt from FBT, such as where there is only limited private use of a panel van or ute. There are no changes to these exemptions.                 In addition, there is an FBT exemption for the provision, by an employer, of transport to and from an employee's usual place of residence and a remote area work site, such as a mine, under what are commonly known as fly-in fly-out arrangements. The exemption applies where an employee is provided with accommodation at or near the remote area work site on working days, the transport is provided to enable the employee to return to their usual place of residence on days off, and where it would be unreasonable to expect the employee to travel to and from work on a daily basis.                  (2) The taxable value of the car fringe benefit, and the FBT payable on that car fringe benefit, depend on whether the statutory formula method or the log book method is chosen. If the statutory formula method is chosen, the FBT payable will depend on the cost of the vehicle, how far the vehicle is driven, and whether the employee makes an employee contribution. If the log book method is chosen, the FBT payable will depend on the cost of owning and operating the vehicle, how much the vehicle is driven for work, and whether the employee makes an employee contribution.                 Under the statutory formula method, the taxable value of the car fringe benefit for a vehicle with a base value of $65,000, being driven further than 40,000 kilometres per annum, will increase from $4,550 to $13,000 following the changes to the taxation of car fringe benefits. However, this is not the FBT payable. The FBT payable depends on whether the employee makes an employee contribution, which can substantially reduce and even eliminate the FBT payable both before and after the reform. Whether the employee makes an employee contribution or not, the FBT liability is not equal to the taxable value of the car fringe benefit.                 Under the log book method, the taxable value of the car fringe benefit depends on how much the car is driven for work, and how much the car is used for private travel. If the vehicle is driven only for work, the taxable value of the car fringe benefit, and the FBT payable, will be zero.

                 (1) The Australian Rescue Vehicle REMORA is currently in storage in Western Australia.  Under a contract with James Fisher Defence, the LR5 rescue vehicle remains available in place of REMORA, which was formerly operated under a separate contract.                 (a) REMORA was fully operational up until December 2006.                 (b) REMORA remains in a refurbished state; however, would need to be recertified to recommence operations.  Additionally, the Launch and Recovery System used to deploy and retrieve REMORA from the deck of a mother ship needs significant modification to meet contemporary certification standards, which are different from those that applied when the system was originally built.  The time required and cost of reconstituting REMORA and its Launch and Recovery System, as well as developing the associated operating and maintenance capability, are being assessed as part of a cost-benefit analysis.                 (2) When last operational, REMORA was maintained at 12 hours notice to mobilise.  The LR5 submarine rescue suite is kept at the same notice.                 (3) REMORA was designed and originally certified to operate to a maximum depth of 525 metres.  Following refurbishment and an extended period in storage, certification has lapsed and REMORA will need to be recertified under a formal test and trials program to demonstrate this capability.                 (4) REMORA is designed to carry six rescued submariners.  The LR5 can carry a maximum of fifteen.                 (5) The Department of Defence owns the REMORA rescue vehicle and the associated Launch and Recovery System.                 (6) The average yearly cost (based on FY05/06 and FY06/07 figures) of maintaining and operating REMORA was $2.7 million (inclusive of maintenance, real estate, personnel and running).                 (7) The current contract for the provision of submarine escape and rescue services with James Fisher Defence expires in May 2012.                 (8) (a) There are no other companies in Australia with access to a rescue vehicle and associated equipment that can provide a similar service to that of James Fisher Defence.                 (b) While overseas companies might provide a similar service to that of James Fisher Defence, they are generally linked to the navies of countries in which they are based.  Of note, James Fisher Defence operates the submarine rescue system of the Republic of Singapore Navy; Rolls Royce is the prime contractor for operation of the NATO Submarine Rescue System; and Phoenix International operates the United States Navy submarine rescue system.  The Royal Australian Navy and many regional navies operating submarine escape and rescue services meet in various fora to share information on their capabilities.  The Royal Australian Navy also joins other navies to employ these capabilities with one another during periodic regional exercises at sea.

                 Minors at the Inverbrackie Alternative Place of Detention (APOD) attend a variety of public schools and preschools in the Adelaide Hills area.                 The costs incurred by those schools in delivering services to detainee minors (including but not limited to salaries of additional teachers, senior teachers and teachers' aides, teachers' equipment, school fees, school uniform costs, school excursion costs and other related education costs for detainee minors), will be paid to the Government of South Australia on a cost recovery basis.                 The fees will be set out in a formal agreement which is currently being negotiated between the Commonwealth of Australia and the State of South Australia.                 The Department of Immigration and Citizenship exchanged letters with the South Australian Department of the Premier and Cabinet on 17 December 2010, in which the parties agreed to work together in good faith to establish the formal agreement and that, in the meantime, South Australia would provide education (and other) services to people housed at the Inverbrackie APOD.                 In accordance with the exchange of letters, approximately $860,000 has been paid to date to the Government of South Australia for education services provided to minors located in the Inverbrackie APOD.                 It is not possible to predict the total sum of future costs that will be provided to the Government of South Australia as:                 the formal agreement is still being negotiated;                 the number of children residing in APODs continues to decrease as more children are moved into community detention arrangements; and                 the particular fees payable are determined on a cost recovery basis (depending on the number of children that attend the public schools).

                 (1) DFAT is currently trialling the use of social media to promote two major bilateral public diplomacy programs in North Asia: the Imagine Australia Year of Australian Culture in China 2010-11; and the Australia-Korea Year of Friendship 2011.                 (a) Imagine Australia Year of Australian Culture in China                 The Australian Embassy in Beijing has established a presence, in broadcast mode only, on three Chinese-language social media sites, similar to Facebook, Twitter and YouTube. They include:                 Sina Microblog: a Twitter-style microblog account, for message posts of up to 140 characters, photos and video http://blog.sina.com.cn/imagineaustralia                 Sina Blog: for longer messages, photos and video http://t.sina.com.cn/imagineaustralia                 Youku account (China's equivalent of YouTube) for uploading of video material http://u.youku.com/user_show/id_UMzI4MzYzODk2.html.                 The three accounts aim to promote the official program of events among Chinese audiences and to reinforce other forms of outreach. The accounts were launched in January 2011 and are accessible through the official Imagine Australia website managed by DFAT https://imagineaustralia.net/en/.                 The embassy has reported positively on the trial to date, concluding that social media will potentially become the premier platform for marketing the program. Regional outreach has been significantly stronger than anticipated, with subscriber interest coming from most provinces and regions across China. More detailed analysis of the effectiveness of these tools will be undertaken as the year progresses and the outcome of this trial will help inform future use of social media for public diplomacy campaigns.                 (b) Australia-Korea Year of Friendship 2011                 The bilateral Year of Friendship program marks the 50th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between Australia and the Republic of Korea. The Australian Embassy in Seoul is trialling the use of YouTube and a Korean-language i-Phone application to promote events on the official program to audiences in the Republic of Korea.                 They include:                 YouTube: videos of Australian cultural performances and official events held in Korea http://www.youtube.com/user/yearoffriendship                 i-Phone Application featuring event listings and photo/video galleries http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id412557544.                 The i-Phone calendar application and YouTube account were launched in January 2011 and are accessible through the official Australia-Korea Year of Friendship website http://australiakorea50.com/ managed by DFAT. The effectiveness of these social media tools to promote the achievements of the past 50 years, and to raise public awareness of Australia in Korea and of the importance of the bilateral relationship to both countries, will be progressively assessed over the coming year and will be reported on in full at the conclusion of the program.                  (c) Other uses                 DFAT established a generic DFAT Twitter account on 7 April 2011. It seeks to complement the department's traditional communication channels, such as media releases and websites, in order to reach a wider and increasingly mobile audience, including people with limited internet access and travellers who may rely on Twitter for information. In times of consular crises, tweets will provide updates on fast-changing situations and will refer followers to the Department's websites, which remain the authoritative source of information. Twitter is an additional way of sharing information with the public about Australia's foreign and trade policies, latest travel advisories, media releases and breaking news, speeches, recruitment and the release of new publications.                 The launch of Twitter followed a number of limited, event-specific social media trials for consular purposes, including during the soccer world cup in South Africa, the Commonwealth games in India and the canonisation of Mary MacKillop in Rome. These trials highlighted the potential benefits of social media platforms as public communication tools but also reinforced the need to address a range of technical, resource and administrative issues, as well as associated risks.                 (2) (a) Facebook                 No Australian overseas mission currently has an active Facebook account.                 Two Australian overseas missions established Facebook accounts for specific time-limited consular purposes in 2010. They were the Australian High Commission in Pretoria for the soccer world cup and the Australian High Commission in New Delhi for the Commonwealth games. Both accounts are now closed.                 (b) Twitter                 One Australian overseas mission has an active Twitter-style account. The Australian Embassy in Beijing established Sina Microblog, a Chinese Twitter-style microblog account for message posts of up to 140 characters, photos and video, to promote the 2010-11 Imagine Australia Year of Australian Culture in China (see Question 1).                 Four Australian overseas missions previously established Twitter accounts for specific time-limited consular events. They were: the Australian High Commission in Pretoria for the 2010 soccer world cup; the Australian High Commission in New Delhi for the 2010 Commonwealth games; the Australian Embassy to the Holy See for the canonisation of St Mary MacKillop in October 2010 and the Australian Embassy in Chile in response to the earthquake in February 2010. These accounts are now closed.                 DFAT launched an official generic Twitter account (@dfat) on 7 April 2011. Its primary purpose is to complement the Department's traditional forms of communication and to accompany information published on its websites in order to reach a wider and increasingly mobile audience.                  (c) YouTube                 Two Australian overseas missions have active YouTube, or local equivalent, accounts.                 The Australian Embassy in Seoul established a YouTube account to promote official events associated with the Australia-Korea Year of Friendship 2011 and the Australian Embassy in Beijing established a Youku account (China's equivalent of YouTube) to promote official events associated with the 2010-11 Imagine Australia Year of Australian Culture in China. Both accounts were established in January 2011 (see Question 1).                 In addition, four dedicated YouTube channels have been established since December 2010. These include a DFAT channel and channels for Mr Rudd, Dr Emerson and Mr Marles.

This grant was jointly funded by the Commonwealth and States/Territories using funds allocated for implementation of the National Long-Term Tourism Strategy.                 (3) Total travel related expenditure for Tourism Division staff in 2010-11 was $288,304.                 (4) (i) Total domestic travel expenditure by Tourism Division in 2010-11 was $203,082  -  including expenditure of $124,749 on airfares. A detailed breakdown of domestic airfare expenditure by class of travel is not readily available. Domestic air travel undertaken by Tourism Division staff is generally economy class, wherever possible utilising the lowest fare available on the day the travel is booked which suits the practical business needs of the traveller. While SES officers have an entitlement to business class domestic travel, the established practice in Tourism Division is for SES to travel economy class on short flights (e.g. for travel to Sydney and Melbourne).                 (ii) Total international travel expenditure by Tourism Division in 2010-11 was $85,222  -  including expenditure of $65,503 on airfares. A detailed breakdown of international airfare expenditure by class of travel is not readily available. Employees required to travel on official business overseas are entitled to business class travel on international flights.

                 The Australian Government has undertaken safety inspections in over 232,000 homes fitted with insulation under the Home Insulation Program (HIP), as at 31 July 2011.                 Inspections and rectification of HIP related safety issues are completed at no cost to the householder.                 There have been approximately 24,000 claims for reimbursements made by householders under Stage One of the Foil Insulation Safety Program (Interim FISP). Interim FISP ran from 10 February 2010 to 5 July 2010.                 There have been 23,666 non-foil households identified as having pre-existing (that is non-HIP) related safety issues. These issues have been referred to the householder for action.                 The cost of rectifying these pre-existing issues is unknown to the Department and is outside the scope of the Home Insulation Safety Program.                 On 20 April 2011, I made a policy committment to continue to notify householders of pre-existing safety issues so they are able to make an informed decision regarding rectification at their own cost.

                 I can advise that the Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency is treating all allegations of fraud very seriously.                 When allegations of fraud or non-compliance are received (such as the concerns raised by the residents at the Killara property) a review process is conducted to consider both the specifics of the allegation and the profile of the insulation installer to fully assess the matter and inform an appropriate response. Depending on the results of this review, the response may include compliance action, referral to the Australian Taxation Office, or the investigation of the alleged fraud.                 It is not the policy of the Department to provide feedback or progress reports on the status of matters undergoing compliance or investigation, as this may compromise the integrity of those processes.

                 (1) The Plan for a Clean Energy Future (the Plan) contains a number of different policies and programs which are designed to move Australia towards a clean energy future. These policies and programs have been designed and will be implemented across a number of government departments. For the Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency, the provision of advice to government leading to policies such as the Plan and developing supporting documentation come under the Department's Program 1.1 (Reducing Australia's Greenhouse Gas Emissions) and Program 1.2 (Improving Australia's Energy Efficiency). Given that the advice that the Department provided to the Government to develop the Plan was a core departmental function, no additional funds were allocated to the Department for this purpose. The Department was allocated funds to run the Multi-Party Climate Change Committee and to run the Garnaut Review Update (including secretariats in both cases), details of which were provided in the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook in 2010.                 (2) Financial costs associated with policies and programs under the Plan can be found in Appendix B of Securing a Clean Energy Future  -  the Australian Government's Climate Change Plan at: www.cleanenergyfuture.gov.au/clean-energy-future/securing- a-clean-energy-future.

                  (1) On 10 August 2011 the Government announced the closure of the Exceptional Circumstances (EC) Exit Grant program to all new applicants. As the program guidelines clearly stated the EC Exit Grant program would close on 30 June 2012 or if all funds were expended. Closing the program earlier than anticipated hasn't reduced the number of people assisted; the same numbers of people have been assisted. The Government initially allocated $9.6 million to this program. At the time of closure this had been boosted to almost $14 million. The Government will continue to stand by farmers, as it did during the drought and now in a period of improved conditions.                 (2) The Government will not re-open the program to new applicants. Anyone who was eligible for payment under the scheme will have their application assessed in line with the guidelines.

                 (1) The Renewable Energy Regulator (the Regulator) and the Office of the Renewable Energy Regulator (ORER) were established by the Howard Government in 2001, under the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Act 2000, to administer the Renewable Energy Target (RET) scheme. The RET is not a Government rebate scheme and does not provide public funds. The RET provides for registered persons to create certificates and sell those certificates privately to liable parties. There is no role for the Regulator or the ORER in settling the sale of these certificates or monitoring contracts which relate to those certificates.                  The RET does not prescribe the market models employed by participants. The onus is on contractual parties to undertake their own due diligence around the ability and commitment of their counterparty to abide by contractual conditions. As the Regulator and the ORER have no enforcement powers in relation to market conduct or enforcing contracts, their standard practice is to advise anyone with an issue about marketing or payment issues to contact their relevant Fair Trading Office, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission or the Australian Securities and Investments Commission as appropriate to the complaint. This advice was given to all those who contacted the ORER. In the case of companies that are in receivership or administration they should also contact the appointed receiver or administrator.                 Once the Clean Energy Future legislation is passed, the RET will be administered by the Clean Energy Regulator which will have additional powers to deal with this type of behaviour. In particular, the Clean Energy (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2011 includes specific provisions to increase the Regulator's powers to refuse registration or suspend registration.                  (2) (a) Yes, to be eligible to create certificates for solar panels systems under the RET they must be installed and designed by a Clean Energy Council (CEC) accredited installer. The CEC installer must also sign a range of written statements before certificates can be created, including a written statement that they installed the system to meet the requirements of the local/state/territory government, that they completed the installation along with their CEC accreditation number. Further details are available on the ORER website at: www.orer.gov.au/sgu/index.html.                  (b)There is no requirement in the RET scheme that the installer must have surety or  insurance to cover any financial or workmanship default. However, there are requirements as part of their CEC accreditation to have insurance requirements including Certificate of Currency/Proof of Public Liability Insurance cover that have a minimum $5 million coverage.                 (3) As stated in the response to part (1), the ORER does not have legal power to intervene in contractual matters. This is a matter for the contracted parties and the receivers.

                 Two organisations that were involved in implementing AusAID-funded activities were identified has having their contracts terminated from 2005 to 2010 for reasons of fraud or mismanagement. A further 21 project staff of organisations implementing AusAID-funded activities had their employment contracts or sub-contracts terminated during this period as a result of fraud or project mismanagement. Details are set out in the table below.                  Given the sensitivities involved in these investigations, it would be inappropriate to provide the names of organisations and individuals involved.

                 (a) I am unable to provide an estimate of the number of self-funded retirees who will be ineligible for household assistance, as many are outside the tax and transfer systems. Accordingly, the Government does not hold information on their details or numbers.                 Depending on their personal circumstances, self-funded retirees may receive assistance through tax cuts, increases to the Seniors Supplement, or a combination of the two. Retirees who are primarily self-funded but also receive some Age Pension will receive the same assistance as Age Pensioners through the new Clean Energy Supplement. As per the Government's commitment to assist all low income households to a level that at least covers their average expected price impact, low income self-funded retiree households that are not fully assisted to offset their average expected cost impact through tax cuts or payment increases will be able to apply for the Low Income Supplement.                  (b) Single self-funded retirees and couples with incomes and savings of up to $25,000 and $50,000 respectively, who do not hold a Commonwealth Seniors Health Card, are likely to be under Age Pension age. They will receive assistance under the Clean Energy Future package, through the following mechanisms, depending on their particular circumstances.                  Self-funded retirees with these incomes, which are less than $80,000, who pay tax on private earnings may receive tax cuts as a result of increases in the tax free threshold from 1 July 2012. The tax package will also increase the thresholds for the senior Australians tax offset, providing a greater offset to eligible self funded retirees over Age Pension age at some income levels.                 Further tax cuts will be delivered in 2015 for all taxpayers with a taxable income of up to $80,000, with most receiving a tax cut of up to $385 in total. Over a million low income individuals will no longer have to lodge a tax return by 2015-16.                 Tax concessions are already provided to self-funded retirees from 60 years of age  -  well below the current Age Pension age of 65 years for men and 64.5 years for women.                 Self-funded retirees in low income households who have not been adequately assisted through the tax or transfer systems may be eligible for the Low Income Supplement from 1 July 2012.                 Self-funded retirees who have an adjusted taxable income, including income from tax-free superannuation pensions, below $30,000 for singles and below $45,000 for couples combined (without dependent children), may be eligible for the annual $300 Low Income Supplement.

                 (a) (i) Funding Agreements with GP Super Clinic grant recipients include a 20 year Designated Use Period following the achievement of Practical Completion for the GP Super Clinic construction or refurbishment. This means that no Funding Agreements have yet concluded.                  (ii) All of the Funding Agreements with GP Super Clinic funding recipients include an indicative date for Practical Completion. It is acknowledged that the Practical Completion date for individual projects may vary from the original indicative date as factors beyond the control of funding recipients may impact a project from time to time. Such factors include the availability of land/suitable premises for the clinic, local council planning and approval processes, availability of construction workforce and materials, and weather conditions. The size and complexity of the construction project can also impact on the anticipated project timeframe.                  (b) As indicated above, the timetable for achieving Practical Completion by GP Super Clinic funding recipients is heavily dependent on external factors beyond the control of the funding recipient including the availability of land/suitable premises for the clinic, local council planning and approval processes, availability of construction workforce and materials, and weather conditions. The size and complexity of the construction project can also impact on the anticipated project timeframe.                  The Department monitors the Funding Agreements for each GP Super Clinic and negotiates variations to milestone timeframes, if required, to reflect the impact of these external influences.

                 (1) Funding allocated towards general practice after hours care is as follows:                                   The funding outlined in the table above includes funding allocated towards the Medicare Local After Hours Program, the after hours GP helpline (including the addition of a videoconferencing capability), the General Practice After Hours Program and the                  Practice Incentive Program After Hours Incentive 1.                 (2) The total sum of funding allocated towards each program that supports general practice after hours care is as follows:                                    The Australian Government also supports after hours service provision through the Medicare Benefits Schedule After Hours Rebates for GPs and other medical practitioners. After hours rebates are higher than equivalent rebates offered during standard hours.                  (3) In the 2008-09 Budget measure, Responsible Economic Management  -  After-Hours medical services  -  streamlining grants funding, the Government announced a streamlining of the former After Hours Primary Medical Care and Round the Clock Medicare: Investing in After Hours GP Services programs into a single program, known as the General Practice After Hours Program.                  The sum of funding allocated to the After Hours Primary Medical Care and the Round the Clock Medicare: Investing in After Hours GP Service programs from 2003-04 to 2007-08 is as follows:                                    From 2008-09, the sum of funding allocated to the General Practice After Hours Program is as follows:                                    (4) Funding allocated to the General Practice After Hours Program over the forward estimates is as follows:                                    Grants under the General Practice After Hours Program will no longer be offered from 1 July 2012. All existing General Practice After Hours Program grants will be honoured, funding for which is reflected in the forward estimates.                  From 1 July 2013, funding previously allocated towards the General Practice After Hours Program will be redirected through Medicare Locals to support after hours primary care.                  (5) The Practice Incentive Program After Hours Incentive was introduced in August 1999. The annual expenditure since its inception is listed below:                                    (6) There is no specific funding allocation for the Practice Incentive Program After Hours Incentive in the forward estimates.                  On 1 July 2011, funding for the Practice Incentive Program After Hours Incentive and a number of other Practice Incentive Program incentives was consolidated into the Practice Incentives for General Practices Fund, which has a funding allocation of around $1.055 billion over four years.                  The Practice Incentive Program After Hours Incentive will cease on 30 June 2013. Funding previously allocated towards this incentive will be redirected through Medicare Locals to support after hours primary care.                 _____________                   1 As of 1 July 2011, there is no specific funding allocation for the Practice Incentive Program After Hours Incentive in the forward estimates.

Specialist Training Program (STP) posts may be composed of multiple rotations across various setting types and localities. The figures provided are indicative of all sites funded under the program which fell into the nominated categories. These categories excluded public settings (non community) in RA1 (e.g. public metropolitan hospitals) and private non-community settings such as Diagnostic laboratories (e.g. pathology lab).                  2. Of the STP post locations identified in the table, approximately 50 percent of the training sites are located in rural and regional areas (ASGC RA 2-5). There are 518 STP positions in 2011, with a number of positions involving rotations in different settings and to more than one training site. On this basis, up to 58 percent of all current STP places are providing at least some of their training in a rural location. These training locations may be at a rural and regional hospital, but could also be at sites in the other categories such as community health settings or specialist rooms.

Costs will therefore come from within annual program funding.

In NSW, the current ratio of 1:8 will continue for this age group in all centres until that time. All services may of course choose to operate at ratios that reflect improved educator to child ratios and are encouraged to do so as part of transitioning to the new ratio but the requirement will remain at 1:8 until 2016.

The Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency estimates that fewer than 500 copies of the booklet were returned to the Department.                  Of the 10 million booklets produced, over 9.8 million were distributed via the national mailout. Remaining copies are available on request through the Department's call centre and at relevant events.

                  (1) (a) to (e) Joint advice from my Department, the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations and the Department of Human Services was provided to the Government on potential trial sites. The information provided included:                 unemployment levels;                 skills gaps;                 education levels;                 the numbers of people relying on welfare payments as their primary source of income; and                 the length of time recipients have been receiving income support payments.                   (2) The selection of particular trial sites was based on a consideration of factors including:                 the Local Government Areas being in the lower range of socio-economic advantage/disadvantage index (SEIFA);                 lower median individual and household incomes than the national averages;                 higher levels of unemployment;                 higher proportions of people in receipt of Centrelink payments;                 higher proportions of non-completion of secondary school;                 higher proportions of teenage parents receiving income support payments and jobless families; and                 availability of existing infrastructure and support services.

                 (a) As at end September 2011 there were fifteen operational clinics.                  The Department of Health and Ageing reports on workforce data from GP Super Clinics at an aggregated level rather than releasing data at the individual Clinic level.                  Please note that the numbers reported by the Clinics for the workforce providing services at each operational clinic are presented as full time equivalents (FTE). The number of individuals comprising this workforce is substantially greater.                 (i) As at end September 2011, there were a total of 93.8 FTE general practitioners providing services at the fifteen operational clinics. The number of specialists providing services at the GP Super Clinics will fluctuate from time to time as the needs of the local community fluctuate. Information on specialist medical services available at operational GP Super Clinics is available on the Department's GP Super Clinics website at:                   http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/pacd-gpsuperclinics                 Information will be available for those GP Super Clinics that have been operational for a minimum of four months. The four month timeframe allows for a period of settling in by the Clinic.                 (ii) As at end September 2011, the fifteen operational clinics reported that a total of 108.0 FTE allied health professionals and nursing staff were providing a wide range of health care services for their local communities.                  (b) and (c)                 Information on the hours of operation and bulk billing policy for individual GP Super Clinics is available on the Department's GP Super Clinics website at:                   http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/pacd-gpsuperclinics                 Information will be available for those GP Super Clinics that have been operational for a minimum of four months. The four month timeframe allows for a period of settling in by the Clinic.                 The hours of operation and bulk billing policy (as end September 2011) for the four sites that became operational between 1 June and 30 September 2011 are set out in the following table:

                 (1) and (2) Irrigation Efficiency Partners Pty Ltd (IEP) was deemed eligible by the assessment Panel to be a delivery partner and receive funding because it met all seven of the eligibility criteria in the On-Farm Irrigation Efficiency Program Guidelines for round two. Under the heading, 'Who is eligible to be a delivery partner?' the requirements are that applicants:                 1. be an entity with direct and demonstrable links to irrigators such as:                  an Irrigation Infrastructure Operator;                 a Catchment Management Authority;                 a commodity or agricultural industry group; or                 a regional irrigation body.                   IEP met this criterion.                 2. be able to demonstrate it has the authority under organisational governance arrangements to be the lead proponent who is responsible for the delivery partner project and is able to enter into contractual arrangements with others (e.g. project participants and irrigators) to implement the project.                   IEP met this criterion.                 3. be financially viable as demonstrated through the provision of audited financial statements and related documents.                 The basis on which IEP was assessed as meeting this criterion is set out below.                 4. be a legal entity capable of entering into a Funding Agreement with the Australian Government (note: unincorporated associations are not eligible).                   IEP met this criterion.                  5. be registered with the Australian Taxation Office for Goods and Services Tax purposes with a valid Australian Business Number (ABN).                   IEP met this criterion.                 6. agree to take all reasonable measures to ensure that permanent water entitlements offered to the Australian Government are unencumbered and are available to be transferred within the specified timeframe after a Funding Agreement is signed.                   IEP met this criterion.                 7. be seeking funding for irrigator sub-projects located only within the Lachlan River catchment and the southern connected system of the Murray Darling Basin.                   IEP met this criterion.                 It is not a requirement, as suggested in question 2, that documents related to financial viability must be provided for at least the last three years for entities to be eligible as a delivery partner. The formal eligibility requirement is as set out at point 3 above.                 In their application IEP made it clear that they were a new entity formed for the purpose of becoming a delivery partner under the program. IEP demonstrated that they were financially viable through financial statements and an unqualified audit opinion in 2011. These were reviewed and accepted by the independent consultants conducting a financial viability risk assessment of all applicants. This financial viability assessment was considered by the Panel which was constituted to make recommendations on the merits of the applications. The Panel included program and economic officers of the Department, an external financial and auditing expert and an external technical (irrigation) expert. The external financial and auditing expert advised the Panel that the documents provided by IEP met the eligibility criteria as they demonstrated financial viability and constituted all the documents that the applicants could reasonably be required to submit under the circumstances. Applicants are asked to provide three years of audited accounts and financial records in the context of the guidelines. This is referable to where an entity had existed for three or more years, but is not formally material to a decision determining financial viability. The Panel decided that the key determinant of financial viability was the independent consultant's financial viability risk assessment report, and they followed the report's findings.                  (3) and (4) The relevant statement in the Guidelines precluding 'organisations that directly supply or install irrigation equipment' specifically refers to an organisation in the lead proponent role as delivery partner in a proposal. The role of a delivery partner is to manage, on behalf of the Department, the delivery of groups of similar infrastructure projects and ensure that unencumbered water entitlements are transferred to the Commonwealth.                  IEP does not itself supply or install irrigation equipment, but entities in the overall consortium are irrigation equipment suppliers. Many of the delivery partners in both rounds one and two lead broader consortia which included members that fall into the categories of an ineligible lead proponent. These consortium members include irrigation suppliers, state government departments and actual irrigators. In all circumstances where an application has been successful, such consortium members are not the lead proponent and do not sign the funding agreement with the Australian Government.                 The approval of the IEP proposal was consistent with this requirement of the guidelines. IEP have supplied a written guarantee that they do not mandate the use of particular service providers to proponent farms participating in their projects. Like other delivery partners IEP has systems to benchmark quotes against industry standards. All delivery partners will have the records of how they disbursed their grant funds assessed by auditors working for the Department.                 IEP was registered as a company on 21 March 2011 and applications for round two of the On Farm Irrigation Efficiency Program closed on 31 March 2011.

                 (1) to (3) The funding for Health Districts in Queensland is a matter for the Queensland Government. Historically the Commonwealth has given funding to states and territories for public hospitals without transparency of where that funding is spent.                 I note the Member's concerns and would advise him that the new financing and transparency initiatives introduced through national health reform aim to improve the distribution of public hospital funding.                 A number of National Health Reform Agreement (NHRA) initiatives will ensure improved funding, and more transparent and locally responsive planning of health services. For example:                 Growth Funding - The Commonwealth will increase its contribution to efficient growth funding for hospitals to 45 per cent from 1 July 2014, increasing to 50 per cent from 1 July 2017. Once this commences, the states/territories and the Commonwealth will share future funding growth in a 50/50 partnership. A guaranteed additional $16.4 billion will be provided by the Commonwealth for public hospital services under this new agreement up until 2019-20. This funding is on top of the level of funding that the Commonwealth would have otherwise provided.                  Funding Transparency - All governments will contribute funding for hospitals into a single national funding pool which will be administered by a National Health Funding Pool Administrator. As a result there will be complete transparency, visibility and accountability of Commonwealth and state/territory government payments into the pool, then from the pool to LHNs.                 Activity Based Funding - As part of the NHRA, agreement has been reached to establish a nationally consistent approach to activity based funding of public hospital services. Under the new funding arrangements, the Commonwealth will contribute towards the cost of each service delivered by hospitals, based on a national efficient price for services. An Independent Hospital Pricing Authority has already been established to get this important work underway. The Commonwealth will also provide block funding for small regional and rural hospitals, and to fund teaching, training and research undertaken in public hospitals.                 Emergency Departments, Elective Surgery and Sub-acute Beds - All states and territories have signed a revised National Partnership Agreement on Improving Public Hospital Services, under which the Commonwealth will provide them with up to $3.4 billion by 2016-17 for improved emergency departments, more elective surgery and new sub-acute beds.                 Local Hospital Networks (LHNs) - Governance of the hospitals system will devolve to LHNs, which will be managed by Governing Councils that are comprised of members with skills and expertise in health, business and financial management, clinical expertise and research expertise. Governing Councils will engage with local clinicians and the local community to provide quality health care services to the community. A key role for LHNs will be undertaking local health planning, identifying gaps in services at the local level, examining opportunities for better targeting of services, and establishing formal and informal linkages with the primary care and aged care sectors.                 The Commonwealth has negotiated these national reforms with the states and territories to ensure that the health system is put on a more financially sustainable footing, with an increasing share of public hospital costs being met by the Commonwealth into the future.

Please note that the numbers reported by the Clinics for the workforce providing services at each operational clinic are presented as full time equivalents (FTE). The number of individuals comprising this workforce is substantially greater.                 (a) As at end September 2011, there were a total of 93.8 FTE general practitioners providing services at the 15 operational clinics.                   (b) and (c) As at end September 2011, the 15 operational clinics reported that a total of 108.0 FTE allied health professionals and nursing staff were providing a wide range of health care services for their local communities.                  (d) The number of specialists providing services at the GP Super Clinics will fluctuate from time to time as the needs of the local community fluctuate. Information on specialist medical services available at operational GP Super Clinics is available on the Department's GP Super Clinics website at:                   http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/pacd-gpsuperclinics                 Information will be available for those GP Super Clinics that have been operational for a minimum of four months.

                 In respect of healthdirect Australia:                 (a) (i) Callers cannot directly access the after hours GP helpline. Patients who call healthdirect Australia in the after hours period1 will initially be triaged by a registered nurse. If the nurse determines the patient will benefit from a GP telephone conversation, the caller will be transferred to a telephone-based GP.                 Therefore, the most appropriate nurse triage disposition to assess the number of calls made to the after hours GP helpline is 'Speak to Telephone GP'.                                    (ii) The number of calls made to a triage registered nurse in July and August 2011 were 70,303 and 70,858 respectively.                 (b) (i) The most appropriate healthdirect Australia nurse triage disposition to assess the number of calls triaged to a general practitioner telephone consultation is 'Speak to Telephone GP'.                                    (ii) A registered nurse triage disposition to follow-up by usual general practitioner is not available.                 The five most appropriate healthdirect Australia nurse triage dispositions to assess the number of calls triaged to follow-up by usual general practitioner are 'See Doctor immediately', 'See Doctor within 4 hours', 'See Doctor within 24 hours', 'See Doctor within 72 hours' and 'See Doctor within 2 weeks'.                                    (iii) The most appropriate healthdirect Australia nurse triage disposition to assess the number of calls triaged to an emergency department is 'Attend Emergency Department immediately'.                                    (iv) A registered nurse triage disposition to a medical deputising service is not available.                 Therefore, the number of calls triaged to a medical deputising service cannot be provided.                 (v) The most appropriate healthdirect Australia nurse triage disposition to assess the number of calls triaged to Triple Zero (000) is 'Activate 000'.                                      1 The after hours period is 6pm  -  8am Monday to Friday, 6pm Friday to 8am Saturday, from 12 noon Saturday to 8am Monday, and on public holidays.

                 (a) Commonwealth funded treatment services which may be to benefit of people in far north Queensland with depression or anxiety are available under the Better Access to Psychiatrists, Psychologists and General Practitioners through the Medicare Benefits Schedule (Better Access) initiative, which provides access for people, with an assessed mental disorder, to Medicare subsidised mental health services provided by General Practitioners (GPs), psychiatrists, psychologists and appropriately trained social workers and occupational therapists. There are a range of private providers registered with Medicare Australia and eligible to provide these services in far north Queensland.                 The Better Access initiative is complemented by the Access to Allied Psychological Services (ATAPS) initiative. ATAPS services are targeted to those individuals requiring primary mental health care who are not likely to be able to have their needs met through Medicare based mental health services. Extra funding of $206 million in the 2011 Budget will see a significant expansion of ATAPS over the next five years.                 To be eligible for the Better Access or ATAPS initiatives, an individual consumer must be diagnosed as having a mental disorder by a GP and have a Mental Health Treatment Plan prepared. In general these initiatives are suitable for individuals with mental disorders of mild to moderate severity.                 Under the ATAPS initiative Divisions of General Practice and Medicare Locals are funded to purchase allied health services necessary to deliver ATAPS services. The Far North Queensland Division of General Practice is currently funded to provide services in far north Queensland.                  The Australian Government also provides a range of telephone and web-based counselling services for all Australians, regardless of where they reside in Australia.                 Through the Telephone Counselling, Self Help and Web-Based Support Programmes measure, the Australian Government has invested $60.9 million over five years to support services for people with low to moderate level mental health disorders and those experiencing psycho-social crisis, or long-standing mental health problems. Activities under this measure, to date, have included crisis counselling via telephone helplines, online counselling, online self-help and peer support, and self-directed online treatment modules. A suite of evidence-based telephone counselling and online mental health programs currently supplements or substitutes for more conventional face-to-face services. Further information on these initiatives is available at www.mentalhealth.gov.au.                 The Australian Government is aware of the ongoing concerns within the community about accessing mental health care, and is also aware of concerns that Australia has lacked a consistent and comprehensive approach to eating disorders.                 In response to this the Australian Government has committed $3 million for the National Eating Disorders Collaboration (NEDC). The collaboration is being led by the Butterfly Foundation and will aim to develop a comprehensive, coordinated national approach to eating disorders.                  People with mild to moderate level eating disorders may benefit from the Better Access and ATAPS initiative outlined above.                 With respect to services available for moderate to severe eating disorders in far north Queensland this is a matter which falls within the responsibility of the Queensland Minister for Mental Health.                 (b) In regards to financial assistance, each state and territory government administers a travel and accommodation assistance scheme (PATS) for people requiring specialised health care not available within a specified distance from their place of residence. While the PATS have some basic features in common, travel assistance arrangements vary across the states and territories with different administration arrangements, eligibility criteria, subsidy levels, requirements for patient contributions and types of medical care covered. The Commonwealth Government has no role in funding or administering these schemes, but is working with states and territories to examine options to improve PATS and to work towards a more nationally consistent scheme.

                 For the financial year 2010-11, the department spent $4.75 million in Australia and overseas on hospitality and entertainment.                 The composition of entertainment and hospitality expenditure overseas and in Australia:                 (a) Overseas $4.02 million                 (b) Australia $0.73 million                 TOTAL    $4.75 million                 (c) Hospitality and entertainment expenditure relating to the United Nations Security Council bid has been incurred both through a range of specific events and as part of broader hospitality events across the diplomatic network.  To collate records to identify this expenditure would entail a significant diversion of resources and, in these circumstances, I do not consider the additional work can be justified.

                 (a) Savings totalling $160 million over the four financial years commencing 2010-11 have been returned to the Budget, by reducing agencies' appropriations.  It is not possible to be specific about the level of savings retained by agencies because travel patterns change over time to reflect operational needs.  However, analysis of the top 30 most travelled domestic routes indicate, that on average, prices paid have reduced by about 30 per cent in 2010-11.  This is an indication that agencies are also retaining benefits.                 (b) The total savings budgeted were $160 million to be returned to the Budget, with agencies retaining $20 million in benefit annually.

                 The Government is aware of media reports that some electricity distribution companies have expressed concerns about high concentrations of photovoltaic systems connecting to distribution grids.                 A concentration of solar photovoltaic systems can impact the ability of distribution companies to manage network voltage. A range of technical options are available to distribution companies to manage network voltage and any other impacts of solar photovoltaic deployment related to power supply quality.                 Distribution companies operate within national energy laws and rules. Should distribution companies find barriers in the rules to delivering efficient management of issues that might arise from photovoltaic systems, the Australian Energy Market Commission rule making process provides an avenue for network businesses to propose rule changes.

Trio                  ASIC formally commenced its investigation in relation to Trio on 2 October 2009 in respect of the Astarra Strategic Fund ('ASF'), of which Trio was the responsible entity. ASIC in taking regulatory action worked closely with the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority as Trio Capital was the trustee of a number of superannuation funds.                 On 14 October 2009 ASIC applied to the NSW Supreme Court for orders restricting overseas travel for two directors of the investment manager of the ASF. On 16 October 2009 ASIC placed interim stop orders on the Product Disclosure Statement for the ASF and on 21 October 2009 interim stop orders were placed on three associated Trio superannuation funds. This had the effect of stopping further investments being made into these funds.  On 16 December 2009 Trio was placed into voluntary administration. The next day ASIC suspended its Australian financial services license which ensured it was no longer able to provide financial services                  On 16 December 2009 APRA suspended Trio as the trustee of four superannuation funds and one pooled superannuation trust.  APRA also appointed an acting trustee to manage these five entities.                 On 16 April 2010 Justice Palmer in the Supreme Court of New South Wales, on the application of Trio's administrator, ordered the winding up of five managed investment schemes for which Trio was the responsible entity, including the ASF and ARP.                   Storm                 ASIC's formal investigation commenced on 12 December 2008.                 In the months of October, November and December 2008 the stock market fell significantly resulting in a shortfall between the equity and margin loans for Storm clients.  Around 18 December 2008, following the commencement of its investigation, ASIC sought to negotiate an enforceable undertaking (EU) with Storm.  The purpose of the EU was to address ASIC's concerns that Storm may have been providing conflicted and incorrect advice to Storm clients who were in negative equity that they did not need to meet their margin calls and should not deal with the banks.                 An EU was not ultimately executed.  However, around 19 December 2008, Storm said it would cease contact with all its clients over the Christmas period.  This action was not requested by ASIC and was a decision made by Storm.  Storm subsequently went into administration on 9 January 2009.                   Westpoint                 From 2000 until early 2006, a number of investigations were conducted by ASIC in relation to the Westpoint Group of companies.                 On 10 May 2004, Bayshore Mezzanine Pty Ltd commenced action against ASIC seeking a determination as to whether the promissory notes issued by it were regulated under the Corporations Act.  On 12 May 2004, ASIC commenced proceedings against Emu Brewery Mezzanine Limited alleging that that company was carrying on an unregistered (but registrable) managed investment scheme. The two proceedings were heard together.  In November 2004, the Supreme Court of Western Australia ruled that the promissory notes issued by Emu Brewery Mezzanine Ltd and Bayshore Mezzanine Pty Ltd were not debentures requiring a prospectus to be lodged with ASIC, but they were interests in a managed investment scheme.  In June 2006, the Court of Appeal held that the promissory notes were interests in a managed investments scheme.                 In 2004 and 2005 ASIC issued a number of interim and final stop orders in relation to the fundraising activities of the Westpoint Group.                  In November and December 2005 ASIC issued applications in the Federal Court seeking to wind up York Street Mezzanine Pty Ltd and Ann Street Mezzanine Pty Ltd and to appoint a provisional liquidator in the interim.  ASIC also sought orders for lodgement of financial reports for a number of Westpoint Group entities.                 On 20 December 2005 the Federal Court ordered that Ann Street Mezzanine Pty Ltd and York Street Mezzanine Pty Ltd, be wound up.  Orders were also made for the lodgement of financial accounts for a number of Westpoint Group entities.

                 General overview of civil recovery proceedings by ASIC                 ASIC plans to publish a document by the end of this year that sets out factors that may be relevant in choosing particular enforcement remedies. One such remedy is to take action to recover damages or property on a person's behalf, including as part of other court actions we take. However, ASIC must form the view that it is in the public interest to commence such litigation..                 In considering whether it is in the public interest to take civil recovery action on behalf of an aggrieved investor ASIC will take into account a range of considerations including the following:                 A viable cause of action being identified (that is, establishing misconduct by the defendant that gives rise to the basis for a compensation action);                 The availability of evidence to prove the cause of action;                 The regulatory effect of bringing the action;                 The extent of impact or quantum of loss arising from the misconduct;                 The costs of bringing the action and the potential liability for costs if not successful;                 The existence of other parties able to commence proceedings seeking compensation for aggrieved investors (such as an external administrator or the investors themselves);                 The availability of funds to satisfy a judgement against a defendant to the proceedings;                 The prospects of the action being successfully litigated by ASIC;                 ASIC's regulatory priorities at the time; and                 Availability of alternative forms of dispute resolution.                   Trio Capital Ltd                 Trio Capital Limited ('Trio') was the trustee of five superannuation entities, the responsible entity for twenty five managed investment schemes and trustee of three unregistered managed investment schemes.                 ASIC's investigations have focused on:                 the conduct of the directors and officers of Trio, the investment managers of the Astarra Strategic Fund ('ASF') and ARP Growth Fund ('ARP'), managed investments schemes of which Trio was the responsible entity;                 The conduct of the officers and directors of the investments managers of ASF and ARP respectively;                 ASIC is also looking at the conduct of a number of financial advisers who advised their clients to invest in ASF                 These investigations are continuing.                 When Trio was placed into administration the reported value of the ASF was around $125 million. These figures include the capitalisation of questionable returns reported by Trio for a number of years. The reported value of ARP was around $58 million. Both these funds are in the process of being wound up. To date the liquidator of Trio has been unable to realise any value from most of the investments made by the ASF and ARP.                 ASIC has not commenced any actions against any third parties for loss recovery purposes.  As ASIC's former Chairman indicated to the Joint Standing Committee for Corporations and Financial Services on 24 November 2010, ASIC is unlikely to commence such an action in relation to ARP.                 Approximately 5000 investors who invested in APRA regulated superannuation funds with an exposure to the ASF will be compensated through the Part 23 SIS Act compensation decision announced by the Assistant Treasurer on 13 April 2011.  The amount of the compensation is in the order of $55 million.                   Storm                 ASIC commenced its investigation into the collapse of Storm on 12 December 2008.  On 19 March 2010, ASIC announced that it would enter into confidential discussions with the individuals and entities which had been the subject of its investigations, to see if a commercial resolution could be reached which would be acceptable to ASIC and which ASIC would be prepared to recommend to investors.  Those negotiations proved to be unsuccessful.                 In December 2010, in addition to civil penalty proceedings against Emmanuel and Julie Cassimatis, ASIC commenced 2 compensation proceedings.  The first proceedings seek compensation and claim damages on behalf of 2 investors, Barry and Deanna Doyle, and are against Bank of Queensland Limited (BoQ), Senrac Pty Limited, the franchisee of BoQ's North Ward branch, and Macquarie Bank Limited (MBL).  ASIC alleges in these proceedings that the banks acted unconscionably in lending to the Doyles, breached the Banking Code of Practice and were linked to credit providers with Storm under s73 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) (re-enacted as the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth)) and are jointly and severally liable for any loss suffered by the Doyles as a result of any breach by Storm in relation to the services they supplied.                 The second proceedings, against Storm, Commonwealth Bank of Australia, BoQ and MBL, seek declarations that Storm operated an unregistered managed investment scheme and that the banks were knowingly involved in the operation of that scheme, as well as injunctions.  A successful outcome in these proceedings lays a foundation for subsequent claims for compensation against the banks on behalf of those who have suffered loss.                  ASIC's proceedings above are ongoing.                   Westpoint                 When the Westpoint Group collapsed in early 2006, investors in Westpoint-issued financial products had an outstanding total capital invested of approximately $388 million.  The estimated losses to investors totalled approximately $310 million.                 In 2007 and 2008 a number of compensation actions were commenced by ASIC under section 50 of the ASIC Act.  The actions were in four categories: (a) a claim brought against KPMG, the former auditors of the Westpoint Group, (b) a claim brought against the directors of certain companies in the Westpoint Group, (c) representative proceedings on behalf of investors against financial planners who recommended investments in Westpoint Group financial products (seven separate actions) and (d) representative proceedings on behalf of investors against State Trustees Limited, the trustee of mezzanine finance notes issued by one of the mezzanine finance companies in the Westpoint Group.                   ASIC's actions against State Trustees Limited and a number of financial planners produced settlements in excess of $25.5 million.  On 1 February 2011 ASIC settled the actions against KPMG and the Westpoint directors.  The settlement of the proceedings against KPMG and the Westpoint directors means the total amount recovered as a result of ASIC's compensation litigation will be up to $92.95 million.                   Another $49.2 million obtained through the liquidation process has also been distributed, a figure that is expected to reach $56 million. Returns from Westpoint companies not in liquidation are expected to reach $22.5 million.  In all, investors are expected to see a return of around $160 to $170 million of the $388 million in losses.                 ASIC's class action against two financial planners and a cross-claim brought by a former Westpoint director against ASIC remain on foot.                 In addition to its compensation actions, ASIC has banned 23 licensed advisers, four unlicensed advisers and one corporate entity in relation to advice concerning Westpoint-related products for periods between 3 years and permanently.  ASIC has also accepted enforceable undertakings from three KPMG partners preventing them from practising as auditors for periods between nine months and two years. A number of criminal convictions have also been secured and criminal proceedings against former Westpoint directors and officers are ongoing.

                 The Government draws on a range of reliable, peer reviewed research in developing climate change policies such as the Clean Energy Future Plan. Reliable information sources include the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the CSIRO and Bureau of Meteorology in Australia, Academies of Science around the world, the World Meteorological Organization and other peer reviewed literature.                 The role of the IPCC is to advise policy makers about the current state of knowledge and provide reliable information pertaining to climate change. The IPCC does not conduct scientific research itself, but instead reviews the thousands of scientific papers on climate change published in the peer reviewed literature every year. The state of knowledge on climate change is summarised in the IPCC's assessment reports, published approximately every six to seven years. The reports are subject to an intense peer review process involving hundreds of scientific experts and government reviewers. This unprecedented level of peer and government review makes this compendium of climate change science one of the most scrutinised documents in the history of science.                 The IPCC's Fourth Assessment Report: Climate Change 2007 is a key information source for the Government in developing climate change policies. Twenty-four Australian authors contributed to all three Working Group reports of the Fourth Assessment Report. (Working Group 1: The Physical Science Basis; Working Group II: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability; and Working Group III: Mitigation of Climate Change). Chapter 11 of the Fourth Assessment Report highlights many of the potential impacts from climate change in the Australian and New Zealand region. Currently, the IPCC's Fifth Assessment Report is being written and is due for publication in 2013-14.                  The Government also draws on the body of peer reviewed work that has been completed since the Fourth Assessment Report was published. Key reports include The Copenhagen Diagnosis, 2009: Updating the World on the Latest Climate Science; Climate Change: a Summary of the Science published by the UK Royal Society in 2010; Advancing the Science of Climate Change published by the US National Academies of Science; and The Critical Decade: Climate Science, Risks and Responses published by the Climate Commission in 2011.

(2) (a) and (b) The 2009-10 and 2010-11 expenses are the actual departmental expenses incurred and are reported in the Department's annual financial statements. The                  2009-10 and 2010-11 average staffing levels are the actual staffing levels for those years. Both the expenses and average staffing levels are published in the Department's annual report. For 2011-12, the estimated expenses and average staffing levels are as reported in the Immigration and Citizenship Portfolio's 2011-12 Portfolio Budget Statements.                                                                                                                       2009-10                                     2010-11                                                     In reviewing the financial information provided in the above tables in response to question 3 (a) to (h), the following notes need to be considered:                 The negative expense amounts reported against some programs are due to minor prior year accounting adjustments.  Depending on the nature of the adjustment and if the adjustment crosses two financial years, this can result in a negative balance against an expense account;                 The expenses reported in relation to travel include airfares, accommodation and allowances.  The airfares were not able to be disaggregated into economy and business class.  According to the DIAC travel policy, most international travel is business class and most domestic travel is economy class;                 No accounting services were able to be specifically identified through the Department's general ledger accounts and the Department is reporting auditing and legal services expenses only; and                 No membership grants to affiliate organisations were identified from departmental funding.  DIAC does make a small number of contributions to organisations such as the International Organisation for Migration through Administered funding.                 For 2011-12, the internal budget is not allocated at the disaggregated level sought and therefore estimates cannot be provided.

                 The Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency advises that 106 instances of contact have been received by the Department in a category including general inquiries, tip-offs for possible fraud, and requests for advice on program guidelines from the electorates of Dawson and Capricornia in regard to work carried out under the Home Insulation Program as at 30 September 2011. These contacts relate to 97 dwellings.                 These figures are within the context of 17,128 installs of insulation in the electorates of Dawson and Capricornia under the Home Insulation Program.                 The Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency advises that more specific information may have the potential to unjustly and adversely affect businesses in the local area, even if it is not business specific. As a result, it is not appropriate to release such information.                 The Government offers inspections to all homes with foil installed under the HIP and provides householders with the option of having the insulation removed or on the advice of a Licensed Electrical Contractor, a safety switch installed.                 The Government will continue to offer inspections to any householder that had insulation installed under the HIP and who has not previously had one, until 30 June 2012.                 The Government has also committed to work with police and other relevant authorities in all jurisdictions to deal with cases of non-compliance and fraud in relation to the Home Insulation Program.

                 Thirty-two claims under the Scheme for Compensation for Detriment caused by Defective Administration (CDDA Scheme) have been received.                  The Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency is currently engaging with the claimants and considering the claims. It is the Department's practice to undertake a preliminary assessment of each claim and request further information from the claimant as necessary. The Department will consider any further information which is provided and will give the claimant the opportunity to comment on all relevant material proposed to be put before the decision maker. Claims will not be finally decided before all relevant information, including any further information and comments provided by the claimant, has been considered.                  No claims have yet been finally decided. Due to the complexity of the claims and the level of consultation with claimants, it is not possible to advise of a timeframe as to when the claims will be finally decided.
