On what scientific, institutional or programmatic bases has the Government decided that the National Action Plan's (NAP) environment objectives can be delivered by regional communities during the initial seven-year life of the NAP.What other models for regional or catchment scale delivery of Commonwealth funding were evaluated in deriving the preferred model (ie where regional groups adopt full responsibility for planning, targets, actions, monitoring and reporting).Is it normal practice for the Australian National Audit Office (ANAO), when assessing the effectiveness of a Government program, to exclusively survey the views of organisations benefiting from program funding.Would regional Natural Resource Management (NRM) groups, who receive the majority of their cash funding from the Commonwealth, be the only groups or organisations with a view on the competence of the NAP program.Of the regional NRM groups that responded to this survey, what proportion of those NRM groups had accredited NRM plans at the time of the survey.How does the Government intend to bring about landscape scale change, including on agricultural lands, if there are not commercially attractive treatment and land management options, and there is no incentive for regional NRM groups to pursue landscape change.In respect of that part of the ANAO report which stated that agencies considered that 'the Australian Government was seeking to purchase outcomes' through the regional investment process 'rather than providing funding on request', (a) what outcomes is the Australian Government seeking to purchase at the regional level, (b) how does funding projects identified through NRM plans differ to providing funding on request, and (c) does funding projects identified through NRM plans increase the transaction costs.Is the Minister aware of whether the ANAO considers the overall costs of program administration, including by the Ministerial Board, State agencies and regional bodies, represents an efficient program.Are there any NAP regions which are not eligible for NHT funding.In light of the shortcomings in NRM plans identified by ANAO and CSIRO/Bureau of Meteorology reports, how will the Minister demonstrate with a reasonable degree of confidence that improvements in salinity and water quality have occurred as a result of the NAP.Is the NAP a targeted investment model; if so, can he explain how the NAP is targeted and, in particular, is it targeted by the nature of (a) critical levels of investment in any region to address a specific environmental theme, (b) the program addressing matters of national environmental significance, and so supporting protection measures under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, and (c) ensuring nationally agreed best practice planning strategies are implemented across all NRM regions.Will achieving the NAP's objectives require landscape scale changes to land and water management, requiring strong leadership at all levels of Government and industry; if so, how does the Minister reconcile these requirements with the findings of the CSIRO and the ANAO.Did the Government consider a phased rollout of the NAP in a limited number of regions, as a means of testing the model for its capacity to deliver NRM outcomes; if so, (a) why did the Government decide not to implement the NAP in a staged fashion (in say one or two regions per State) and (b) why did the Government commit to a seven year program costing $1.4 billion to the Australian public, when the outcomes were unknown.On what basis did the Government consider that the NAP/NHT regional delivery model, applied Australia-wide, would deliver NRM planning outputs, financial accountability and environmental quality outcomes that have not been previously achieved by any jurisdiction in Australia. </title></top>

How does the Government propose to implement adaptive management arrangements in the Natural Resource Management (NRM) process to overcome the failures acknowledged by the ANAO.What action is being taken by agencies to remedy shortcomings in the quality of regional plans and to ensure the guidelines are implemented by all NRM groups. In particular, will the Minister provide details of the specific actions, timelines, budgets and staff resourcing to achieve this by the end of the National Action Plan for Salinity and Water Quality (NAP).Will the application of adaptive management principles during the life of the NAP be adequate to (a) deliver the NAP objectives and (b) ensure the establishment of resource condition and management action targets that are sufficiently robust to arrest or reverse declining salinity and water quality.Are NAP agencies using the prospect of adaptive management or continuous improvement as an offset to their failure to require implementation of best practice planning guidelines, such as the National Water Quality Management Strategy (NWQMS) and is incremental change over time a suitable alternative to undertaking competent NRM planning in the first instance.Can the Minister explain how the administration of the NAP can be improved sufficiently for it to achieve its objectives.Has the Government made NAP funding to regions conditional on those regions, as a matter of priority, undertaking supplementary planning to improve the accredited plans, such as for example supplementary planning to implement the NWQMS planning, management and monitoring guidelines.Is the prospect of adaptive management being used by the Government as a response to failing to support the development and accreditation of competent regional NRM plans, for example, NRM plans that implement the National Water Quality Management Strategy. </title></top>

Can the Minister explain (a) why the three-year funding cycles for implementation of Natural Resource Management (NRM) plans is an appropriate arrangement and (b) how the three-year funding cycles would be appropriate for NRM-related non-regional delivery projects, such as, for example, the biodiversity hotspots program; if not, why not.Why is the Government providing comparable levels of investment across the National Action Plan for Salinity and Water Quality (NAP) regions, regardless of the relative quality of those NRM plans and investment strategies.Have the NAP agencies identified and documented the Commonwealth's investment priorities for each NRM region, and the outcomes it plans to secure through the funding of investment strategies; if so, will the Minister provide the investment priorities and intended outcomes for the regions for which three-year investment strategies have been agreed.Which NRM regions have either established or are moving to establish three-year funding cycles and, once three-year funding agreements are established, what capacity is there to adjust the investment strategy to accommodate revised Commonwealth priorities, or to account for new information.Will the Minister explain why a payment was made to an unincorporated body as identified in paragraph 4.17 of the ANAO report which noted that 'one region_.was not an incorporated body at the time of receipt of NAP funds'.Would the Minister estimate the administrative cost to all levels of Government, including the regional NRM group, as a proportion of the overall cost of implementing the NAP and how does this compare to the administrative costs of implementing the first phase of the Natural Heritage Trust (NHT).For each year of the program, will the Minister provide a table of the (a) NAP and (b) extension of the NHT expenditure, accounting for all levels of investment, the proportion of payments made from the respective financial year budget in each month.In respect of the statement in the ANAO report that 'in one State, payments were not released from the SHA to the regions for some 5 months' (a) did the 5 month period overlap financial years, (b) what is the maximum period from which a payment is made by the Commonwealth into a single holding account and the related payment being made by the State, (c) what has been the maximum period between making a payment to a single holding account and the subsequent payment by a State, and (d) will the Minister provide a table that shows on a monthly basis the quantum and timing of payments into single holding accounts and the quantum and timing of payments from those accounts by States/Territories to other parties.In respect of the agreement between the agencies for all future policy processes involving the allocation of public funds to regions or areas of need, to document and demonstrate the comparative assessment of regional needs as a basis to policy decisions, should this principle also apply when allocating future NAP funds between regions and in making Commonwealth investments within a region; if so, what procedures will the Minister require of the agencies in meeting comparative assessment objectives for investment purposes.In respect of statement in the ANAO report that the Collie River catchment and associated initiatives have received NHT funding support and are now 'a priority area for investment under the National Action Plan', (a) is this a priority area of investment in terms of the region, the state or the nation, (b) what are the attributes of the Collie River catchment initiative that makes it a priority for NAP investment, (c) what proportion of the total investment for the relevant region does this 'priority' represent, (d) what are the other NAP investment priorities for this region, and (e) how does this priority compare by way of investment to other priorities in that region.In respect of the statement in the ANAO report that there is 'credible evidence to suggest that once established, dryland salinity is very difficult to contain, or reverse, in some regions' and the statement in the CSIRO/Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) report to Ministerial Council that expressed doubts that the targets in some plans were 'sufficiently robust to arrest or reverse the decline in some catchments', does this mean that (a) public investments in salinity management in some regions are a waste of money, and (b) if management action targets are inadequate for achieving the desired environmental quality outcome in some regions, should these funds be spent in regions where there are more important environmental assets and the potential for environmental protection is greater.Will the Government be focusing NAP investments on preventing future damage to high value assets rather than seeking to improve degraded areas.What priority will the Government give to investments in protecting or improving the condition of public assets, rather than private (eg agricultural) assets. </title></top>
