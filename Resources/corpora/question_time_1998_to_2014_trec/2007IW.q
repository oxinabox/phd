What is the Minister's response to the comments by Malcolm Mackerras that the recommendations of the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters are 'relentless in their pursuit of the electoral interests of the Liberal Party'.Has the Government considered the prediction made by Mr Mackerras that the report's proposed changes to the method of voting for the Senate would 'massively drive up the informal vote'; if so, is the prediction accurate and, if it is not, can the Minister explain why not.What is the Minister's response to the comments by Professor Colin Hughes, who was the Australian Electoral Commissioner from 1984 to 1989, and Professor Brian Costar of Swinburne University that 'if Federal Parliament adopts some of its [the report's] key recommendations, the right to vote will be significantly restricted, thereby diminishing Australia's well-earned reputation as a world leader in democratic practice'.Does the Minister accept the statement in the AEC's submission to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters inquiry that enrolments made during the five working days after the writs are issued are scrutinised with the same degree of rigour as they are in a non-election period; if not, why not and what evidence is there to the contrary.What is the Minister's response to Professor Hughes and Professor Costar's observation that the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters report found that there is minimal evidence of actual roll fraud.Does the Minister intend to implement the recommendation of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters report to (a) change the method of voting for the Senate and (b) close the rolls on the day the writs are issued; if so, what is the Minister's justification for the massive disenfranchisement of Australian voters which the changes will cause. </title></top>

Prior to the privatisation of Sydney Airport, was it subject to price regulation in the form of price notification and price monitoring by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC); if so, did this price regulation include the regulation of prices notification for aeronautical services and monitoring of aeronautical-related services in the Prices Surveillance Act 1983.In December 2000, prior to the expiration of the price caps for Sydney Airport, did the Commonwealth Government ask the Productivity Commission to inquire whether price regulation was required at privatised airports, one of which was Sydney Airport.Did the Productivity Commission opt for a 'light handed' approach in its recommendations, recommending that price caps and prices notification arrangements at Sydney Airport should be replaced by a mandatory price monitoring arrangement for a probationary five year period.On 13 May 2002, did he announce that the Government had accepted the Productivity Commission's recommendations that Sydney Airport be subject to price monitoring for five years, effective from 1 July 2002.On 13 May 2002, did he further announce that the new arrangements would not impact on regional airline operations into and out of Sydney and that regional airlines would continue to be guaranteed reasonable access to Sydney Airport under the slot management system and with a prohibition on any increases in aeronautical charges that exceed the Consumer Price Index.Has he read the ACCC media statement titled ACCC Decision on Sydney Airport Prices (Release MR 110/01, 11 May 2001), which states that a decision was made to increase Sydney Airport Corporation Limited's (SACL) aeronautical revenue in 2000-2001 from around $93 million to around $183 million, an increase of $90 million or 97 per cent, which compares to the increase sought by SACL of around 130 per cent.Since privatisation, has the aeronautical revenue of Sydney Airport increased at a higher rate than the CPI; if so, by what sum for the period 2000 to 2006.Can he confirm that any increase in aeronautical revenue being imposed on regional aircraft seeking to use Sydney Airport results in the financial exclusion of smaller and regional aircraft from Sydney Airport, thus denying such flights reasonable economic access to Sydney Airport; if not, why not.Can he confirm that any increase in aeronautical charges at Sydney Airport will affect the purchase of slots at Sydney Airport and force airlines to choose Bankstown Airport instead; if not, why not.Can he confirm that the current arrangement for airport pricing regulation at Sydney Airport means that Sydney Airport's slot management system is now priced so that only large jet aircraft will be able to afford aeronautical charges at that airport, whilst regional flights will be priced out and hence compelled to use Bankstown airport; if not, why not. </title></top>
