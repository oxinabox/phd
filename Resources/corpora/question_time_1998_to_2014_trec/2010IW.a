The Government estimates that 148,000 new parents will be eligible for Paid Parental Leave (PPL) each year. Parents will be able to choose whether or not they receive PPL. Due to a range of factors it is estimated that around 14 per cent of these eligible parents will choose not to take up the scheme.The net administered cost of the scheme when it is fully implemented will be approximately $260 million per year. The five year cost of $731 million for the scheme includes a small amount of expenditure in the 2008-09 financial year and only two and a half years in which the scheme will operate (from 1 January 2011).</DOC>

The Minister substituted a more favourable decision for that of the Refugee Review Tribunal (RRT) for 1040 persons. The Ministerial intervention process differs fundamentally from the visa determination process, in that the decision to substitute a more favourable decision for that of a review authority focuses on the extent to which the characteristics of the case raise the public interest, whereas a visa determination focuses on whether a person is able to meet the codified criteria for the grant of a visa.None. The power under section 417 is not enlivened where a Court quashes or sets aside a decision of the RRT and the matter is remitted to the review authority to be decided again because there is no longer a review decision to be substituted.</DOC>

Ministerial intervention has been the subject of the Select Committee on Ministerial Discretion in Migration Matters (2004) and the Proust Review (2008) which provided advice on arrangements for the exercise of the Minister's public interest powers.The Proust review made six recommendations in relation to management of the caseload and suggested enhancements for future action, including recommendation 3 of the report that 'all delegable powers, currently exercised by the Minister, be delegated, either to the Department or to the relevant tribunal'. Progress against the recommendation is as follows:delegation of the 197AB power to senior departmental officers is part of the Detention Reform Bill currently being considered by Parliament. The Bill provides that there will be a Ministerial Direction under section 499 as to the exercise of the delegated power once a decision has been made to consider someone for residence determination.the exercise of section 501(1) and s501(2) to refuse to grant a visa or to cancel a visa where the Minister is satisfied that the person does not pass the character test has been delegated to a senior departmental officer. However, cases which are more sensitive or contentious in nature will be decided by the Minister and will not be delegated.section 33(9) which allows the Minister to make a written declaration that a person not be granted a Special Purpose Visa has been delegated.certain ministerial intervention powers have been abolished along with the Temporary Protection visa. These are Subclause 866.228(b) and 866.228A(b), Subclauses 866.222A(2) and 866.222B(2), Subclause 866.214(2), Subclause 866.215(2) of Schedule 2 of the Regulations  - Subclause 866.229(b).Further, the Department continues to identify cohorts of the ministerial intervention caseload which would be appropriate to have their cases resolved within the Department's visa framework.On 14 September 2009, the Migration Regulations were changed to allow certain partners of Australian citizens, permanent residents and eligible New Zealand citizens to apply for a partner visa onshore.Complementary protection legislation has been introduced in Parliament to provide a direct visa pathway for people for whom Australia has a non-refoulement obligation under the International Convention of Civil and Political Rights and the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman and Degrading Treatment or Punishment as part of the Protection visa assessment process.In relation to other delegable powers, the Proust review recommended that it may be appropriate for the Minister to retain personal involvement in the exercise of a small number of other powers such as certain citizenship cases.Section 34 gives the Minister the discretion to revoke a person's Australian citizenship for actions prior to the acquisition of citizenship by application such as false statements and fraud. Section 36 gives the Minister the discretion to revoke a child's Australian citizenship where a responsible parent has ceased to be an Australian citizen in specific situations.There are no plans to delegate the powers under Sections 34 and 36 of the Citizenship Act 2007 due to the small and sensitive nature of these caseloads.</DOC>

The Government borrows by issuing Commonwealth Government Securities (CGS) to financial market intermediaries, who make purchases on behalf of their clients. This process is undertaken by the Australian Office of Financial Management (AOFM).The Australian Government's net debt position remains low by international standards. On current projections, net debt will peak at 10.0 per cent of GDP in 2013 - 14, before falling to 2.2 per cent by 2019 - 20. This compares to a projected net debt of 93 per cent of GDP in 2014 for the major advanced economies collectively.The market for CGS is open and transparent and there are no restrictions on who can purchase these securities. In the year to June 2009, the proportion of CGS held by overseas investors averaged around 59 per cent. This is around the same proportion as when the previous Government was last in office (an average of 60 per cent in the year to December 2007).From 1 January 2009 to 11 August 2009, the AOFM tendered $33.4 billion in Treasury Bonds and $21.9 billion of Treasury Notes.Government repayments on debt are for both coupon payments and payments upon maturity of CGS. No Treasury Bonds matured during the period 1 January 2009 to 11 August 2009.

20 November 2008.Yes, CASA's advice of 8 July 2003 complemented Airservices findings. The concerns were based on significant increases in traffic causing congestion and safety issues on routes out of the Perth terminal area.Refer to (2).and (c) The introduction of a linked STAR system was required to resolve the CASA RCA and this required the entire redesign of the former SID / STAR package.This work was undertaken in two stages, the latter stage included in WARRP.  Perth's route structure now has runway linked SIDs and STARs, segregated flight paths for jets and non-jets, and a reduced number of reporting and crossover points.  CASA endorsed all proposed changes to the air route structure under WARRP prior to implementation.The reduction of incident reports since implementation is a positive indicator that the restructure of routes has helped address the identified safety issues.The Western Australia Route Review Project identified solutions to resolve airspace safety issues.  These solutions were adopted as part of the WARRP implementation.</DOC>

Airservices Australia has advised that:The consultation model employed during the Western Australia Route Review Project (WARRP) is one the organisation has used nationally for airspace reviews for a number of years i.e. where proposals for change are safety driven. The process commenced in 2005/06 under the previous Government, using consultation processes established during the term of the previous Government. In Perth this involved the Perth Airport Aircraft Noise Management Consultative Committee comprised of community representatives, Federal and State MPs, local councils, community organisations and the Western Australian Government.These consultation processes included Airservices regularly updating the Committee on progress of the review, including detailed information on proposed new arrival and departure routes, so that Committee members could inform their respective organisations and constituencies. Information on the review was also posted on Airservices' website.</DOC>

On 15 September 2009, 556 people were detained at the Christmas Island IDC.On 15 September 2009, the Christmas Island IDC had a capacity of 800 at that point in time. Capacity has since been increased.For the period 1 March 2009 to 14 September 2009, 430 irregular maritime arrivals were granted permanent visas, transferred from Christmas Island to the Australian mainland and settled into the Australian community. Due to the regular, high number of client movements between facilities on Christmas Island, it is not possible to say how many clients were granted visas from the Christmas Island IDC itself.For the period 1 March 2009 to 14 September 2009, 45 irregular maritime arrivals were admitted to hospital with a range of medical conditions. The cost of medical care (including medical and hospital services, pharmaceuticals and mental health counselling) for all clients on Christmas Island for this period, based on invoices received and paid, for services up to and including 14 September 2009, was approximately $1.9 million.For the period 1 March 2009 and 14 September 2009, 430 irregular maritime arrivals were granted permanent visas, transferred from Christmas Island to the Australian mainland and settled into the Australian community.Furthermore, a small number of clients would also have been brought to the mainland from Christmas Island prior to security checks being finalised and visas granted. Reasons for these transfers have ranged from individual clients' medical treatment or personal circumstances of their case, to transfer of some clients to Perth prior to their removal from Australia. All clients transferred to the mainland prior to their checks being completed remained in immigration detention throughout their time on the mainland.Due to the regular, high number of client movements between facilities on Christmas Island, it is not possible to say how many clients were transferred to the mainland directly from the Christmas Island IDC.The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade should be consulted for information on the forecast cost for the Ambassador for People Smuggling.For the period 1 August 2008 to 14 September 2009, 1278 irregular maritime arrivals were intercepted and then detained on Christmas Island. Due to the regular, high number of client movements between facilities on Christmas Island, it is not possible to say how many irregular maritime arrival clients were detained at the Christmas Island IDC during this period. Of those detained on Christmas Island:40 percent had been granted a visa. For those that were granted a visa up until 14 September 2009, the average processing time from arrival on Christmas Island to visa grant was 104 days.None.</DOC>

As each State and Territory has different planning regulations and processes, there cannot be a single 'national electronic development assessment system'. Many State and Territory departments and local governments have existing eDA systems, and the electronic development assessment (eDA) 'interoperability specification' (the eDAIS) establishes a national standard for how eDA systems will 'talk to each other'. $29.6 million has been allocated from the Housing Affordability Fund to roll out eDA: $3.6 million to support a common protocol (the eDAIS) for the electronic lodgement and assessment of planning and development applications; and $26 million to assist States and Territories to implement eDAIS-compliant eDA systems targeting high growth areas.The table below shows each jurisdiction's funding allocation which is based on their share of dwelling approvals over the five years to March 2008:State/TerritoryFunding recipientFunding allocatedFunding paid(to 14 Oct 2009)New South WalesDepartment of Planning$5,920,000$2,000,000QueenslandLocal Government Association of Queensland$6,470,000$1,900,000VictoriaDepartment of Planning and Community Development$6,500,000$1,400,000Western AustraliaWestern Australian Local Government Association$3,820,000$800,000South AustraliaLocal Government Association of South Australia$1,790,000$620,000TasmaniaLocal Government Association of Tasmania$500,000$400,000Northern TerritoryDepartment of Planning and Infrastructure$500,000$400,000Australian Capital TerritoryACT Planning and Land Authority$500,000$325,000Payments are made on the basis of agreed milestones specified in the funding agreements. The funding paid to date is detailed in the answer to question 2 above.All eDA funding agreements require jurisdictions to implement end-to-end eDA systems, covering lodgement, referral, tracking through to determination, and complementary business processes; target implementations to high growth areas initially; and ensure all systems implemented conform to eDAIS. While each funding agreement specifies that payment is conditional upon delivering these three elements, the precise requirements for a particular jurisdiction vary depending on the extent and capability of existing eDA infrastructure in the jurisdiction and the amount of funding provided.The role of the Local Government and Planning Ministers' Council is to make decisions on key strategic policy matters that can be addressed at a national level, including ensuring systems provide national consistency where possible. The Council also examines development assessment reforms and considers proposals to improve planning and development assessment processes.All jurisdictions with the exception of Victoria have committed to complete their eDA projects by June 2010. Victoria will complete their project by June 2011.Due to the extent of the IT changes required to implement eDA in all local governments and State and Territory departments and agencies additional investment may be required.Yes, $3.6 million has been allocated to develop, implement and refine the eDAIS, which will provide a national standard for eDA. The funds are allocated to the Western Australian Department of Planning, which is hosting a national project team (the eDAIS National Coordination Office). The eDAIS has been completed. Version 2.2.1 will be submitted to the Cross-Jurisdictional Chief Information Officers' Committee for endorsement as a national standard. It expected to be finalised by the second quarter of 2010. While endorsement has not yet occurred, the eDAIS 2.2.1 is available online, providing eDA system software developers the information they require to build eDA systems which comply with the standard.Moving from paper-based systems to electronic systems is expected to deliver a range of productivity improvements for the development industry including reduced time-related costs through more efficient processes, reduced complexity when interacting with multiple government agencies, and reduced administrative costs through less paper handling. For local governments across Australia, which typically purchase their ICT systems from national software vendors, the common national standard will reduce the long term purchase costs or licence fees charged by the software vendors.</DOC>

Yes.The number at the end of September is not yet available. The number at the end of June was 13,946 with $41,534,000 in balances.Departmental expenses are not available to 15 September 2009. For 2007-08 and 2008-09 departmental expenses were $22.6m, which includes the capital cost of system upgrades.Administered expense forward estimates have been revised because the number of First Home Saver Accounts is lower than allowed for in the original costings.Parameter variations may be made as the program develops and statistics change.The Commissioner generally prepares a single annual report into the administration of all laws for which he has the general administration. It is a matter for the Commissioner to determine the manner in which he wishes to report. Although there is no fixed date, the Commissioner's annual report is expected to be tabled towards the end of October this year.</DOC>

Under Regulation 17 Statements of Compliance are required to be lodged electronically with the Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs (the Department) for approved rental dwellings.Statements of Compliance for dwellings which were available for rent before 30 April 2009 were required to be submitted between 1-13 May 2009. No Statements of Compliance were required after this date.No Statements of Compliance were required after 13 May 2009.No allocations have been revoked.The Secretary has varied special conditions under Regulation 23 in two cases. The first was due to an incorrect special condition made in the letter of offer of NRAS Incentives from the Department, which was accepted by the participant. Following a request from the participant, the Department subsequently corrected this as a variation to the special conditions. The other variation was because the approved participant organisation sold four of its 'adaptable dwellings', proposing to replace these dwellings. The Department has followed up on the replacement dwellings with the participant and is awaiting their confirmation.</DOC>

Indonesia receives this support.In 2007, the Department of Immigration and Citizenship (DIAC) funded the International Organization for Migration (IOM) to deliver a project to improve the management and care of irregular migrants in Indonesia. The decision to fund this project was made by the previous government.This project has supported three facilities in Indonesia.The project included the refurbishment of two Indonesian detention facilities (at Tanjung Pinang and Jakarta) and training for Indonesian officials. Refurbishment was completed in mid-2009. In addition, minor repairs have been completed at Pontianak to fix sewerage.A total of $6.9 million was paid for the project in 2007-08 ($7.7 million was allocated by the previous government but the final cost was lower due to a favourable exchange rate). Project activities enabled by this funding continued to mid 2009. An additional $1 million over two years was committed by the Rudd Government in the 2009-10 budget to provide ongoing support to improve the facilities, staffing and operations of these centres.Although both the previous government and the current government have provided funding to IOM to improve the management and care of irregular migrants in Indonesia, the Indonesian Government is responsible for detention facilities in Indonesia. Standards of health, hygiene, human rights and security in Indonesian detention facilities are matters for the Indonesian Government.Funding provided by Australia to IOM is directed at improving the management and care of irregular migrants in Indonesia. This includes the provision of a range of support services to irregular migrants in both community accommodation and detention in Indonesia, including access to medical support and social workers.In community accommodation the support also includes funded accommodation and the distribution of clothing, towels and bedding items as needed by IOM. Food and basic necessities are also provided. Further, IOM organises excursions and activities for people in community accommodation.In detention centres the support also includes regular IOM staff visits, referrals to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) for assessment of protection claims, and support to the senior Indonesian Immigration officer responsible for the detention facility to cover food, clothing and additional bedding items.Although both the previous government and the current government have provided funding to IOM to improve the management and care of irregular migrants in Indonesia, the Indonesian Government is responsible for detention facilities in Indonesia.

Questions 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5: As per the system established under the previous Government a fundamental tenet of Family Assistance legislation is that families are required to incur a liability for the cost of using child care. Payment of the Child Care Rebate is based on child care attendance information, as reported by the child care providers. Child Care Rebate is not paid when there is no child care usage.These arrangements are in place so that the vast majority of families, who pay their fees on time, are not disadvantaged and receive their correct entitlements in a timely manner. Many families use this assistance to pay any outstanding fees to their child care service provider.</DOC>

The Government intends to declare marine protected areas in Commonwealth waters adjacent to Western Australia under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act) as part of meeting the Australian Government's 1997 national commitment to establish a National Representative System of Marine Protected Areas, and its 2002 international commitment to do this by 2012.The identification of new marine protected areas is being undertaken as part of the marine bioregional planning process. Representative networks of marine reserves are being identified based on the best available scientific information and extensive consultation with stakeholders. The Government is seeking to achieve robust and long-lasting outcomes for biodiversity conservation while at the same time minimising the impacts on marine-based industries and communities dependent on the use of marine resources.The nature and extent of any assistance for businesses impacted by the creation of marine reserves is being considered.</DOC>

Wild catch fisheries are not eligible for EC assistance.EC assistance is administered in accordance with the Farm Household Support Act 1992, the Rural Adjustment Act 1992 and an agreement first signed by the Australian, state and territory governments in 1992 and updated in 1999 (the Agreement). The Farm Household Support Act 1992 and the Agreement define farming as comprising the 'agricultural, horticultural, pastoral, apicultural and aquacultural industries'. It excludes aquaculture from 'harvesting' industries, where farming or cultivating is not an integral part of the operation.Applying EC assistance to the wild catch fishing industry would therefore require the support of all parties to the Agreement, including all state and territory governments. I do not have the discretion to overrule these arrangements. Furthermore, in consultations with the states and territories as part of the national review of drought policy, none has proposed extending EC assistance to wild catch fisheries in general or rock lobster fisheries in particular.The exclusion of wild catch fisheries reflects their 'common property' nature, which means one particular fisher can directly affect the production (output) of others. Consequently, government assistance to one fisher may be detrimental to another's ability to compete. It may also be detrimental to the overall sustainability of the fishery.For exit packages to be effective in fisheries, the agency responsible for providing the assistance, in this case the Western Australian government, must also have control over the management arrangements.</DOC>

The Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations entered into a six month funding agreement with the Australian Services Union on 19 August 2009.The funding agreement is for $132 000 (including GST), and under the funding agreement, the Australian Services Union is undertaking a range of activities, to facilitate the transition of employment services staff to employers working in Job Services Australia.I am advised that as part of the project, the Australian Services Union is surveying workers within Job Services Australia regarding what measures they believe would assist in the retention and attraction of a skilled workforce in Job Services Australia.I am advised the survey closed on 16 November 2009 and participation was voluntary.The terms and conditions on which the funding agreement was agreed were from the standard form funding agreement used by the Department for all funding of projects of this nature. The funding was provided in compliance with Commonwealth Procurement Guidelines.I am advised that the Mandatory Procurement Procedures outlined in Division 2 of the Commonwealth Procurement Guidelines 2008 do not apply, as the Australian Services Union has been provided resources to assist the retention of these skilled workers as a Grant. Therefore a competitive tender process was not required to be undertaken to establish the arrangement.In relation to procurement activities, circumstances where an open tender process is not mandatory are outlined in Section 8.33 of the Commonwealth Procurement Guidelines - 'Conditions for Direct Sourcing', and Appendix A 'Exemptions from Mandatory Procurement Procedures'.The Commonwealth Procurement Guidelines are publicly available and can be accessed on the Department of Finance and Deregulation website.</DOC>

The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare collects annual statistics on child protection in Australia from each state and territory department responsible for child protection. This data is then used to produce the publicly available Child Protection Australia Report. The Child Protection Australia Report is released annually at the end of January following the reporting period. Data relating to 2008-2009 will be available in the January 2010 publication. Data for the period of 1 January 2006 to 30 June 2008 on the number of substantiations of notifications received by family type in which the child was residing is publicly available and can be found as follows:Child Protection Australia 2005-06 page 19Child Protection Australia 2006-07 page 34Child Protection Australia 2007-08 page 36The current child protection data collection does not distinguish married couples from de facto couples.(2)   One of the actions under the National Framework for Protecting Australia's Children 2009-2020 is the reviewing of data definitions for child protection to improve national reporting, with the aim of enhancing national consistency and continuous improvement in child protection services. The Performance and Data Working Group has responsibility for providing specialist technical advice regarding data issues on child protection to the National Framework Implementation Working Group. The current child protection data collection in Australia is complex due to system and legislation variations in each state and territory. The priority of work relating to child protection data is to improve the comparability of the data.</DOC>

WIN Television has advised the Department of Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy that the comments in 'Long wait for HD Television' in the Manjimup-Bridgetown Times of 21 October 2009 indicating WIN and GWN 'were waiting on Federal Government authorisation before High Definition (HD) television screened in the region' do not reflect any public statements it has made about the provision of digital television services to regional Western Australia.The remote and regional Western Australian licence areas are not subject to mandatory HD digital television requirements, in common with several other areas where the commercial broadcasters plan to extend a third digital-only commercial television terrestrial service.However, GWN and WIN do not require any Government authorisation to provide HD digital television services and the decision to do so or not is a commercial one for the broadcasters. Remote and regional Western Australian licence areas cover the whole of the state outside the Perth licence area.On 18 June 2009, the Australian Communications and Media Authority announced that the commercial broadcasters would begin to roll out digital simulcasts of their services in remote and regional Western Australia from 30 June 2009.WIN has advised that TEN WEST service will commence June 2010.See the answer to (1) above.The ABC and SBS deliver the full range of their SD and HD multi-channels to all Australians capable of receiving their digital television terrestrial services, irrespective of where they reside.On 4 November 2009, the Government announced that it had determined a pathway for community television to make the transition to digital broadcasting and that a new community television licensee in Perth will commence digital-only broadcasts in early 2010. It is expected these will be in SD mode.The commercial broadcaster digital television arrangements outlined in the answer to (1) above apply to the whole state outside the Perth licence area.

On 30 October 2009, the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) First Committee adopted a Resolution mandating formal Arms Trade Treaty (ATT) negotiations. The Resolution was adopted 153-1(Zimbabwe) - 19. The Resolution sets out a timetable of Preparatory Committee meetings leading to a Negotiating Conference for a Treaty to be held in New York in 2012. It is expected that this Resolution will be adopted at an UNGA plenary session later this year.While it is not possible to be certain about the exact figure, it is a fact that a regrettably large number of people have been killed and injured as a result of armed violence since the 2006 Resolution.The Government is strongly committed to the negotiation of a robust and widely-supported ATT. Australia participated actively in the UN Group of Government Experts (GGE) established by UNGA Resolution 61/89 on an ATT in 2006. Australia also participated in the ATT Open-Ended Working Group (OEWG) established by UNGA Resolution 63/240in 2008. Australia was one of the seven co-authors of the 2009 UNGA First Committee Resolution mandating formal ATT negotiations. In New York, Australia chairs a group of ATT-supporting countries (the 'Friday Group') which seeks to build wider support for a Treaty among other Member States. Australia attended and chaired one of the sessions of an Asia-Pacific seminar on the ATT sponsored by the UN Institute for Disarmament Research in Kuala Lumpur on 13-14 October 2009. Australia promoted the ATT at a regional meeting on small arms and light weapons hosted in partnership with the UN in Sydney in June 2009. Australia's diplomatic missions have advocated support for an ATT, with a particular focus on countries in the Asia Pacific region.The Government will ensure that sufficient resources are available for Australia to continue to take an active and constructive role in ATT negotiations.</DOC>

$125 000 has been budgeted for 2009/10 Prevention and Community Health Committee (PCHC) activities.The composition of PCHC is not defined under the National Health and Medical Research Council Act 1992 (NHMRC Act), with the exception that one of the members must be a member of the Australian Health Ethics Committee. Members were appointed based on an assessment of their capacity to contribute to the functions of the PCHC (Commonwealth of Australia Gazette, No. GN 11, 25 March 2009).Under Section 41(1)(c) of the NHMRC Act, I must appoint the Chairs and other members of the National Health and Medical Research Council's (NHMRC) Principal Committees. I delegated the appointment of PCHC members to the Parliamentary Secretary for Health, The Hon Mark Butler MP.NHMRC wrote to 113 government, community and professional health and medical organisations seeking nominations for the PCHC. Nominations were also invited from persons who had served on previous NHMRC committees or the Council of NHMRC. Nominations were received from 119 individuals. A full and short list of nominees were provided to me for consideration.When considering appointments I assessed the capacity of nominees to contribute to the functions of the PCHC, including their breadth of expertise and experience in community, public, environmental and Indigenous health, and consumer advocacy.The positions were not advertised via the media. Nominations were sought as per my response to question (d).One of the ten PCHC members is a food and grocery expert. This person has expertise and interests in public health nutrition and improving population health through improving the nutritional quality of the food supply. This person was appointed for individual expertise and not as an industry representative.</DOC>

The 2008 Defence Procurement and Sustainment Review (the Mortimer Review) examined the entire capability life cycle for defence equipment across the Department. It was not a review of the Defence Materiel Organisation alone.
The Government agreed to 42 of the 46 recommendations in full and to the partial implementation of a further three. The recommendation that DMO be made an Executive Agency was not agreed.
Implementation of the Review is progressing, and a number of recommendations have already been fully implemented. These include
the creation of an independent sustainment efficiency office with the DMO, the direct appropriation of service fee funding to the DMO, and the codification of arrangements for the management of the DMO workforce.and (3) Defence is unable to provide costing information for the implementation of each individual recommendation. The estimated cost for the implementation of the Mortimer Review as a whole is $28 million over the forward estimates and $69 million over the decade (2009-10 out-turned figures) of this, approximately $0.5m has been expended to date.</DOC>

Funding is allocated according to the requirements as set out in the National Affordable Housing Agreement (NAHA) and, like other National Agreements, needs to be viewed in conjunction with the Intergovernmental Agreement on Federal Financial Relations (IGA). A copy of the NAHA and the IGA is available on the Council of Australian Government's (COAG) website.The NAHA commits Governments to joint action to achieve the outcome of 'people have access to housing through an efficient and responsive housing market'. The NAHA states that outcomes will be delivered through outputs including the number of zoned lots available for residential construction. Specific agreements have been reached in relation to planning and the supply of lots, including:an audit of surplus land owned by State and Territory Governments;an increase in the proportion of code based assessments;State and Territory participation in the data collection of the national Housing Supply Council to collect the first accurate data on housing supply and demand in more than a decade; andthe rollout of electronic development assessments.</DOC>

Work for the Dole represented only one Mutual Obligation option which job seekers could undertake. Other options included voluntary work, Community Work, participation in the Defence Force Reserves, Language, Literacy and Numeracy Programme and other training courses.The decrease also reflects the strong labour market conditions and low unemployment rate present for much of the 2007/08 period, which subsequently resulted in a reduction in numbers of referrals and commencements into Work for the Dole.</DOC>

 - TheMinister for Employment Participation has provided the following
The Work Experience Placement program was targeted towards the most disadvantaged job seekers commenced in Intensive Support in Job Network, or in the Disability Employment Network, or Vocational Rehabilitation Services. The program allowed eligible job seekers to take part in work experience to gain skills and experience to enhance their employment prospects and encourage more active participation in the workplace. It also aimed to develop job seekers' abilities to work as part of a team and allowed them to demonstrate their capacity to perform productive work. In 2008 - 09, 248 job seekers gained employment with their Work Experience Placement host organisation.For highly disadvantaged job seekers, gaining such real, workplace based experience with a potential employer may be challenging under normal circumstances. The fact that so many highly disadvantaged job seekers were able to participate in such a program was a positive outcome in itself. As a result of their participation, job seekers also obtained employment with organisations other than their Work Experience Placement host organisation, or moved into engagement in other areas, such as study, often after their formal placement had concluded. In addition to the 248 mentioned above, a further 78 job seekers achieved other positive outcomes, such as moving into full or part time employment, and full or part time study.</DOC>

Between 3 December 2007 and 29 October 2009, there were 56 visits to Australia under the Guest of Government (GoG) Program administered by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. This total was comprised of seven head of state visits, 15 head of government visits, 33 ministerial visits, and one royal visit.It is considered that provision of detailed answers to all of the above questions in respect of those visits would require an unreasonable diversion of resources. However, the following general information is provided by way of background.With head of state and head of government visits, the Australian Government accepts financial responsibility for the leader and spouse (if accompanying), and eight party members  -  ie a maximum of 10 people. With ministerial visits, the Australian Government accepts financial responsibility for the minister and spouse (if accompanying), and one other party member  -  ie a maximum of three people.In all cases, if the spouse does not travel, that entitlement is not transferable to another party member.In all cases, the entitlement is for a maximum of five nights/six days. Most visits are for less than the maximum.For heads of state, heads of government and ministers, a suite is provided at the respective hotels. For other members of a party for whom we are responsible, a standard room is provided.A RAAF VIP aircraft is provided (if available) for all air travel within Australia for heads of state and heads of government. Business class air travel on scheduled flights is provided for ministers for travel within Australia.Ground transport for all visits is arranged through Comcar. Up to four vehicles are provided for each visit. Although the principal is always in a Comcar, the other three vehicles can be any mix of cars and/or buses.For GoG visits, gifts are provided to the principal (and spouse if accompanying). Gifts are not provided to other members of a visiting party.One major Australian Government hospitality occasion is provided during each GoG visit. This is usually a lunch or a dinner, but on some occasions has been a reception.For GoG visits, no assistance is provided with international air travel, nor is any assistance provided with layovers in other countries.Travel allowance and travel insurance are never provided to visitors under the GoG program.All of the 56 visits referred to above were funded from the relevant annual
State occasions and official visits

Since the election of the Government, many Government departments and agencies have provided to relevant ministers, and continue to provide, a broad range of advice related to border protection and people smuggling, which includes border security advice, intelligence assessments and legal advice and may include advice prepared for purposes of Cabinet deliberations. Attempting to identify the details of all such advice, and whether any of that advice was of the nature referred to in the question, would require an unreasonable diversion of resources. This conclusion takes into account that the substance of much or all of any such advice would be expected to be subject to public interest immunity claims on grounds including adverse impacts on Cabinet processes, intelligence collection, international relations and law enforcement.Officials in Australia and at overseas posts interact with numerous individuals in regard to immigration and border security issues on a daily basis. Attempting to identify all such communications, and whether any of those communications were of the nature referred to in the question, would require an unreasonable diversion of resources. Moreover, public disclosure of any such conversations may jeopardise ongoing diplomatic relations.</DOC>

&amp; (2) The views of the Australian Government in relation to the expulsion of Mr James Elder, a UNICEF official, were presented to the House in the Ministerial Statement on Sri Lanka that I (Mr Smith) delivered on 14 September 2009. In the Statement, I (Mr Smith) referred to Mr Elder's reported remarks. I added that Mr Elder had been making the point, as had the Australian Government, that we needed to see unimpeded access by international agencies to the camps for internally displaced people. On the same day, 14 September, the Statement was delivered to the Sri Lankan Foreign Minister by our High Commissioner in Colombo, and the Sri Lankan High Commission in Canberra was informed of the Statement. The Government's views were also conveyed directly to Sri Lankan Government officials by Australia's High Commissioner in Colombo.
     
Furthermore, in a tabled response to House of Representatives Question on Notice 996 from Mr Oakeshott of 10 September 2009, I (Mr Smith) said on 20 October that the matter of Mr Elder's visa was one for the Sri Lankan Government, Mr Elder and the United Nations to resolve. Mr Elder and UN officials had indicated to Australian officials that representations by Australia to the Sri Lankan Government regarding the visa were not required.</DOC>

Conclusion of a bilateral prisoner transfer agreement with Indonesia is a high priority for the Australian Government, and discussions between Australian and Indonesian officials are ongoing. It is Australia's long-standing policy, and internationally accepted practice, to keep the nature of international treaty negotiations and discussions confidential between the parties until a treaty is signed. Accordingly, it would not be appropriate to comment on the details of any formal discussions with the Indonesian Government on this matter.

I also undertook a bilateral visit to Pakistan 16-18 February 2009, where I discussed Australia's support for Pakistan's efforts to address extremism with a number of high-level interlocutors.The International Conference on Afghanistan in The Hague on 31 March emphasised the importance of engaging regional countries in promoting stability in Afghanistan. It was co-chaired by Afghanistan, the United Nations and The Netherlands. The conference brought together 72 countries, nineteen international organisations and 700 delegates. The following countries attended: Afghanistan; Albania; Australia; Austria; Azerbaijan; Bahrain; Bangladesh; Belarus; Belgium; Bosnia and Herzegovina; Brazil; Brunei Darussalam; Bulgaria; Canada; Chile; China; Colombia; Croatia; Cyprus; Czech Republic; Denmark; Egypt; Estonia; Finland; France; Georgia; Germany; Greece; Hungary; Iceland; India; Indonesia; Islamic Republic of Iran; Ireland; Italy; Japan; Jordan; Kazakhstan; Kuwait; Kyrgyzstan; Libyan Arab Jamahiriya; Latvia; Lithuania; Luxembourg; Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia; Malaysia; Malta; The Netherlands; New Zealand; Norway; Oman; Pakistan; Poland; Portugal; Qatar; Republic of Korea; Romania; Russian Federation; Saudi Arabia; Singapore; Slovakia; Slovenia; Spain; Sweden; Switzerland; Tajikistan; Turkey; Turkmenistan; Ukraine; United Arab Emirates; United Kingdom; and United States of America. The following organisations attended: Aga Khan Foundation; Asian Development Bank; European Union (EU); International Monetary Fund; North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO); Organisation of the Islamic Conference; World Bank; Islamic Development Bank; United Nations, Mr Ban Ki-moon, Secretary-General of the United Nations; and United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan, UN Special Representative Mr Kai Eide. The following observers attended: ACBAR (Agency Coordinating Body for Afghan Relief); European Parliament; International Committee of the Red Cross; Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development; Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe; and South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation.The statement by co-chairs reflected the outcomes agreed by participants at the International Conference on Afghanistan. The statement emphasised the importance of eliminating sanctuaries for Al Qaeda and other terrorist networks through cooperation among all countries in the region. The statement pointed to the need to develop among Afghanistan, Pakistan and NATO/International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), operating within its current mandate, a comprehensive security strategy. It also noted the need for: greater border security and integrity in the region; clearer and common priorities for infrastructure in the region; expanded regional trade and improved customs and trade and transit agreements; and regional expertise to build capacity in key economic sectors. The statement also expressed support for the FODP and PDC meetings in Tokyo on 17 April and welcomed the increased attention given to Afghanistan and the regional context by conferences in Tehran, Moscow, The Hague, Islamabad and Trieste as important steps in enhancing development and in fighting terrorism, drug trafficking and transboundary organised crime.The FODP ministerial meeting in Tokyo on 17 April demonstrated wide international support for Pakistan in its efforts to address acute security, economic and development challenges. The meeting was chaired by Pakistan and hosted by Japan. The meeting was attended by FODP members and observers from Australia, Canada, China, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Indonesia, Islamic Republic of Iran, Italy, Japan, Kuwait, Malaysia, The Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Oman, Pakistan, Republic of Korea, Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, United States of America, EU, European Commission (EC), Asian Development Bank, World Bank, Food and Agriculture Organisation, International Labour Organisation, International Monetary Fund, Islamic Development Bank, and the United Nations and its agencies: United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHCR), United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) and World Food Programme (WFP).The statement by the chair acknowledged the important role of Pakistan and the sacrifices the Pakistani people had made in confronting terrorism and extremism as well as Pakistan's strong commitment to becoming an anchor of stability and peace in the region. The statement reflected the decision of the FODP to explore all avenues to support Pakistan in realising shared development priorities and addressing security challenges with a focus on less developed areas.The PDC in Tokyo on 17 April highlighted Pakistan's economic and development challenges in light of Pakistan's role in the international community's efforts to eradicate terrorism, and the close connection between Pakistan's stability with the peace and stability of the surrounding region, in particular, Afghanistan. The meeting was co-chaired by Japan and the World Bank. The meeting was attended by FODP members and observers from Australia, Canada, China, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Indonesia, Islamic Republic of Iran, Italy, Japan, Kuwait, Malaysia, The Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Oman, Pakistan, Republic of Korea, Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom , United States of America, EU, EC, Asian Development Bank, World Bank, Food and Agriculture Organisation, International Labour Organisation, International Monetary Fund, Islamic Development Bank, and the United Nations and its agencies: UNFPA, UNICEF, UNDP, UNHCR, UNODC and WFP.The statement by co-chairs conveyed strong international support to the Government of Pakistan and its development strategy. It noted concern about the security situation in Pakistan, and the impact on development, the investment climate and economic growth. The most important outcome was the aid pledged of more than US$5 billion, including Australia's contribution of A$120 million.The FODP Summit in New York on 24 September was co-chaired by the United States of America, United Kingdom and Pakistan. The meeting was attended by FODP members, including: Australia, Canada, China, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, The Netherlands, Norway, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, United Nations, Sweden, Spain, Republic of Korea, United Arab Emirates, United States, United Kingdom, EU, EC, Asian Development Bank, Islamic Development Bank and World Bank.The statement by co-chairs conveyed a strong message of political support for Pakistan's efforts to strengthen its democracy, combat extremism and terrorism, and enhance its development. The statement noted the establishment of a Multi-Donor Trust Fund for regions affected by terrorism, militancy and extremism. It also agreed to the FODP focusing on the reform of Pakistan's energy sector, with the Asian Development Bank playing a role including by preparing a report on energy for the next ministerial meeting of the FODP. The statement endorsed the Pakistan Government's Malakand strategy and reinforced the commitment of FODP members to offer further humanitarian and early recovery assistance for those in areas affected by conflict. It noted the Pakistan Government's commitment to develop a comprehensive approach to addressing security and development in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas. Also highlighted was the need for comprehensive enhancement of Pakistan's institutional capacity and the reinvigoration of the Pakistan Development Forum as a vehicle for substantive policy dialogue between the Government and its international partners. The statement recognised the value of the FODP as a political forum as well as a catalyst for mobilising concrete support for the Pakistani Government.I visited Pakistan from 16-18 February 2009. During my visit, I met President Zardari, Chief of Army Staff Kayani, Prime Minister Gillani, Foreign Minister Qureshi, Advisor to the Prime Minister on Interior Affairs and Narcotics Control Malik and Minister of State for Economic Affairs Khar.In Islamabad, I discussed the expansion of our bilateral relationship including enhanced economic links and ways in which Australia could assist Pakistan's efforts to combat terrorism. I also discussed the importance of Pakistan's determination to eliminate terrorist networks and overcome extremism.The Australian Government has significantly increased its bilateral engagement with Pakistan including: doubling development assistance to $120 million over the next two years (2009-11); contributing $28 million in humanitarian assistance to Pakistan since August 2008; doubling training in Australia for the Pakistan military to 140 places, making Australia the second largest provider of overseas military training to Pakistan after the United States; and expanded law enforcement cooperation. In addition the Government has announced that it will further expand its cooperation with Pakistan by: establishing an Australia-Pakistan Development Partnership; expanding strategic dialogue; and holding regular meetings of the Australia-Pakistan Joint Trade Committee to support closer economic links.</DOC>

The value of the BAF, as at 30 September 2009, was $10,022 million.*Debits from the BAF since its establishment relate to payments for road and rail infrastructure and the national broadband network. To 30 September 2009, payments of $1,065 million have been made from the BAF for infrastructure and national broadband network projects. All the payments were for projects announced in the 2009-10 Budget. Management and operational costs of $2 million have also been paid out of the BAF since the establishment of the fund to 30 September 2009.*There has been one inter-fund transfer of $6,527.87 from the BAF to the Future Fund to cover the cost of legal services in relation to the Nation - building Funds. The costs were paid by the Future Fund and then split between each of the Nation-building Funds. The legislation permits transfers between the funds in relation to investment and operational costs that are shared between the funds. It does not allow for amounts to be transferred between the various funds for the purposes of making payments for infrastructure projects.The current BAF Investment Mandate was issued on 14 July 2009 and came into effect on 29 July 2009.Since its establishment to 30 September 2009, the BAF received earnings net of investment management fees of $149 million.*The Investment Mandate prescribes the BAF benchmark return as the Australian three month bank bill swap rate + 0.3 per cent per annum, calculated on a rolling 12 month basis (net of fees). The mandate has not yet been in place for 12 months.____________________*Responses to Questions 1, 2 and 5 include figures rounded to the nearest million dollars</DOC>

The ABS publishes statistics on iatrogenic deaths annually in
Causes of Death, Australia
(cat. no. 3303.0). Causes of deaths are coded using the International Classification of Diseases (ICD).The ICD is the international standard classification for epidemiological purposes, and is designed to promote international comparability in the collection, processing, classification and presentation of cause of death statistics. The part of the ICD relating to deaths due to complications of medical and surgical care is 'Complications of medical and surgical care (Y40-Y84)'. The 310 individual codes within this codeblock allow for a high degree of specificity when used to assign underlying or multiple causes of death.In investigating an issue such as iatrogenic deaths, it would be appropriate to use both multiple cause and underlying cause of death data. Underlying cause of death is defined as 'the disease or injury which initiated the train of morbid events leading directly to death, or the circumstances of the accident or violence which produced the fatal injury'. Multiple cause of death coding is defined as 'the coding of all morbid conditions, diseases and injuries entered on the death certificate, including those involved in the morbid train of events leading to the death which were classified as either the underlying cause, the intermediate cause, or any intervening causes, and those conditions which contributed to death but were not related to the disease or condition causing death.'For deaths registered in Australia in 2007, there were 4,015 mentions of conditions on death certificates which are listed in 'Complications of medical and surgical care (Y40-Y84)', and 246 deaths which had an
underlying
cause of death within this codeblock. These statistics were released in March 2009.It should be noted that ABS cause of death data for 2007 (and later years) will be revised in future. Revised data for 2007 will be published in the 2008 Causes of Death publication due for release in March 2010, and again in the 2009 publication in 2011. The revision process will enable the use of additional information relating to coroner certified deaths as it becomes available over time, resulting in increased specificity of the previously assigned ICD codes. This has the potential to increase the number of deaths with an underlying cause of 'Complications of medical and surgical care' for 2007 compared to statistics initially released for 2007 in March 2010.</DOC>

It is important to note that 13 week outcomes cannot be fully reported at this stage. Providers have up to 28 days to record these and insufficient time has elapsed to 26 November for this. Also, job seekers in Stream 1 do not yet qualify for reportable outcomes and may have joined services too recently for reportable Job Placements. This age group also includes young people who are Early School Leavers and undertaking training or study job search rather than job search. A key outcome indicator is 26 week employment outcomes, and with a program start from 1 July 2009, there has not been sufficient time to report on this indicator.

Under the extended Australian Health Care Agreements (AHCAs) 2003-09, the Australian Government Department of Health and Ageing collected Admitted Patient Care National Minimum Data Set (NMDS) information that included the International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision, Australian Modification (ICD-10-AM) codes for in-patient hospital procedures.Yes, all procedure and diagnosis codes are included. However, while there are Australian standards, definitions and directives to instruct hospital inpatient coding which ensure high levels of coding consistency across jurisdictions, coding is not an exact science. There may be differences in coding practices between the sectors, jurisdictions and hospitals. Factors that would contribute to coding variation include the level of documentation supplied and established clinician/coder communication channels within hospitals.2007-08.In 2007-08, 39.7% of all separations were from private hospitals; and 60.3% of all separations were from public hospitals.Public hospitals:75.5%.100%.71.6%.Private hospitals:93.4%.99.9%.59.4%.Public hospitals - 3,396,808.Private hospitals - 1,859,023.Note that additional diagnoses codes that contain morphology codes, external cause codes, place of occurrence codes or activity codes have been excluded from this answer.Public hospitals - There was an average of 4.0 diagnosis codes reported per separation.Private hospitals - There was an average of 3.3 diagnosis codes reported per separation.Please note the caveat at 1(a) and that the following information does not necessarily identify infections that have been acquired in hospitals. From July 2010, it will be possible to differentiate those conditions which arose during, or arose before, an admitted patient episode of care through the use of a condition onset flag that has been introduced in the Admitted Patient Care NMDS.Public hospitals:215,046 separations recorded an ICD-10-AM code of 'Y92.22'.3,031 separations recorded an ICD-10-AM code of 'Y95'.19,975 separations recorded an ICD-10-AM code of 'T81.4'.Private hospitals:100,687 separations recorded an ICD-10-AM code of 'Y92.22'.221 separations recorded an ICD-10-AM code of 'Y95'.8,570 separations recorded an ICD-10-AM code of 'T81.4'.Public hospitals:4,740 separations recorded an ICD-10-AM code of 'Z06.8'.8,409 separations recorded an ICD-10-AM code of 'Z06.32'.Private hospitals:1,091 separations recorded an ICD-10-AM code of 'Z06.8'.965 separations recorded an ICD-10-AM code of 'Z06.32'.</DOC>

The Australian Government is universally opposed to the use of capital punishment.  The Government is opposed to all executions that take place throughout the world, including the cases of Lobsang Gyaltsen and Loyak. The Australian Embassy in Beijing made representations to the Chinese Government in April 2009 about the sentence handed down on Lobsang Gyaltsen and Loyak, expressing Australia's opposition to the death penalty and urging China to commute the sentences. The Government cannot confirm that the sentences of Lobsang Gyaltsen and Loyak were reviewed and ratified by the Supreme People's Court.The Government has no information on legal representation and is not in a position to comment on the trial.The Government cannot confirm reports that two further executions were carried out on 20 October 2009.The Government cannot confirm that these three individuals have been handed suspended death sentences in April 2009 in connection with the events in Lhasa on 14 March 2008. No.  The Government will make enquiries through diplomatic channels.No.As part of the bilateral Human Rights Dialogue, the Government urges China to ensure the human rights of all Chinese citizens are fully guaranteed and that due legal process is guaranteed in criminal proceedings.  We also encourage the Chinese Government to establish a moratorium on the use of the death penalty as a key step towards the complete abolition of capital punishment.  We will continue these efforts.</DOC>

The AFP investigation into the matter of Mr Campos was conducted over the course of more than a year and involved complex inquiries into historical matters spanning several countries including Australia, East Timor and the United States. Up until 31 August 2009, the cost of the AFP investigation in Australia and abroad totalled $430,948. AFP travel costs to East Timor amount to $18,396. The costs associated with witness interviews are part of the overall cost of an AFP investigation. Up until 31 August 2009, the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions (CDPP) had not paid any external costs for evidence collection and analysis. Since then accounts have been paid for legal advice totalling $13,420 including GST. No CDPP officers have travelled to East Timor.The AFP investigation in this matter related to offences under the Crimes (Torture) Act 1988 for alleged conduct committed by Mr Campos in East Timor during the 1990s. As Mr Campos is not an Australian citizen, and as he is no longer present in Australia, he is unable to be charged in Australia under the Crimes (Torture) Act. I am advised that for these reasons the AFP investigation into these matters is not continuing.The Geneva Conventions of 1949 impose an obligation on all States to prosecute or extradite a person alleged to have engaged in conduct that amounts to a 'grave breach' (within the meaning of the Geneva Conventions), where a prima facie case is established. It would not be appropriate to comment on whether the conduct alleged against Mr Campos amounts to a 'grave breach' within the meaning of the Geneva Conventions, as this would involve the provision of legal advice on a specific case.Before his voluntary departure from Australia, Mr Campos was lawfully present in Australia on a bridging visa. The AFP investigation into these matters involved extensive inquiries in Australia and East Timor and the investigation was ongoing at the time of Mr Campos' departure. The only lawful means for preventing Mr Campos from departing Australia before the expiration of his visa would have been to arrest him. However, I am advised that the AFP did not have sufficient evidence to proceed with any charge against Mr Campos at that time.As Mr Campos was not at any time present in Australia as an unlawful non-citizen, it was not possible for the Attorney-General to consider whether or not to issue a Criminal Justice Stay Certificate to stay his removal under the Migration Act 1958. In any case, where a Criminal Justice Stay Certificate is issued, it does not prevent a person from leaving Australia voluntarily.</DOC>

The statement of principles referred to in Ms Bishop's question is not in fact a statement by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. The statement was actually adopted by the G8 at a meeting of Justice and Home Affairs Ministers in Washington DC on 11 May 2004. This G8 statement of principles is, however, posted on UNHCR's Refworld site. The Refworld site is a refugee decision support reference site, containing a collection of reports relating to situations in countries of origin, policy documents and positions, and documents relating to international and national legal frameworks.Australia is under no obligation to align its screening processes with those outlined in the G8 document. However, the principle of close cooperation between countries processing applications from asylum seekers to protect these processes from abuse by people who have been involved in terrorist activities as outlined in the G8 statement is one with which Australia strongly concurs.To this end, Australia has developed strong relationships and information sharing practices with a number of countries, taking into account asylum seekers' legitimate confidentiality and privacy interests, to ensure that people involved in terrorist activities are not afforded undeserved protection through the refugee status assessment process.An example of these information sharing practices is that earlier this year, the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship announced that Australia has signed an agreement for biomentric data sharing between Australia, Canada and the UK. Under this partnership, the Department of Immigration and Citizenship (DIAC) will be able to securely and confidentially cross check fingerprints with Canadian and UK databases.These data sharing arrangements will allow DIAC to undertake more detailed identity enquiries if necessary, and to confirm if a client has had dealings with these countries. This will increase the chance of detecting persons of concern in immigration caseloads.The range of background checks undertaken by the Department of Immigration and Citizenship includes identity and character checks which include penal checks, where possible, with all countries in which the client has resided for more than 12 months during the previous 10 years.Australia also conducts background checks in relation to national security and counter terrorism. However, DIAC is not responsible for the processing of these checks other than to provide relevant information to the competent authority, the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation.</DOC>

As at 25 November 2009, there were 89 Australian Federal Police (AFP) officers working on people smuggling, including the investigation of irregular maritime arrivals.The AFP has a flexible workforce and routinely moves resources around the organisation to address emerging crime types. As at 25 November 2009, 8 AFP officers had been diverted from domestic and international duties to focus on irregular maritime arrivals.From 1 July 2009, the Australian Federal Police (AFP) will receive a total of $48.4 million (over two to four years) in additional funding to combat the surge in people smuggling. Under this funding, enhancements are being made to Australian and foreign law enforcement through increased resource allocation and targeted training opportunities. These enhancements will further support regional cooperation to improve intelligence collection, investigational capability, legislative awareness and information exchange to disrupt people smuggling activity offshore.This funding is comprised of the following five New Policy Initiatives (NPIs) which were approved by Cabinet for AFP People Smuggling measures within the region:               Development of Regional Law Enforcement Capacity - $4 million over four years.Enhancing Australia's approach to People Smuggling - $2.6 million over four years.Enhancing AFP Capability to Combat People Smuggling - $10.4 million over four years.Enhancing INP Capability - $15 million over four years.Enhancing AFP and Regional Capacity - $16.4 million over two years.</DOC>

However the response provided in 1(a) provides some indication of time lapsed between payments.The use of government resources to develop a comparable set of answers outside the Survey does         not justify the effort to calculate the average times, when authoritative information on the    Government's performance is available from the Survey.2      (a) and (b) Only one agency reported receiving an invoice for interest on a late payment, for an amount of $30.27. It should be noted that:the late payment interest penalty element of the small business procurement policy commenced on 1 December 2008, half way through the Survey period; andit was restricted to new written contracts of up to $1 million (GST inclusive), negotiated from 1 December 2008.</DOC>

Because Asian honey bees (Apis cerana) are not listed under either the Emergency Animal Disease Response Agreement or the Emergency Plant Pest Response Deed, the Commonwealth Government has no formal obligation or requirement to contribute to the response. However, through the Office of the Chief Veterinary Officer within the department the Commonwealth has provided expert technical assistance to the on-the-ground response in the areas of epidemiology, digital mapping and ornithology (location and monitoring of Rainbow Bee Eaters).Further DAFF has assisted Biosecurity Queensland in the preparation of their response plan and has convened the Consultative Committee on Asian Honey Bees to consider the response plan, develop a nationally coordinated response to the incursion and lead discussions on the potential for cost-sharing the response between industry and governments. DAFF will also lead deliberation within the National Management Group (representing governments and industry) to reach a consensus recommendation as to whether a cost-sharing arrangement between governments and industries to fund the response plan should be undertaken and provide such a recommendation on cost-sharing to the Primary Industries Ministerial Council.</DOC>

From 1 May 2010, Medicare item 702 and nine other health assessment items will be superseded by a series of four time-based health assessment items. This is part of the Government's response to the Medicare Benefits Schedule Review of primary care items to simplify the Schedule, reduce red tape and encourage prevention.No. From 1 May 2010, the regulations governing where a health assessment can be performed and who can perform it, under Medicare arrangements, will not change.The current arrangements for health assessments, which require General Practitioners (GPs) to provide the majority of the service, will continue. Under both current and future arrangements, the GP must also make a personal attendance on the patient. A practice nurse may assist a GP in performing a health assessment, in accordance with accepted medical practice and under the supervision of the GP. This may include activities associated with information collection and providing patients with information about recommended interventions at the direction of the medical practitioner.</DOC>

It is a requirement of the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 that all clinical investigational use of a product in Australia be registered with the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) where that use involves a product not entered on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods, including any new formulation of an existing product or any new route of administration; or a use of a registered or listed product outside the conditions of its marketing approval. The TGA has no 'clinical trials exemption' or 'clinical trials notification' registered on its database under these requirements in respect of dichloroacetate (DCA).In addition, the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ANZCTR) is an online register of clinical trials being undertaken in Australia and New Zealand. The ANZCTR includes trials from the full spectrum of Australian therapeutics. There are no clinical trials of DCA for the treatment of cancer presently registered in Australia under these arrangements.In 2007, researchers at the University of Alberta found that DCA shrank in vitro rat cancer cells. There are a number of clinical trials underway and planned in the USA and Canada further to this result in respect of DCA. These are:

No. Imported vegetables undergo rigorous screening before they can be released from quarantine. Each consignment is sampled and visually inspected by the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) and some vegetables must comply with additional pre-export conditions and/or treatments. Under the AQIS inspection scheme that tests food for food safety, horticultural products are subject to testing at the rate of 5% of consignments for the presence of 49 agricultural chemicals and in some products, heavy metal contaminants. Controls on domestically produced horticultural products are the responsibility of states and territories.No. If, Australia imposed what were perceived to be barriers on imports, such as insurance bonds on overseas suppliers and/or Australian importers, it could expect equally unjustified conditions to be applied to our exports.</DOC>

The BER program is an Australian Government initiative, underpinned by a strong partnership approach with state and territory governments and non-government education authorities to deliver the Building the Education Revolution (BER) in accordance with the National Partnership Agreement on the Nation Building and Jobs Plan: Building Prosperity for the Future and Supporting Jobs Now.In the context of the National Partnership Agreement, states, territories and Block Grant Authorities are responsible for implementing the BER program, including meeting all obligations under Commonwealth and State legislation, ensuring the most appropriate facilities are funded according to each schools' priorities, and managing tendering and procurement activities, such as the procurement and installation of turf products.My Department has received advice from the Western Australian Department of Education and Training (WA DET) and the New South Wales Department of Education and Training (NSW DET) about this issue.WA DET requires that contractors ensure all turf is installed in the appropriate manner on school sites and a certificate is provided stating that turf installed on site is 'sting nematode free.'NSW DET's Schools Facilities Standards include a standard specifically for landscaping, whether for new construction or refurbishments. This standard encourages the use of native plant species; provides advice on potentially toxic species and referencing sources for further information; and provides guidance on selection and location of turf and grass species. BER funded projects in NSW public schools must comply with the Schools Facilities Standards.The BER program assurance framework includes monitoring of BER projects and the implementation by education authorities of the BER. Education authorities are required to report monthly to DEEWR on project progress, including commencement and completion dates.</DOC>

The Government commissioned a review of the Australian Defence Force Cadets Scheme in June 2008 to make recommendations on actions required to improve the scheme to ensure that it is achieving its specific objectives in an efficient and effective manner.In May 2009, the Government accepted the Defence response to the review, agreeing to 30 of the 48 recommendations. The Review findings referred to in paragraphs 2.8.7. and 2.8.8. of the report; to establish a single Commander of the ADF Cadet Scheme, was not agreed. Instead, an alternative model was adopted which sees the intent of this recommendation preserved through changes to formalise and enhance the governance and accountability structure for the Cadet Scheme while preserving the administrative responsibilities vested in the Service Chiefs.The Vice Chief of the Defence Force, through the Cadet, Reserve and Employer Support Division, is responsible for coordinating implementation of the Review recommendations relating to governance, compliance, assurance, reporting and audit, development of joint policy and a shared services approach to areas such as IT, administration and business processes. Significant progress has been achieved in establishing a cadet governance framework through the creation of a hierarchy of strategic guidance committees and several crucial single issue working groups.Defence's Management Audit Branch is to conduct an audit of aspects of the ADF Cadet Scheme commencing this financial year, including financial compliance, the adequacy of the processes of allocating funding to Cadets, the effectiveness of Cadet information technology systems and Occupational Health and Safety issues related to Cadets, including facilities and firearms.</DOC>

As at September 2009,23,460 Totally and Permanently Incapacitated (TPI) disability pensioners who receive an eligible income support payment from either my Department or Centrelink received some increase.5,362 TPI disability pensioners did not receive a benefit as they were not in receipt of an eligible income support payment.Of those TPI recipients who received a benefit, their total average fortnightly payment from my Department is $1,444.89. This fortnightly payment ranged from $1052.30 to $1694.00, for singles and from $1044.90 to $1694.00 for partnered TPI pensioners. These figures comprise both TPI and service pension. TPI pension is an amount of $1,022.10 per fortnight.(ii)

Some TPI pensioners may be impacted by the new income taper rate for the assessment of income support payable. The income taper rate increased from 40 cents (20 cents per member of a couple) to 50 cents (25 cents per member of a couple). Pension is reduced in this manner for income exceeding the threshold of $248 per fortnight for couples and $142 for singles. This same taper rate is used for both service pension and Centrelink pensions. Those affected by the new taper rate are protected by transitional provisions which remain applicable until their assessed rate under the new taper rate is higher.</DOC>

The Budget measure focuses on building capacity to address terrorism challenges in South-East Asia. The Government has made no specific funding commitment for counter-terrorism activities solely in Indonesia. However, Australia and Indonesia have had first-class cooperation in counter - terrorism matters over a number of years and the Government is committed to continuing close cooperation in the future.</DOC>

The Australian Government is firmly committed to efforts to protect and promote human rights in Afghanistan, and continues to monitor developments in relation to the Shia Personal Status Law (SPSL), which came into effect on 27 July 2009. The Government supports efforts by the international community, led by the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA), to seek clarification from Afghan authorities of the provisions of the SPSL and their implications for the rights of women. These efforts have been hampered by the absence of an official English-language translation of the law and by uncertainty about how the legislation would be applied in relation to other relevant Afghan laws.and (3) The Australian Government has made formal representations on the SPSL to the Afghan Government in Kabul and in Canberra. The Deputy Head of Mission at the Australian Embassy Kabul made representations on the SPSL to the Afghan Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) in May and June 2009. The Afghan MFA noted Australia's concerns on this matter. DFAT senior officials also made representations on the SPSL to the Ambassador of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan in Canberra in June 2009. The Ambassador undertook to relay Australia's views to Kabul. Further representations were made by DFAT senior officials on two occasions in January 2010. Subsequent to these discussions, the Afghan Embassy advised that it had confirmed that no official English-language translation was available. The SPSL has been discussed in the course of the Australian Government's regular engagement with Afghan authorities and international partners in Kabul on a range of Afghan matters. In September 2009, I raised the issue of women's rights in the Group of Friends of Afghanistan meeting in New York, which was attended by Afghanistan's (then) Foreign Minister Spanta. In my address at the London Conference on Afghanistan in January 2010 I raised the importance of the Afghan Government meeting the needs of women and girls.</DOC>

This stands in contrast to the record of the previous Coalition Government, who repeatedly dismissed the prospects of international legal action and refused to undertake monitoring of the Japanese whaling fleet in support of potential legal action.</DOC>

The promulgation of the 2025 Australian Noise Exposure Forecast (ANEF) does not of itself impact upon the Development Applications by landowners in this circumstance. The landowners' Development applications are affected by the Council's Development Control Plan (DCP) which gives effect to the impact of any changes in the 2025 ANEF.
Landowners may choose a discretionary mechanism to attempt to obtain compensation for changes between the 2012 and 2025 ANEFs.6 October 2009.The new ANEF 2025 was released to the public on 23 October 2009. a letter was sent to the Port Stephens Shire Council on 12 November formerly advising them of the final ANEF maps release.ANEF 2025 was made publicly available on the Defence website after its endorsement on 23 October 2009. Some minor cosmetic changes to the title block of the map were required to be made. This accounts for the delay in the final date of release of 23 October 2009. Importantly these amendments did not involve any change to the contours on the map.The development of an ANEF and the development of a Public Environment Report (PER) are two separate processes. Given that aircraft noise is one of the significant environmental considerations for Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) introduction, it was logical for the ANEF 2025 and the New Air Combat Capability Draft PER to be developed in parallel. However, whilst ANEF 2025 figures were depicted in the Draft PER, ANEF 2025 remains a separate document developed through a separate process.No. The development and approval of ANEF is an internal Defence process. However, while this is an internal process to Defence and external approval by other Ministers is not required, any directions or conditions (such as planning or environmental restrictions) must be factored in when developing the ANEF.No. The Draft PER was conducted voluntarily by Defence in order to inform Defence's referral of JSF operations to Department of Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts (DEWHA) under the
Environment Protection &amp; Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999
at a future date. When Defence refers JSF OPS to DEWHA, that department will decide the scope of environmental study and public consultation required in order for JSF operations to be formally approved. This further study (likely to be an Environmental Impact Statement or PER) will be subject to DEWHA approval. As part of this process the Minister for Environment, Heritage and the Arts may impose conditions that require refinement of JSF operations and therefore refinement of ANEF 2025.</DOC>

Of the actual hours flown in the aircraft, less than 5% are expected to require the use of weapons ranges such as Salt Ash Air Weapons Range. While Air Force aims to minimise the environmental impacts of use of weapons ranges, some use is required to ensure operational proficiency.</DOC>

The insertion of gold fiducial seeds into the prostate and their use as markers for Image Guided Radio Therapy (IGRT) in the treatment of prostate cancer are new medical services that have not had their safety, effectiveness and cost effectiveness evaluated by the Medical Services Advisory Committee (MSAC).Item 37218 is payable for an injection into, or a needle biopsy of the prostate. The term 'injection' in the context of this item was intended for the injection of antibiotics or other medicines.In January 2010, the Faculty of Radiation Oncology, RANZCR, committed to providing an application to MSAC for an assessment of IGRT (using gold fiducial seeds as markers). As a consequence there will be no changes to the item descriptor at this time.In the interim, my Department has agreed that item 37218 can continue to be used for the insertion of gold fiducial seeds.</DOC>

In 2005 the Republic of Hungary requested the extradition of Mr Charles Zentai to face prosecution for a war crime allegedly committed in World War II. Any extradition request received from Hungary is considered on its merits in accordance with the requirements of the
Extradition Act 1988
(Cth) and the Extradition Treaty between Australia and Hungary. On 12 November 2009, I made a final determination under the Extradition Act that Mr Zentai should be surrendered to Hungary. The extradition process does not involve an assessment of guilt or innocence. I arrived at my determination following careful consideration of the provisions of the Extradition Act and Treaty between Australia and Hungary and taking into account relevant representations and considerations.
Matters relating to the investigation and prosecution of a person for a war crime offence in Australia are matters for the Australian Federal Police and the Office of the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions as independent statutory authorities. Allegations of war crimes committed overseas can give rise to complex legal and factual issues that would need careful consideration by law enforcement agencies. As a matter of longstanding practice, Australia supports prosecution of offences in the country in which the offence occurs.Following his initial arrest in Perth on 8 July 2005 Mr Zentai was granted conditional bail. He remained on conditional bail until 22 October 2009 at which point he was committed to Hakea Prison under the Extradition Act in accordance with the orders made by a magistrate in extradition proceedings, to await my final determination whether he was to be surrendered to Hungary. Mr Zentai continued to be held in custody, as is required under the Extradition Act, following my decision that he should be surrendered. On 4 December 2009, an application was filed in the Federal Court on behalf of Mr Zentai seeking judicial review of my determination that he be surrendered to Hungary. As part of Mr Zentai's application to have my determination judicially reviewed, he also sought interlocutory orders that he be released on conditional bail. On 16 December 2009, the Federal Court determined that it had the power to release Mr Zentai on bail. The Federal Court granted Mr Zentai interlocutory relief, and released him on bail pending the hearing of the judicial review application. At the hearing before the Federal Court the Commonwealth did not oppose bail. The judicial review application has been listed for hearing on 31 March 2010.</DOC>

An insurer can decide to refuse to sell OVHC to someone or set higher premiums for people at greater risk of claiming (for instance, elderly persons with a pre-existing illness). OVHC is also sold by some private health insurers outside of their core business. It is not considered health insurance business which is regulated under private health insurance legislation.</DOC>

THE ASIA - PACIFIC
A COMMUNITY FOR THE 21ST CENTURY
SYDNEY
3-5 DECEMBER 2009
CONFERENCE SUMMARY RECORD
 a community for the 21st century', was held in Sydney, Australia, from 3-5 December 2009. It was hosted by the Australian Prime Minister's Special Envoy on the Asia Pacific community (APc), Mr Richard Woolcott AC, and co-chaired by Dr Michael Wesley, Executive Director of the Lowy Institute for International Policy, and Madame Ton Nu Thi Ninh, President of the Founding Committee of Tri Viet International University, Vietnam. The conference was attended by over 140 academics, commentators and senior government officials from the 21 countries visited by Mr Woolcott during his regional consultations on the APc and also from Australia, along with experts on regionalism from France, the United Kingdom and Germany.The Prime Minister of Australia, the Hon Kevin Rudd MP, addressed the conference's opening session on 4 December. The keynote speech was delivered by former Prime Minister of the Republic of Korea, Dr Han Seung-soo. The Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Hon Stephen Smith MP, addressed the conference dinner on 3 December.The conference was not an inter-governmental negotiation nor did it attempt to reach agreed conclusions or present recommendations. It was a '1.5-track' gathering of participants from both non-government and government sectors, participating as individuals under 'Chatham House' rules. As intended, it was a discussion  -  held in plenary and 'breakout' sessions  -  to further explore the idea of a leaders' level APc, as proposed by the Australian Government.
The APc initiative
Prime Minister Rudd first proposed the idea of an APc in an address to the Asia Society AustralAsia Centre in Sydney on 4 June 2008.Mr Rudd proposed that regional countries discuss the development of an APc which would have the right membership and mandate to address economic, security and other transnational challenges at leaders' level. Mr Rudd has made the point that the movement in economic and strategic weight to the Asia Pacific is set to continue and will provide significant opportunities, but also challenges. He has put the case that intensifying inter-connectedness and inter-dependency calls for increased consideration of what arrangements can serve to manage regional stresses and strains, and that it is in the region's interests to work cooperatively and actively to shape improved regional arrangements.Mr Rudd announced in his speech in 2008 the appointment of former senior diplomat and head of Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Mr Richard Woolcott AC, as his Special Envoy on the APc, charged with conducting consultations with governments and non-government stakeholders across the Asia Pacific.Between September 2008 and March 2009, Mr Woolcott visited 21 countries, holding discussions with more than 300 individuals, including more than 30 ministers and eight heads of state or heads of government.Mr Rudd wrote to leaders in May 2009 outlining the main conclusions of Mr Woolcott's report to him on the regional consultations and inviting them to send representatives to a 1.5-track conference to further discussions on the initiative.The Prime Minister announced the conference publicly in a speech to the Shangri-la Dialogue on 29 May 2009. In that speech, Mr Rudd said that an APc couldhelp ensure that the process of regional economic and financial integration is driven forward;nurture a culture of cooperation and collaboration on security; andprovide a vehicle for discussion and cooperation on other challenges such as climate change, resource and food security and terrorism.Further to his speech at the Shangri-la Dialogue, Mr Rudd spoke with regional leaders about his initiative at the East Asia Summit in Hua Hin, Thailand, on 25 October and at the APEC leaders' meeting in Singapore on 14-15 November. His Special Envoy also had further high-level discussions in Washington and New York in October and Singapore and Jakarta in November.
Address to the conference by the Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd
it was dynamic and was rapidly becoming the centre of global economic and strategic weight, driven by the rise of China and India and long-standing powerhouses such as Japan and the United States as the continuing superpower;it was becoming infinitely more connected, increasing the importance of robust pan-regional institutions to enhance the positive dimensions of growing regional interconnectedness and manage any negative impacts;it faced a number of emerging challenges includingthe need for a balanced model for regional growth,competition for scarce resources,unresolved border disputes, along with large and growing militaries and continuing regional flashpoints,non-traditional security threats,climate change,a confluence of interests of five major powers  -  the United States, China, India, Russia and Japan.History should caution regional countries not to assume that peace, harmony and concord were pre-determined; common security had to be crafted by nation states driven by common purpose. The United States and China had so far managed their interests well on a largely bilateral basis, but it may be that in the future this would be supplemented by emerging regional institution building.Moreover, challenges were not static; the prospects for rapid change were great. Regional countries could draw lessons from the G20's response to the global financial crisis: we needed to be alert to where our trajectories were leading us and to ways we could cooperate more closely on our shared interests. We needed actively to shape our regional future. Key questions for the conference were:how do we best manage our region's dynamism, inter-dependency and common challenges?how do we ensure outward-looking regionalism continues as the bedrock of Asia-Pacific integration?how do we foster a deeper regional culture of cooperation and entrench habits of cooperation and so avoid any future conflict?how do we craft integrated solutions to complex and multi-faceted problems?Mr Rudd said the Australian Government had deliberately not sought to answer fully questions about what sort of APc was required, but had sought to stimulate a dialogue, and it valued the counsel of senior regional statesmen. The regional conversation had been enhanced by the contribution of Prime Minister Hatoyama of Japan on the future of our region.From Australia's perspective, an APc would need to:engage all countries that made up the region, including the United States, and have ASEAN play a major role;be able to traverse all of the major questions that affected our region  -  political, economic and strategic  -  in an integrated way;shape the habits of transparency and trust and foster the instinct of cooperation; andmeet at leaders' level, as only leaders could fully connect economic, strategic, environmental and political issues.It was, however, also clear that the region did not need a supra-national decision making structure, an additional institution or a further leaders' meeting. Instead, regional countries needed to discuss how to 'evolve an Asia-Pacific region from our existing regional institutions  -  rather than try to start completely afresh'.Mr Rudd said that some options were to:do nothing  -  exposing countries to weaknesses in current architecture;build an entirely new institution from the ground up; orbuild an APc using existing architecture such asAPEC (which would need to admit India and take on a more defined security mandate),the EAS (which would need to increase its membership to include other key players),or by bringing APEC and the EAS together, bringing with it the benefit of a single leaders' meeting or cluster of meetings  -  an arrangement that could be extended by merging the wider range of regional bodies to bring together political, economic and security agendas.Mr Rudd urged conference participants to settle on ideas and principles that would guide future discussion and find a mechanism to continue the conversation on an APc in a constructive way.The full text of the speech is available on the Prime Minister's website www.pm.gov.au
Address by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Stephen Smith
 terrorist attacks; people smuggling; and latent security problems such as on the Korean Peninsula.Regional integration had underwritten the economic success of our region, but the region could not rest on its laurels. Regional countries needed to ensure a meaningful, long-term response to the global economic crisis by entrenching good economic policy and structural reform. The region also needed to be able to respond rapidly with significant assistance to natural disasters.None of these challenges could be addressed or resolved by any one nation; they could only be addressed by nations in the region acting together.Mr Smith said the lessons of a regional approach were clear from cooperation in the Asia Pacific. The stability, prosperity and regional cooperation ASEAN had fostered since its establishment had been an important achievement; the ARF was gradually developing a role in preventive diplomacy; the EAS was an increasingly productive forum; and APEC had become vital to building consensus around open markets, trade and investment.The Minister said, however, that as valuable as existing groupings continued to be, there was a need to examine closely the regional architecture and consider how it might best be developed to serve our interests into the first quarter of the 21st century and beyond. Australia had asked whether the present regional arrangements were equipped to enable all the key Asia Pacific players to have a conversation in the same room at the same time about trade and investment and also about peace, stability and security.APEC and ASEAN would have central roles to play into the future, but we needed to recognise the gaps that existed and consider how to address them. An Asia Pacific community would: encourage further economic and financial integration; foster a culture of deeper collaboration and transparency in security; and drive cooperation on the range of transnational challenges.Mr Smith said the APc initiative was not about supplanting or diminishing the roles of existing regional groupings, especially the centrality of ASEAN; it might emerge from the existing architecture just as the ARF and the EAS had emerged from ASEAN.
Keynote address by Dr Han Seung-soo, Former Prime Minister, Republic of Korea
 the region's dynamism was most clearly manifest in its impressive economic growth, which would be sustained and accelerated by the removal of trade barriers. The region's huge potential for further growth and movements towards sub-regional integration were likely to raise its profile internationally. The growing economic influence of the Asia Pacific region had also considerably bolstered its strategic significance. Furthermore, the region was of monumental importance in global security: the North Korean nuclear issue posed a threat not only to Northeast Asia, but to the rest of the world.Dr Han said it was imperative for countries of the Asia Pacific to respond to these trends. The question was: how do we align the recent positive developments in the Asia Pacific to achieve our strategic objectives in ensuring security and stability?Dr Han believed the region could play a pivotal role in five major areas:conceiving viable solutions for the global financial crisis in other regions (drawing on the lessons of the 1997 Asian financial crisis) and advocating free trade;leading international cooperation to address climate change through a coming together of developed and developing countries to articulate a single voice that the rest of the world could follow;narrowing the development gap by expanding and improving development assistance;bringing North Korea back to the negotiating table, serving the interests of regional security and supporting the vision of a 'nuclear free world'; andcontinuing to provide innovative solutions to non-traditional security threats such as maritime security, piracy, human trafficking, narcotics and terrorism.Dr Han maintained that existing regional mechanisms lacked sufficient mandate and capacity to solve effectively new challenges. The scope of the problems confronting the region rendered urgent calls to create more effective cooperation structures to supplement extant mechanisms. A new structure could be constructed either by readjusting existing mechanisms or forming a new structure to replace current arrangements. Mr Rudd's APc initiative and Prime Minister Hatoyama's proposal for an East Asian Community had emerged against this backdrop and both deserved serious consideration.Dr Han said the process of reshaping regional architecture should be guided by a number of principles, taking into account the complexities and diversity of the region:the process should be inclusive;ASEAN should continue playing an instrumental role;a clear standard of contribution from participating countries should be set; andthe new framework should not be duplicative.Dr Han said he believed that the enthusiasm surrounding the new proposal of an Asia-Pacific community for regional governance indicated wide support for new multilateral institutions with broad mandates to respond to the changed geopolitical context of the region. The conception of an APc also stemmed from the acknowledgement that the current mechanisms no longer sufficed to comprehensively deal with all the major challenges.An Asia Pacific community that included key global players such as China, Japan, India, the United States and Indonesia as well as other countries in the region would substantially improve the region's capabilities to deal with the challenges of the 21st century. Possible models for an APc included:expansion of APEC through the addition of political and security issues to its economic agenda and the inclusion of countries not currently members; andexpansion of the EAS, allowing the participation of other key players in the region.As the G20 had emerged as the premier forum for global governance, building a new Asia Pacific community should be closely coordinated with the G20 process.Dr Han proposed establishment of an APc Eminent Persons' group to devise a 'concrete action plan for the eventual creation of an Asia Pacific community'.
Conference discussion
This summary seeks to reflect the free-flowing and open nature of discussion over the six separate breakout sessions and concluding plenary session of the APc conference. As was made clear by the conference host and co-chairs, the conference was not a negotiation and did not seek to be conclusive. Rather, it was intended to enrich and take forward the regional discussion of an APc, which had been proposed by Prime Minister Rudd.
The region
Participants agreed that the region was increasingly interconnected and that many of the challenges facing regional countries needed to be addressed on a regional basis (although some observed that some challenges might better be addressed globally). The region was going through a profound transition, both in terms of its internal power balances and in relation to its overall global power and influence. The rise of the Asia Pacific was positive and needed to be facilitated.
Challenges
the confluence in the region of the interests of and, potentially, competition among the great powers  -  the United States, China, India, Russia and Japan;maintaining economic growth;rebalancing economic relationships (including rebalancing debt in the United States against surpluses in Asia);the build-up of regional militaries;arms control and non-proliferation;competition for scarce energy and water resources;ecological challenges such as climate change;the need to distribute more equally the benefits of globalisation;demographic challenges such as ageing populations;unregulated migration;transnational crime, including terrorism and the illegal movement of people;calls for civil and political rights that could be seen to impact on political stability; andthe need to meet demands for human security through freedom from want and fear while not violating states' rights.
Existing regional institutions
 it did not wish to be non-cooperative nor defensive and was changing to fit current needs. Others took the view that while ASEAN had been successful in building a community in South-east Asia, it was not necessarily optimally placed to play the role of 'institution builder' in the Asia Pacific. Regional institutions in their current form did not reflect an emerging 'new regional order' and partly for this reason the Asia Pacific region had not had a strong enough voice in global conversations.While there were differing views on its achievements and effectiveness, it was clear that ASEAN's role was valued. Its future role was a subject for discussion. Were ASEAN and ASEAN-based bodies able to tackle hard security problems and/or drive concrete outcomes? Some participants took the view that the ARF in particular faced significant challenges: it had, for example, achieved some success on confidence-building measures, but to the extent it had begun moving on preventive diplomacy, progress had been very slow and it was not equipped to respond to the larger task envisaged in the Asia Pacific community initiative of discussing together security, political and economic challenges. Whether ASEAN could remain as cohesive as in the past was also discussed.
APEC's role as the premier forum for facilitating economic growth, cooperation, trade and investment in the Asia Pacific region was widely acknowledged. Its practical achievements were, however, thought by some to be difficult to measure. In contrast to APEC's free trade goals, there were multiple preferential trade agreements in the region, many of which were driven by strategic or defensive rather than economic interests. Moreover, it was not clear whether APEC was robust enough to tackle emerging challenges such as energy and food security. The presence of non-state members Taiwan and Hong Kong would have to be taken into account in any proposal to develop a security agenda.
An Asia Pacific community
 an evolutionary approach to regional architecture whereby a focus on identifying challenges and delivering results through closer cooperation would, over time, clarify what institutional arrangements were required; or a more active approach which would focus sooner on structural changes that might be required in the face of emerging regional challenges. A few participants put the view that there was no need for change at this time and that existing structures would adapt if and when the need arose.Questions were raised about the capacity of a single institution to deal with the diverse range of issues facing the region. Some put the view that while imperfect and untidy, networks of existing institutions and state and non-state actors might be best suited to addressing complex and changing challenges. Multi-layered and overlapping approaches to regional architecture might be more effective than a single institution which could become overloaded. It was, however, suggested by others that the inseparability of economic, political and security challenges demanded the attention of leaders gathered in one place, noting that only leaders were in a position to address all three of these types of challenges together in the one national viewpoint. The two approaches were not necessarily exclusive.There was a broad, though not unanimous, view that that APEC and the EAS could be the potential building blocks for an Asia Pacific community. If this approach were developed, in the case of APEC, it would be necessary to admit India and develop a security agenda; in the case of the EAS, it would be necessary to consider admitting the United States and Russia.There was a widely-expressed view that it was necessary to define the meaning of 'community'. A community could be a customs union, an integrated economic system or a loose-knit grouping within which common interests and cooperation could develop into institutional arrangements. Participants noted variously that a community should encompass common identity, interests, purpose and norms.Regionalism and a sense of community were underpinned by the presence of driving factors, including:common or converging strategic interests;clarity of purpose;historical factors;an incremental build-up of habits of cooperation and institutions;economic imperatives; andcommon security problems.A view was put that that any successful future Asia Pacific community would need to: include principles of equality and transparency; take into account the security and development needs of all its members; and involve close collaboration between the principal powers, including China and the United States.The idea of creating an Eminent Persons' Group to take forward the APc initiative, suggested by Dr Han in his keynote speech, was also raised by several participants. Some put the view that this would be a useful further step, while some others found the idea premature at this stage.
was there value in a regional approach, as distinct from a global approach, to meeting present and future economic/financial challenges, geostrategic/security challenges, environmental and other political/social challenges and the interconnections between them?what kind of institutional role would be required to add that value and how crucial was it that this integrate economic, security and other issues (as distinct from addressing them in separate silos)?how should the region be configured for this/these institutional role/s?how would we move institutionally from where we were now to where (as a result of answers to the above), we wanted to be, given: the lack of support for any supra-national executive structure or brand new institution superimposed on all others; the continued significant role for ASEAN; and support for an evolutionary process?
Observations by Madame Ton Nu Thi Ninh, co-chair
 could any single structure cope with such interconnectedness and complexity? To be effective, any mechanism(s) responsible for managing future regional challenges would need to be flexible, adaptable and dynamic. There should be resistance to the desire to be 'neat' for its own sake. Rather than a single framework or institution, a 'modern' approach may be a flexible, modular one where countries were present in some institutions or discussions, but not others.
Communities emerged from perceived common challenges, threats and interests from which common goals and objectives could be identified. As the discussion about regional architecture was taken forward, it would, however, be important to pay attention to 'style and approach'. Pace and momentum would need to be considered. In developing regional architecture, there would be an element of 'right place, right people, right moment'.Factors which might shape membership of any APc included economic inter-linkages, geostrategic weight, ability to contribute, peer acceptance, and geography. In considering membership, it would also be important to get the right balance between effectiveness and inclusiveness.Madame Ninh said ASEAN was an indispensable grouping within the Asia Pacicic community, but precisely what it could contribute in the future was an open question. Once ASEAN was convinced of the need for change, it would move forward. In her view, membership of the G20 by an ASEAN country would not detract from and, in fact, should be a plus for ASEAN.Madame Ninh noted that the inclusion of the United States and Russia in the EAS made realpolitik sense, but remarked also on what she saw as Asia's growing sense of shared identity and the fact that some countries would be less comfortable than others with the inclusion of these two powers.
Observations by Dr Michael Wesley, co-chair
the core of an APc should be an annual leaders' meeting with a mandate to engage across the breadth of the security, economic and political challenges facing East Asia and the West Pacific;an APc should complement other regional and global institutions, and might arise out of the evolution of existing multilateral arrangements;an APc should draw on the important role ASEAN continued to play in the evolution of regional multilateral arrangements, and ASEAN would be an important part of any future APc;an APc should promote a market-driven regional economy that was open to the world;an APc should enhance regional stability through dialogue on traditional and non-traditional security threats and seek to develop confidence and security building measures across the region;APc countries should have a history of significant engagement in East Asia and the West Pacific across economic, strategic and political arenas; andAPc countries should have a demonstrable vital interest in  -  and capacity significantly to contribute to  -  the economic, strategic and political circumstances of East Asia and the West Pacific.Dr Wesley said he believed that there was more support among participants for evolving current institutions than for doing nothing, or creating a new body from the ground up. The best approach to regional architecture would involve a balance between activism and gradualism. He also supported Former Prime Minister Han's suggestion of an Eminent Persons' Group or similar senior advisory body to consider the most appropriate means for movement towards the creation of an APc.
Observations by Richard Woolcott, conference host
the conference had achieved its stated objectives. While it was not a negotiating body, a wide range of interesting and mainly forward-looking opinions, as well as some concerns, were expressed. The discussions were frank and sometimes robust, which we had hoped they would be.Prime Minister Rudd's concept had been refined and had gained momentum, especially in recent months, since he had first put it forward on 4 June 2008.there was a consensus that there was a need to discuss and consider now the implications for the region of the continuing shift in economic and strategic influence from the Atlantic to the Pacific.the opinion was widely held  -  although there were some participants who considered existing institutions adequate for the task  -  that present arrangements had neither the mandates nor the memberships to deal comprehensively, at head of government level, with the major security and political issues the region can expect to face as the coming decade unfolds.the attitudes of government participants from key countries on the call for a more effective regional architecture and the need for an APc were evolving in a positive direction. South Korea's existing support had been explicitly and publicly strengthened.a number of participants spoke of a possible linkage between an institutionalized G20 and the APc concept. The G20 had demonstrated the value of addressing collectively global financial issues. Some participants said a similar logic could be applied to any emerging arrangements for an APc as well as to the need for links between global and regional institutions.The host believed the outcome of the Conference would provide the Prime Minister and other regional leaders with useful ideas for the next steps in progressing the concept of an APc, including continuing to promote a growing culture of cooperation across East Asia and the Pacific and developing some broader principles for a future APc.

I am advised that, as at 23 November 2009:718,513 households had received assistance under the Home Insulation Program, including the Low Emission Assistance Plan for Renters (LEAPR).Due to the significant number of claims for assistance that were received under the Program, the Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency (DCCEE) has provided the data requested in a weekly breakdown (Attachment A).The Program's objectives were measured in terms of the number of houses insulated and not categorised into electorates automatically. DCCEE is not able to provide the installations by electorate as it would require a manual process requiring a dedication of significant resources.$904,095,440 had been paid in assistance for claims made under the Program.I am advised that the average rebate:from the commencement of the Program to 31 October 2009 was $1,348.42.from 1 November 2009 to 23 November 2009 was $1,023.55. This figure does not include the manual top up payments required for claims lodged in the transitional period for the installation payment changing from $1,600 to $1,200.The table below shows the total number of claims lodged per month and the total amount of assistance paid in respect of these claims.

Radio broadcasting
During May and June of 2009 the radio industry switched on digital radio services in Adelaide, Brisbane, Melbourne, Perth and Sydney. Consideration of the complex policy and planning issues involved in the regional rollout of digital radio is underway and engineering advice on spectrum requirements is being developed by the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA).The Government will conduct a review, by 2011, into alternative terrestrial and satellite digital radio technologies that may be appropriate for regional areas. This review will address the fact that the digital radio technology being used in metropolitan areas (known as Digital Audio Broadcasting Plus, DAB+) is unlikely to be able to replicate the extensive broadcast coverage of some regional AM services.
Digital television
On 5 January 2010, the Government announced that it would fund a new satellite service to provide digital television to viewers in remote licence areas and those in metropolitan and regional licence areas who are unable to receive the terrestrially-delivered digital television services provided by commercial broadcasters licensed for their area.In addition to the full range of ABC and SBS digital television services, the satellite service will feature a range of commercial services equivalent to those available in metropolitan areas - this includes three core channels feature content from the Seven, Nine and Ten Networks plus digital multi-channels such as GO!, 7TWO and ONE HD. The satellite service will also provide eligible viewers with access to the local news and information regional commercial broadcasters provide their terrestrial licence areas.On 18 March 2010, the Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (Digital Television) Bill 2010 (the Bill) was introduced into the House of Representatives. The Bill establishes the legislative framework for the commercial broadcasting digital television services that will be delivered as part of the new satellite service.The Bill also introduces measures to allow all commercial free-to-air digital television services, including digital multi-channels such as GO!, 7TWO and ONE HD, to be provided terrestrially to a small number of licence areas where historically there were fewer than two commercial broadcasters.The Bill amends the
Broadcasting Services Act 1992
to allow commercial broadcasters in regional South Australia, Griffith and Broken Hill to apply for a third, digital-only commercial licence giving them the opportunity to provide a full suite of digital television services in their licence area.
Convergence
Australians living in remote and rural areas are already able to access radio and television services on the Internet. Examples of such services could be online radio, Internet Protocol Television (IPTV) and video-on-demand services. These services are delivered by traditional broadcasters as well as new providers, and may be viewable on traditional platforms such as television sets as well as convergent devices such as smart phones and tablet PCs. The range of services available to consumers will increase consistent with improvements to broadband infrastructure from technology advancements and ongoing investment.A key trend in the broadcasting sector is convergence, which refers to the merging of different forms of technology to provide the same services. The Government has flagged its intention to consider in 2011 whether to look again at its overall approach to regulation in a convergent environment in the
 Regulatory Reform for 21st Century Broadband Discussion Paper
and the
 Future Directions
paper. A key theme in these considerations will be the scope for winding back industry-specific regulation once the National Broadband Network is firmly established as an open access, wholesale-only, national network. The Government has also indicated that it will look at a range of issues in this review such as media diversity, ownership controls, audience reach rules and local content obligations.</DOC>

 Only DHA owned properties are encompassed by this response on the grounds that lease expiries will take many of the DHA leased properties out of the portfolio by the time the 2025 ANEF is effective.There have been no Development Applications for DHA houses within 2012 ANEF noise affected areas.
             
and (vi)There have been 10 Development Applications for DHA houses within 2025 ANEF noise affected areas. Six of these were approved six months before the public release of the 2025 ANEF (October 2009) and four were approved 18 months before the public release of the 2025 ANEF.None.DHA is not required by legislation to retrofit noise attenuation measures to existing houses that might be affected under the 2025 ANEF. However, DHA on its own initiative may retrofit noise attenuation measures, but no decision will be made on such action until the 2025 noise contours are finalised by Defence.</DOC>

To be eligible for the Healthy Communities Initiative Local Government Area (LGA) Grants pilot phase, LGAs were required to meet a number of targeting criteria. These criteria included: socio economic status and rates of overweight and obesity. To help ensure pilot LGAs had the optimum chance of being successful, additional factors were taken into consideration including capacity to undertake the project. During theselection process the Department was also mindful of the Government's Social Inclusion agenda and Priority Employment Regions. Where possible, the Department sought to align the invited LGAs with these regions whilst still
having regard to the need to ensure
the pilot phase had a diverse range of implementation models across a range of population sub groups and geographic locations. In addition, the selected LGAs incorporated the recommendations put forward by the states and territories. As only 12 grants are available in the pilot phase a small group of LGAs meeting the targeting and capacity criteria were invited to apply.A list of the 42 LGAs invited to apply during the Healthy Communities - LGA Grants pilot phase is at
Attachment A.The first phase of the Healthy Communities Initiative LGA Grants is a pilot and not all potentially eligible LGAs such as Port Macquarie-Hastings, Kempsey and Greater Taree, could have feasibly been invited. The Department of Health and Ageing is keen to ensure the pilot phase trials a diverse range of implementation models across a range of population sub groups and geographic locations. In this context, the Department applied a number of targeting criteria (as outlined above) and then invited a small group of geographically and socially diverse LGAs to apply under the pilot phase.Phase 2 and Phase 3 will be a competitive process open to all LGAs. It is anticipated Phase 2 will be advertised nationally in mid 2010. A total of 92 grants will be provided across all three phases.

and (8) As Minister for Foreign Affairs, I have had some engagement with representatives of Securency International Pty Ltd on the following occasions:Securency Managing Director Mr Myles Curtis attended a dinner hosted by me on 26 August 2008 during a visit to Canberra by Brazilian Foreign Minister Amorim. There were 21 attendees at the dinner including members of Minister Amorim's party, Brazilian and Australian officials, and representatives of Australia's business and other interests engaged with Brazil. Dinner guests were asked to speak briefly about their organisations' engagement with Brazil and Mr Curtis spoke about Securency in that context.I raised Securency with Indian Finance Minister Mr Chidambaram in New Delhi on 12 September 2008. Also present at the meeting were Australian and Indian officials. During the meeting, I asked about a possible trial of Securency polymer notes by the Indian Government. Mr Chidambaram responded that the Indian Government was considering whether a trial would proceed.During a visit to Mexico, I attended a lunch hosted by the Australian Ambassador in Mexico City on 18 November 2008. At the lunch, I was introduced to a representative of Securency in Mexico, Dr Jaime Pacreu. There were some 25 people at the lunch, including Mexican Government officials, representatives of the private sector, including Australian companies active in Mexico, and members of the diplomatic corps.During a visit to Santiago de Chile, on 27 August 2009 I attended an Australian Business Club reception at which I was introduced to a representative of Securency in Chile, Mr Guillermo Montt. Present at the reception were some 40 to 50 guests, including representatives of Australian companies active in Chile, other private sector representatives and government officials.There may have been other occasions that I have attended business-related functions at which representatives of Securency have been present.I do not regard the attendance of business-related functions at which Securency representatives have been present as comprising the 'making of representations' or 'lobbying' on behalf of Securency.I became aware of the allegations against Securency on 23 May 2009. I have made no representations on behalf of Securency since 23 May 2009.and (5) Long-established portfolio procedure has been applied to establishing the bona fides of, and providing assistance to, Securency.For a business to receive the support of the Australian Government, the business must be an Australian business that contributes to the Australian economy; and/or have a reasonable proportion of its workforce employed in Australia. Heads of Mission or posts are asked to judge whether a company meets these criteria when assisting companies overseas.Advice from Austrade assists this assessment, including information Austrade may hold in respect of Australian business registration details, the proportion of Australian ownership, and an assessment of the significance of the net return to Australia from the proposed activity.Securency's bona fides as an Australian company seeking support for its activities overseas had been established for some time. Ministers and officials of the Australian Government have been making representations on behalf of Securency since the mid-1990s. For example:during a visit to Pakistan from 6 to 10 February 1998, former Minister for Foreign Affairs Mr Downer raised Securency's interest in selling polymer banknotes with the Pakistani Minister of Finance and the Governor of the State Bank;during a visit to Chile from 5 to 7 September 2001, former Minister for Trade Mr Vaile discussed Securency with Central Bank President Massad;during a visit to Mexico from 7 to 9 September 2002, former Treasurer Mr Costello participated in the media launch of Mexico's 20 peso polymer note produced with Securency; andduring a visit to India from 18 to 19 February 2003, former Minister for Trade Mr Vaile promoted Securency's polymer banknote technology to then Indian Minister of Finance Singh.and (7) Consistent with the portfolio's long-established practices, Ministers and officials of the Australian Government, including officers of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and Austrade, have provided advice and assistance to Securency since the mid-1990s.The advice and assistance has been provided in Canberra and at multiple posts. It is not possible to provide a list of every instance of contact between DFAT and Austrade officers and Securency dating back to the mid-1990s, or of the associated cost.The portfolio undertakes advocacy on behalf of Australian commercial interests overseas in a number of ways including:making government to government representations on behalf of the business or industry where:Australian interest is served; and/orbarriers to trade exist;facilitating contact between Australian businesses and the host country government and business interests, including through functions, promotional activities and participating in trade missions.Austrade provides services to Securency in line with the agency's role as the Government's trade and investment development agency.Securency has contracted Austrade to arrange independent background checks on its network of agents. These checks are typically sourced through local third party service providers. Austrade also has a number of client service agreements to provide general information and marketing support in selected overseas markets, as requested by Securency.The services provided by Austrade to Securency have been in line with those available to all Australian exporters and the majority have been on a fee-for-service basis.</DOC>

The Australian Government has raised concerns about the treatment of Baha'is with the Iranian Government on numerous occasions.I (Mr Smith) raised these concerns with Iran's Ambassador HE Mr Mahmoud Movahhedi on 11 February 2010. I also discussed the treatment of Baha'is with Iran's Foreign Minister HE Mr Manuchehr Mottaki in Tokyo on 17 April 2009.Senior officers have raised Australia's concerns with Ambassador Movahhedi on several occasions, most recently in a meeting on 11 February. Australia's Ambassador in Tehran has also raised the issue with the Iranian Government at senior officials level on multiple occasions over the past two years.Australia co-sponsored a Canadian resolution on the human rights situation in Iran, which was adopted by a vote in the Third Committee of the United National General Assembly in November 2009, and which specifically addressed Iran's treatment of Baha'is. Australia raised concerns about human rights in Iran, including treatment of Baha'is, in our National Statement on Human Rights delivered in the UN General Assembly in October 2009.Officials from the Australian Permanent Mission to the United Nations delivered a statement on the human rights situation in Iran during Iran's appearance before the UN Human Rights Council's Universal Periodic Review Working Group in Geneva on 15 February 2010. In its statement, Australia recommended Iran ensure that the trials of seven Baha'i community leaders currently in detention were fair and transparent and conducted in accordance with international standards and that Iran amend all legislation that discriminated against minorities.
Australia also raised the human rights situation in Iran in our 'item 4' statements on country-specific situations of serious concern at each of the three UN Human Rights Council sessions in 2009, referring to Iran's treatment of Baha'is as a specific concern.</DOC>

Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprise (MOGE) is under the direct control of the Burmese regime and is a part of the Ministry of Energy. Details of the arrangements for individual oil and gas projects in Burma are not readily available. Based on the information available, I am advised that in oil and gas projects initiated by foreign companies, MOGE plays a role in representing the Burmese authorities.Australia's autonomous targeted financial sanctions list in relation to Burma is comprised of named individuals, not entities. I indicated in my Ministerial Statement of 8 February 2010 that the Burma sanctions list announced in October 2008 will remain in operation for the present.Consistent with past practice, any update to the sanctions list will take into account personnel movements in the regime and further information about members of the State Peace and Development Council, ministers, senior military officers, prominent business associates of the regime, and immediate family members of these individuals.</DOC>

The 'Hot Ops Jobs' website no longer exists on the Defence Restricted Network or the Army Internet website.A webpage titled 'Operational Employment Information' has replaced the 'Hot Ops Jobs' website. It provides guidance to Australian Regular Army members on operational deployments via the Defence Restricted Network. Although Army Reserve Officers are able to view the website, the number of Army Reserve Officers who have accessed the website cannot be determined, as the metrics in place do not provide this particular information. It is also not possible to determine how many Army Reserve members have been deployed as a result of accessing the 'Operational Employment Information' website, since the webpage directs members to their individual career managers to discuss their deployment interests.</DOC>

The Australian National Audit Office Audit Report No. 31 2008-09 Performance Audit Army Reserve Forces was released on 14 September 2009 and detailed the findings of an audit into Army Reserve Forces. The audit's four recommendations and Defence's progress in responding to these are as follows:Considering the Army Reserve's current role and the existing work being undertaken towards developing its 2016 Approved Future Force structure, the ANAO recommends the Army reviews its policies related to the location of Army Reserve units to take into account the cost of operating a dispersed organisation against the capability offered and the desire to maintain a public presence.Defence status:Army has completed the Army Reserve Approved Future Force and has grouped it under the 'Rebalancing Army' (RBA) initiative. The implementation plan for the RBA initiative is currently being developed and has not yet been provided to Government. Upon completion and approval of the RBA initiative, changes will be implemented supported by a comprehensive change management and communication strategy.The ANAO recommends that Defence uses a periodic assessment of costs to bring together appropriate cost information related to the Army Reserve, to inform longer term decision making.Defence status:Cadet, Reserve and Employer Support Division, in consultation with the Services and Chief Finance Officer Group, is currently developing a baseline data set to determine appropriate cost information of the Reserves to inform longer term decision making. This data set will be the standard for future assessments as a means of calculating the cost of Reserves. It is expected to be finalised by 31 December, 2010.The ANAO recommends that the Army:request current Reservists to provide relevant information relating to their civilian qualifications and skills;where this information is provided, record it on Defence's existing personnel management database, PMKeyS; andstreamline the approval processes for the recognition of civilian skills and qualifications.Defence status:
             
Defence ensures all Army Reservists have adequate access to the Defence Restricted Network; andDefence considers developing an internet portal or similar facility for Army Reservists to facilitate individual's update of their personnel data.Defence status:
             
Reserve access to the Defence Restricted Internet is currently subject to projects being coordinated by the Information Communication Technology Stream of the Strategic Reform Program. Reserve access to the Defence Restricted Internet will be significantly enhanced during the second half of 2010, with the procurement and release of additional Defence Remote Electronic Access and Mobility Services (DREAMS) tokens as an interim measure.As per (a).The barriers identified by the ANAO largely relate to the differences in conditions of service and entitlements between Australian Regular Army and Army Reserve members, which are reviewed periodically. The Army does not perceive these issues as impediments to movement between different categories of service for all members. However, it may influence the decisions of a small number of personnel.</DOC>

Defence
White Paper 2009
detailed the Government's intent to make better use of ex-Regular ADF personnel and enhance the use of the Reserve including the High Readiness Reserves (HRR). The extension of the Graded Officer Pay Scale (GOPS) and Graded Other Rank Pay Scale (GORPS) to Reservists has increased the attractiveness of Active Reserve service to members separating from permanent service. Reserve conditions of service and employment will be reviewed as part of the Strategic Reform Program 'Reserves Reform Stream'. The intended outcome is to maximise the transfer of separating full time ADF members to Reserves, lengthen the tenure of already trained Reserve members, and attract fresh Reserve members with required core or niche skill sets.</DOC>

In respect of the Defence Indigenous Development Program in the 2009-10 budget and forward estimates (Department of Defence, Defence Portfolio Budget Statements, Canberra, page 96):Yes.Yes, with the following results:20 trainees participated on the course and 10 trainees graduated on 16 December 2009.Five graduates achieved the Certificate II in General Education for Adults. The remaining five achieved Certificate I.All 10 graduates achieved the Certificate II in Rural Operations.Job placements were identified for the majority of the trainees prior to graduation.The program will be delivered on behalf of Army by NORFORCE, in 2010. Currently 29 trainees are undergoing an orientation program at the Katherine Rural College.It is intended that the 2011 programs will commence in April 2011 in Katherine and Cairns providing places for a similar number of trainees.The $3.308 million budgeted for this program in 2009-10 was broken down by Defence's Chief Financial Officer Group as follows:The total sum budgeted by Army for NORFORCE to run the pilot course was $1.187 million. This amount only includes the direct costs of the program. Defence did not track the specific cost of a range of support such as clothing and meals provided during the military training components of the course.The balance of funds allocated to Defence Groups for the ongoing delivery of the Army and Navy components of the program is $1.576 million. As at 22 February 2010 the notional balance is $0.657 million. Defence does not routinely track the specific costs of administrative support across the Groups.</DOC>

The Government recognises the concerns expressed by the veteran community regarding the indexation of military superannuation pensions. In acknowledgement of these concerns the Government commissioned an independent expert review - the Review of Pension Indexation Arrangements in Australian Government Civilian and Military Superannuation Schemes, conducted by Mr Trevor Matthews.The review considered whether the current Consumer Price Index (CPI) indexation methodology for pensions for Australian Government civilian and military defined benefit superannuation schemes should be changed.The report of the review, released on 21 August 2009, recommended no change to the indexation arrangements.Mr Matthews recommended that pensions from the Australian Government civilian and military superannuation schemes continue to be indexed by the CPI as it is the most suitable index to protect pensions against inflationary price increases.The Government fully supports the findings and recommendations of the report.Mr Matthews did not consider it inequitable or unfair that civilian and military superannuation pensions are increased on a different basis to the Age or Service Pensions. He considered that they are different benefits provided for different purposes and therefore can be increased on a different basis.That is, Mr Matthews is drawing a distinction between the obligation of the State to provide an income support safety net to its more disadvantaged citizens and the obligation of the State (as an employer) to provide superannuation to its employees and former employees.Mr Matthews considered that the CPI should be retained as the basis for indexation of civilian and military superannuation pensions, unless a better measure of changes in the cost of living for superannuants becomes available.</DOC>

and (ii) The proposed expenditure of $28 million over the forward estimates and $69 million over the decade provide for the ongoing implementation of the Mortimer reforms. Examples of specific funding requirements include funding the General Manager Commercial position recommended by the Review, the recruitment of a specialist team to provide expert analysis of cost, schedule and risk implications of major project proposals and strengthening the customer supplier agreements between the Department of Defence and the Defence Materiel Organisation.Salary and other personnel-related expenses have accounted for the majority of expenditure to date. For example, the specialist team providing the analysis of cost, schedule and risk implications of major project proposals has been established.The Mortimer (Procurement and Sustainment) stream is one of the 'non-savings streams' of the Strategic Reform Program. While direct cost savings are not anticipated, the blueprint document entitled 'Strategic Reform Program: Delivering Force 2030' released by Defence on 4 June 2009 notes that the non-savings streams 'will help to keep costs down through better quality planning, cost estimation and control'. The Mortimer reforms are a critical enabler of efficiencies in major Defence capital equipment acquisitions and in the through-life support of that equipment.</DOC>

Database records indicate that, up to 1 March 2010, seven permanent protection visa recipients and two humanitarian visa recipients were proven to have committed offences under section 234
Migration Act 1958
for providing forged, false or misleading documents or false or misleading information to Commonwealth officials in connection with immigration or visa application procedures. In each case, criminal penalties were applied but visas were not revoked.There is no offence in the
Migration Act 1958
of obstructing a Commonwealth official in their duties. Database records relating to offences contained in other legislation for obstruction of a Commonwealth official do not always indicate whether the charge was related to immigration procedures or people smuggling. Identifying links between general charges for obstruction of a Commonwealth official and immigration or people smuggling is not feasible as it would require manual examination of a large number of prosecution files spanning a number of years.

The total cost of the contract for the project is $5,020,091.3 sites in the Woden precinct and 4,400 handsets were included.The procurement was undertaken as a direct source arrangement in accordance with the Commonwealth Procurement Guidelines.The project was not market tested. Gartner, an independent information technology research and advisory company,
advised that there are a very limited number of suppliers of Voice Over IP (VoIP) equipment and systems. These suppliers and other ICT service providers to the Department were approached to provide an indicative proposal which allowed the Department to assess the indicative market costs of a VoIP solution.Yes.IBM, NEC, AVAYA and Optus submitted proposals.IBM, whose offer was accepted, provided a quotation of $5,074,369.The quotations from NEC, AVAYA and Optus were provided on a Commercial-In-Confidence basis.An additional proposal was received post contract signature from CDM Australia on 2 September 2009. The proposal was a broad solution and did not give sufficient technical detail to provide assurance to the Department that the solution offered would deliver the Department's requirements.The value of the proposal was $3.911m in Capital, and did not provide costs for ongoing management support and operational costs. The solution provided connectivity for only 3200 staff, 1,100 handsets below the Department's requirement.The Department did not respond to the vendor.The Department sought appropriate advice in relation to the development of the technical requirements, with decisions around the procurement being undertaken on the basis of that advice by departmental officers. The departmental officers involved in the decision making process do not have any conflicting interests, real or perceived, in relation to the decision outcomes.</DOC>

During this period the current control on the number of medical places that universities can offer will continue.It is likely that controls on Commonwealth-supported medical places will remain under the new funding system from 2012. However, the demand driven funding system will give the Government the ability to increase the number of medical places universities can offer without introducing new budget measures.The Government's decisions about Commonwealth-supported medical places will be informed by Health Workforce Australia advice on workforce demand and the capacity for clinical and postgraduate training.</DOC>

Xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus (XMRV) is a human virus that has been found in tumour tissue of patients with prostate cancer and the blood of people with chronic fatigue syndrome. The medical research literature on the topic is equivocal as to whether the virus may play a causative role in these conditions.The Department is not aware of any pathology laboratory that offers testing for this virus in Australia.If such a test were generally considered by the medical profession as necessary to the appropriate treatment of patients then a Medicare benefit would be payable under item 69494 of the Medicare Benefits Schedule.</DOC>

The Government is aware of media reports that on 28 December 2009, the Xining Intermediate People's Court found Mr Dhondup Wangchen guilty of 'splitting the motherland' and sentenced him to six years in prison. However, the Government has not been able to confirm Mr Dhondup Wangchen's situation with Chinese authorities.On 3 March 2010, the Australian Embassy in Beijing made representations to the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs on individual cases of concern, including Mr Dhondup Wangchen and sought information on his status, location and condition.While recognising that China has made some progress in human rights over the last 30 years, the Government remains concerned about human rights issues in China, including freedom of speech, freedom of media, freedom of religious worship, open and transparent trials, and the use of the death penalty. The Australian Government raises its concerns with China, including raising individual cases of concern, through bilateral exchanges with senior political leaders and officials, diplomatic channels, and the Australia-China Human Rights Dialogue. We will continue to raise Mr Dhondup Wangchen's situation with the Chinese Government.</DOC>

The Government recognises that Griffin Coal is a significant regional employer in the South West of Western Australia and that any potential closure of its operations would have an adverse impact on not only the employees and their families but the region as well. The Government has been and will continue to closely monitor developments with Griffin Coal. It should be noted that Griffin Coal is in administration and its current operations continue until there is an outcome from the administration process.In the event that a company goes into liquidation, employees of Griffin Coal will be able to seek assistance from the General Employee Entitlements and Redundancy Scheme (GEERS). The GEERS assists employees who have lost their jobs and are owed certain employee entitlements when a liquidator or trustee in bankruptcy has been appointed to their employer. Entitlements under GEERS include up to three months unpaid wages for the period prior to the appointment of the insolvency practitioner, unpaid annual leave, unpaid long service leave, up to a maximum of five weeks unpaid payment in lieu of notice and up to a maximum of sixteen weeks unpaid redundancy entitlement. The Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations administers GEERS.</DOC>

The Commonwealth and State Territory Governments have worked with the National E-Health Transition Authority to put in place robust and rigorous security measures to limit as far as possible any potential security risks and to impose significant penalties for unauthorised or inappropriate use of healthcare identifiers held by the Healthcare Identifiers Service.These measures are being implemented through a number of strict security and privacy protections - both in the legislation and the technical design of the HI Service.These include:The Federal Privacy Commissioner's role has been extended in the HI legislation so that she has the authority to conduct investigations into the inappropriate use of healthcare identifiers.The information maintained by the HI Service has been strictly limited to Name, Date of Birth, Sex, and Healthcare Identifier number in most instances, with other information such as Address and Birth Order only recorded when necessary to administrators and the Service. Individuals who wish to use anonymous healthcare will still be able to continue to do so and pseudonyms may be issued by the HI Service in special circumstances.The system design does not allow for an identified healthcare provider, that is, an individual provider that has been assigned a HPI-I or an organisation assigned a HPI-O to 'browse' the records held by the Service Operator. A request by an identified healthcare provider for a patient's identifier will only reveal an IHI when there is an exact match with patient information provided by the healthcare provider.Each time a record held by the Service Operator is accessed by an identified healthcare provider, the details of who has accessed the record and when, will be recorded in an audit log.Medicare Australia will be the initial operator of the HI Service. As a trusted government authority, Medicare has the national infrastructure, as well as the industry and community relationships needed to securely deliver and maintain the healthcare identifiers. As a statutory agency, Medicare Australia is governed by national legislation that sets out the scope of the functions it can perform and the privacy and security it must maintain for the personal information it holds.Medicare Australia has established additional preventative measures including education and training for all Medicare Australia staff members, a proactive audit program, and having a range of actions in place (including fines and dismissal) for handling privacy and security breaches.</DOC>

Background.
protect the Australian community from public health and safety risks;contain public expenditure on health care and community services; andsafeguard the access of Australian citizens to health care and community services that are in short supply.Active tuberculosis (TB) is the only condition that in itself will prevent the grant of a visa to Australia as it is specifically mentioned in the regulations and is also considered to be a 'threat to public health'.The minimum health assessments required for each class of visa are set out below. The Department can request further formal health assessments for any individual visa applicant where there is also a good reason to do so.Persons seeking to come to Australia can apply for either a Permanent or a Temporary visa.
 Permanent visas.
All applicants for a Permanent visa (including those seeking a Humanitarian or refugee visa), are required to undertake as a minimum, a medical examination, a chest X-ray (if 11 years or older) and an HIV test (if 15 years or older).If there are clinical indications of other diseases or conditions or the applicant declares they have a condition or disease then a Medical Officer of the Commonwealth may request additional tests. This could include testing for Hepatitis B and/or C.For children under 11 years old or for pregnant applicants from low or medium risk countries a medical examination may be undertaken in place of the chest x-ray.
 temporary visas
Their country of Citizenship and the level of TB risk associated with that country.The length of time they intend to stay in Australia.The activities they intend to undertake while in Australia.The requirements can range from no testing, to only a chest X-ray, to a chest X-ray and medical examination.If there are clinical indications of other diseases or conditions or the applicant declares they have a condition or disease then a Medical Officer of the Commonwealth may request additional tests.
Country of Citizenship.
The Department uses a Health Assessment Matrix that places all countries into one of three risk categories for TB; lower, medium, higher. The placement of countries is determined by their TB prevalence rates as provided by the World Health Organisation and is reviewed annually.
Length of Stay
The longer the intended stay in Australia the more likely an applicant will need to do additional medical tests. For example an applicant from a higher risk country for a stay of less than 3 months generally will not require any health assessment. However, if the applicant wishes to stay more than 3 months a chest x-ray will be required
Intended activities in Australia
There are a number of activities that are deemed to be of 'special significance' in terms of the potential risk an applicant may pose. In general, unless there are clinical indications of other diseases or conditions or the applicant declares they have a condition or disease, applicants may undertake a chest X-ray, or chest X-ray and medical examination and/or blood testing.Those intending to study, work or train to be a doctor, dentist, paramedic or nurse must undergo HIV, Hepatitis B and C blood testing in addition to a medical and chest x-ray. This is regardless of their country of citizenship or intended period of stay.Pregnant applicants who are intending to give birth in Australia are required to undertake a Hepatitis B test. Pregnant applicants from medium or higher risk countries intending to give birth in Australia are required to undertake a chest x-ray. Pregnant visa applicants from lower risk countries would be required to undertake a chest x-ray if they intended to work in a health care facility or child care centre.However as the Australian Government does not recommend the taking of chest x-rays during pregnancy, applicants from lower or medium risk countries are able to undergo a medical examination in lieu of the chest x-ray. Higher risk pregnant visa applicants (both onshore and offshore) are generally required to defer the chest x-ray  -  and therefore finalisation of the visa  -  until after the child's birth.
Mandatory Hepatitis B and C Testing
The Department does not routinely test all visa applicants for Hepatitis B or C as this would not be practical nor is it considered necessary to achieve the aims of the health requirement.The Department obtains advice from and works with the Department of Health and Ageing to determine which visa applicants require mandatory Hepatitis B and C testing. The table below lists visa applicants who are required to undertake Hepatitis B or C testing (or both).
Type of ApplicantHepatitis B surface antigen testHepatitis C antibody testPregnant womenYesNoChildren for adoptionChildren who have been, or are to be, adopted by Australian residents.YesNoUnaccompanied minor refugee childrenYesNoHigh-risk applicantsany person whom the panel doctor considers to be at high risk of hepatitis B or C infection.persons with a history of hepatitis, jaundice or blood transfusions,persons showing clinical evidence of hepatitis B or C infection,persons with tattoos if extensive or suspected as having been done in un-sterile conditions.YesYesHospital and health care workersAll temporary visa applicants intending to work as, or study to be a doctor, nurse, paramedic or dentist.YesYes
Pregnant visa applicants intending to deliver in Australia are tested for Hepatitis B. This is because Hepatitis B is a potentially serious viral infection that a mother may transmit to her baby at, or around the time of birth. Infants who are infected during birth are at high risk of becoming chronic carriers of the disease. This significantly increases their risk of developing chronic liver disease, which may cause premature death.If the mother is diagnosed with Hepatitis B before the baby is born, the newly born infant can receive appropriate immunisation in the delivery room.Doctors, dentists, nurses and paramedics are required to be tested for Hepatitis B and C as well as HIV. All health care workers who have Hepatitis B or C or HIV are asked to confirm whether they will be performing certain procedures known as exposure prone procedures (EPPs). If their duties will include EPPs, the applicants will not meet health for the grant of a visa as they are considered a risk to public health.</DOC>

The AFP is an independent statutory body of government and the decision on whether to investigate an allegation is a matter for the AFP.On 29 January 2010, Japanese authorities referred a number of incidents between SSCS marine vessels and Japanese whaling vessels to the AFP which allegedly occurred during the current whaling season. The AFP commenced preliminary inquiries into these allegations in accordance with Australia's obligations under the SUA Convention. Australia was bound to undertake those inquiries when the MV
Steve Irwin
and the MV
Bob Barker
docked in Hobart on 6 March 2010.AFP Manager Special Operations authorised the investigation. The execution of search warrants upon the MV
Steve Irwin
and MV
Bob Barker
on 6 March 2010 was an operational decision of the AFP.No. As
the Japanese whaling vessels have not entered Australia's jurisdiction international obligations do not exist. Consequently, the AFP has no basis upon which it can undertake preliminary inquiries in accordance with our domestic responsibilities.</DOC>

Information on the number of sole source defence procurements is not available. In accordance with the Commonwealth Procurement Guidelines (CPGs), Defence collects data on the number of direct source procurements. This has been Defence practice since the January 2005 release of the Commonwealth Procurement Guidelines. Direct source is a broader definition which may include more than one supplier and therefore may be a competitive procurement process.Defence would not be able to provide information on why tenders were not sought without dedicating significant resources to the task. I am not prepared to direct the Department to release such resources. However, it is important to note that even when Defence decides to sole source a procurement, such a decision is required to be made consistently with the fundamental obligation set out in the CPGs (and reflected in the Defence Procurement Policy Manual) to achieve value for money.</DOC>

The then Public Service Commissioner was responsible for ensuring that the requirements of the Public Service Act 1999 were met before making a decision to issue a certificate which was a precursor to any decision by CEO DMO about Ms Wolfe's employment. The then Public Service Commissioner was satisfied that these conditions had been met and issued the required certificate. On 8 April 2010 the Federal Court reversed the Public Service Commissioner's decision and set aside CEO DMO's decision on the basis that procedural fairness had not been applied. The Court Order directed that the matter be referred back to the Secretary for Defence and the Public Service Commissioner for further consideration.A search of relevant records has found no evidence that the use of the DMO logo, which incorporates the Commonwealth Coat of Arms, on the Wikipedia website has been authorised by the DMO.

There is no legislated movement rate at Perth Airport.The curfew at Busselton Airport and related noise management issues are a matter for the Western Australian Government's Environment Protection Authority. There are capacity constraints and operational limitations, both in the air and on the ground, that preclude the use of RAAF Base Pearce as an alternative to Perth Airport.</DOC>

The Australian Government values community television as an important component of the Australian media landscape. Accordingly it has determined a pathway for community television to make the transition to digital broadcasting.The Government asked the Australian Communications and Media Authority to temporarily allocate unassigned spectrum to community stations C31 in Melbourne, TVS in Sydney, QCTV in Brisbane and Channel 31 Adelaide to simulcast their services until the switch to digital - only television in capital cities in 2013. A new trial community broadcasting licensee, West TV in Perth, commenced digital-only broadcasts in April 2010.The Government has also allocated funding support, totalling $2.6 million, to assist the community television sector to meet the costs of commencing digital services.Other than these capital cities no spectrum has been reserved or identified in licence area plans for digital community broadcasting television services. Further, the availability of spectrum for any new broadcasting television services will depend on decisions by the Government about the use of the spectrum after the completion of digital switchover.</DOC>

Regulation 20 (Deemed effective service  -  exceptional circumstances) of the Defence Home Ownership Assistance Scheme Regulations 2008 (DHOAS Regulations) provides that circumstances which are taken to be 'exceptional' include, but are not limited to:The member has had an extended period of illness or injury that prevents the member from performing their effective service;service has been performed but, as a result of a defective decision, is not recognised as service.The Explanatory Statement to the DHOAS Regulations explains that a defect in a member's appointment, enlistment or transfer, which may be corrected at a later time, may leave some uncertainty on whether a member has completed effective service. The member may have grounds to apply for their service to be deemed effective.The Explanatory Memorandum provides that in circumstances when a Reserve member's illness is long and serious enough to prevent the member from serving for an entire service year, the member may also apply for deemed effective service.The Explanatory Memorandum states that there would be no exceptional circumstance when a Reserve member is simply not offered service, or where the member is not offered service because the member has applied to serve in a rank or employment category for which the member is not qualified or competent to serve.36 Reservists applied; 29 were approved; six denied; and one not proceeded with by the member.The nature of the 'special circumstances' for each application is as follows:Medical/HealthEight members were deemed effective for medical/health reasons.Death of serving membersThe partners of two deceased members were approved deeming in respect of the deceased member's service for the year in which the member died, because of service performed by the members prior to their deaths.Mandatory Training/Scholarships/Civilian employmentSix members were deemed effective on grounds of mandatory training requirements; overseas studies; or civilian employment commitments. One of these members applied for service to be deemed effective for more than one financial year and was approved for part of the period requested.Posting Orders/Training CancellationsFour members were deemed to have provided effective service for the following reasons: changes to posting order; accompanying spouse (permanent member) on overseas posting; cancelled training; cancelled unit parade days.Service History DiscrepancyOne member was deemed to have provided effective service on recognition of a discrepancy in service history data. The member had applied to have more than one financial year deemed effective and was approved for part of the period requested.Administrative ErrorEight members of the Reserve Forces were deemed effective on grounds of an administrative error relating to notification of their service obligations during financial year 2008-09.Not Proceeded with ApplicationOne member sought consideration for ineffective service to be deemed effective on grounds of specific service requirements. However, the member had decided not to proceed with his application.</DOC>

Under the National Health and Hospitals Network the Commonwealth Government will become the majority funder of the Australian public hospital system. The Commonwealth will fund:60 per cent of the efficient price of every public hospital service provided to public patients;60 per cent of recurrent expenditure on research and training functions undertaken in public hospitals;60 per cent of capital expenditure, both operating capital and capital investment, to maintain and improve public hospital infrastructure; andover time, up to 100 per cent of the efficient price of 'primary health care equivalent' outpatient services provided to public hospital patients.This Commonwealth funding commitment will apply to every service that states/territories and Local Hospital Networks agree to provide.Consistent with my Government's commitment, no state or territory will be worse off in the short term and all states will be better off in the long term. By 2019-20 Queensland will be better off by around  $3.5 billion under the NHHN reform plan.(2)   For the first time the Commonwealth will fund 60 per cent of capital expenditure,  on a 'user cost of capital' basis approach incorporating both depreciation and cost of capital components where possible.</DOC>

The Minister for Climate Change, Energy Efficiency and Water is aware that border carbon price adjustments were included in a discussion of possible policy options to mitigate competitiveness concerns in the 2008 report 'Building a low-carbon economy  -  the UK's contribution to tackling climate change' by the United Kingdom (UK) Committee on Climate Change. The UK Committee on Climate Change is an independent body that advises the UK Government on emissions reduction. The Committee's discussion of policy options to mitigate competitiveness concerns in the report did not make recommendations as to which options should be adopted, and the Minister is not aware of any formal proposals for a border carbon price adjustment measure being considered in the UK.Other than arrangements under the World Trade Organization (WTO), there are no significant trade agreements in existence between Australia and the UK. Any proposed border carbon adjustment measure would need to be consistent with UK obligations under WTO rules. If a UK import carbon tax were ever proposed, its impact on Australian businesses would depend entirely on its design and purpose. The Australian Government routinely monitors progress of these types of issues and will undertake appropriate analysis of the implications for Australia, including the WTO consistency, of any specific proposals put forward.</DOC>

On 13 January 2010 I (Mr Smith) wrote to Bishop Suriel of the Diocese of Melbourne to express my condolences and deep sadness at the loss of life in the 6 January attack on a Coptic Orthodox Church in Egypt. I noted that the murder of seven innocent Egyptian citizens, including six Christians and one Muslim, was a heinous act, particularly given the murder was committed on such a holy day for Coptic Christians. I noted further that Australia welcomed steps taken by Egyptian authorities to bring the perpetrators to justice, including the direct personal involvement of the Chief Prosecutor in investigating the crime.On 14 January 2010, Australia's Ambassador to Egypt wrote to His Holiness, Pope Shenouda III, head of the Coptic Church, conveying condolences and deep sadness at the 6 January attack.In February 2010, Australia submitted a written intervention in Egypt's Universal Periodic Review at the United Nations Human Rights Council. This is available on the website of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. Australia welcomed Egypt's March 2009 decree recognising the rights of adherents of non-recognised religions to obtain identification documents without having to identify themselves as Christians, Jews or Muslims. The intervention asked the Government of Egypt for an update on the status of the proposal of the Egyptian National Council for Human Rights for a 'unified law' on the construction and renovation of houses of worship.</DOC>

Under the National Health and Hospitals Network the Commonwealth Government will become the majority funder of the Australian public hospital system. The Commonwealth will fund:60 per cent of the efficient price of every public hospital service provided to public patients;60 per cent of recurrent expenditure on research and training functions undertaken in public hospitals;60 per cent of capital expenditure, both operating capital and capital investment, to maintain and improve public hospital infrastructure; andover time, up to 100 per cent of the efficient price of 'primary health care equivalent' outpatient services provided to public hospital patients.This Commonwealth funding commitment will apply to every service that states/territories and Local Hospital Networks agree to provide.Consistent with my Government's commitment, no state or territory will be worse off in the short term and all states will be better off in the long term. By 2019-20 Queensland will be better off by around $3.5 billion under the NHHN reform plan.The Government will also provide an additional $1 billion in new investments in the Queensland health and hospitals system over the next over years, including $150 million for emergency departments, $161 million for elective surgery and $327 million for new sub acute beds.(2)     For the first time the Commonwealth will fund 60 per cent of capital expenditure, on a 'user cost of capital' basis approach incorporating both depreciation and cost of capital components where possible.</DOC>

why is Form 484 available with electronic data entry fields, while Form 201 is not.ASIC provides the following services for the lodgement of documents;1. Online via ASIC website2. Electronically via approved third party software (EDGE &amp; ECR)3. In paper
1. Online
Company OfficerRegistered AgentLiquidators-Auditors; andFinancial Services (Licensees and Representatives)A Form 484 (Notification of change to company details) can be lodged via this service.  A form 201 (Application for registration as an Australian company) cannot, however, a key priority for ASIC is the development of an online solution for company registration in future.
2. Third Party Software
EDGE is the name of the service that allows registered agents to lodge documents electronically with ASIC using software created by a third party.  A Form 484 can be lodged via this service.  Agents can also receive information from ASIC, such as company annual statements and data downloads.  
ECR operates under that the same general principal as EDGE, with one important difference.  The most commonly lodged ECR form is the Form 201.  Since payment must accompany lodgement of this form, all ECR lodgers must have a direct debit or direct credit account with ASIC.  To ensure security of their lodgement (ie so we debit the correct amount form the correct account) each transmission is digitally signed by an X509 certificate, available from Verisign. While anyone can become a registered agent and lodge EDGE documents, ECR lodgers tend to be specialist shelf company creators.
3. Paper
All forms, including the form 201 and form 484, can be lodged with ASIC in paper.  This can be done over-the-counter in an ASIC service centre or via the mail to an ASIC office.  Forms are available to download and print from ASIC's website homepage.  An interactive version of the Form 484 is also available that allows a client to download and enter information directly onto the form using their computer.  This function does not allow the form to be lodged electronically.  Once completed the client must print it, sign and date it and lodge it in paper.In summary, a form 484 can be lodged online via ASIC's website, via EDGE (third party software) or in paper.  A form 201 can be lodged electronically via ECR (third party software) or in paper.does the ASIC record the number of processing errors resulting from hand written forms; if so, how many of those errors were recorded against Form (i) 484, and (ii) 201 in the last reporting period.The collection and interpretation of data and information forms a significant part of ASIC's role.  The Registry Services area is responsible for paper document processing and is ISO 9001 certified, meaning that our management processes and practices are assessed against an international quality standard.    This ensures we are constantly vigilant with doing the right things the right way, consistently that in turn delivers appropriate service for our clients. As part of this certification, ASIC is required to review the quality of information recorded on the corporate registers from paper documents lodged.   The procedure to do so is derived from Australian Standard 1199.  The procedure involves double sampling documents processed by a team member based on lot size, processing skill, knowledge and experience within a team.  Double sampling requires the inspection of a first sample that leads to a decision to accept, reject or to take a second sample.  The inspection of a second sample leads to the determination of the lot being within or outside the acceptable standard of quality. As the sampling is based on the number of documents processed and not by document type, we cannot provide you with information relating to errors recorded against forms 484 and 201.  Our records indicate that for the 08/09 year, 455,503 paper documents were processed and of those 130,198 were quality sampled, resulting in 3,946 errors detected (3% error rate).</DOC>

and (2) My diary records the following meetings with representatives of Hawker Britton this Parliament.
 
DateAttendessLocation06/08/2008Prime Minister, Bruce HawkerCrown Plaza, Darwin29/01/2010Prime Minister, Bruce Hawker, Bob CarrKirribilli House, SydneyMr Hawker has been a personal friend of mine for 20 years. The meetings recorded in my diary were private meetings, which Mr Hawker attended in his personal capacity as distinct from attending in his capacity as a lobbyist on behalf of a third party.I am advised that responding to parts of this question relating to departmental officials would involve an unreasonable diversion of government resources, as this would require the examination of a large number of diary and meeting records. I am not aware if Hawker Britton arranged any other meetings with other organisations.</DOC>

Responding to this question would require Departmental officials to review calendar and diary entries since December 2007 for meetings that may have involved or been attended by Hawker Britton. This would require the manual examination of a large number of diary and meeting records, which is an unreasonable diversion of government resources.Conducting the same searches across the diary records of current ministers and parliamentary secretaries in this portfolio would be an unreasonable diversion of resources for similar reasons. The records of former ministers and parliamentary secretaries are considered personal information in many circumstances and no access to those records will be sought.</DOC>

The average payment of Medicare benefits per capita in each Federal electoral division for the 2007, 2008, and 2009 calendar years are at Attachment A.Medicare benefits have been allocated to electoral divisions on the basis of each patients' Medicare enrolment postcode. Where a postcode boundary overlaps different electoral divisions, the postcode data is allocated using a postcode to electoral division concordance file.Populations for electoral divisions are calculated on a financial year basis. Therefore the 2007 table uses the estimated resident population (ERP) at 30 June 2007 and the 2008 table uses the ERP at 30 June 2008. The ERP at 30 June 2009 is not yet available for Federal electoral divisions. Therefore the 2009 table also uses the ERP as at 30 June 2008.Since the introduction of health workforce programs based on areas of workforce shortage in the late 1990s, it has been government policy not to release information concerning General Practitioners to population ratios below state and territory level. Ratios in any particular area can vary significantly over time, and the release of data at any one point in time can be misleading.Attachment AAverage Medicare benefits paid per capita (1) in Federal electoral divisions.

Uses the latest available electoral division population estimates, as at 30 June 2007 for 2007 averages, and as at 30 June 2008 for 2008 and 2009 averages.Only health services receiving a Medicare benefit rebate appear in Medicare data sets.Where a postcode boundary overlaps different electorate boundaries, the postcode data is allocated to the respective electorates using a postcode to CED concordance file, built by  the Department of Health and Ageing, using Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) population data. This assumes that Medicare postcode data is geographically distributed in the same  proportions as the population was distributed for these split postcodes. This may result in some postcode-based service and funding data being allocated to an electorate different to that  of the address of the service provider or user.Where possible, PO Box postcodes have been allocated to an electorate using geospatial programs and a PO Box/delivery area postcode file from Australia Post.Electorate data should not be aggregated to produce state and national totals as some postcode data cannot be allocated to electorate.It is important to note that some people would receive assistance from services outside this electorate, and similarly services located in this electorate may provide assistance to people living in other electorates.</DOC>

Bulk billing figures for non-referred GP attendances do not include Practice Nurse items.Only health services receiving a Medicare benefit rebate appear in Medicare data sets.Where a postcode boundary overlaps different electorate boundaries, the postcode data is allocated to the respective electorates using a postcode to CED concordance file, built by the Department of Health and Ageing, using Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) population data. This assumes that Medicare postcode data is geographically distributed in the same proportions as the population was distributed for these split postcodes. This may result in some postcode-based service and funding data being allocated to an electorate different to that of the address of the service provider or user.Where possible, PO Box postcodes have been allocated to an electorate using geospatial programs and a PO Box/delivery area postcode file from Australia Post.Electorate data should not be aggregated to produce state and national totals as some postcode data cannot be allocated to electorate..It is important to note that some people would receive assistance from services outside this electorate, and similarly services located in this electorate may provide assistance to people living in other electorates.

Medicare bulk billing data is based on year of processing by Medicare Australia (formerly the Health Insurance Commission) and may not be the same as the year in which the patient received the service.These statistics relate to non-referred (general practitioner) attendances that were rendered on a fee-for-service basis for which benefits were processed by Medicare Australia. Excluded are details of non-referred GP attendances to public patients in hospital, to Department of Veterans' Affairs patients and some compensation cases.Electorate level data should be considered as estimates only. Allocations of services are based on the reported postal address postcodes of patients. Therefore some data will not accurately reflect the address of where the patient actually resides.Where a postcode overlapped electoral boundaries, the statistics were allocated to electorate using a concordance file derived from Population Census data. This can result in some data being erroneously allocated to an adjoining electorate. Data have also been excluded if postcodes were not present on the concordance file.Postcode data recorded using a post office box or private mailbag are excluded from electorate reporting in the cases where they cannot be accurately allocated. This is notable in the electorates of Lingiari and Solomon in the Northern Territory, where approximately 25% of bulk billed non-referred GP attendances were claimed against post office boxes or private mailbag addresses.It is important to note that some people would receive assistance from services outside this electorate, and similarly services located in this electorate may provide assistance to people living in other electorates.</DOC>

Any use of these terms will have no impact on veterans' entitlements. These entitlements are determined in accordance with the terms contained in the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 (VEA) and the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2004 (MRCA). Neither the VEA nor its preceding legislation, the Repatriation Act 1920 have ever contained the terms 'wounded in action' or 'injured in action'. These Acts refer to 'war caused injury' and 'defence caused injury'. The term 'service injury' is used in the MRCA.There is no move by the Government to formally change the terminology of 'wounded in action' to 'injured in action'.</DOC>

There are nine television transmission sites in the Paterson electorate their site name and area served are described by the ACMA as:Broadcast Site Coorei Hill serving the area of Dungog;Broadcast Australia Site Kiaora Lookout serving the area of Gloucester;Telstra Site Gan Gan Hill Near Nelson Bay serving the area of Port Stephens;Broadcast Site Mt Douglas serving the area of Vacy;Broadcast Site Booral serving the area of Booral;Council Water Reservoir Elizabeth Beach serving the area of Elizabeth Beach;Water Tower Likely Street Forster serving the area of Forster;Telstra Site Macwood Rd Smiths Lake serving the area of Smiths Lake; andBroadcast Site Stroud Reservoir King Street Stroud serving the area of Stroud.Eight of the nine sites broadcast the national services of ABC and SBS as well as the commercial broadcasters of Prime, NBN and Southern Cross which is the equivalent content of Seven, Nine and Ten.The site serving Vacy transmits ABC and SBS services only.The four sites serving Dungog, Gloucester, Port Stephens and Vacy are operated by broadcasters and are broadcasting in digital.The remaining five sites serving Booral, Elizabeth Beach, Forster, Smiths Lake and Stroud are analog only self-help facilities sites operated by the Great Lakes Council, they do not transmit digital TV.Of the sites mentioned in question 3 part 2:Booral and Elizabeth Beach are directional transmission sites.Forster, Smiths Lake and Stroud are omnidirectional transmission sites.Of the sites mentioned in question 3 part 2 those serving Booral, Forster, Smiths Lake and Stroud have been identified by broadcasters as candidate sites for digital conversion. While the Government has strongly encouraged broadcasters to take every possible step to ensure that the site can be converted in a timely fashion, the final decision about whether and how to convert the sites is a matter for negotiation between the current licence holder, the Great Lakes Council, and the broadcasters.The cost of upgrading these four sites to digital is a matter for negotiation between the Council (as self-help licensee) and broadcasters. In general the offer being made by broadcasters relates to the provision and maintenance of transmission equipment. Broadcasters have advised that the local community or self-help licensee would be expected to continue to meet the basic costs of running the site as well as maintaining the facility in a suitable physical state for broadcasting.</DOC>

Responding to this question would require Departmental officials to review calendar and diary entries since December 2007 for meetings that may have involved or been attended by Hawker Britton. This would require the manual examination of a large number of diary and meeting records, which is an unreasonable diversion of government resources.Conducting the same searches across the diary records of current ministers and parliamentary secretaries in this portfolio would be an unreasonable diversion of resources for similar reasons. The records of former ministers and parliamentary secretaries are considered personal information in many circumstances and no access to those records will be sought.</DOC>

The Government has a range of initiatives to support the tourism industry covering marketing, policy, programs and industry development.The Tourism Australia's 'There's Nothing Like Australia' global marketing campaign will promote and support the tourism industry in all regions in Australia. This campaign will supplement existing domestic tourism marketing such as the 'No leave, No life' initiative.Australia's South West featured in one of the seven episodes of the No Leave, No Life television series over summer 2009/10 on Channel 7. The production of this episode was in partnership between Tourism Australia, Tourism WA and Australia's South West. The episode was watched by 1.1m Australians nationally and the region also received exposure online through the No Leave, No Life and Yahoo!7 websites. In addition to the television series, Australia's South West sponsored the March/April 2010 issue of the No Leave, No Life tactical offers magazine which gave them logo placement on the front cover and premium advertising space.There is a range of Australian Government programs which stimulate key elements of the tourism industry -  examples include the small business programs such as Business Enterprise Centres and Enterprise Connect; indigenous employment initiatives such as the Indigenous Employment Program; climate change, environment and heritage programs such as the Climate Change Action Plan, Caring for our Country.TQUAL grants program which provides specific funding to boost the quality and diversity of Australia's tourism industry. In December 2009, 70 TQUAL grants were announced totalling almost $8.3 million. Of these grants eight were in Western Australia and these projects are receiving just under $690,000 in funding. This includes funding to contribute to the Fontys Pool 4 Star Tourist Accommodation Upgrade at Manjimup and funding for Augusta Margaret River Tourism Association Inc to assist with the holding of the CowParade Margaret River-developing inter-regional art/event program.</DOC>

I did not meet with any members of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Australia during 2009 or 2010. Members of my staff have not met with any members of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Australia during 2009 and 2010.I have not refused to meet with members of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Australia.I have received two representations from the Coptic Orthodox Church of Australia during 2010 which included meeting requests.I referred one meeting request to the Australian Embassy in Cairo who would have been able to provide a comprehensive response to the issues raised. I have sought further information from the Coptic Orthodox Church of Australia in relation to the second meeting request and referred the matter to the appropriate program area within my Department to facilitate detailed information dissemination on the issues they raise.</DOC>

Responding to this question would require departmental officials to review calendar and diary entries since December 2007 to identify information about meetings with, or arranged by Hawker Britton. This would require the manual examination of a large number of diary and meeting records, which is an unreasonable diversion of government resources.Conducting the same searches across the diary records of current ministers and parliamentary secretaries in this portfolio would be an unreasonable diversion of resources for similar reasons.</DOC>

On 22 April 2010, I announced that the insulation component of the Renewable Energy Bonus Scheme would not proceed. This decision was made following advice received from Dr Allan Hawke in his Review of the Administration of the Home Insulation Program. In his report, Dr Hawke noted that 'the safety and quality risks cannot be fully abated and both the Government's efforts and those of reputable industry players will be largely deployed on the Government's rectification program, which must proceed as soon as possible.'See above answer to part (1). On 1 April 2010, I announced the Government's Home Insulation Safety Plan. A key element of the plan is the Home Insulation Safety Program (HISP). Participation in this program will be an opportunity for long-standing, reputable insulation firms and their workers. The HISP will also assist in restoring confidence in the insulation retrofitting industry in the longer term.On 6 May 2010, I announced the $15 million Insulation Industry Assistance Package to provide financial assistance to reputable insulation businesses for inventory held when the Home Insulation Program (HIP) was terminated on 19 February 2010. This package will help offset the industry's inventory costs.A number of hotlines have been established to assist householders and installers with queries relating to the discontinued HIP.The Safety Hotline 13 17 92 provides information relating to safety inspections (foil and non-foil).Two phone numbers, 13 17 64 (employers) and 13 28 50 (employees), have been established to provide information on the Government's $41.2 million Insulation Worker's Adjustment Package.The Installer Hotline 1800 029 686 provides information relating to outstanding payments for work carried out under the discontinued HIP.The AusIndustry hotline 13 28 46 provides information about the Insulation Industry Assistance Package.The Energy Efficiency Homes Package Hotline 1800 808 571 provides general information on the discontinued HIP.The Government is committed to finalising the processing and payment of all eligible and compliant claims as quickly as possible. However, there is evidence of non-compliance and fraud under the HIP. Thorough investigation of instances of possible fraud or non-compliance is essential to ensure that payments of Commonwealth funds are appropriate. The Department has appointed a team of forensic auditors and deployed additional staff to carry out audit and compliance work to complete this work as expeditiously as possible.</DOC>

The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT), through the Australian Embassies in Cairo and Ankara, has made over 30 inquiries and representations to the Egyptian and Turkish governments (including to the Egyptian Foreign Minister and senior law enforcement and security authorities) and to private bodies (including prisoner groups and human rights activists) seeking information about Mr Abbass's possible whereabouts and circumstances.The Government has also approached Australia's consular partners, the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada, for any information they might possess or suggestions they could make to help locate Mr Abbass. DFAT also engaged NSW Police, the Australian Federal Police and Interpol to assist in the search.However, these efforts have not revealed any information on Mr Abbass's whereabouts. On 16 April 2008 NSW Police advised that they had suspended their investigation of Mr Abbass's disappearance as there were no further enquiries they could make.My office has no record of a letter being received from Mrs Abbass dated 15 December 2009. On 8 February 2010 DFAT responded to a letter dated 15 December 2009 to the Deputy Prime Minister, the Hon Ms Julia Gillard MP. DFAT did not provide any commitments in its response.In a meeting with Mrs Abbass in 10 May 2007, the then Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Hon Mr Greg Hunt MP, undertook to instruct DFAT to review Mr Abbass's case.The then Assistant Secretary of DFAT's Consular Operations Branch, Simeon Gilding, wrote to Mrs Abbass on 16 October 2007 noting that the review had revealed no new information about Mr Abbass's whereabouts, that DFAT had exhausted all avenues of inquiry and that in the absence of new information, there was nothing further DFAT could do to locate Mr Abbass.I wrote to Mrs Abbass on 19 March 2008, noting that I had asked DFAT to make further enquiries with the Governments of Egypt and Turkey. I noted that the Egyptian Government had responded that it had no new information. On 14 July 2008, the then Assistant Secretary of DFAT's Consular Operations Branch, James Choi, wrote to Mrs Abbas and advised that the Turkish Government had confirmed it had no record of Mr Abbass residing in Turkey and that DFAT had no further information about his whereabouts.The Australian Government, through the Australian Embassy in Cairo, last made enquiries with the Egyptian Government about Mr Abbass's whereabouts on 25 March 2008.On 25 March 2008 the Egyptian Government advised that it had no information on the whereabouts of Mr Abbass.</DOC>

The Australian Government primarily funds whale research through the Australian Marine Mammal Centre (AMMC), based at the Australian Antarctic Division (AAD). These funds are primarily administered through a research grants program. Under this program, proposals are sought that deliver the highest quality science outcomes to address the most pressing marine mammal management needs.To accommodate Australia's national and international obligations, and to reflect the large-scale movements of many marine mammal species, the funding priorities of this program focus on the whales, dolphins, seals, sea lions and dugongs of the Australasian region, including the waters of the Indian, Southern and South Pacific Oceans.The priorities of the program have been developed to incorporate scientific and management priorities identified from or through:Australia's obligations under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999;national recovery plans for listed threatened species;Australian science in Antarctica;relevant international treaties;broad-scale consultation with the marine-user stakeholders and the scientific community; andthe national Strandings Sampling Protocol.The AMMC Grants Program is open to both public and private bodies and individuals. The Program is open to state government departments. Commonwealth bodies are eligible to apply for funding, however, under the 2009 Commonwealth Grant Guidelines, only Commonwealth bodies under the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies (CAC) Act 1997 are eligible to receive grant funds.Applications are assessed for their scientific merit by the National Marine Mammal Scientific Committee (NMMSC) and for their relevance, utility and priority for management and conservation needs by the National Marine Mammal Advisory Committee (NMMAC).All recipients of funding under this program are required to sign a Funding Agreement with the Australian Government through the AAD that outlines Commonwealth oversight of the research projects. This agreement covers rights and responsibilities including the project budget, financial and performance reporting and acquittal, intellectual property, assets and data requirements.Between the 2008-09 AMMC funding rounds, the Australian Government has provided $2,715,765.62 in marine mammal research grant funding. These include projects conducting research on whales, dolphins, seals, sea lions, dugongs, or combinations of these species. Approximately 57 per cent of these funds ($1,547,986.30) have been spent on projects conducting cetacean research. A list of all projects funded is below.Project 0809/2: Developing a decision process based on expert knowledge to inform the management of dugongs and coastal dolphins in Northern Australia: the Yanyuwa sea country in the Northern Territory as a case study.Project 0809/5: Quantifying trophic links in several Antarctic marine predators.Project 0809/6: Further investigation into abundance estimates of migrating humpback whales in Australia: Resolving unmodelled heterogeneity, estimating g(0) and producing new abundance estimates for both populations.Project 0809/7: Final development of a new computerised fluke matching system and creation of a fluke database for humpback whales photographed off the east coast of Australia from 1999-2005.Project 0809/8: Review of existing sighting datasets to assess the spatial and temporal distribution of humpback whales within the Great Barrier Reef for identifying potential breeding/calving grounds.Project 0809/9: A Comparison of Group IV Humpback Whale Population Estimates from Two Key Locations Along the Western Australian Coast - Implications for Future Survey Location and Methodology.Project 0809/12: Microsatellites, mating systems and males influence on management units in the Australian sea lion.Project 0809/13: Unravelling the genetic structure and diversity of Balaenoptera musculus in Australia: the genetic identity of Geographe Bay blue whales.Project 0809/14: Movement behaviours and habitat usage of West Kimberley dugongs: A community based approach.Project 0809/17: Improving analysis of marine mammal populations using natural marks and capture-recapture analysis.Project 0809/19: Population genetics and phylogeography of Australian snubfin and humpback dolphins: defining appropriate management units for conservation-Stage 1.Project 0809/23: Identification of gene expression differences among cetacean age classes and their application to cetacean age estimation.Project 0809/27: A stable isotope method to rapidly screen the foraging ecotype profiles of Australian sea lion subpopulations: improving foraging distribution models to assist bycatch mitigation in gillnet fisheries.Project 2009/3: Determining baseline health and disease parameters for wild dugongs in urban and non-urban waters of northern Australia.Project 2009/7: Population genetic structure of blue whales in Australia and surrounding regions: Genetic assessment of northern Indian Ocean blue whales and connectivity with Australian blue whales.Project 2009/8: Population size of blue whales in Australian waters.Project 2009/9: Population genetic structure of Australian sperm whales.Project 2009/17: Prevalence and impact of hookworm infection on Australian sea lion populations.Project 2009/19: Genetic Structure and Abundance of fishery-impacted dolphin populations of the Pilbara region, North-Western Australia.Project 2009/23: Evaluation of WA Humpback surveys 1999, 2005, 2008: Where to from here?Project 2009/25: Abundance estimates of the east Australian humpback whale population: 2010 survey.Project 2009/27: Genetic evidence for distinctiveness and connectivity among Australian dugongs.Project 2009/29: Informing dugong hunting management in Torres Strait by studying dugong movements and habitat usage.Project 2009/32: Beaked whale habitat modelling part of Coral Sea using environmental data and acoustic detection survey data.Project 2009/34: Inter-seasonal variation in cohort survival to recruitment in the threatened Australian sea lion: demographic modelling of the Seal Bay population to assist management and recovery of the species.Project 2009/35: Using the foraging behaviour of the threatened Australian sea lion to assess habitat quality and inform the zoning of marine parks in South Australia.Project 2009/36: Maintaining the monitoring of pup production at key Australian sea lions at colonies in South Australia.Project 2009/38: Structure and subdivision of the Australian sea lion - defining species-wide management units using ecological and genetic information.Project 2009/39: Track: A new tool for integration, interpolation and visualisation of animal tracking data.Project 2009/40: Southern right whales - 2009 census and photo identification at Head of Bight, South Australia.Project 2009/41: Monitoring population dynamics of right whales off southern Australia.Project 2009/42: Southern right whales and stable isotopes: Towards defining southern right whale habitat and trophic ecology.Project 2009/43: Habitat use and distribution patterns of southern right whales and sperm whales discerned from spatial analyses of 19th century whaling records.Project 2009/44: Status, structure and distribution of Southern-Right Whales in South-East Australia - Phase 1.AMMC grant funding is provided to undertake research and is not conditional on publication. The list below is of papers produced by AMMC grant recipients. This list may not contain all papers published on cetacean research arising from AMMC grant funding. Some grants that have already resulted in publications may yet produce more publications; some grants will never produce papers because the research did not proceed as hoped. It would therefore be misleading to link the grant awarded with a cost for papers produced to date.

There is no absolutely confirmed roll. As soon as possible following the cessation of hostilities the Australian Army deployed personnel from the PW Contact and Enquiry Unit to Tokyo to seek information about Australian prisoners of war. The Japanese Navy provided a roll of those embarked on the Montevideo Maru which was translated and a list sent to Australia, covered by a letter signed by Major H.S. Williams on 3 October 1945. Further work was required to compare the names which had been written by sound in Japanese then transliterated back into English with lists of people known to have been in Rabaul when it fell. This process produced the most complete roll possible of those thought to have been embarked on the Montevideo Maru. There have been challenges to the accuracy of this roll with suggestions that some people shown on the roll were killed in Rabaul and did not embark. These challenges are based on survivors of captivity in Rabaul who were interviewed after the war. Obviously, these witnesses were not on the Montevideo Maru. Copies of the original list sent by Major Williams in 1945 are held by Defence and National Archives. The other records, many developed from the roll sent by Williams can be found in National Archives (NAA) and the Australian War Memorial (AWM).Other Japanese ships transporting Australian POW were sunk between 1942 and 1945. Defence is not aware of any Australian POW being transported on Japanese ships in 1941. The exact number may never be known. Numbers of prisoners died on Japanese ships of disease, malnutrition and bad treatment on ships that were not sunk. On one trip by Maros Maru from Ambon to Surabaya only 325 of 650 British and Dutch POW survived the voyage, despite the ship arriving at its destination. The Japanese did not mark ships carrying POW and on occasion transported Japanese soldiers additional to the POW escort, and/or military stores, which made the ship a legitimate military target. On at least one occasion Japanese civilians were transported on the same ship as POW. Hatches were battened down during storms, to protect the cargo, and sometimes during submarine attack. This inevitably resulted in poor ventilation for overcrowded prisoners as well as trapping them if the ship sank. It is known that the Junyo Maru was sunk by HMS Tradewind off Moako Moakao on 16 September 1944 while carrying 1,377 Dutch, 64 British, Australians and United States and 4,200 Javanese slave labourers. Of the 6,520 prisoners 5,620 were lost, including three Australians. The names of the three Australians are known. Most of the survivors of Junyo Maru picked up by the Japanese died slaving on the Sumatra railway line. The two most costly losses are described below:The most serious Australian loss after the Montevideo Maru was the Rokyu (or Rakuyo) Maru. No Japanese roll has ever been found so it is not known who exactly was on board. The Australian Official History gives 649 Australians and 599 British, the History of the Directorate of Prisoners of War and Internees (DPOWI) suggests 718 Australians and 599 British. The Australians included Army personnel from Blackforce in Java and survivors of HMAS Perth. On 12 September 1944 it was sunk by USS Sealion off Hainan. All or most of the POW seem to have got off the ship. Subsequently US submarines found and picked up some survivors (80 Australians according to the OH, 92 Australians according to the DPOWI). These men provided the first evidence of conditions in Japanese POW camps and POW ships. They provided information on other POW on the ship as well as news of some men still in, or who had died in, other camps in Thailand, the Netherlands East Indies, Malaya and Singapore. Following requests from the Allies, the Japanese provided lists of survivors picked up by Japanese ships, given in the Australian Official History as 80 Australians and 56 British. This suggests that between 489 and 558 Australians died, depending on how many were on board.  There is evidence that some allied survivors were shot in the water by the Japanese.The Japanese ship Tamahoko Maru was sunk by USS Tang off Nagasaki on the night of 18 June 1944 while carrying 772 Australian, British and United States POW of whom 560 were lost. Of the 267 Australians on board only 72 survived. The survivors were picked up by a Japanese whale chaser and transferred to a POW camp ashore.Records are held by the AWM and NAA.</DOC>

The ATO is discontinuing e-Record from 1 July 2010.Since March 2000, e-Record has been available to small businesses from the ATO for free. e-Record was designed as a product to help small businesses move from paper-based record keeping to commercial electronic record-keeping systems.The decision to discontinue e-Record followed a review recently undertaken by the ATO. The review found:e-Record would have required redevelopment to keep up with changes in technology, including new operating systems and softwaree-Record was not able to interact with the electronic services being developed as part of the Standard Business Reporting initiative, anda lack of compatibility between e-Record and current commercial record-keeping systems.The number of e-record registered users fluctuates with 48,700 users currently registered (registration is voluntary).Small business taxpayers can meet their tax reporting obligations through a number of channels including the business portal and paper. There is also a range of free online tools available on the ATO website to support business such as self-help calculators and information products.Taxpayers will still be able to download the final version, e-Record v6.2, from the ATO website until 30 June 2010. User support will continue to be available until 30 September 2010. This will allow users to complete their reporting obligations for the 2009-10 financial year and allow time to transition to alternative record keeping systems.A comprehensive communication process has advised users of e-Record of the decision to withdraw the product and the support arrangements in place. In developing the communication plan, consultation was undertaken with a number of existing e-Record users to ensure that issues were identified and concerns addressed.As part of the ATO's communication plan the ATO has recommended that taxpayers consider purchasing alternative commercial software by 30 June 2010. Information regarding available software has been made available on the ATO website.</DOC>

The GP Super Clinics Program provides for relocation incentive payments under certain circumstances for specified health professionals relocating during the first 12 months of the GP Super Clinic's operation. The GP Super Clinics National Program Guide 2008 provides details of the amounts available.Applicants seeking funding to establish a GP Super Clinic were required to identify within their proposals if they intended to use part of the available funding to offer relocation incentives. Where a funding recipient chooses to use part of their grant funding for relocation incentives, they are responsible for offering the incentives and making the payments to the health professional.Depending on where General Practitioners are moving from to take up employment in a GP Super Clinic, they may be eligible for a financial incentive under the Outer Metropolitan Relocation Incentive Grant (OMRIG) program. Moving to a GP Super Clinic does not influence eligibility for the OMRIG program.As at 25 February 2010, no funding recipient has used GP Super Clinics program funding for relocation incentives.Three.Three.A Preliminary Assessment of District of Workforce Shortage (PADWS) approval can be granted to medical practices that are not located in district of work force shortage (DWS) areas to address special circumstances.In the instance of the three exemptions identified above, a PADWS approval was granted as the clinic involved has a high percentage of patients of Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islanders, a substantial proportion of patients from lower socio-economic groups, and which draws patients from surrounding locations that have a DWS classification.A practice that is funded by the Australian Government as a GP Super Clinic is not considered to be a special circumstance in lieu of DWS.As the transition to the Australian Standard Geographical Classification System  -  Remoteness Areas will not occur until 1 July 2010, data related to the number of exemptions that have been granted according to remoteness area classification is not available.</DOC>

The Government's commitment in establishing the National Broadband Network is to provide all Australians with affordable high speed broadband, no matter where they live. No towns will be excluded.The Government's objective is to connect at least 90 per cent of premises with fibre to the premises technology providing speeds up to 100 megabits per second, with the remaining premises being connected via next generation wireless and satellite technologies delivering 12 megabits per second or more.Detailed modeling undertaken as part of the NBN Implementation Study shows fibre can be extended to 93 per cent of all premises and recommends it also cover the 1.3 million new premises expected to be build by 2017-18, within the total capital cost estimate of $43 billion. This would extend the fibre coverage to an additional 1.6 million premises.The Implementation Study also shows that next generation wireless services will be a vast improvement on current services. They will deliver peak speeds of at least 12 Mbps, and much higher for many wireless users. Satellite services will deliver average data rates which are more than 20 times higher than most users of these technologies experience today and much higher than average DSL usage today.The Government is currently considering the Study and its recommendations.It is not yet possible to provide details of when the electorate of Forrest will be connected to the National Broadband Network, or which technology will provide such access. Detailed rollout plans are the responsibility of NBN Co as part of its network design and roll out and announcements will be made in due course. The rollout in Tasmania, the rollout of the first release sites on the mainland and the construction of optical fibre backbone links are already underway and will feed into the schedule.Given the scale and complexity of a project like this, the rollout will be meticulous and comprehensive. It is crucial that we get it right and that's why learning from the rollout in Tasmania, and with the First Release sites, will be so important.</DOC>

The Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) has advised that civil aviation safety regulations require a number of actions from operators in order to ensure flight crew retain and periodically demonstrate ongoing competency and proficiency.In particular, Civil Aviation Orders require the holder of an air transport pilot licence shall not act as pilot in command of an aeroplane in regular public transport operations unless he or she has satisfactorily completed, in that type of aeroplane within the preceding 15 months, a flight proficiency test including proficiency in emergency manoeuvres including a simulated failure of one engine. This emergency manoeuvre is one of the most critical competencies needed to ensure the safety of aeroplane operations.Yes.Civil Aviation Regulation 217 requires operators of regular public transport services, operators of any aircraft which exceeds 5,700 kilograms in maximum take-off weight and any other operators specified by CASA, to provide a training and checking organisation so as to ensure that operator's crews maintain and periodically demonstrate competency.The staffing of flight simulator equipment is a matter for individual operators to manage.</DOC>

The Government provides over $200 million per annum to the Family Relationships Services Program to support families. The Government has identified savings within the program of $48.4 million over four years. The majority of the savings have been found by reducing activities to be undertaken by or on behalf of my Department. The savings offset which will directly affect Family Relationship Centres is the introduction of fees for the second and third hour of dispute resolution at Family Relationship Centres - a saving of $3 million per year.These changes will not come into effect until 1 July 2011. Importantly Family Relationship Centres will be able to recoup these savings through the introduction of new fees of $30 per hour for the second and third hour of family dispute resolution when a client earns over $50,000 per year. The first hour will continue to be free for all clients. Those earning under $50,000 per annum or who fall under one of the waivers will continue to receive up to 3 hours of free FDR.Yes. Importantly while the Government has reallocated funding from the Family Relationship Services Program, the Government is actually reinvesting $154 million for legal assistance services across Australia, a significant proportion of which will be used to specifically to help families resolve disputes through targeted legal assistance. These changes now mean more funds are being provided to frontline services to help the most vulnerable Australian families. For example, additional funding will mean more families utilising Family Relationship Centres will be able to access legal information and advice.The Attorney-General's Department will work with the Family Relationship Services sector on details of implementation of these changes to minimise the impact on the delivery of services, including an analysis of the ability of individual Family Relationship Centres to recoup fees.</DOC>

Membership of the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) project requires a significant financial investment to which Australia is currently unable to commit. As a result, Australia is not pursuing membership of ITER at this time.However, Australian participation in the ITER project is progressing on a project by project basis through Australian researchers and institutions. Of particular relevance is the collaboration between ITER and the Australian Plasma Fusion Research Facility at the Australian National University which was established through a Government funded Major National Research Facilities Program grant of $8.7 million. This facility is currently being upgraded through a $7 million grant provided under the Government's Super Science Initiative. Funding for this upgrade was provided, in part, to ensure that information and resources from the facility continue to contribute to the ITER project.</DOC>

Saatchi and Saatchi has not been contracted by the Australian Government to conduct any campaign to discourage irregular maritime arrivals to Australia. The Australian Government contracted the International Organization for Migration (IOM) to conduct a counter-people smuggling communications campaign in Sri Lanka. IOM sub-contracted Saatchi and Saatchi to deliver some aspects of this project. The total value of the contract awarded to IOM for this project is AUD194,506 (As a result of renegotiating a more favourable contract the budget was revised down from the figure quoted in the original proposal). IOM paid Saatchi and Saatchi USD6,500.00 for initial campaign research and campaign design services. Saatchi and Saatchi's role in the campaign ceased in August 2009.This campaign was only conducted in Sri Lanka.IOM paid Saatchi and Saatchi USD6,500.00 for initial campaign research and campaign design.Total travel, incidental and accommodation costs for the campaign were USD5,100.Total production costs including all campaign collaterals were USD58,421.Total equipment hire and dissemination costs for the collaterals was USD6,000.No volley ball nets were produced. 150 high quality fishing nets branded with campaign key messages were produced and donated to Fisheries Federations in Negombo and Chilaw. The total cost of the fishing nets was USD 10,500.30 Street theatre performances were conducted in selected community areas surrounding Negombo and Chilaw. The total cost for all performances including talent, production costs and equipment hire was USD5,500.The total cost of USD5,500 includes all costs for script writers, directors and drama coaches. This figure also includes accommodation and travel expenses. No further breakdown is available.The campaign conducted by IOM in Sri Lanka concluded in July 2010. Customs and Border Protection is currently considering options for future communications initiatives in Sri Lanka.IOM were contractually required to conduct an evaluation of the methods of dissemination, community awareness of messages and any resultant behavioural change. The evaluation found that 96% of those surveyed at the completion of the campaign responded that the campaign messages had changed their mind about considering involvement in irregular migration. The evaluation also suggests that the campaign penetrated the target communities, with high levels of awareness of the campaign. Since the campaign began there has been a significant decrease in the number of ventures departing Negombo and Chilaw.</DOC>

In the period from 1 September 2008 to 30 September 2010, a total of 4110 refugee claims from
irregular maritime arrivals (IMAs)
have been processed.The table below gives a breakdown of the source countries for all people who had refugee claims assessed and finalised during this period.

Approximately
18% of IMAs have been found to have some form of documentation
which has assisted with establishing their identity.
Afghanistan13%Iraq35%Iran20%Sri Lankan Tamil
32%Burmese40%The Afghan Taskera identity document and the Sri Lankan Identity card have been the most common documents provided by IMAs.
A small number of passports and documents issued by the UNHCR, some including personal identifiers, were also provided for identity purposes.For people without identity or travel documents, a range of methods are used to establish their identity.
All irregular maritime arrivals have their biodata and biometrics captured upon arrival.
This data is tested and checked during the entry interview, and then is further explored during the Refugee Status Assessment (RSA) interview by the RSA officer.
The information is also compared with other countries as part of the data sharing arrangements discussed below.
RSA officers are trained to investigate all aspects of an asylum seeker's claims, including questions of identity, through in depth questioning at interview.
RSA officers must assess the credibility of all claims, including those relating to identity, as weighed against other information relevant to the case, including country of origin information.
Australia has also developed strong relationships and information sharing practices with a number of countries to help to verify people's identity, nationality, possible prior protection or criminal records and to ensure that only people who need and deserve protection are afforded protection through the refugee status assessment process.
An example of these information sharing practices is that earlier this year the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship announced that Australia has signed an agreement for biomentric data sharing between Australia, the United States of America, New Zealand, Canada and the United Kingdom.
Under this partnership, the Department of Immigration and Citizenship is able to securely and confidentially cross check fingerprints with Canadian, US, NZ and UK databases.
These data sharing arrangements allow the Department to undertake more detailed identity enquiries if necessary, and to confirm if a client has had dealings with these countries.
DIAC does not collect or aggregate statistics on people who arrive without some form of travel or identity documents in a way that can track through to identify those who are ultimately found to be refugees and are granted permanent residence.
Refugee claims are considered on a case-by-case basis and while identity issues form an important part of the process, the absence of documentation is not uncommon and may not adversely affect the outcome of the case.</DOC>

Hizb ut-Tahrir is not a proscribed group in Australia under the Criminal Code. The Government proscribes organisations under the Criminal Code on the advice of relevant security and intelligence agencies.The issue of which organisations should be proscribed as terrorist organisations remains under active review by the relevant agencies.It is the Government's longstanding practice not to comment on the status of any consideration being given to the possible listing of Hizb ut-Tahrir or any other organisation under the Criminal Code.Before listing an organisation, I must be satisfied on reasonable grounds that the organisation is directly or indirectly engaged in, preparing, planning, assisting in or fostering the doing of a terrorist act or advocates the doing of a terrorist act.</DOC>

award modernisation process:Modern awards are the responsibility of the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations (DEEWR).Throughout the award modernisation process the Department of Resources, Energy and Tourism worked with key stakeholders including the then Minister for Education, Employment and Workplace Relations, the Hon Julia Gillard MP and industry associations to ensure the concerns and interests of the tourism and hospitality industry were considered.Following consultation with the Department of Resources, Energy and Tourism and the industry associations, Minister Gillard requested a variation, asking the Australian Industrial Relations Commission (AIRC) to 'create a separate modern award covering the restaurant and catering industry, separate from those sectors of the hospitality industry providing hotelier, accommodation or gaming services'. On 26 September 2009, Minister Gillard announced the AIRC had set out the provisions of a proposed Restaurant Award 2010.The decision recognises the business circumstances of the industry. (b) decision to increase employer-funded superannuation guarantee from 9 to 12 per centPolicy responsibility for the employer-funded superannuation guarantee (SG) rests with the Treasury.More than 90 per cent of tourism and hospitality businesses are small businesses and the Government has given consideration to the impacts on small businesses and employees. This is reflected in the phase in arrangements. The lead time will allow employers and employees time to adapt, and for the increased SG contributions to be taken into account when negotiating future wage agreements.</DOC>

The Commonwealth funded the Loose Asbestos Insulation Removal Program for the identification, sealing and removal of asbestos from ACT homes from October 1988. On self-government, responsibility for the conduct of the program was transferred to the ACT with the Commonwealth to contribute funding on the following basis:The ACT pay the first $10 million of costs;The ACT and the Commonwealth share, dollar for dollar, the next $20 million of costs; andThereafter the costs be proportionately met $2 to $1 by the Commonwealth and the ACT respectively.By the conclusion of the program in 1994, the Commonwealth contribution had been $55.7 million towards this program, with $44.1 million provided by the ACT.Portfolio responsibility for this program rested within the then Department of Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories.(2)
There are no current Australian Government programs that can provide support, assistance or funding to home owner occupiers in NSW whose properties are contaminated with friable asbestos. The Minister does not have any discretionary power to provide such support, assistance or funding.</DOC>

Tourism Division does not allocate internally in a formal budgetary manner how much time is done in kind by its officers for each of the various activities it undertakes, so program support costs related to implementation of the Strategy would be difficult to quantify. Consistent with broader Australian Public Service practice, the Tourism Division's operating budget is applied flexibly to meet ongoing and emerging priorities.</DOC>
