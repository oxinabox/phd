                (1) The areas listed in (a) to (g) have not been the subject of an NBN Co build contract. While these areas were listed in NBN Co's one year rollout plan published in April 2013, under previous definitions this simply indicated that construction of the network was scheduled to commence within 12 months. In areas that had not entered the 'build commenced' phase, including those listed above, NBN Co had not issued build instructions to delivery partners.
                NBN Co's rollout maps have been updated to show only areas where build instructions have been issued to delivery partners or where services are already available.
                (2) NBN Co and the Department of Communications do not have specific information regarding the condition of Telstra's copper infrastructure in these areas. However, at the Senate Estimates hearings in October 2013, NBN Co indicated its intentions to test network performance at the node or cabinet level in planning the future rollout of the National Broadband Network.

                As UN Security Council (UNSC) coordinator ('pen-holder') for Afghanistan, Australia's first priority is to ensure that the Council remains fully committed to the international efforts to help protect and advance the basic rights of the Afghan people. 
                Australia advocates for human rights protections by ensuring provisions in Council resolutions such as the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) renewal authorisation and United Nations Assistance Mission to Afghanistan (UNAMA) mandate support not only security and political transition, but human rights and peace and reconciliation efforts. 
 the protection of the rights of women and girls; the need to protect civilians from sexual violence and all other forms of gender-based violence (including full implementation of the Elimination of Violence Against Women law); condemning the increased targeted killing of women and girls; the importance of recruiting, training and retention of women in the Afghan National Security Forces; the vital role that women play in the peace process; and the importance of Afghanistan implementing UNSC Resolution 1325 on Women, Peace and Security. Similarly, we are working to ensure strong language on the Women, Peace and Security agenda in the UNAMA mandate renewal.
                We also draft and author Council statements that condemn attacks against civilians and violations against human rights, and urge continued protection of all persons including women, children, media workers and detainees. 
                Moreover, we use report briefing and open debates to make public national Statements to the Council, including key messages on continuing to encourage Afghanistan to finalise and implement a National Action Plan on Women, Peace and Security and hold elections that maximise voter participation, especially the participation of women. 
                More broadly, as outlined above, as UNSC pen-holder on Afghanistan, Australia uses its role to promote human rights and the rule of law amongst Afghan authorities through negotiating mandates, coordinating press statements and resolutions and through our national statements to the UNSC during UNAMA quarterly debates.
                During our term on the UNSC, the women, peace and security agenda (WPS) will continue to be a priority for Australia. Australia is working with our fellow members and the UN system to encourage all relevant peacekeeping and peacebuilding operations to address the impact of the situation on women and girls and prevent impunity for sexual violence.
 peacekeeping mandates to include gender perspectives; the appointment of gender advisers and women protection advisers in Council mandated missions; and for WPS to be more effectively integrated into conflict prevention and peacebuilding. We are for example highlighting the impact of conflict situations on women and girls, as well as advocating responses which seek to empower women, and also respond to sexual violence in conflict. We are also advocating for regular briefings to the Security Council to keep the Council informed of gender concerns, including by UN Women, the Secretary-General's Special Representative on Sexual Violence in Conflict, the Under Secretary-General for Peacekeeping, and other relevant UN officials and for peacekeeping reports to the Security Council to address gender issues. We are continuing to support the work of the Special Representative and advocating for Council visits to countries on the Council's agenda to consult civil society, including women's groups. 
                In April 2013, we participated in the Open Debate on Sexual Violence in Conflict. Our statement highlighted the need to end impunity, make best use of existing sanctions mechanisms, ensure women's participation in conflict resolution and peace building and to deploy systematically gender expertise to Council mandated missions.
                In May 2013, Australia and Guatemala co-hosted a UNSC 'Arria-formula' meeting on the implementation of the UNSC's women, peace and security agenda and to derive lessons from the experience of those in the field. Australia's then Minister for Defence, the Hon Stephen Smith MP, delivered opening remarks and Australia's then Ambassador for Women and Girls, Penny Williams, facilitated discussion. The meeting heard from senior UN officials and Gender and Women Protection Advisers serving in UN peacekeeping missions - MONUSCO in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, UNMISS in South Sudan, and MINUSTAH in Haiti. Non-Council UN members, UN agencies and representatives from NGOs also participated.
                In June 2013, under the UK's Presidency, we co-sponsored UNSC resolution 2106, focused on ending impunity for sexual violence in conflict, and participated in the related open debate. We have also championed the UK's Preventing Sexual Violence in Conflict Initiative and signed up to the Declaration to End Sexual Violence in Conflict launched in September 2013.
                On 6 September 2013, during our UNSC Presidency, Australia co-hosted, with Conciliation Resources and the NGO Working Group on Women Peace and Security, an interactive panel on Women's Participation in Peacebuilding in New York.
 deploying greater technical expertise in peacekeeping missions and UN mediation teams supporting peace talks; improved access to timely information and analysis on the impact of conflict on women and women's participation in conflict resolution in reports and briefings to the Council; and strengthened commitments to consult as well as include women directly in peace talks. 
                The Australian government is committed to ensuring the promotion and protection of human rights during its term on the Security Council.
                Similar to our approach in addressing women's rights, we seek a comprehensive approach to human rights so that these issues are considered across the Council's entire agenda in a systematic way. This includes entrenching respect for human rights law and international humanitarian law and the protection of civilians in Council resolutions and deliberations, highlighting the impact of conflict situations on the human rights of affected populations; advocating for peacekeeping mandates to include human rights monitors; advocating for peacekeeping reports to the Security Council to specifically document and provide options to respond to human rights issues; advocating for regular briefings to the Security Council by relevant UN officials; and advocating for Council visits to countries on the Council's agenda to consult civil society.

                In 2012-13, almost 2 million Medicare rebateable podiatry services were provided to patients with a chronic medical condition, at a total cost to government of $102.3 million.
                The Government has inherited an enormous debt and policy priorities, including any expansion of Medicare services, will be considered within this context. Any additional expenditure will be considered when we responsibly can.
                Medicare does not cover aids and appliances. Medicare benefits are limited to the costs of professional services rendered by practitioners. 
                State and territory governments operate aids and appliances programs to assist residents with the cost and/ or provision of appropriate equipment, aids and appliances in the community setting.

                (a) On 26 November, the Afghan Ministry of Justice told the Australian Embassy in Kabul it had no intention of introducing stoning as a punishment under Afghanistan's Penal Code. It would comply with its international obligations. 
                This position was subsequently confirmed by President Karzai during an interview on 29 November 2013 with Radio Free Europe, and by Afghan Minister for Justice Ghalib during a meeting with the Australian Ambassador in Kabul on 17 December. 
                Where matters of this nature arise, the Australian Embassy in Kabul takes every opportunity to register Australia's concerns with the Afghan government and encourage the implementation of international human rights norms.
                Given our response to (a), we do not think it is necessary to respond to part (b) of the question.

                (1) In the Federal Court hearing on Animals' Angels e.V. and the Secretary of Department of Agriculture, I can confirm that the applicant made submissions to the court to the effect that the department was on notice of being informed of overstocking on the voyage and that there was a practice of overstocking live animal export vessels.The applicant also made submissions to the court to the effect that a departmental investigator had spoken to both Dr Lyn Simpson and Dr Mike McCarthy about live animal export practices. The judgment has not yet been handed down. 
                (2) The allegations of overstocking on the voyage were not proven so no action was taken against the exporter concerned. 
                The department has applied an additional condition to approvals for livestock export consignments for an exporter previously found to have overloaded a live export ship. This condition requires additional oversight of the loading process by Department of Agriculture staff.

 Vessel preparation and loading within the Australian Standards for the Export of Livestock (Version 2.3) 2011 (ASEL). 
                Load plans for consignments destined to, or through, the Middle East are calculated using Heat Stress Risk Assessment (HSRA) software, known as HotStuff. Department of Agriculture officers attend the loading of livestock vessels to check that livestock are loaded in accordance with the HSRA and load plan before an Export Permit and Health Certificate can be issued. 
                The Department of Agriculture has not conducted investigations about overstocking of livestock vessels.

                (a) The Department of Agriculture is currently investigating allegations of breaches of the Exporter Supply Chain Assurance System (ESCAS) in (i) Jordan and (ii) Mauritius. The department is committed to a prompt and thorough investigation to ensure that it is as complete as possible. Investigations take as long as needed to ensure a fair and accurate outcome is reached. When the investigations are complete, the reports will be published on the department's website. 
                (b) ESCAS was designed knowing that no regulatory system can eliminate the issues it has been put in place to guard against. ESCAS seeks to ensure that adverse animal welfare incidents for Australian livestock are minimised. However, when incidents do occur, ESCAS provides a regulatory process to investigate and address the incidents in a manner that minimises the disruption to trade and improves animal welfare outcomes. In relations to these specific allegations of cruelty to Australian sheep and cattle, the department of Agriculture is currently investigating these allegations.
                (c) The Minister has no regulatory or investigative role, the department undertakes regulatory responsibilities.

                Medicines are listed on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) on the advice of the independent expert body known as the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC). PBAC is not part of the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA). The TGA therefore has no direct role in reviewing PBS listings.
                The PBAC considers each PBS listing submission having regard to the safety, clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness (value-for-money) of the medicine for the intended use, in comparison with other available treatments.
                At its November 2006 meeting, the PBAC recommended the listing of atomoxetine (under the brand name Strattera®) on the PBS for the treatment of patients with ADHD diagnosed between the ages of 6 and 18 years, under certain circumstances (as outlined on the Schedule of Pharmaceutical Benefits).
                Atomoxetine is currently available on the PBS as an authority required medicine, restricted only for the treatment of patients with ADHD diagnosed between the ages of 6 and 18 years, under certain circumstances. This means that in order to prescribe this medicine, treating doctors need approval from the Department of Human Services (Medicare Australia). The treating doctor must declare the specific conditions and circumstances that justify the use of this medicine through the PBS. This can be usually done by phone during the consultation.
                The TGA does have an important role in reviewing medicine safety. The TGA published an article on 1 October 2013 for health professionals in its bi-monthly medicines safety bulletin (Medicines Safety Update) reinforcing the importance of existing precautions regarding the risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviours associated with atomoxetine.
                The article reminded health professionals to carefully weigh the risks against the benefits of atomoxetine therapy and patients to be carefully monitor for suicidality, especially in the first few months of treatment and whenever there is a change in dose. The article also advises health professionals to warn parents and caregivers of the risks, and alert them of the need to monitor for signs of unusual changes in behaviour or precursors of suicidality.
                  The management of a patient's medical condition, including direction as to the most appropriate pharmaceutical or other therapy option/s, is essentially a matter for the professional clinical judgement of the treating doctor concerned. A treating doctor would consider individual risks and potential benefits when suggesting a pharmaceutical or other approach for a patient's treatment. When treating a child or adolescent with ADHD, a treating doctor is at liberty to recommend behavioural and/or psychosocial interventions without pharmaceutical therapy, depending on the risk/benefit profile for the individual.
                Importantly, individuals or carers of individuals currently taking these medications should contact their doctor if they have concerns about these medications.

                (a) The Government updated expenditure and revenue estimates at the 2013-14 Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook (MYEFO). Another update will be published in the 2014-15 Budget. 
                (b) The impact of individual measures on the Governments' public debt interest cannot be disaggregated from total public debt interest, because the Government raises funds for the aggregated financing requirement rather than specific measures or programs. Estimates of public debt interest will vary depending on the prevailing market interest rates across the yield curve for issuance of Commonwealth Government Securities.
                (c) The RBA will receive the grant before 30 June 2014.

 - The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
                a) and b) 
 Evidence on Wind Farms and Human Health' was released on 24 February 2014.
                  c) In response to community concern over wind farms and human health, the Australian Government committed to establish an independent research program on this issue. 
                The National Health and Medical Research Council's (NHMRC) independent review of the published literature has identified that the existing body of evidence on the potential human health effects of wind farms is small and of poor quality. Further research of the highest standard is warranted.
 Evidence on Wind Farms and Human Health' has been considered.

                Living organ donors are encouraged to register for the Supporting Leave for Living Organ Donors Scheme (the Scheme) prior to surgery and submit a claim for payment after they return from leave. Payment under the Scheme is a one-off payment that is made to the employer retrospectively, on the condition that they have paid the donor employee and leave has been taken. 
                In the first seven months of the Scheme from 1 July 2013 to 31 January 2014, the Department of Human Services has received registrations from 76 individual donors under the Scheme and has so far made 32 payments.

                The Australian Government and NBN Co Limited (NBN Co) are examining options for addressing the current lack of affordable broadband services in regional, rural and remote Australia.
                NBN Co is currently undertaking a review into its fixed wireless and satellite programs. This review is considering strategic options available to NBN Co to cost-effectively provide coverage to areas outside the fixed-line footprint, as well as considering the optimal model to provide this coverage. I am unable to provide further information at this stage. 
                It is important to note that high - level estimates from NBN Co indicate that around 100,000 premises that were to be serviced by the National Broadband Network's fixed-wireless and satellite networks may be serviced by FTTN, under the revised rollout that assumes an optimised multi-technology mix.

                The Government's Interim Statement of Expectations provided to NBN Co on 24 September 2013, directed NBN Co to continue deploying the fixed wireless network, but, in doing so, take into account the very likely availability of fixed line broadband technologies via very-high-bit-rate digital subscriber line (VDSL) in smaller communities not currently in the fixed line footprint.
                The planning of the fixed wireless network, including site selection and the construction schedule are commercial decisions for NBN Co. As part of the Government's direction to increase transparency in NBN Co, as construction commences in areas, these areas will be updated to the rollout maps, which are all publicly available on the NBN Co website.
                Additionally, the NBN Co Strategic Review, received by the Government on 12 December 2013, advised that NBN Co will undertake a detailed review of its Fixed Wireless and Satellite programs. The review will consider strategic options available to NBN Co to cost effectively provide coverage to areas outside the fixed footprint, as well as considering the optimal model to provide this coverage.
                The Government will consider the recommendations of the Strategic Review, together with the outcomes of other reviews as part of its transformation of the NBN.

                (a) Funds to meet this commitment are expected to be available in 2014-15 from the Safer Streets Programme, which will be administered by the Attorney-General's Department.
                (b) Funding recipients will be required to demonstrate that they meet the requirements of the Safer Streets Programme before funding can be provided. Requirements include how the proposed project fulfils the identified election commitment, whether the proposed project is cost-effective and represents good value for money, and the organisation's capacity to deliver the project and administer grant funds.
                Decisions on the provision of grants will be made by the Minister for Justice.
                (c) The Government is funding its election commitments through the Community Development Grants (CDG) programme, with $342 million provided for a range of community projects to support economic growth and liveability. The Government has allocated $435,000 from the CDG to the electorate of Richmond through the Tweed Shire Council including $185,000 for the Murwillumbah Football Club upgrade, and $250,000 for the Joan Nicoll Tennis Centre - Stage 1 and 2.

                I wrote to all Mayors on 9 December 2013 advising of the Government's decision not to proceed with funding for projects under Rounds Five and Five B of the Regional Development Australia Fund. These projects were election commitments of the former government which were announced during or just before the election campaign, and are not binding on the Government. They were to be funded by the Minerals Resource Rent Tax (MRRT), however as the MRRT did not raise significant funds, these projects were unfunded.

                  Contribution of the Not-for-Profit Sector
                   did not recommend the establishment of the ACNC to regulate the charity sector and support its effectiveness.
                  Instead,

                  The Australian Government should establish a one-stop-shop for Commonwealth regulation by consolidating various regulatory functions into a new national Registrar for Community and Charitable Purpose Organisations.
                  While ultimately the Registrar could be an independent statutory body, initially it should be established as a statutory body corporate or organ in the Australian Securities and Investment Commission.
                  (2) The role of charities and not-for-profit (NFP) organisations in our society is important and the Australian Government believes that supporting the sector
                  '
                  s ability to self-manage allows organisations to focus more on their work in the community.
                  The Government is implementing a broad deregulation agenda to boost productivity by removing any excessive, unnecessary and overly complex red and green tape imposed on business, community organisations and individuals by at least $1 billion a year.
                  As part of this, the Government has committed to remove the ACNC and provide further support to charities and the NFP sector through a new National Centre for Excellence (NCE).
                  The NCE will foster innovation, provide education and represent the interest of charities 
                  and NFP agencies to government.
                  (3) (a) and (b) I have, and will continue to seek advice on the impact of removing the ACNC.
                  The outcome of this advice is a decision for Government.
                  (4) The department is working across government to ensure transition arrangements with the abolition of the ACNC run smoothly.
                  I
                  will continue to seek advice on the impact of removing the ACNC and the outcomes of this advice is a decision for Government.

                (a) How would 'proficient' standards be different to current NAPLAN standards?
                For NAPLAN, the 'national minimum standards' represent minimum performance in literacy and numeracy for a given year level, below which students will have difficulty progressing satisfactorily at school.
                Within the National Assessment Program, proficient standards are not the same as national minimum standards because the latter refers to the basic level needed to function at that year level whereas the proficient standard refers to what is expected of a student at that year level. Proficient standards represent a reasonably challenging level of performance with students needing to demonstrate more than minimal or basic skills to be regarded as reaching it.
                The identification of 'proficient' NAPLAN standards, in addition to 'minimum' standards will strengthen the focus on reporting student achievement across multiple levels.
                (b) Who makes up the advisory, reference and working groups, and on what basis have they been selected?

                (1) No.
                (2) The Perth Airport Rail Link and the Perth Light Rail projects are currently listed as 'early stage' on Infrastructure Australia's National Infrastructure Priority List following their submission in 2012-13. Based on Infrastructure Australia's criteria, a cost benefit analysis is not required for submissions listed as 'early stage'. The Perth Light Rail Project has been deferred by the Western Australian Government, however, should the Western Australian Government submit a 'Threshold' business case for either project, Infrastructure Australia will evaluate the cost benefit analysis submitted.

                (1) All nations active in Antarctica are party to the Antarctic Treaty and the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty. Australia is one of the leading proponents of environmental protection under this system. Under the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty there is an unambiguous and indefinite ban on mining throughout the Antarctic Treaty area, which comprises the entire area south of 60 degrees South. It says 'Any activity relating to mineral resources, other than scientific research, shall be prohibited'. Consistent with the position held by successive Australian Governments, the Government advances Australia's Antarctic interests, including the protection of Antarctica from mining, by actively engaging in the institutions and forums of the Antarctic Treaty system.
                (2) I have requested that issues relating to the question of World Heritage listing of Antarctica be considered in the development of the 20 Year Australian Antarctic Strategic Plan. The Government will consider the Plan when its author, Dr Tony Press, reports on it in July 2014.

                The Government agrees that after five years of Labor at a federal level that people in the Moreton electorate are suffering higher levels of unemployment and finding it more difficult to make ends meet.
                The best thing that the Coalition Government can do to create jobs in Moreton is to abolish the job-destroying Carbon Tax and Mining Tax and to build a stronger and more prosperous economy.
                It is disappointing that the Member for Moreton voted against these job creating measures when given the opportunity in the Parliament. 
                I was strongly supportive of the Liberal National Party candidate for Moreton, Malcolm Cole's, plan for local jobs including hosting a jobs forum. If the honourable Member would like to demonstrate the same level of proactivity, he is very welcome to host a jobs forum as Mr Cole intended.

                (1) The Fair Work Amendment Bill 2014 (the Bill) implements the very clear election commitments outlined in the Coalition's Policy to Improve the Fair Work Laws. 
                The Bill does not in any way change the existing situation with regards to penalty rates from Labor's regime. To suggest otherwise is completely incorrect. There will be no 'Individual Flexibility Agreements'. They are Individual Flexibility Arrangements (IFAs) to which the employee must agree and be better off overall. Labor's approach on IFAs is outlined in the Fair Work Bill's 2008 Explanatory Memorandum.
                As well as keeping the current safeguards as introduced by the then Minister, the Hon. Julia Gillard MP, the Bill provides an additional protection to ensure that an individual flexibility arrangement (IFA) includes a genuine needs statement setting out why the employee believes that the arrangement meets their genuine needs and leaves them better off overall than they would have been if no IFA was in place.

                the employee is left better off overall than they otherwise would have been on their underpinning employment instrument; 
                an IFA cannot be a condition of employment; 
                an employer cannot force an employee to sign an IFA; and
                an IFA must include a statement which sets out in writing why the employee believes the IFA meets their genuine needs and how they consider themselves better off overall. 
                If an IFA is found to be deficient, it can be terminated with 28 days' notice from either party and the employee falls back onto their underpinning instrument  -  be it, the modern award or enterprise agreement.

                  Under Labor
                  '

                  rostering and hours of work;
                  all up rates of pay;
                  provisions that certain award conditions may not apply where an employee is paid above a fixed percentage as set out in the award; and
                  an arrangement to allow the employee to start and finish work early to allow them to collect their children from school 
                  without the employer paying additional penalty rates for the early start
                  .
                  '
                  (emphasis added)
                (ALP 'Forward with Fairness Policy Implementation Plan', August 2007, page 11)
                (2) The question relating to the cleaner in the hypothetical example provides no context and therefore cannot be answered.
                (3) Yes, the recommendations of the Panel as set out in the question are correct. The Labor government did not take up these recommendations, so to suggest that this Bill 'removes' them is incorrect. The Bill strengthens protections for employees on the issue of IFAs by requiring an IFA to include a written 'genuine needs statement' setting out why the employee believes the arrangement meets their genuine needs and results in the employee being better off overall. All existing protections for employees remain in place and unchanged. All this was clearly set out in the Coalition's Policy to Improve the Fair Work Laws released 5 months before the last election.
                (4) Yes, I am aware of the Essential Research polling commissioned by the ACTU in 2013. 
                (5) The 2012 Fair Work Act Review Panel did not deal with the issues raised at (a) or (b) of the question in any detailed manner or make specific recommendations for or against such proposals. 
                The Review Panel did however, note at page 189 of its report that the previous Labor Government undertook to 'maintain the existing right of entry rules' that existed previously when introducing the Fair Work regime. 
                The Fair Work Amendment Bill 2014 implements not only the Government's right of entry election commitments, but also the commitments made by the Australian Labor Party ahead of the 2007 election in Forward with Fairness, which include modelling right of entry rules on the arrangements in place prior to the commencement of the Fair Work Act 2009.

                (c) The Coalition's Policy to Create Jobs by Boosting Productivity sets out the Government's plan to drive investment, job creation, higher real wage growth and better standards of living for all Australians. The policy prioritises 17 initiatives, including abolishing unnecessary taxes (like the carbon and mining taxes), cutting the cost of red tape by $1 billion a year, encouraging more workforce participation, delivering the economic infrastructure our nation needs, and introducing a genuine paid parental leave scheme. The Government believes these policy initiatives will result in a stronger economy capable of delivering higher real wage growth and job creation.

                   (i) Labor failed Western Australians in rolling out the NBN. Prior to the time of the last election, as at 2 September 2013 NBN Co had connected just 91 active brownfields users in Western Australia. In the following 8 months the Coalition Government has increased active NBN brownfields users in WA by 28 times what Labor achieved in 6 years.
                The Strategic Review found that the fastest and most affordable way to deliver the NBN is to apply a mix of technologies based on their best fit with the infrastructure already in place. NBN Co is now making preparations to implement the Government's directions. NBN Co's review into the wireless and satellite programs has been completed and is available on its website.
                The outcomes of these reviews will feed into the process of determining which areas of Australia will be serviced by which technology. Meanwhile, the Fibre to the Premises (FTTP) build is continuing and the areas where build has commenced or where services are available are listed on the NBN Co website. 
                Once these processes have been completed and NBN Co has stabilised the FTTP rollout, the company will be in a position to provide further details. NBN Co is working on a new rollout schedule which will indicate when different parts of Australia will be connected to the NBN and which technology will be used in those locations. We expect this information to be released in the second half of this year.
                Importantly, areas with no or limited access to broadband will be prioritised and will receive upgrades on average 2 years sooner than they would have under Labor.

                (a) The Future Fund operates within the governance, performance and accountability framework for Commonwealth entities.
                The management of the Future Fund complies with the reporting obligations of Commonwealth entities, including reporting to Parliament via the tabling of an annual report and the appearance of senior executives of the Future Fund Management Agency at Senate Estimates hearings. 
                The Future Fund was established with the clear objective to strengthen the Commonwealth's long-term financial position by making provision for the discharge of unfunded Commonwealth superannuation liabilities. The Future Fund Board of Guardians is responsible for deciding how to invest the Future Fund at arm's length from the Government. Under the Future Fund Act 2006, the Board is required to do this by seeking 'to maximise the return earned on the Fund over the long term, consistent with international best practice for institutional investment'. This is in the best interest for the taxpayer.
                (b) The Future Fund makes information regarding its operations and investment activity available to the public via its website. Examples of the information available on the Future Fund's website include the Future Fund Board of Guardians Statement of Investment Policies, quarterly portfolio updates and the Fund's top 100 listed equity holdings.  
                (c) The appropriateness of public disclosure of the Future Fund's portfolio investments is a matter for the Board to decide, noting the independence of the Board, and having regard for maintaining the Fund's ability to pursue competitive investment opportunities and maximise returns on investments.
                (d) The Future Fund Board has developed and published a Statement of Investment Policies, which includes its policy on environmental, social and governance (ESG) risk management. The Board's ESG Risk Management Policy provides a framework for managing the complex risks and opportunities related to ESG issues both directly and through external investment managers. It addresses the Fund's approach to integrating ESG considerations into investment decision-making, the exercise of ownership rights and engagement with investee companies, the Fund's approach to collaboration with other investors to enhance the financial system and its approach to considering exclusions from the portfolio. 
                (e) In accordance with its investment mandate and investment strategy, the Future Fund, through its external investment managers, has exposure to many thousands of entities across a breadth of economic activities. 
                In regard to 'fossil-fuel investments', entities in which the Fund invests will frequently have diversified operations, which may include fossil-fuel related activities, renewable energy-related activities as well as other unrelated activities. As such it is not a simple matter to identify 'fossil-fuel investments'.
                However, using S&amp;P's Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) it is possible to identify the size of the Future Fund's listed equity investments in the categories of diversified metals and mining, coal and consumable fuels, integrated oil and gas and oil and gas exploration and production. The Fund's listed equity investments in these categories at 18 March 2014 was $3.634 billion. As noted above many entities in these categories have diversified operations and, in addition, entities classified elsewhere in the GICS framework may also have activities associated with fossil-fuels.

                (a)   No.  The Australian Government will continue projects under the Liveable Communities Programme (formerly Liveable Cities Program) where contracts have been settled.  However, it will not be progressing projects that were commitments of the former government that were not contracted prior to the caretaker period, including the upgrade to the Bice Oval.
                (b)   My Department advises me there is no record of your correspondence dated 2 October 2013 in the Department.  A reply to your correspondence dated 28 November 2013 was sent to you on 14 April 2014.  As noted in my letter of 14 April 2014, your correspondence was received by my office on 28 January 2014, having been referred from the Minister for Sport, the Hon Peter Dutton MP, for consideration and reply.  In my response I apologised for the delay and I trust that my response addresses your concerns.

                5PRO-01 and 5PRO-03 are currently 'build commenced' as indicated on the NBN Co website (www.nbnco.com.au). 
                Labor failed South Australians in rolling out the NBN. Prior to the last election, as at 2 September 2013 NBN Co had passed just 1,636 brownfields premises in South Australia. In the following 8 months the Coalition Government has increased brownfields premises passed in South Australia by 7 times what Labor achieved in 6 years.
                In regard to the other FSAMs mentioned, the Strategic Review found that the fastest and most affordable way to deliver the NBN is to apply a mix of technologies based on their best fit with the infrastructure already in place. NBN Co is now making preparations to implement the Government's directions. NBN Co's review into the wireless and satellite programs has been completed and is available on its website.
                The outcomes of this and other reviews will feed into the process of determining which areas of Australia will be serviced by which technology. Meanwhile, the Fibre to the Premises (FTTP) build is continuing and the areas where build has commenced, such as 5PRO-01 and 5PRO-03, or where services are currently available are listed on the NBN Co website. 
                Once these processes have been completed and NBN Co has stabilised the FTTP rollout, the company will be in a position to provide further details. NBN Co is working on a new rollout schedule which will indicate when different parts of Australia will be connected to the NBN and which technology will be used in those locations. We expect this information to be released in the second half of this year.
                Importantly, areas with no or limited access to broadband will be prioritised and will receive upgrades on average 2 years sooner than they would have under Labor.

                (2)   Following the election, the Department proposed suspending the public release of Hot Issues Briefs, pending further consultation with the Minister's Office. The Office agreed to this approach.
                On 5 May, the Department sought advice from the Minister on this matter. This matter is still under consideration.

                The question of the unemployment level of Australian (a) pilots, (b) engineers, and (c) flight attendants should be addressed to the Minister for Employment, Senator the Hon Eric Abetz.
                Applicants for the Temporary Work (Skilled) visa (subclass 457) may nominate occupations on the Consolidated Sponsored Occupation List (CSOL).
                The CSOL currently includes all occupations in skill levels 1 to 3 of the Australian and New Zealand Standard Classification of Occupations, except where there are immigration concerns with respect to an occupation, or integrity issues. 
                An applicant for the subclass 457 visa must be sponsored by an approved business. A business can sponsor someone for this visa if Australian workers are unavailable to undertake the skilled work.

                The question of the unemployment level of Australian truck drivers should be addressed to the Minister for Employment, Senator the Hon Eric Abetz.
                Applicants for the Temporary Work (Skilled) visa (subclass 457) may nominate an occupation on the Consolidated Sponsored Occupation List (CSOL).
                The CSOL currently includes all occupations in skill levels 1 to 3 of the Australian and New Zealand Standard Classification of Occupations, except where there are immigration concerns with respect to an occupation, or integrity issues. 
                The occupation Truck Driver (ANZSCO 733111) is not on the CSOL. The occupation of Truck Driver can be sponsored through the Labour Agreement programme which provides a tailored skilled migration arrangement for businesses and sectors with specific needs that sit outside the mainstream skilled migration programme. Businesses seeking access to a labour agreement need to demonstrate there is genuine and significant demand for the nominated occupation and that this demand cannot be met from within the Australian labour market.
                The question of the funding level for particular training courses should be addressed to the Minster for Industry, the Hon Ian Macfarlane.

                (1) (a) and (b) The majority of the savings from the Community Legal Services Programme will be achieved from 2015-16 onwards. The Government intends to align all legal assistance funding arrangements to expire on 30 June 2015 and is currently considering arrangements beyond that date.
                57 community legal centres which have funding agreements in place until 30 June 2017, including Southern Community Justice Centre, have been advised that those funding agreements will cease at 30 June 2015. This gives affected services adequate notice to address any potential changes in service delivery.
                (c) It is the Government's intention that these savings will be structured in a way which protects the most vulnerable clients of legal assistance services.

                (a) The revised budget, total expenses for the Live Animal Export Division for 2013 - 14 is $16,984,313 (as at 16 May 2014). This is taking into account all officers (Canberra and Regional) and the appropriation and cost recovered portions of the budget.
                This budget includes implementing reforms to the regulation of livestock export such as the roll out of Export Supply Chain Assurance System (ESCAS), and implementing the government's election commitments to improve the performance efficiency and reduce unnecessary red tape in export certification and ESCAS. The budget also includes the regulation of all live animal exports - livestock, horses, reproductive material, companion animals and other animals (such as zoo animals). Regulation is cost recovered from industry.
                (b) Questions about the costs to industry of implementing livestock export reforms should be directed to industry.
                Industry research bodies such as Meat and Livestock Australia (MLA) and LiveCorp have undertaken a range of activities to support the implementation of livestock export reforms.

                Fair Work Building and Construction considered and referred the information it had received to the Department of Immigration and Border Protection as the appropriate body to investigate allegations about abuse of visas. 
                The Government is deeply concerned about any allegations of criminality in the building and construction sector. If the honourable Member is genuinely concerned about this issue, he would support the Government's legislation to re-establish the Australian Building and Construction Commission to ensure a tough cop on the beat in the sector.

                The decision to prescribe Ethiopia under the Family Law (Bilateral Arrangements - Intercountry Adoption) Regulations 1998 (Cth) does not impact the Australian Government's current policy on intercountry adoption from Ethiopia. The program remains closed. This decision was to assist those families whose adoptions through the Ethiopia Australia Intercountry Adoption Program, prior to its closure, had not yet been finalised in Australia. By prescribing Ethiopia, these families will have their adoptions immediately recognised under Australian laws. This removes the need for these families, whose adopted children are now resident in Australia, to take the additional step of finalising the adoption in an Australian court following the conclusion of the post placement supervision period (which is generally 12 months).

                The Ethiopia-Australia Intercountry Adoption Program operated under two separate models prior to its closure in June 2012. Following the suspension and review of the program in 2009 10, a new program was opened. It operated under a significantly different governance structure. Background checking, undertaken by an independent service provider, assisted to minimise the risks of child trafficking. A small number of cases of concern were raised with my Department, in relation to adoptions facilitated under the old program structure.  No cases of concern have been raised with my Department in relation to adoptions facilitated under the newer program structure.  It is not appropriate for the Australian Government to comment on specific adoption cases.

                (1) Yes. 
                (2) My Department continually monitors all intercountry adoption programs to ensure that Australia complies with its obligations under the Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption, regardless of whether the partner country is a signatory to the convention. This policy was not relaxed by the decision to prescribe Taiwan, Ethiopia and South Korea under the Family Law (Bilateral Arrangements - Intercountry Adoption) Regulations 1998 (Cth). 
                Taiwan, Ethiopia and South Korea have not acceded to or ratified the Hague Convention on intercountry adoption. However, South Korea signed the Hague Convention on 24 May 2013, and my Department anticipates the Convention will enter into force in South Korea by 2016. My Department considers that the Taiwanese and South Korean intercountry adoption programs comply with Hague Convention principles and standards. 
                The decision to include Ethiopia does not affect the Australian Government's current policy on intercountry adoption from Ethiopia. The program remains closed. This decision will assist those families whose adoptions through the program, prior to its closure, had not yet been finalised in Australia, although the children are now resident here. 
                (3) There are no new bilateral agreements with Taiwan, Ethiopia and South Korea.

                (a) Safe Work Australia data indicate the road freight transport sector recorded a fatality rate of 29.09 deaths per 100,000 workers in 2012. Recent National Truck Accident Research Centre data suggest that truck drivers are not responsible for the majority of multi-vehicle fatal accidents involving trucks. In 2011, every multi-vehicle fatal accident involving a National Transport Insurance insured heavy vehicle was found to be the fault of the driver of the lighter vehicle (or third party). Data from 2009 indicate the truck driver was found to be at fault in only 18 per cent of cases.
                (b) The most recent data from the Bureau of Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Economics (Australian Road Deaths Database) indicate a significant overall decline in truck-related fatalities from 259 in 2004 to 180 in 2013.

                (1) (a). The 2011 Regulatory Impact Statement, prepared by the then Labor Government, in respect of the Road Safety Remuneration Bill stated that 'There is some research to suggest that the remuneration for drivers is a factor in safety outcomes, however data at this point in time is limited and being definitive around the causal link between rates and safety is difficult.' This remains the case.
                (b) Yes.
                (2). The Australian Government believes road safety is vitally important and is committed to ensuring that regulations and policies for improving safety outcomes in the road transport industry are appropriate, effective and based on credible evidence. That is why the Government commissioned an independent review of the road safety remuneration system. 
                The review examined the links between remuneration and road safety along with the role of other forms of regulation in improving Australia's road safety record.
                The Government will carefully consider the review.

                72 per cent of the businesses audited were compliant with their monetary obligations; and
                40 per cent of the businesses audited were found to have contravened workplace laws, including many which were errors in non-monetary obligations, such as pay slip and record keeping requirements.
                (2) (a) This is a false claim. Businesses who are awarded Commonwealth Government contracts will continue to be required to comply with all Commonwealth laws, including the Fair Work Act 2009 as a condition of their contract. Further, they must declare that they have no unsettled judgements relating to employee entitlements against them.
                (b) Since the Cleaning Services Guidelines commenced in January 2012, there have only been around 25 to 30 cleaning contracts influenced by the guidelines, in capital cities where a Commonwealth Agency directly engages a cleaning company - a tiny proportion of the industry. For the very small subset of employees in the cleaning industry involved in contracts influenced by the Guidelines, the terms and conditions of current employment contracts will continue to apply beyond 1 July 2014. 
                The continuation of these discriminatory arrangements would have perpetuated a two-tiered system. For instance, a cleaner in a Centrelink office in the Melbourne CBD would be covered by the guidelines whereas a cleaner in a Centrelink office in regional Victoria would not. This is manifestly unfair.

                The proposed amendments related to an application for a 2,000 block residential development, to be located under southerly arrival and departure flight paths for Kingsford-Smith Airport.
                The Department's advice was that the proposed development was likely to be subject to significant aircraft noise.

In parallel, the government also released a major study on the Eastern Australian Domestic Gas Market and consulted with stakeholders on potential policy options. In light of this analysis the Government has decided not to progress with convening such a panel or finalising its terms of reference and other arrangements.

                (1) Transport modelling indicates that by 2031, 100,000 to 120,000 vehicles will travel along the Eastern section of the East West Link using the three lane twin tunnels (detailed transport modelling is yet to be undertaken for the Western section). There are many inputs into the transport model and forward petrol price projecting is one such input.
                (2) The transport model is sensitive to many different inputs including population growth, network improvements elsewhere on the Melbourne network, car occupancy, public transport fares and vehicle operating costs, including the price of petrol. Sensitivity tests are undertaken with different values for particular parameters to understand the impact on travel demand. The published forecast takes account of the various considered scenarios.

                At this time, the final design for East West Link is unknown and therefore the precise impact on trees is unknown. The contractor selected to construct the project is required to comply with the project's Environmental Management Framework which not only requires park land to be restored after the project is complete but to also achieve a net increase in tree canopy.

                Labor failed New South Wales in rolling out the NBN. Prior to the time of the last election, as at 2 September 2014 NBN Co had connected just 8,232 active brownfields users in New South Wales. In the following 8 months the Coalition Government has increased active NBN brownfields users in NSW by 3.5 times what Labor achieved in 6 years.
                The Strategic review found that the fastest and most affordable way to deliver the NBN is to apply a mix of technologies based on their best fit with the infrastructure already in place. NBN Co is now making preparations to implement the Government's directions. NBN Co's review into the wireless and satellite programs has been completed and is available on its website.
                The outcomes of these reviews will feed into the process of determining which areas of Australia will be serviced by which technology. Meanwhile, the Fibre to the Premises (FTTP) build is continuing and the areas where build has commenced or where services are available are listed on the NBN Co website.
                Once these processes have been completed and NBN Co has stabilised the FTTP rollout, the company will be in a position to provide further details. NBN Co is working on a new rollout schedule which will indicate when different parts of Australia will be connected to the NBN and which technology will be used in those locations. We expect this information to be released in the second half of this year.
                Importantly, areas with no or limited access to broadband will be prioritised and will receive upgrades on average 2 years sooner than they would have under Labor.

                Any Australian employer is able to request access to the Labour Agreement programme. However, in their submission they must provide a reason why they are having difficulties in recruiting from the Australian domestic market as well as provide evidence of genuine on-going recruitment efforts. Employers must also commit to a yearly training benchmark to spend either one per cent of gross wages on the training of their Australian employees or pay two per cent of gross wages into an Australian industry fund.

                (1) Questions in relation to large capital works projects undertaken in the private sector should be addressed to the Minister for Industry, the Hon Ian Macfarlane, or to the relevant state or territory government.
                (2) While the Legislative Instrument giving effect to the Skilled Occupation List (SOL) is made in accordance with migration legislation, the composition of the SOLK has been, to date, based upon the advice of the Australian Workforce and Productivity Agency (AWPA). AWPA analyses a range of evidence when updating its advice on the SOL. The agency considers labour market, education and training, migration and general economic and demographic data, and submissions from stakeholders including industry bodies, trade unions, peak professional organisations and other government agencies.
                The advice from AWPA made no specific recommendation to remove any engineering occupation from the SOL for the 2014-15 programme year. Accordingly, no engineering occupations have been removed from the SOL.
                It has been announced that the functions currently performed by AWPA will be incorporated into the Department of Industry. Questions regarding the methodology behind compiling the SOL should therefore be addressed to the Minister for Industry, the Hon Ian Macfarlane.

                  Data Limitations

                granted a permanent (or provisional) visa after 1/1/1991 and arrived in Australia within 25 months of visa grant, (or are yet to arrive and it has been less than 25 months since their visa was granted), or 
                who arrived in Australia after 1/1/1991 having been granted a permanent (or provisional) visa prior to 1/1/1991. 
                  SDB has not been adjusted to reflect settlers who are deceased, have permanently departed Australia or who have had their grants cancelled.
                  SDB includes some duplicate settler records.
                  SDB includes only the settler's latest known residential (or intended residential) address. Address information is only updated if the department is notified. Some settlers have no address details recorded.
                  SDB location data is based on the 2011 Australian Standard Geographic Classification (ASGC).
                  SDB includes only the latest permanent (or provisional) visa for a settler.
                 
                  Reporting Limitations
                  Reports including numbers of settlers in specified locations may be inaccurate due to limitations in address data. This is particularly problematic for regional/rural locations.
                  Settlers with an existing permanent (or provisional) visa may appear in different reporting categories over time if they are granted a subsequent permanent (or provisional) visa. 
                  Reports including numbers of settlers of 5 or fewer have been suppressed (indicated by an asterisk*) for client confidentiality.

                develop an insurance information and comparison website (or an insurance aggregator);
                facilitate engineering assessments of strata title properties in North Queensland; and
                encourage participation by unauthorised foreign insurers (UFIs) in the North Queensland insurance market.
                The Government is assessing feedback from the submissions received to determine the actions it will take to address insurance costs in North Queensland. 
                In the 2014 - 15 Budget, funding of $12.5 million was provided over three years to fund the engineering assessments of strata title properties and provision was made for an insurance information and comparison website.
                The discussion paper complements studies by the Australian Government Actuary (AGA) into strata building and home insurance pricing. On 6 June 2014, the AGA released a report into strata title insurance prices in North Queensland, building on an initial report into growth in strata insurance premiums in North Queensland in 2012. The report identifies that premiums in North Queensland were much higher than in other parts of Australia. The differences in premium rates were found to be largely explained by differences in recent claims experience. The AGA has now commenced an additional report into residential building and contents insurance which will be completed by 31 October 2014. The findings from these reports will inform the Government's next steps.

                (1) Energy market policy in Australia is developed cooperatively by the Australian and State and Territory Governments. The Australian Government does not determine the generation mix for the electricity sector as this is determined by market operators given the available generation in the market, however uranium based nuclear generation is precluded by legislation. 

                The Australian Energy Market Operator develops an Electricity Statement of Opportunities report which forecasts and evaluates the adequacy of total supply across different regions in Australia under a range of scenarios. The 2013 report found that with the exception of Queensland all regions have adequate generation capacity over the ten year outlook period.
                In 2012, the Australian Energy Market Commission (AEMC) assessed the ability to accommodate electric vehicles as a new load source on the electricity network. The AEMC determined that there are, in general, appropriate energy market arrangements in place to enable the economically efficient uptake of electric vehicles. Further work has been undertaken to consider the needs and impact of electric vehicles on electricity network through Smart Grid Smart City project overseen by my Department which is to be completed this year.

                (a) No. The Department of Immigration and Border Protection has advised that no submission has been received from the Australian Trucking Association requesting access to a Labour Agreement for overseas truck drivers.
                (b) No. Australian Bureau of Statistics (trend) data estimates that employment in the Transport, Postal and Warehousing industry decreased by 5,300 persons (0.9 per cent) over the 12 months to February 2014. Australian Bureau of Statistics (original) data estimates that the number of underemployed people in Australia in the Transport, Postal and Warehousing industry was 41,100 persons at February 2014.
                (c) No. The summary report published on 5 May 2014 noted that job advertising has recovered this year, having risen for four consecutive months at an annualised rate of nearly 30 per cent over this period.
                (d) No, Australian Bureau of Statistics (trend) data for May 2014 estimates that the number of unemployed persons in Australia is 719,700 persons and the unemployment rate is at 5.9 per cent. The teenage (15 to 19 years) unemployment rate was 18.5 per cent (144,100 persons) and the youth (15 to 24 years) unemployment rate was 13.0 per cent (268,500 persons). Australian Bureau of Statistics data for 2012-13 estimates that the number of unemployed Indigenous people in Australia was 48,600 persons, with the unemployment rate at 20.9 per cent for that period.
                (e) At 31 December 2013, there were 1.2 million people on temporary visas (with and without a work right) in Australia, excluding New Zealanders on special category visas. The number of people in Australia on a subclass 457 temporary work visa has risen by 7.6 per cent between 31 December 2012 and 31 December 2013 to 169,070.

                (1) The Australian Government is aware that data published in 2013 indicates that the brush-tailed bettong, or woylie, population declined by around 90 per cent between 1999 and 2006. 
                The species' distribution is concentrated in the south west of Western Australia, however, there are also translocated populations reaching as far north as Shark Bay and to the New South Wales and South Australian border in the east.
                (a) The brush-tailed bettong is listed as Endangered under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act) and is therefore protected under national environmental law. A National Recovery Plan for the Brush-tailed Bettong was adopted under the EPBC Act in 2012. This plan outlines the actions necessary for the recovery of this species in the wild.
                A number of conservation strategies identified in this plan are being implemented by the Western Australian Government, coordinated through a Woylie Recovery Team. While key threats to the brush-tailed bettong include predation by cats and foxes, habitat loss and disease, the Woylie Recovery Team continues to coordinate research to better understand the full range of causes of the species' decline as well as the development of a population management strategy.

                (1) The 33 kilometre Saemangeum seawall in the Republic of Korea is amongst the largest single reclamation works in the world, and resulted in the loss of about 40,100 hectares of tidal flat that was important habitat for migratory shorebirds. It is also thought that this development resulted in the deaths of many shorebirds including Great Knots, but the number is uncertain. Recent results from a University of Queensland collaborative grant program that was co-funded by the Australian Government indicate that up to two-thirds of the tidal flats surrounding the Yellow Sea (more than 700,000 hectares) have been lost to development since the 1950s. The study indicates that the Great Knot population surveyed across Australia is continuing to decline by approximately four per cent per year.
                (2) Results from the University of Queensland study, which analysed all migratory shorebird population count data collected in Australia and New Zealand, show declines in seven species that had sufficient data for analysis. These results indicate an 81 per cent decline for Curlew Sandpiper over 20 years, a 69 per cent decline over 20 years for Eastern Curlew, and a 27 per cent decline for Red-necked Stint over 20 years.
                (3) The Australian Government is working to address these declines internationally through our bilateral migratory bird agreements with Japan, China and the Republic of Korea (JAMBA, CAMBA &amp; ROKAMBA), and through the East Asian-Australasian Flyway Partnership (the Partnership). Parties to the migratory bird agreements meet every two years, and Australia seeks better protection for important migratory shorebird habitat through these meetings. The Australian Government was instrumental in establishing the Partnership in 2006. This international forum works to develop a coordinated approach to protecting migratory waterbirds and their important habitats throughout the flyway.
                All migratory species within Australia, including shorebirds, are matters of national environmental significance under the EPBC Act. Proposed actions in Australia are assessed to ensure that any approved action will not have an unacceptable environmental impact.

                Regarding the first part of the question, the honourable member is correct in saying that Hong Kong and Singapore have, since October 2012 and December 2011 respectively, levied a tax in the form of additional stamp duty on non-residents who purchase property. Since January 2013, both of these taxes have been levied at the rate of 15 per cent.
                Regarding the second part of the question, the budget impact of any tax introduced by Australia and levied on non-resident purchasers of Australian property would depend on a number of factors. The Foreign Investment Review Board's annual report details 11,668 properties having been purchased by non-residents in the 2012-13 financial year, with a total value of $17.16 billion. 
                Regarding the third part of the question, the Honourable Member is correct in saying that an article entitled 'Why we should tax foreign purchases of Aussie homes' appeared in News Limited Network newspapers on 12 March 2014, which discussed a proposal for a 15 per cent tax to be imposed on non-resident purchases of Australian property. The article also notes that such a tax 'would likely deter some purchases'. 
                Regarding any proposal to introduce a tax on the purchase of properties by non-residents, the Commonwealth Government has no plans to introduce such a tax.

                The department conducted a non-regulated analysis of existing policy for Californian table grapes to Western Australia. A draft report was issued for stakeholder consultation and a final report was released on 18 July 2013. Grapevine red blotch associated virus (red blotch disease - GRBaV) was fully considered in the final report (see Appendix D - Additional information on GRBaV).
                  _____________
                  Appendix D
                  Additional information on Grapevine red blotch associated virus (GRBaV)
                Grapevine red blotch-associated virus (GRBaV) is a virus recently identified in grapevines in the USA (Al Rwahnih et al. 2012; Krenz et al. 2012). It is associated with disease symptoms known as red blotch or grapevine red leaf disease (Al Rwahnih et al. 2012; Poojari et al. 2013). There have been no reports of the virus or the disease in Australia and tests on ten grapevine varieties from an Australian collection did not detect the virus (University of Adelaide 2013). GRBaV is a quarantine pest for Australia.
                The first accounts of the red blotch disease in red wine grape vineyards were in 2007 (Stamp &amp; Wei 2013). However, earlier reports of symptoms similar to those caused by grapevine leafroll-associated viruses may have been linked to GRBaV (Al Rwahnih et al. 2013; Poojari et al. 2013). Virtually identical isolates of GRBaV have been reported from New York, named Grapevine cabernet franc-associated virus (GCFaV); California, named Grapevine red blotch-associated virus (GRBaV), Washington, named Grapevine redleaf-associated virus (GRLaV), and British Columbia (Canada) (Al Rwahnih et al. 2012; Al Rwahnih et al. 2013; Krenz et al. 2012; Poojari et al. 2013). All these detections are considered to be variants of the same species (Poojari et al. 2013).
                GRBaV is very likely to be the causal agent of the observed red blotch disease symptoms as it is consistently detected in symptomatic plants (Stamp &amp; Wei 2013; Poojari et al. 2013). GRBaV has been detected in bark scrapings of dormant canes, leaf petioles, leaves, root tips, rootstock and scion material (Al Rwahnih et al. 2012; Al Rwahnih et al. 2013; Poojari et al. 2013; Stamp &amp; Wei 2013). Symptoms of GRBaV appear to be only linked to vines with maturing bunches towards the end of the season but prior to harvest. 
                GRBaV infects grapevine systemically and can be transmitted through grafting (Al Rwahnih et al. 2013; Poojari et al. 2013). Although there are no reports of the virus being isolated from grape berries, rachis material, peduncles or seeds, there is a chance that this systemic virus could be present in all parts of the plant. GRBaV infection has also been reported to reduce the brix levels in the berries, yields and other berry quality attributes (Poojari et al. 2013; Sudarshana &amp; Wolpert 2012). Calvi (2011) and Poojari et al. (2013) have suggested that a vascular blockage at the leaf-petiole boundary may affect the translocation of sucrose in the phloem from leaves to fruit in vines with red leaf symptoms.
                GRBaV is present in some areas in California and vines have been found to be infected in some Californian wine grape vineyards (Stamp &amp; Wei 2013; Staff 2013). Although the majority of accounts to date associate the virus and the disease with wine grape varieties (Al Rwahnih et al. 2012; Al Rwahnih et al. 2013; Krenz et al. 2012; Poojari et al. 2013; Stamp &amp; Wei 2013; Sudarshana &amp; Wolpert 2012), there has been one report of the virus from a cross of Thompson Seedless x Concord (Staff 2013).
                GRBaV has been assigned to the family Geminiviridae based on its genetic sequence (Al Rwahnih et al. 2012; Krenz et al. 2012; Poojari et al. 2013). Geminiviridae is a large and economically important family of plant viruses referred to as geminiviruses, which have single stranded DNA genomes and geminate particles (Carrillo-Tripp et al. 2006; Timmermans et al. 1994). 
                If GRBaV can infect imported table grape bunches it can only establish and spread in Australia if it can transfer from that infected bunch to a host plant. Mechanisms for the potential transfer of GRBaV are considered below. 
                GRBaV is graft transmissible using standard grafting techniques (Al Rwahnih et al. 2013; Poojari et al. 2013) and the grapevine rachis is not used for propagation and grafting. Mechanical transmission has been speculated for GRBaV (Stamp &amp; Wei 2013) although there is no evidence to support this mode to transmission for GRBaV. Some geminiviruses are transmitted by mechanical abrasion in laboratory experiments but they are not naturally transmitted in this way (Brown et al. 2012; Briddon &amp; Stanley 2009; Rojas et al. 2005).
                Virus seed transmission is well studied and over 200 plant virus species are known to be seed transmissible (Sastry 2013). However, while there are over 100 species of geminiviruses, none are seed transmitted (Sastry 2013; McGarry &amp; Ayre 2012; Briddon &amp; Stanley 2009; Carrillo-Tripp et al. 2006; Rojas et al. 2005; Abdel-Salam, et al. 1998; Sudarshana et al. 1998; Polston et al. 1993; Wong et al. 1993; Brown &amp; Nelson 1988). 
                For vector transmission of GRBaV to occur, a suitable vector would need to acquire the virus from an infected bunch and transfer the virus to a susceptible host. Transmission by an insect vector is considered in more detail below.
                It had been speculated that GRBaV could be spread by sap feeding vectors, with whiteflies and leafhoppers identified as potential candidates because of their known association with geminiviruses (Argi-analysis 2012; Staff 2013; Stamp &amp; Wei 2013). One report from Stamp &amp; Wei (2013) also suggested that aphids could potentially vector the virus but aphids do not vector other geminiviruses. DAFF have contacted the authors and they confirmed that they had no evidence of transmission by aphids. 
                Experimental work has now shown that the Virginia creeper leafhopper, Erythroneura ziczac (Walsh) (Cicadellidae), is a vector of GRBaV after a three day acquisition period on infected host foliage (Poojari et al. 2013). Studies are currently underway to investigate the virus-vector relationship for the western grape leafhopper, Erythroneuraelegantula (Osborn),which is also present in western USA vineyards (Poojari et al. 2013). 
                  Erythroneura is a genus with many species native to North America (CABI 2011; Dmitriev &amp; Dietrich 2007) and there are no species of the genus Erythroneurain Australia (NSW DPI 2013). There are many leafhopper (Cicadelladae) species in Australia (CSIRO 1991), but it is more likely that GRBaV is transmitted by leafhopper species closely related to E. ziczac. The leafhopper genera Anzygina, Empoascanara and Pettya are present in Australia and they are in the same tribe as Erythroneura; Erythroneurini, (ANIC; NSW DPI 2013; Fletcher &amp; Larivière 2009). There are some species currently classified in the genus Zygina although this genus is recognised as needing reclassification in Australia (NSW DPI 2013). 
                The relationships between geminiviruses and their insect vectors are typically highly specific with particular virus genera linked to a group of vectors (Briddon &amp; Stanley 2009; Rojas et al. 2005; Timmermans et al. 2004; Lopez-Moya 2002; Lett et al. 2002). This specificity is partly explained by the complex circulative non-propagative mode of transmission (Lopez-Moya 2002; Timmermans et al. 1994). Grape vines are reported to be a host for Bemisia tabaci (whitefly) (DAFWA 2008). However, no geminivirus transmitted by a leafhopper is also transmitted by a whitefly (Brown et al. 2012; Briddon &amp; Stanley 2009; Rojas et al. 2005). If there are other vectors of GRBaV, this information suggests that they are more likely to be leafhoppers in the genus Erythroneura. 
                GRBaV transfer could potentially occur via vectors imported with the table grape bunch. Erythroneura ziczac feeds on grapevines in the USA and all life stages are associated with leaf material, not table grape bunches (Lowery 2010; Paxton &amp; Thorvilson 1996; PNW 2013). Species from the Erythroneura are quarantine pests for Australia (DAFF 2013). In over ten years of trade of Californian table grapes, no leafhopper species have been found during phytosanitary inspection.
                Since the table grape bunches are purchased for consumption, most berries will be eaten and it is the rachis that is more likely be discarded as waste in a range of environments. Waste disposed via municipal garbage collection will be sent to tips, where it will be commercially composted or disposed in landfill. However, smaller quantities of fruit waste will be discarded in urban, rural and natural localities including domestic composts, along roadsides, and in other environments and this may include commercial vineyards. 
                Taking account of the vector specificity of geminiviruses and the absence of Erythroneura species in Australia, it is less likely that a suitable vector is present in Australia compared to North America. However, given the recent research into GRBaV, the presence of a leafhopper vector in Australia cannot be dismissed. If a suitable vector is present in Australia, it would first need to feed on discarded fruit waste. Leafhoppers in the Erythroneura are associated with leaf material with a preference for oviposition and feeding on the lower side of the leaf (Paxton 1990; Paxton &amp; Thornvilson 1996). 
                There are reports of more than 15 species of leafhoppers recorded in Australian vineyards (Glenn 2000). Several of the species recorded in vineyards were able to survive on vine leaves for nine days under no choice feeding experiments. However, field surveys between years and across multiple sites in Victoria and South Australia did not record any developmental association of leafhoppers with commercially grown vines (Glenn 2000). The presence of the leafhoppers in the vineyards was positively correlated with host weed species growing within and around the vineyards (Glenn 2000). When leafhoppers where collected around the vine, adults were collected in greater numbers near the trunk rather than in the canopy (Glenn 2000). Glenn (2000) does not report any association of Australian leafhoppers with grape bunches.
                There are no reports of leafhoppers as pests on grapevine in Australia from state departments of agriculture (such as the 2011/ 2012 viticulture spray guide, DAFWA 2011; NSW DPI 2007) or from the peak industry research body (GWRDC 2013a). For example, a survey was conducted by the Grape Wine Research Development Corporation (GWRDC) in 2011 on the pest profile in vineyards that included 354 responses from all grape growing states in Australia (GWRDC 2013b). The respondents note several insects as pests (light brown apple moth, locusts, earwigs, mealy bugs etc) though there are no reports of leafhoppers (GWRDC 2013b). GWRDC website also includes information on pest and diseases of grapevines and there is no information on leafhoppers (GWRDC 2013a).
                For a suitable leafhopper vector associated with Vitis spp in Australia to transmit GRBaV it would first need to feed on infected table grape bunch material. However, plant material severed from the transpiration stream will lose moisture and sap sucking insects are known to respond negatively to plant tissues under moisture stress (Huberty and Denno 2004). A review of the scientific literature showed chewing insects where not affected by moisture stressed host plant tissue. In contrast, sap-feeding insects, such as leafhoppers, responded negatively to moisture stress (Huberty and Denno 2004). More specifically, egg, nymphal and adult densities of leafhoppers in the Erythroneura genus are known to respond negatively when irrigation water deficits are imposed on commercial grapevines (Costello 2008; Daane et al. 1995). In a trial conducted in California, the number of adult leafhoppers recorded on moisture stressed vines (no supplementary irrigation during the growing season) decreased by over 90% compared to vines receiving commercial rates of irrigation (Daane et al. 1995). In this study, the moisture stressed vines yielded 15.7 tonnes per hectare compared to vines that received commercial rates of irrigation and yielded 48 tonnes per hectare (Daane et al. 1995). This level of moisture stress imposed on a living plant, which still yielded fruit, is likely to be significantly less than what would occur in harvested material severed from the transpiration stream of the plant. 
                  Harvested table grape bunches are known to be perishable and begin to desiccate during transport. Well developed cold storage techniques have been developed to minimise this water loss (Litcher et al. 2008; Candir et al. 2011; Meng et al. 2008). The mechanism that influences the rate of moisture loss is the difference in water potential in the commodity and the atmosphere (water vapour deficit) that is largely influenced by humidity and temperature (Lichter et al. 2011). Therefore, commodities lose less moisture at low temperatures and high relative humidity and as temperature increases and humidity decreases, water loss increases. During cold storage conditions (about 1.5 °C and 90% relative humidity), moisture loss from a table grape bunch can be between 0.41 to 6% over 60 days depending on the liner used in the packaging (Ngcobo 2013). Moisture loss is much more severe in the rachis with greater than 40% moisture loss over 60 days (Ngcobo 2013). Grapes purchased at retail outlets and then stored in a refrigerator (at about 5 °C) are considered to have a shelf life of about seven days (USDA 2011). 
                  Once table grape bunches are exposed to ambient temperature at retail sale, moisture loss will increase. Studies have shown that table grape bunches of several varieties, including red globe and Thompson seedless, exposed to 20 °C for 3 - 4 days result in significant browning of the rachis and pedicles (Guelfat-Reich et al. 1975; Lichter, et al. 2008). Significant browning of the rachis is known to be linked to water loss of about 2 to 3% (Crisosto et al. 2001; Lichter et al. 2011) and results in cell death (Balic et al. 2012). At a higher temperature (28 °C), Thompson seedless bunches recorded a 20% water loss over three days (Lo'ay 2011). Further work details the interaction between temperature and relative humidity and moisture loss in sugarone and Thompson seedless table grape bunches (Lichter et al. 2011). At 10 °C and 95 -  99% relative humidity, moisture loss from a table grape bunches stored in punnets was recorded to be about 0.5 - 1% over four days; decreasing relative humidity to about 70%, increased moisture loss to about 2.5 - 3% (Lichter et al. 2011). At 20 °C and 70% relative humidity, moisture losses of about 3.5% were recorded over 4 days and water loss increased with increasing water vapour deficit. Compared to the whole bunch, at 20 °C and 70% relative humidity, moisture loss in the rachis was greater with around 15 - 25% moisture loss (Lichter et al. 2011).
                  After domestic consumption, any waste discarded in the environment will continue to desiccate under dry conditions. Under wet conditions, moisture loss would be delayed. However, specialist saprophytic micro-organisms will hasten the decay of discarded material under wet conditions. Saprophytes will hasten a loss of cell integrity and this rotting material is unlikely to be conducive to leafhoppers that are associated with living tissue for feeding.

                Setting a fixed population target can mask the complexities of the issue. For example, there are many aspects of population change in Australia, such as changes in fertility rates that cannot be accurately predicted or directly controlled. 
                The Australian Government has in place a range of commitments to infrastructure, services, jobs and the environment which will provide for Australia's currently growing population including a commitment to better plan for and sequence infrastructure development across Australia, and to develop a White Paper on the Development of Northern Australia. These policies will support environmentally, socially and economically responsible growth and cultivate resilient, productive and fair communities.

                NBN Co Limited (NBN Co) advised the Government that to deliver fast broadband sooner, at less cost to taxpayers and more affordably for consumers, the NBN should be completed using a multi-technology mix. This is predicted to save taxpayers $32 billion, get the NBN finished four years sooner than under Labor and enable nine out of ten Australians in the fixed line footprint to get access to download speeds of 50 megabits per second or more by 2019.
                The rollout of the NBN is currently underway in Maitland. NBN Co is working on a new rollout schedule which will indicate when different parts of Australia will be connected to the NBN. It is expected that this will provide greater certainty about the rollout timing and technology for many areas, such as Aberdeen, Aberglasslyn, Branxton, Broke, Cassilis, Cessnock, Denman, Gillieston Heights, Greta, Kandos, Kurri Kurri, Lochinvar, Merriwa, Mulbring, Murrurundi, Muswellbrook, Pokolbin, Rutherford, Rylstone, Scone, Singleton, and Wollombi.

                The Government has not made a decision to sell Australian Hearing Services. 
                As announced in the 2014-15 Budget, the Government has decided to undertake a scoping study. The scoping study will assess the future ownership options for Australian Hearing Services, and, should a sale be agreed by Government, ensure an appropriate model for the agreed course of action is used to continue the availability of high quality hearing services for all eligible Australians. 
                Once completed, the Government will consider the scoping study and its recommendations in the context of the 2015-16 Budget.

                In light of the previous and projected budget deficits in Australia and the high cost of participation in world expos, the Government has decided it can no longer justify participating in the World Expo in Milan in 2015.
                Through our Embassy in Rome and Consul General in Milan, we will support Australian trade, tourism and networking events in the lead up to, and during, the Milan Expo. This presence will support Australian organisations and business activities to participate in promotions alongside the Expo which emphasise our people-to-people and cultural connections. 
                Even though Australia is not participating in the Expo, Australia will have a significant public diplomacy footprint in Italy during 2015 through the Australia Council's Pavilion at the Venice Art Biennale.
