     Minister, do you recall that, when I asked you 14 months ago whether all health products, including tampons, vitamins and over-the-counter medicines would be GST free, you said that the GST would not affect me much unless I needed cosmetic surgery or tattoos removed?
     Isn't it the case that the GST still applies to all these health products and that, whilst the cost of your shaving cream will be reduced under your new tax system, all Australian women will be paying more for sanitary products which were previously exempt from tax on health grounds?
     Minister, will you respond to the 10,355 women and men who have signed the electronic petition being tabled in the Senate today and announce that tampons and pads will be GST free in the same way you have said you will exempt condoms, sunscreens, folate pills and personal lubricants from the GST?

     Prime Minister, I refer to your promise, recommitted today, that no petrol price will rise as a result of the GST.
     Are you aware that, today, the price of unleaded petrol at the Mobil station on the corner of Victoria Road and Macarthur Avenue in North Parramatta is 84.
    9c per litre?
     Prime Minister, given Parramatta motorists will not get any of your petrol grant and the 7c cut in excise will not cover the impact of the GST, how will you guarantee that the GST will not force up their petrol prices in Parramatta?

     My question is to the Prime Minister, and it recalls the exact circumstances of the one I asked last Thursday on John and Wendy.
     Prime Minister, are you aware of comments by Professor Ann Harding, whom you cited approvingly earlier this week, last night on PM regarding John and Wendy:The $12 a fortnight better off is before the GST.
     We estimate they will be paying about $28 per fortnight GST.
     So overall they are about $16 a fortnight worse off before these new special measures that Senator Newman has announced will take effect.
    Prime Minister, isn't it the case that John and Wendy are ineligible for these special measures because their child was born in December?
     Prime Minister, given that a week and a backflip later John and Wendy are still worse off, when will you fix this problem?

     Can you explain why today Caltex at Mount Victoria in the Blue Mountains is charging 83.
    9c a litre for unleaded petrol while Caltex in Lithgow, just 25 kilometres down the road, is charging 93.
    9c - a full 10c a litre more - when Caltex says the cost of transporting petrol from Lithgow to Bathurst, a distance of 65 kilometres, is just 0.
    2c a litre?
     Hasn't the decision to abolish the maximum endorsed wholesale price scheme and remove the ACCC's powers to monitor wholesale petrol prices resulted in a total lack of transparency in petrol prices at the wholesale level and allowed petrol companies to effectively charge retailers whatever they want?
     Treasurer, motorists living in Lithgow and further west want to know what their government is doing to ensure the unfair petrol price gap is not retained but narrowed and made more transparent.

     Don't these tables show that one year after your tax cuts are introduced revenues from personal income taxes will be back to where they are now and, after two years, the average Australian taxpayer will be paying $600 more in personal income tax than they are today?

    9 per cent you paraded at the 1998 election and upon which you based your compensation package?

     the full amount received in the first GST year (including any loan component) should be recognised as revenue.

     It says:It is understood that the use of a `loan' by the Commonwealth in 2000-01 has been driven solely by the Commonwealth's own budgetary issues.

     Do you recall telling an audience of French business leaders in Paris, in relation to the GST, `I do not think there are any negatives at all for business.
     I think they are all beneficial.
    ' Prime Minister, have you seen the latest Yellow Pages small business survey, which shows small business confidence falling to its lowest ever recorded level, with over 50 per cent of proprietors believing the GST would adversely affect their bottom line, two-thirds of proprietors concerned by the complexity of the GST, and only 15 per cent believing that government policies are supportive?
     Instead of squandering the now more than $420 million of taxpayers' money on GST advertising and propaganda, why hasn't your government put more effort into preparing small business to better cope with this GST?

     - The question to the minister is: Minister, isn't it a fact that, on the one hand, you claim that the $762 is there to pay for the higher prices caused by the GST and, on the other side of your face, you claim -  - and on the other hand -  - Thank you, Mr Speaker.

     - Sorry, guys.
     Minister, are you aware that the latest small area labour market survey released by the Department of Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business on Friday shows that three-quarters of labour market areas experienced a rise in the unemployment rate?
     Are you aware that the number of areas experiencing above 10 per cent unemployment, many of which are in regional Australia, rose by a massive 34 per cent?
     Minister, why do you allow your government to constantly crow about the national unemployment rate falling when it is rising in many of the areas you and your party represent?
     Is this one of your most important outcomes?

     Was this advice not provided after receipt of the letters of demand sent this morning by Senators Faulkner and Ray to the Electoral Commissioner and the Commissioner of Taxation demanding that they take this action?
     Didn't these letters state clearly that legal action would be commenced in the Federal Court tomorrow?
     Was it not the threat of legal action from the Labor Party that brought this to a head, and only the prospect of being found out by the court has led, belatedly, to the electors' privacy finally being protected?

     and that prohibits the raising in a court of anything done or said in the Commonwealth Parliament.

     My question goes to some points made by the Prime Minister in answer to the previous question I asked him.
     Is he aware that Justice O'Loughlin stated in the Cubillo and Gunner case that:Neither the evidence in this trial, nor the reasons for judgment, deny the existence of `the Stolen Generation'.
     Numerous writings tell tragically of a distressing past.

     That is one of your problems.
     But I will proceed nevertheless.
     -  - We do.
     We actually do.
     Justice O'Loughlin specifically found that `the applicants in these proceedings have suffered the psychiatric illnesses which they alleged.
    ' Then he `accepted Mrs Cubillo's evidence that she was viciously assaulted', and further that Mr Gunner was `the victim of a sexual assault by one of the missionaries'.
     Is it not a fact that the Commonwealth has now outlaid more than $12 million on this case alone, without in any way redressing the hurt and trauma acknowledged by the court, and that the only sure beneficiaries of this government's determination to confront every case in the courts will be the legal profession?
     Will the Prime Minister now consider a more just, equitable and humane response to the plight of the stolen generations?

     Does the minister recall issuing a press release in December 1998 which said:Records show that several hundred Australians received South Vietnamese and Cambodian awards during the Vietnam War, but at the time Australians were not allowed to officially accept or wear such individual awards.
    Under the Government's foreign awards policy, there is now a mechanism whereby foreign honours and awards, issued by a former government which has ceased to exist, may be formally recognised and approved for wearing.
    Minister, in view of this, why do you continue to deny the survivors of the Battle of Long Tan the right to wear the awards which the then Vietnamese government wanted to present to our diggers but was prevented from doing so by the Australian Liberal government of the day?
     Secondly, Minister, if your reply is that the Queen had not approved the Long Tan awards, will you table copies of her approval for the awards which have been approved under the mechanism you announced in December of 1998?

     Prime Minister, yesterday you said in this House:We are not in the business of cutting benefits for needy Australians; we never have been and we never will be.
    Prime Minister, is it not the case that your government cut $850 million from child care; slashed funding for the JET program in half; abolished the earnings credit scheme -  Government member - No.

     In supporting the statement of his three ministers that they will not cooperate with UN treaty committees on human rights, Prime Minister Howard said that these matters should be determined by Australians themselves.
     If he is genuine in this statement, why have the Prime Minister and the government ignored the determinations of Australia's own Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, which has condemned the mandatory sentencing of Aboriginal people and the mandatory detention of refugees?
     Furthermore, why has the government totally ignored the pleas of the Refugee Council of Australia, church groups and other community organisations that support the UN criticism?
     If the Prime Minister wants to ignore the UN on these issues, why won't he at least listen to the millions of Australians who are very concerned about his policies on refugees and indigenous people?

     Prime Minister, do you think it is better to spend $1.
    4 million of taxpayers' money on colonnades, quadrangles and ambience for the King's School or on doubling special education funding for 3,000 students?
     Prime Minister, how much more ambience does King's need?

     - The Prime Minister can deny it, Mr Speaker.
     - If you rule that it is not proper to ask, `Is it a fact that you behaved in this manner?
    ' it means that it is not possible to raise any question concerning allegations of improper behaviour by ministers.
     On your interpretation, Mr Speaker, we could not have asked, `Is it a fact that you misused your telephone card?
    ' That would have been a question that you say we could not ask.
     I put it to you that that is reducing the capacity of people to interrogate ministers far below the level that accountability requires.
     - Mr Speaker, while we persist with the points of order and would like you to reflect on them, I am quite prepared to seek to rephrase the question if it will help you.
     I do not resile from the points of order, and we would like you subsequently to rule on them.

     Minister, are you aware of allegations in today's Australian that reports detailing incidents of sexual molestation of female detainees by an ACM officer were `discarded by the company without investigation'?
     Minister, given your spokesman's comment that `unacceptable behaviour is unacceptable', will you now call a full judicial inquiry into the growing number of allegations emerging from Australia's detention centres, the management practices of ACM and the conduct of the company's officers?

     Minister, will you confirm that ACM, which has the contract to run Commonwealth detention centres, is a wholly owned subsidiary of the American Wackenhut Corrections Corporation?
     Are you aware that, in the last 18 months, Wackenhut corrections was sued by the US justice department because its officers sexually abused minors in a Louisiana prison and subjected them to corporal punishment, excessive force, gas grenades and chemical restraints?
     Are you aware that Wackenhut corrections surrendered the contract to run a prison in Texas following investigations of sex between guards and inmates?
     Are you aware that it settled out of court with the family of a 14-year-old girl, who was raped repeatedly by a guard in a Wackenhut prison, and who subsequently committed suicide?
     - Are you aware that in 1995 Wackenhut was found guilty of illegally retaliating against a whistleblower?
     - Are you also aware that George Wackenhut -  - founder and chairman, has said, `Australian operations are very important to us .

     Can you also confirm that this research included federal election voting intentions in Queensland, the results of which are set out on page 6 of the leaked report, which has been suppressed by the government?
     Was this report suppressed because it improperly contains partisan political research funded by the taxpayer?

     Was this report suppressed not only because it improperly contained partisan political research but also because it contained findings that are an obvious embarrassment to the minister and his government?

     I refer the Treasurer to his endorsement in question time yesterday of the claim of the Commissioner of Taxation that existing law does not allow an employer and an employee to be the same person for the purpose of superannuation tax deductions.
     Isn't it true that this claim has been contradicted by legal opinions to the Taxation Office from Professor Richard Vann in August 1998, who recommended legislation to overcome the problem, and Sydney barrister Chris Bevan in February 1999, and further contradicted by the Australian Taxation Office Technical Liaison Committee in October 1998?
     Given this, why won't you make the legislation to outlaw the superannuation tax avoidance schemes retrospective to October 1998?

     Prime Minister, do you recall yesterday refusing to rule out the Kurnell Peninsula as the site for a second airport for Sydney?
     Given that you have previously said you would announce the government's decision on the second airport before Christmas this year, will you today rule out Kurnell as a possible site?
     If not, why are you prepared to sacrifice the people of Sutherland Shire and beyond just so you can save Minister Kelly?
