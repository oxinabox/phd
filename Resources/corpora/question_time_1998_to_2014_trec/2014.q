     The AEC sends written instructions to all polling booths in Australia, approximately seven days before an election, directing AEC staff to distribute preferences to two candidates chosen by the AEC, regardless of the number of votes by Australians for each candidate as shown on the ballot paper.

     Half of all airline fatalities come from maintenance and inspection failures.

     The 5,000 Qantas engineering workers who created this safety are now to be sacked, their jobs and $1 billion a year going overseas.
     Overseas access by treaty is confined to an Australian airline.

     Prime Minister, the budget maintained funding for Bass Strait freight and passenger vehicle subsidies and flagged the Productivity Commission inquiry into the issue.
     Prime Minister, Bass Strait is the most significant brake on Tasmania's economic development, and any reduction in the subsidies would be a crippling blow.
     When will the commission's report be made public; when will the government respond; and do you commit to not reducing the subsidies in any way, regardless of the commission's recommendations?

     Thank you for the funding of the election commitment of $100 million for mobile phone black spots.
     I understand that nationally over 1,800 black spots have been reported to the department and this money in the budget will be used to fix approximately 250.
     Given that many of the 1,550 remaining black spots are not financially viable for the telcos to build and in order to speed up the rollout, would you consider collocating mobile capability and NBN wireless towers?

     I refer to the petition of more than 2,500 GPs calling on the Prime Minister to abandon his GP tax and to a GP registrar in the member for Corangamite's electorate who writes, 'The $7 GP tax will make regular visits for some patients unaffordable.
     I genuinely fear that they will refuse visits and fail to have proper management of their heart failure, diabetes and chronic lung disease.
    ' Why should sick and elderly patients in Corangamite be stopped from getting the treatment they need because of the Prime Minister's GP tax?

     According to NATSEM, a single income family on $65,000 will be $6,000 a year worse off because of the Prime Minister's unfair budget.
                          This week the Prime Minister has failed to rule out further cuts, including a $15 GP tax, cuts to the National Disability Insurance Scheme, scrapping the family tax benefit, further cuts to schools and hospitals.
     How much more will Australian families have to suffer under the Treasurer's alternative budget?
