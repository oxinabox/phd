 - It has not been a secret at any time that the request for an opinion came from the minister, in this case the  minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs. This was referred to by the solicitors for the plaintiffs sometime in January when they sought confirmation from the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth indicated that, if the need arose in the course of the hearing, counsel would be on instructions and confirming that that was the case. It was therefore known on all fronts before the date of the hearing before Justice Callinan.Let me just say that there have been some rather strange assertions made. There has been no attempt to cover up anything. There has been no conspiracy of any sort. The Commonwealth has consistently taken the position that whether Justice Callinan sat on the case was a matter for him and the court. It remained the position until he determined to withdraw. - Senator Bolkus, the shadow Attorney-General, and the member for Banks seem to have taken a different view and have put that view abroad in the media. I simply reject it. I invite them to have a look at what they are doing. The High Court has heard the case, Justice Callinan has withdrawn and the remaining six judges will determine the case. It is a matter that is still under consideration, and it should not be politicised in the way that the opposition is attempting to do.</DOC>

 - I might well start my answer by saying, if only time permits. - I appreciate that, Mr Speaker. Since the parliament last sat, there has been what I can only describe as an impressive escalation of the credits against the name of the Australian economy. Since the parliament last sat, there have been unmistak  able further signs that the economic momentum built up in 1997 has continued into 1998. Most importantly of all, there has been a dramatic reminder that if my government had not taken corrective measures in the face of the $10½ billion deficit - and in the face of the legacy of debt and deficit that we inherited from the former government led by the now disgraced former finance minister who now poses as the policydevoid Leader of the Opposition - the economic troubles of Asia would have filtered through into the Australian economy. This is no idle political claim. It is an undeniable fact that if we had not strengthened the Australian economy over the last two years -  - He says it is rubbish. It is not rubbish that we now have the lowest inflation rate in the world. It is not rubbish that in two years time we will have halved the debt to GDP ratio that we inherited from you. It is not rubbish that you left us a $10½ billion deficit and we will be budgeting for a surplus in three or four months time. It is not rubbish that we have presided over interest rate reductions that are the equivalent of a $90 to $100 a week wage increase for the average Australian wage earner. They are undeniable facts. There is no rubbish about that.Over the past couple of months we have seen capital expenditure figures demonstrating the strong confidence of the Australian business community in the future prospects of the Australian economy. We have seen only last Friday in the area of tourism, where there were legitimate grounds for concern, a dramatic rebound in the month of January in the wake of the rather disappointing figures for November and December. Building approvals are now 20 per cent higher than a year ago and, despite the strength of the economy, wage and price pressures remain subdued. Average weekly ordinary time earnings rose by 3.7 per cent over the year to November 1997 - well within the RBA's wages growth target range.The other good economic news that has occurred since the parliament last sat includes the very positive industry policy statement  that I delivered two days after the parliament rose. That is seen by the business community of Australia as a strong and balanced response to the needs of the Australian business community. But it does not stop there. Perhaps the opposition would not like to be reminded of something called a `climate change conference' that was held at Kyoto where the member for Denison, at the critical stage, wanted Australia to sign off on a figure that would have reduced our GDP by 1½ per cent. You were prepared, along with your mates - despite the fact that you were a member of the Australian delegation that went to Tokyo - to sign off on something which would have sold out Australia's interests.I am pleased to report that since the parliament last met there has been an absolute plethora of indications that the Australian economy is fundamentally strong but, most important of all, the judgment of my government in taking the corrective measures it has has insulated the Australian economy and through it the Australian people against the growing economic troubles in the Asia-Pacific region.</DOC>

 - In my previous answer I pointed out that it was known on both sides, by the plaintiffs and the Commonwealth, that the request had been made to the minister. If  one carefully reads the reasons given by Justice Callinan for his decision - I think on 4, 5 or 6 February - one will see that he refers to the fact that it is in his mind, too, that the request came from the minister. What Senator Bolkus was doing, as I understand it, was seeking the consent of Justice Callinan to release documents that were held by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee and were still under privilege. I do not know that the purpose you attribute to Senator Bolkus is one that would have been recognised as such by Justice Callinan. I do not know what was in his mind other than what the registrar has conveyed to us. The registrar indicated simply that Justice Callinan had overlooked certain documents and had some inaccurate recollections. It is a matter for him.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Fisher for his question. I think the Australian public is going to be interested in key issues during the course of this year: key issues like interest rates, job opportunities and taxation possibilities - all of the kinds of things that you will never hear a question from the Australian Labor Party about. They go off on all these little tangential issues because they cannot face the big ones. They cannot bring themselves to face the big issues. Two years ago the unemployment rate was 8.5 per cent; in January it was down to 8.2 per cent. Two years ago the CPI was 5.1 per cent; now it is actually negative - 0.2 per cent. Two years ago growth was at 3.4 per cent; over the year to September it was 4.6 per cent. Two years ago variable mortgage rates were 10.5 per cent, and today they are 6.5 per cent. Two years ago the budget was  in a $10.3 billion deficit.	 Over two budgets we have clawed back $7½ billion and, if the Australian Labor Party is unsuccessful in its strategy, next year we can put Australia into the black. Notwithstanding the Australian Labor Party's paltry attempts to stop Australia getting back to paying its own way, this government will be able to make a bold claim: we took the failures of Beazley as finance minister and we turned them around.I was absolutely amazed to see the failed finance minister, in his first economic speech and at his own invitation - he invited himself up to the CEDA conference recently - claim that, if he were elected back, he would deliver three years of surplus budgets. His problem is, he has a thing called `form'. He was a finance minister in 1994-95 and his outcome was negative $13.1 billion. He was a finance minister in 1995-96 and his outcome was negative $10.3 billion. This is the man who, in two years of form, ran up $23 billion worth of deficits. But re-elect him and he will produce a surplus every year - every single year - notwithstanding all of the expenditure cuts he opposes and notwithstanding the tax policy that he opposes!The only surplus he has ever delivered was a surplus of false promises in relation to the budget position. This is the man who said before the last election that the budget was in surplus. He says now that he will do it again, and he has $23 billion to prove it.</DOC>

 - No, I do not, and let me take the opportunity of reminding the House  of the contribution you made when you were in government to the problem the Australian community now has. You were warned by your health minister -  - In 1990 and 1991 you were failing as an employment minister because it was then that you presided over an unemployment rate of 11.2 per cent. You not only failed as a finance minister; you were also a miserable failure as an employment minister. In 1991 you drove unemployment in this country to a post-Depression high. While the Leader of the Opposition, in those years, was failing as an employment minister, his then colleague Senator Richardson who was the health minister warned the Hawke and Keating governments that, if something was not then done when private health insurance was sitting at 39 to 40 per cent of the total population, there would be a further inexorable decline. Quite deliberately and maliciously the Keating government, aided and abetted by the Leader of the Opposition, set out to destroy private health insurance in Australia.It was your neglect in your years in government, when you could have done something to stabilise that level, that has created the problem that we are now grappling with. If we had not introduced those tax incentives, then the level of private health insurance would have been much lower than what it is now. If your policies were adopted, the situation would be a lot more serious than what it is now.You have no alternative health policy, as you have no alternative taxation policy. You simply believe that by running a fear cam  paign you can induce the Australian people to forget your deplorable record as a failed finance minister, your deplorable record as a failed employment minister -  - And your absolutely deplorable performance during 13 years in government.</DOC>

 - I am delighted to inform the honourable member for Deakin, and in fact all members of the House, about a survey which has just been released by the Australian Stock Exchange. The press release accompanying that survey has the headline `Share ownership soars with Telstra float'. The survey shows that 40.4 per cent of Australians now have some form of share ownership. This is an increase of 6.4 per cent in the last nine months. It is the first survey since Telstra listed on the Stock Exchange last November and states that some 5.5 million Australians have some form of share ownership.What this shows is that Australians are prepared to put their money into companies that are prepared to grow Australia's wealth. It is a very encouraging and healthy sign. I suppose it is fair to say that Labor does not particularly welcome this news because they have little time for the share investors. They believe that the stock market is only for the big end of town. Australians from all walks of life - in fact, I have noted even a couple of Labor members of the federal parliament - are part of the 1.9 million investors who have invested in Telstra. -  - What this survey from the Australian Stock Exchange shows is that some 559,000 Australians have invested, through Telstra, for the very first time in the share market; that some 14.2 per cent of the adult population now have some interest in shares - and, of course, we know that 92 per cent of the employees of Telstra have invested in the company through the employee share ownership plan.We know, again, that Labor does not like Australians making their own investment decisions, and they would do well to take note of this survey and what it shows in respect of the levels of share ownership in lower income levels of households. This survey shows that 45 per cent of households with incomes of between $30,000 and $50,000 per annum have some shareholding; it also shows that 30.9 per cent of those households are direct investors in shares.It is interesting to note the trend towards younger Australians investing on the market, because something like one-third of those aged between 25 and 34 are investors on the share market, and more than one-half - in fact, 52.1 per cent - of those between 35 and 44 are investors. A good sign again: females have increased in their share market investments from some 28.2 per cent nine months ago to 36.2 per cent now. It is also interesting to note that, since Telstra listed on the share market, some 96.2 per cent of all who invested in shares have held those shares; those who have invested have realised that this is a good long-term investment.What this survey shows is very good news. It shows that an ever increasing number of Australians are choosing to take control of their own savings and investment. But, of course, we know that perhaps one of the groups that does not seek to welcome it as good news is the Australian Labor Party. All I can do there is to suggest to the Australian Labor Party that they might seek advice from those two members of the Labor Party who have invested - Senators Crowley and McKiernan from another place - who no  doubt opposed, like all the other Labor members opposite, the sale of the Telstra shares and then, we note from the register, have chosen to purchase some shares in the company - very sensible people.If they do not want to take advice from those two, they should perhaps have a look at the article in yesterday's Sunday Telegraph from former Senator Stephen Loosley. I will not go into it in too much detail but just commend it to the Labor Party to read. But I will tell you the headline - `Telstra policy could cost Labor'. Mr Speaker, it certainly will.</DOC>

 - There is a very simple answer - and that is that the figures in the budget paper were based on what the Department of Finance and the Department of Health estimated. I have been meticulous in what I have said publicly, and I have never made any overblown statements. The fact is that I have had lower expectations of what this would do than bureaucrats in the Department of Finance, bureaucrats in my depart  ment and people in Access Economics who costed this before the last election.As for the issue in the high income surcharge, we do not know what percentage that has increased health insurance by. It probably has increased it. The difficulty is that probably fewer people know about it than we expected. When tax returns come in for the 1997-98 financial year, which is the first year of its operation, and people actually discover that they are paying $1,000 or more that they were not expecting to, we expect that there will be some further take-up. So, until probably six to nine months after the end of this financial year, it is impossible to say how many people will have taken it up.</DOC>

 - This government is committed to reforming the tax system. - I will tell you when. Just hold on. You will see the legislation when you are sitting in the same chair after the next election.This government is committed to reforming the tax system. This government is committed to reforming the tax system because Australia's tax system is unfair - and we want to make it fair. We want to make sure that the Australian taxpayer gets a modern, efficient, good taxation system which can drive this country into the next century. We want to see Labor's unfair taxation system turned around. - Even I am amazed at such sensitivity coming from the Leader of the Opposition. - I rather think it might have something to do with a statement in the Sydney Morning Herald  today, which says:An inquiry into the tax system by the Labor-affiliated Evatt Foundation has swung behind support for a. . . goods and services tax. -  - That is a really big problem for the Australian Labor Party, but it is not all of the Australian Labor Party. There are people in the Australian Labor Party who do support tax reform. There are some people who are progressive and modern thinking; just as the Leader of the Opposition was in 1985 when he was last in favour of taxation reform; just as the Deputy Leader of the Opposition was - and who is nodding now - in 1985; and just as Senator George Campbell is, for example. He said that Australia ought to have  a decent debate on improving our taxation system.Mr Speaker, the coalition government wants to improve Australia's taxation system. Why does the Labor Party support a 22 per cent tax on toothbrushes and no tax on caviar? Why do you support that? Why does the Labor party refuse to try to address the anomalies in the sales tax system? Why does the Labor Party, for example, support indirect taxes on Australia's exports? Why does the Labor Party support that? Why does the Labor Party refuse to join with the government in relation to reforming that?I will tell you why, Mr Speaker. The Labor Party supports an unfair taxation system because the Labor Party presided over and created it over the last 13 years. You do not want reform it because it is your system.I welcome the fact that the Evatt Foundation - no great friend of this government - has come out and said this. And I do not want it to be heavied either; no midnight phone calls like Father Frank Brennan is getting! The Evatt Foundation knows that it is important that we reform and improve Australia's taxation system. I do welcome the fact that the Evatt Foundation is prepared to open its mind, embrace change and try to improve Australia's taxation system.The one really significant figure in Australia now standing against tax reform is the Leader of the Opposition. What a career! As an employment minister, he gets 11 per cent unemployment so they make him a finance minister; as a finance minister, he gets $23 billion worth of deficit so they make him a leader of the opposition; and as Leader of the Opposition he stands with only the lonely in opposing tax reform in this country, which is important for all Australians to give them fairness.</DOC>

 - In respect of the tenancy issues, the fact is that after years of doing nothing on the Labor Party side, we finally gave some leadership on this issue. I am pleased to be able to say to the House that, as a result of the excellent meeting we had with the state ministers before Christmas, we have already seen some progress at the state level with the announcement -  - By an announcement by the Victorians, amongst others, and we will obviously continue to encourage the states to move towards the adoption of those reasonable standards which we adopted established before Christmas. -  - I can also say that, in respect of the other matters in the New deal: fair deal  report, we are on target. After I made the announcement on behalf of the government of our policy commitment, I had a phone call from someone who said, `We are glad to hear that you have introduced the policy. When are you going to introduce the legislation?' I was able to say, `Today we not only introduced the policy, but this afternoon I will be back into the House with the legislation.' This will provide a benefit which has been called for by the small business community for 20 years, but of course it took the introduction and election of a coalition government to finally deliver it.What is disturbing is the attitude of the Labor Party on these issues. Their record is that in 13 years in office they had 17 reviews, but did nothing, and when they were finally in opposition - where they deserve to be - one of their first announcements of what their policy would be was to have another review. When we introduced the details of the changes to the Trade Practices Act, the shadow minister for small business said publicly that  he has been having discussions with big business and, on the basis of the representations made by big business, the Labor Party in the Senate will attempt to amend the Trade Practices Act to limit the benefits which our legislation proposed to give to small business. - No amount of clarification can save the Labor Party from the embarrassment of their attitude to small business policy. In fact, I highlight the deficiencies of their policy: when they got to their Hobart conference last year, they amended the draft policy, taking out the recognition that there are differences between big business and small business.Why did you do that? The smile is nearly there on his face in recognition. The reason you did that is you were concerned that your own policy would undermine your opposition to a benefit for the small business community - namely, the exemption from unfair dismissals. I thank the member for Lowe for his interest in small business. The only party standing in the way of a decent go for small business is the Labor Party.When these matters get up in the Senate, we are going to be sticking to the propositions that we have put. The small business community have waited 20 years for this. Your attempts to delay, your attempts to water down, and your attempts to deny the small business community the benefits of our package will be resisted by us. If we have to  put something a second time to the Senate, we will do so.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. I am delighted to be able to say to the House that the introduction of the new competitor on the Australian waterfront as we started 1998 - the operation by those associated with the NFF; the new business known as P&amp;C Stevedoring - has got off to a very good start. I am delighted to be able to say to P&amp;C Stevedoring that those on this side of the House support their initiatives to start up a new business. We say that, as far as the rorts and rip-offs on the waterfront are concerned, enough is enough. It is time we had some real competition so that Australia can benefit in our export businesses, as can all of those businesses that rely on an efficient waterfront. The waterfront is the gateway to the economy. We must have an efficient gateway. We must have a system on the waterfront which gives our exporters and others the opportunity to compete in world markets.When I say that they have made a good start, what have they done? They have set up a management structure, have secured the site to set up a viable operation and have the equipment necessary to conduct their business. The opposition leader referred to the question of the lease - he is a bit behind the times because that matter was settled a week or so ago. They have trainees on site and, despite the intimidation of some initial trainers, they now have trainers looking to the accreditation of 30 or 40 trainees.Why it is important is that Australia's crane rates and productivity levels are woeful. The reliability on the Australian waterfront is a national disgrace. It was the international  shippers who last year voted Australia as the least reliable port to send a ship to. Also, if we had better workplace relations on the Australian waterfront, we would also have a safer environment for the shippers themselves. That is a worthy objective in itself.All this has happened for a number of reasons - principally because the government has made significant reforms to the Workplace Relations Act, to the industrial relations system in Australia, to allow anybody to set up a new business if they so desire. As we look at this new business, we see the various facets of our new legislation operating. You would not have been able to set up this business but for the fact that you can enter into an Australian workplace agreement and have a much more flexible and efficient set of operations. We made AWAs available.In the early days of this dispute, we saw the MUA taking industrial action. They were told to go back to work by the commission under section 127, which is a new power we gave to the commission that requires people to meet their obligations. Of course, there are the Cheryl clauses - the Trade Practices Act reforms which place a ban on secondary boycotts and primary boycotts and which are the reason that today Australia is not in a state of national economic paralysis.Imagine if Labor got in in the future, or go back a few years when they were in and we had such a development: the whole place would be brought to a standstill. The reality is that those are very effective sanctions. Labor's policy, if they were ever to be re-elected, would be to take the MUA off the leash, to take the Trade Practices Act prohibitions out of that particular law and to gut them and make them ineffective.There has been very widespread community support for what the farmers are undertaking - not just within the farming community, where the polls show over 90 per cent support amongst the farming community, but in the community at large. A Sydney Morning Herald survey reported on 4 February that 60 per cent of all Australians support the establishment of a non-union alternative on the waterfront, and it showed also that 41 per cent of Labor voters support this move. There  will be lots of opportunities to talk about the golden silence from the other side. I see that the shadow minister is about to jump, so I will move onto that presentation of mine as the opportunity is provided.I say in conclusion that this is one of the things that has to be done in Australia. We must have a more efficient waterfront. The new act, the new legislative prescriptions and the support that this government will give people prepared to set up a new business and to be competitive are the critical elements that will make this a successful venture. On behalf of all members on this side of the House, I say to those who have started a new business and who are working on it: good on you and we support you.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Canberra for that question. I think it is an important one. I might remind him that the preference provisions in the insolvency law under which these workers are operating at present are yours. - We must get that straight. You had 13 years to amend the law to give them a better deal and you did not. Now you have the hide to come along and say, `Why doesn't the coalition do this and why doesn't the coalition do that?' I will tell you something that the coalition is doing. The coalition, through the ASC, is ensuring that legal action is being taken so that, if there is any evidence that there has been a breach of directors' duties, those directors will be brought to account.The proposition that in some way there should be an even higher gradation of preference given would, as I think you know and many on the frontbench know, interfere very  significantly with the whole basis on which loans are made available and on which security is being given. The alternative that has been suggested - that some kind of trustee guarantee system be introduced similar to what operates in other countries - is one that we are looking at but it does start with the enormous disability that it would involve contributions from companies that treat their employees decently and properly and it would probably impose burdens on many honest, soundly based companies that it would be unreasonable to do.I think it is an extraordinarily unfortunate situation. We are examining ways in which bona fide help can be given without creating difficult precedents. Let it be remembered that the disability under the law that they are complaining about is a disability under your law and nobody else's.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. There is no doubt that the Natural Heritage Trust constitutes perhaps the most far-reaching response ever put together in this country and maybe even globally to the twin problems of land degradation and water degradation. If there is one thing the ALP hates more than good policy, it is good policy that becomes popular policy because it works. They cannot stand it. It is even worse if it happens to apply to those people who live between Katoomba and Kalgoorlie because they are not interested in them.Let us get to a few facts on this. The first I would like to cover is that the funding has been directed mainly to community groups undertaking on-ground works. Secondly, the  NHT is designed to address the causes of environmental decline, not the symptoms. Thirdly, it is a rigorous community based assessment process - demonstrably so - where regional and state assessment processes prioritise applications.The next point that needs to be understood by those opposite, because no-one on this side has any trouble understanding it, is that the land, water and vegetation challenges facing Australia are overwhelmingly in regional and rural areas. I will give a few statistics. A total of 95 per cent of the funds from the 1997-98 funding round were committed to 99 per cent of Australia's land service. In fact, the ALP only holds 1.17 per cent of the land mass of Australia. The way they are going, they will be lucky to maintain even that. Given their position on this and given their position on tax reform, when everyone in the bush wants tax reform, and given their position on Wik, I cannot see them increasing the percentage of the land mass they hold in this country. You may as well get used to it.There are other factors. The documentation on the trust has always clearly indicated that the bulk of funds would be spent in the areas of greatest need, such as the $163 million committed to the Murray Darling Basin. How much of the Murray Darling Basin in area does the ALP hold? Two per cent. In the case of Western Australia, funds were directed overwhelmingly to the salinity action plant. Anybody who comes from Western Australia would know that that is the issue that needs to be confronted over there. It happens to be focused mainly in Western Australia's wheat belt, where the ALP has no representation at all. - That is right. It is worth noting too that funds expended - stop and think about this for a moment - in important areas such as landcare, bushcare, world heritage, Cape York and rivercare in the end have almost no hope of falling in ALP electorates because there are so few of them. That does not really matter anyway because the money is spent where it needs to be spent and that does not necessarily mean that that is  where the benefits will accrue. This is a very important point.The opposition's flippancy with regard to this highlights the fact that their interests are political, not environmental. For instance, to get cleaner water in Adelaide requires extensive work to be done in the Murray Darling catchment in Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria. You do not spend the money in urban seats in Adelaide to get the benefits for the residents of Adelaide with regard to cleaner, more secure water supplies; you spend it in the Murray Darling Basin. Who are the beneficiaries? As much the people of urban Adelaide as anyone else.There are a couple of other important facts that I want to get on the record. On checking the figures, it has been revealed that 90 per cent of all recommendations of the state assessment panels were from projects in coalition electorates. Let me spell that out for a moment. In the case of New South Wales, of the applications that they put forward for expenditure - and that is not a coalition government, in case you have missed it - 89 per cent of their recommendations were for expenditure in coalition seats. - Yes, that is by Bob Carr's government. Why? Because that is where the money should have been spent; that is where it should have been allocated. If you are concerned about environmental outcomes and not political outcomes, like the member for Denison, that is where you will spend the dollars.I better cut it short. I would like to keep going. The fact is that there is a great deal of public support for the NHT; that is why they do not like it. Whether it is the conservation councils from each state and territory that have recently written to us, whether it is the massive increase in the number of people in the landcare movement - up 25 per cent in the last 12 months - the fact is that the trust is widely supported because it is the largest and most exciting and accountable environmental program in Australia's history.The fact is that we managed to fund this very important program in a responsible way,  despite the Beazley black hole. I think in the final analysis what has to be said is this: people like the member for Denison ought not to ascribe to us the same inappropriate and base approach to both politics and policy that they identify with.</DOC>

 - I think one thing that is very clear out of that question and out of this whole exercise is that the Labor Party hates spending $1 billion on Australia's environment. The central thing to understand about this is that the Labor Party is totally and utterly opposed to the expenditure of so much money on the environment.As to the particular proposal that was made, let me say that I am satisfied - I will of course investigate the particular proposal that has been put forward - and have an enormous amount of confidence in the Minister for the Environment. Is the opposition seriously suggesting that, in something of this character, it is never possible on the merits for somebody or some company that has an identification with one side of politics to be the recipient? That is basically what is being alleged by those who sit opposite that Let me say to those who sit opposite, I am naturally not aware of the particulars of the claim that has been raised by the member for Denison.  I will make some investigations and come back to the House.I take this opportunity of reminding the House again that the establishment of the Natural Heritage Trust was opposed tooth and nail by the Labor Party. This Natural Heritage Trust was designed to address the major environmental problems faced by Australia. As the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy said, those major environmental problems are overwhelmingly in the rural and provincial areas of Australia. It is axiomatic that if you are going to address those major problems you are going to spend most of the money in those areas. I have every confidence in the way in which the whole fund has been administered. - </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Murray for her question. The government, as it is now becoming absolutely plain to everybody, is delivering on its commitment to provide Australians with real jobs. Over the last five months, we have seen 140,000 new jobs coming through - 116,000 of which were full time. That compares with 16,000 new full-time jobs in the last six years of the Labor government. Last Thursday I announced the outcome of a $1.7 billion tender to replace the CES from 1 May with Job Network, a new national network of 306 private community and government organisations competing with each other to get unemployed people into jobs.This is one of the major social justice reforms of the last 50 years. It shows this government's deep commitment to assisting the most disadvantaged in this community. It contrasts dramatically with the spending and taxing policies of the previous government which churned the unemployed through the $10 billion Working Nation program.Job Network is going to give unemployed people the best possible chance at getting a real job. It will offer tens of thousands more vacancies on the Job Network than has been offered through the CES, which had only 20 per cent of vacancies. It will provide four times as many sites as the CES has provided throughout Australia and particularly throughout regional Australia to provide unemployed people with easy access to job vacancy opportunities.In Port Macquarie, for example, the one CES office will be replaced by five Job Network members; in Townsville, two CESs will be replaced by five Job Network members; and in Bendigo, one CES network will be replaced by six Job Network members. Indeed, the member for McEwen I know is particularly delighted that in her community Net Gain, a community non-profit organisation, has received the contract to help unemployed people in that community. All of these Job Network members will be competing with each other to provide unemployed people with the best possible chance to get a real job.How this contrasts with the complete lack of regard for unemployed people from the Labor Party. The member for Batman has conducted a disgraceful disinformation campaign right throughout the launch of this. He was warning for weeks beforehand that a duopoly of Employment National and Drake International was coming, and now we have 306 providers. Some duopoly! I think it is back to numeracy training for the member for Batman.But I think one of the most disgraceful things that the member for Batman has said was in a press release he issued when the Job Network was announced. He said that people will seek to get onto welfare even if they have to cheat to get there. That is a disgraceful statement about unemployed people in this  country. That shows what a low opinion the Labor Party has of unemployed people - that they will cheat in order to gain the benefits provided by the Job Network. You should resign for that. You have criticised the unemployed before. In this House you are just the voice for the unions. You do not care for unemployed people.You should take a leaf out of the book of your former colleague Graham Richardson, who, on 2GB last week said in relation to the Job Network, `I think we should all give it a chance.' Even your mate Richo sees the advantage of the Job Network. It is time for you to face up to the facts and realise that it is this government that is pursuing a strong justice agenda in this country to help the most disadvantaged people whom you abandoned.</DOC>

 - Can I say in answer to the member for Denison that I do not regard it as prima facie improper in any way for a minister to seek the advice of a member of parliament. I think the proposition is that in some way it is wrong to seek the advice of a member of parliament, but that is the generality of my response.The particularity of my response is that my understanding is that before entering parlia  ment the member for Dunkley was in fact an adviser to the Victorian Minister for the Environment and therefore, as well as the generality of the principle, would have some knowledge of environmental matters. Can I simply say to those opposite: if you have any evidence of wrongdoing, please let us have it.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Corangamite for his question and for his long interest in the need to improve the Australian waterfront. Of course, it is vital for the Australian economy but also for many exporters in the member for Corangamite's electorate. I am aware of a statement by the MUA that they were about to release proposals to improve productivity on the Australian waterfront. Those comments were made I think on Thursday or Friday of last week.I had, obviously, a long weekend as I awaited advice that the MUA had revealed their plan to improve productivity on the Australian waterfront. I picked up the paper,  I think on Friday morning, and I combed through page after page and failed to find any such proposals. I got up early Saturday morning and went through the voluminous Saturday pages and looked for the proposals to reform the waterfront. Were there any such proposals from the MUA? No. Disappointed again! Before I did a TV interview on Sunday, I got up early again and went through all  the Sunday papers. Could I find a reference to such an improvement? No, I could not. - Did I surf the net and go to the MUA page? No, I didn't. I watched 60 Minutes  last night as John Coombs invited Paul Lyneham onto his property and surveyed the chardonnay grapes - chardonnay Coombs. Did he then have a proposal to improve productivity on the waterfront? No, he didn't. In fact the last time I had a sit down conversation with Mr Coombs, I said to him, `John, what are we going to do to improve productivity on the Australian waterfront?' His answer was, `Don't be provocative.' I said to him, `John, what do we have to do to reduce the level of industrial disputes on the Australian waterfront?' He said, `Don't be provocative.'It would not be hard to make some significant improvements to productivity on the Australian waterfront. Members will, I hope, appreciate that in the last few weeks on a daily basis we have sent out a bulletin. In that bulletin on the right hand column, if you have missed it, I refer you to the heading which says, `Rort of the day'. This dispute could go on for six months and we would have a fresh one on a daily basis. But, in terms of fixing up the productivity on the Australian waterfront, you do not need a grand plan. What you need is a commitment for people just to do a decent day's work.Let me give you this example. At the start of this dispute at Webb dock the wharfies were worried about their public reputation. They decided that there were four containers that should be moved. They had kiwi fruit in them. They said to Patricks, `Don't worry; we'll remove those to get them out of the way of the dispute.' So they organised the removal of the four containers. How many people would it take the wharfies to move four containers? You would need one bloke to drive the forklift. I would have to say that in most businesses that would be plenty. But, of course, if you have one bloke driving a forklift, you have to have a foreman. There are four containers, so you need three advanced mathematicians who are all members  of the MUA to count them. They needed five people to move four containers.One of the classic stories of this dispute goes back to December. Overmanning is a constant problem. One of the classic stories of this dispute is the meeting between Chris Corrigan, who runs Patricks, and John Coombs before Christmas. Basically Chris Corrigan said to John Coombs and the MUA, `Quite frankly, John, we've spent a year trying to get an agreement out of you. That was 1996. In 1997 we spent a year trying to get you to do the very things that you had agreed to do. We find running this business basically impossible because we don't run it; you, the MUA, run it.' So he said to John Coombs, `I've got a solution for this. I will sell you the business for $1.' As he made that offer, Mr Corrigan passed over the dollar to John Coombs - `Here's the dollar you need to buy it.' Why wouldn't John Coombs accept that offer? Because he knows himself that even he could not run that business with the MUA to give it the productivity and the efficiency that we need.Mr Speaker, take this example. This is an example straight off the wage records of one of the major stevedores. This relates to a crane driver in the port of Melbourne. These are actual records. The crane driver is paid for an average 50.3 hours a week; that is his average working week. He spends 14 hours on relief time and other duties; 10½ hours holiday and sick leave; 8.5 hours on idle time or training; and 3.2 hours on meal breaks. This leaves only 14.1 hours, or 28 per cent of the paid hours, doing what he or she is supposed to be doing - driving the crane. They get paid $90,000 a year for 14 hours a week on a crane. And John Coombs is going to reveal his plan to improve productivity!My plan to improve productivity, just as a starter, is to deal with the rorts and the rip-offs on the Australian waterfront which are being protected by none other than the Labor Party. Why haven't we had a question from the Labor Party on the waterfront? They have been making the allegations about this particular dispute. Where are your questions? I will tell you why we have not heard much from them - not according to my point of  view, but according to the point of view of none other than he who knows them very well: Graham Richardson, Richo. This is what Richo said:The unions still own a majority of the stock in the ALP and the federal parliamentary Labor Party will be expected to stick with them. There are senior people in the party who know how risky this would be. They can see no way out of defending the wharfies to the bitter end. Perhaps this explains Kim Beazley's silence over the past week. This is the beginning of a major war on the waterfront, a war that could lead to a general strike, and we still don't know what the leader of the opposition thinks about it. This is one silence that isn't golden.The Richardson quote sums it up nicely. The fact of the matter is that we need significant reform on the waterfront. When Labor was in office, $420 million was spent trying to fix up the problem. - In many ways the problem is as bad today as it was back then - in fact worse in some respects, because we fall behind those against whom we compete.The member for Melbourne says, `Rubbish.' This is what the member for Melbourne said in March 1997:Labor acknowledges that, after a process of substantial reform in both shipping and the waterfront, further productivity improvement has not been as readily forthcoming as hoped.You are dead right. Someone is going to do something about it. This government is supporting those who want to set up a new business and give this country a decent, efficient, productive and reliable waterfront.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. I know the concern that he has for our Defence Force personnel. In the debate earlier today many people stood and said how important the service was that our personnel were going to render. There was bipartisan support for those personnel. It is also important that we recognise that their families are part of that service and that they do need support while their family member is away on the deployment. Accordingly, one of the first things they need is information. So the Defence Force Support Unit has established a  hotline which will be the sole source of information for families of serving personnel.Secondly, the Defence Community Organisation, which is the organisation established to coordinate all support services for personnel, will have the special task of contacting families about their needs. The Special Air Services Regiment does have a vast internal network of unit welfare officers, liaison officers, a psychiatrist and a chaplain. They will be supported as well by the Defence Community Organisation. But, as with previous deployments, the Defence Force Support Unit will also provide services for the non-SASR personnel who are on deployment. All of those organisations will work jointly so that information is provided to families as they require it and support is given if there is need because their serving personnel family member is away. If there is ever the need for someone to be brought back for compassionate reasons those organisations will look at those concerns and deal with them as necessary.I stress that this government has a great commitment to the families of serving personnel. You have all expressed your support for the fine people who have gone on deployment and I suggest we extend that to their families as well.</DOC>

 - Let me make this point, and I have said this before: in relation to the external situation, if there is a downturn  amongst your trading partners you would expect over a period of time a downturn in relation to exports. That is an obvious point. I have also forecast in the mid-year review that that will have an effect on the current account deficit. I would not see anything to the contrary in today's figures; in fact, they would be quite consistent with what we have been saying.It is a long time since I have seen somebody from the opposition come into a parliament and try to set hares running as you just did by trying to broad brush what is obviously a very difficult financial position in Asia into Australia. What was the point you made? Was it that we have not done enough? Was that it? Where would we have been if we were $10 billion in deficit? Where would we have been if you had succeeded in your attempt to drive the economy into deficit? Where would we have been if debt was still where you left it? Where would we have been if we had maintained the kind of deceit that the Leader of the Opposition maintained by saying that the budget was in surplus when it was $10,000 million in the red? Where would we have been?Why is it that the Labor Party fought us on every single measure right throughout that period and now turns around and says, `Maybe you should have been doing more.' Where would we have been if we had not got inflation down to where it is now? Where would we have been if interest rates were not down at 6.5 per cent? Where would we have been if non-farm growth was not as strong as it is? As I indicated earlier, it is in a very strong position up to September 1997. - A minor bounce back! The economic illiteracy of the Leader of the Opposition is rivalled only by his shadow treasurer. Australia at the moment - let us get this fact into your mind - is growing faster than any nation in the G7, one of the fastest growths in the developed world. You, Mr former employment minister, were responsible for an 11.2 per cent unemployment rate. Here is somebody who stands up at the dispatch box with a legacy of complete failure and  argues that our successes have not been great enough. - What was the point of order? That it was growing faster than the G7 - what did you say? - in the last 10 years? In 1990-91 Australia's growth under Labor was minus 0.8 per cent. Where do you get off? In 1991-92 Australia's growth rate under Labor was 0.7 per cent. - You just stood at the dispatch box and said that we have been growing faster than the G7 for 13 years. Or did my eyes deceive me? Did my ears deceive me? Here we are: we are growing faster than any nation in the G7 -  -  - You said it! You are condemned out of your own mouth! We all heard it. You stood at the dispatch box and said it a moment ago. Why don't you get up and make another point of order in relation to that?As I said earlier, we are one of the fastest growing nations - faster than any G7 nation: non-farm growth 4.6 per cent over the September quarter, and in a situation not where Asia is leading our growth but in a situation where Asia has gone into steep decline in the last year. You were right about one thing: never once in those 13 years did you have to bank on a declining growth rate in Asia - never once did you have to bank on a declining growth rate in Asia - and yet you still  managed negative growth back in the early nineties.Where would we have been under those policies if we had not dealt with the budget deficit that was left to us? What absolute gall to then stand up and say, after a record of failure, `We have an economic policy' - the first economic policy that they have announced in opposition after all of these years. Let us have a guess what it was: to produce surpluses over the next three years.I just want to add to one answer that I gave before. I may well have said that toothbrushes were subject to a 22 per cent sales tax. I now believe that toothbrushes may well be exempt. It is toothpaste that is subject to a 22 per cent sales tax. And, if you cannot find the logic in that, you had better ask the Labor Party because that is their system too.</DOC>

 - During question time my colleague the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business drew attention to the anti-small business policies of the Labor Party in relation to our new fair deal package, which was announced last September. I think everybody would agree that that was an absolute watershed so far as small business reform was concerned.Outlined in that package, the government supported the extension of the banking industry ombudsman scheme to small business and the development of a banking industry small business charter. I am very, very pleased to announce to the House today that the Australian Bankers Association and the Australian Banking Industry Ombudsman Board have today agreed and announced that both of these policy initiatives announced last September will be implemented.Firstly, the Australian banking industry ombudsman scheme will be extended to cover small business. Until now, only consumers and some unincorporated bodies have had  access to the scheme; incorporated small businesses have been denied access. I would think that all members on this side of the House, who work very hard for small businesses in their electorates, would be aware of a constant complaint of small business - that is, they do not have access to the Banking Industry Ombudsman. If an individual consumer has a complaint with small business they can go to the ombudsman, but, in relation to the small business, if they have a complaint, an iron door has come across and someone has said, `No, you cannot have access to the small business ombudsman.'This is yet another trailblazing initiative of our government to do something practical in order to assist the small businesses of Australia. Let's face it: this would not have happened if it had not been for the agitation of this government. It was something that has been strenuously resisted over a period of time. In addition, the Australian Bankers Association and its members will develop and adopt a small business charter. Until now, this has only been a consumer guide. I have to say again that the Labor Party had 13 years to do these things but, of course, they were going to do it in the 14th year. Like they were going to do something else in the 14th year. - You were going to get the budget in surplus. They were going to balance it in the 14th year and they were going to have a surplus in the 15th year - that is what they were going to do. This is yet another illustration of the absolute determination of my government to deliver a fair deal to the small business community of Australia. Can I say to the member for Cunningham and to all of those who sit opposite who claim to have an interest in small business: if you are sensible, you will let the reforms to small business that we have proposed go through the Senate without opposition, including our reforms in relation to unfair dismissal. Let me take the opportunity while I am on my feet of reminding -  - He says, `Oh, no, no, no!' Let me remind the member for Cunningham and those who sit opposite that reforming the  unfair dismissal laws is another article of faith for the small businesses of Australia. We will be putting that legislation back. We will be putting the Labor Party to the test in the Senate because we know that if those further changes are passed that will lead to the generation of thousands of additional jobs in the Australian small business community.While I am on my feet, may I add to an answer that I gave to the member for Denison, who asked me a question to do with the Natural Heritage Trust. - As a result of the question asked by the honourable member for Denison, I sought some information. My office has been informed by Senator Hill that the grant in question was one of three which was reassessed because it had incorrectly been ruled ineligible in the first round. - Can I finish giving the explanation and perhaps you will not be so boisterous. It was reinstated because the regional assessment panel had incorrectly ruled it ineligible on the basis that the application had come from an individual entity and not a community group. However, under the natural heritage trust, individual entities are allowed to apply if it has a wider community benefit.I also inform the House that the project had the very strong support of the on the ground conservationists, who believed it to be one of the most important vegetation projects in the state. Could I also inform the House - and this will interest those in the Labor Party who are interested in distributional justice - that the grant was in the ALP electorate of Lalor. I wonder whether Barry supported it. He did! Ha! Ha! Gee, and wasn't he a terrific Deputy Chairman of the Constitutional Convention? - Could I also, for the sake of completeness, inform the House that the advice of the member for Dunkley, so I am informed by Senator Hill, was being sought  on how states might attempt to cost-shift. This was based on his experience as a former chief of staff not to the Minister for Environment but the Minister for Natural Resources. -  - It has got a bit more to go yet. I am prepared to wait. I will wait for the rest of the afternoon; it is for me to decide when further questions are placed on the Notice Paper  and I believe in getting the maximum value out of question time. I think we ought to be accountable to the parliament for these things. I really think we do. So the advice of my honourable colleague the member for Dunkley, the former chief of staff to the Victorian Minister for Natural Resources, was sought as to how state governments might cost-shift. They have been occasionally known to cost-shift, you know. - I notice that the former Premier of New South Wales said that there is no truth in that matter, but I think that in reality they have. That is why he sought his advice. Can I say that I think that was an extremely sensible thing for the minister to have done, and all I can say to those who sit opposite is that you have demonstrated again that from the very beginning you hated the natural heritage trust and you are during your level best to bring it down. Can I say that the more you carry on with this nonsense -  - I simply say again that the Labor Party has been against the Natural Heritage Trust. I really want to thank you for what you have done over the last few weeks. You have given millions of dollars of additional publicity to the Natural Heritage Trust. You have drawn the attention of the Australian people to the fact that we are investing a billion dollars in the regeneration of the environment of Australia. We are doing for the rural and regional areas of Australia  through this natural heritage trust things that the people who live in those areas never dreamt of. You are demonstrating yet again how absolutely hostile you are to the interests of Australians who live in the bush. The more you carry on with this campaign, the more we welcome it and the more you are drawing attention to it.I think, Mr Speaker, that it might be reasonable, at five minutes past five, that I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. But we will be back tomorrow at 3 o'clock. A few of us are going somewhere else until then.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Wannon for his question because today balance of payments were released for the December quarter showing a balance on the current account of $5.7 billion. That outcome was slightly better than was expected by the Australian markets, although it does show, as was expected by the government, that the current account deficit over the course of this year will increase. The last two quarters combined show a current account deficit of about $10.4 billion. The government has been forecasting for a full year about $23 billion, and today's outcome is consistent with those forecasts, which would again indicate that over the course of the remainder of the financial year the current account is likely to widen in line with that forecast.The current account deficit in particular has been led by strong imports, which is consistent with strong demand in the Australian economy, a matter also revealed by today's retail trade figures, which showed a very strong increase in January 1998 of 2.1 per cent.Over the course of the last decade we have seen on three occasions a blow-out of the current account deficit under Labor's administration: 1986, a current account deficit blow-out of 6.6 per cent to GDP; the Keating Labor Party second current account blow-out in 1990 at 6.8 per cent; and the Keating Labor third blow-out in the current account deficit of 6.8 per cent in 1995.Unlike those last three occasions when there was a blow-out in the current account deficit, Australia stands poised in much better shape. In 1986 inflation was at 9.3 per cent, in 1990 inflation was at 8.6 per cent and in 1995 inflation was at 3.9 per cent. Although consistent with the cycle, the current account deficit  is expected to grow this year. Inflation, of course, is substantially better than it was on any of those occasions with an underlying inflation rate of 1.4 per cent.An incident having occurred in the gallery -  - This is also consistent with government policy not only to lower inflation but to lower interest rates. Interest rates have been lowered to a level which is the lowest in the last 30 years. Low interest rates are consistent with the government increasing economic opportunities throughout the course of the year for small business, business generally and particularly for home buyers. For the average home buyer on a mortgage of $100,000 a year, this represents a saving of nearly $3,000 a year - as the Prime Minister said yesterday, the equivalent of a $100 per week pay increase for those that are getting the benefits of low mortgages. One hundred dollars per week for the average Australian on the average home would be the salary increase required to get to the situation that they now have because of the government's low interest rate policy.Today's figures on the current account are consistent, as I said earlier, with strengthening demand in the domestic economy. It reinforces, from the government's point of view, the importance of its savings objectives: that this government has to produce savings as a government by producing surpluses in order to attend to Australia's savings needs. Again, today's current account deficit reflects the importance of continuing on with sound structural change in the Australian economy, the kind of change that is required in relation to Australia's taxation system.If we want to give our exporters a go on international markets and if we want to help Australian exporters, which of course will go towards making a contribution to solving our current account problems, we should be moving to a taxation system which does not penalise exporters, which does not make them carry the burden of taxes on international markets, which gives them the opportunity that exporters from all over the world who have proper and modern taxation systems have to have their taxes taken out and which  gives them a go on an even-handed basis on international markets. That is why this government stands for tax reform: to give those exporters that opportunity, to give this country that opportunity.</DOC>

 - It takes a special kind of gall from the $23 billion deficit man over there; the man who misled the Australian people month after month and week after week during the election campaign; the failed finance minister who is now the Leader of the Opposition who went around during the election campaign swearing blind that we had a surplus when he knew all the while that we had a deficit of $10.3 billion - as the Treasurer pointed out yesterday, in just two years he racked up $23 billion worth of deficit -  - Mr Deputy Speaker, I repeat: it takes a special kind of gall for the man who gave us the highest level of unemployment since the Great Depression, the man who gave us, over two years, $23 billion worth of budget deficit, to now have the nerve to tell the Australian business community that he is going to produce three surpluses if he wins the election.	 He really is a magician. He is going to produce three surpluses. He is going to spend literally thousands of millions of extra dollars. He is going to give us all income tax cuts. He is going to provide this and that in Mandrake-like fashion in every area of government spending and every area of taxation. I have trawled through the history of the leadership of the Australian Labor Party. I thought they had had some economically irresponsible leaders in the past, but the way this one has been behaving in recent weeks takes the cake; he absolutely tops the bill. - I am delighted that the honourable member for Hotham makes reference to the motor vehicle industry. I just remind the member for Hotham and the House that, under our government, motor vehicle sales in Australia are at an all-time record high. As a result of the industry policies -  - How many hundreds of thousands of vehicles were they able to sell under your government? They have gone up and up ever since we were elected to office. That is what has happened to motor car sales in this country. They have gone up. They have not stayed flat; they have not gone down. They have gone up. I know you are  tremendously unhappy about the $1.8 billion that General Motors is investing. I know you are unhappy about the money that Toyota is investing. The fact is that, under our government, we have given them confidence with our industry policy. They are not only producing more cars; they are selling more cars. They are attracting more investment, far more investment than was ever attracted under your administration.</DOC>

 - The differences are not only significant but also require a certain amount of time to recite so that those opposite and those who are listening in have a very clear understanding of how very different the administration of the Australian economy has been under my government. First and foremost, of course, we inherited a deficit of $10.5 billion from the failed finance minister, the Leader of the Opposition. In two years we have pared that back so that there is every prospect when the budget is brought down in May of this year that this country will be once again in the black and the Treasurer and the government will have been able to achieve something that utterly eluded the Leader of the Opposition when he was finance minister in the former government. So we are, first and foremost, on track to achieve a significant underlying surplus in 1998-99.I remind the House that, under the former government, Commonwealth general government net debt increased nearly fivefold to around 19 per cent of gross domestic product  in 1995-96. Under the coalition, it is expected that that figure will be cut in half to about 10 per cent in the year 2000-2001. In the last five months of the Labor government, only 48,000 new jobs were created. In contrast, more than 140,000 new jobs have been created in the past five months of the coalition government. Not only have 140,000 new jobs been created but last week my colleague the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs also unveiled a new system for placing unemployed people that will in many cases treble and in some cases quadruple the number of job placement agencies that are available to help the unemployed. The new jobs network system signals a new era of hope and new prospects and a new dawn so far as the unemployed of Australia are concerned. Instead of there being just one agency available to help the unemployed, there will now be something like three or four available.When the Labor Party left office, the headline inflation rate was 3.7 per cent. At the December quarter 1997, Australia's headline inflation rate was negative. We had a headline inflation rate at the end of last year that was the best in the OECD. - It was not the second best, the third best or the 10th best; it was the best in the OECD. That is a demonstration of the fiscal rectitude that my government has brought to the management of the Australian economy.Under Labor, variable bank home loan interest rates peaked at 17 per cent in 1989. In March 1996, when we took over, they were 10½ per cent. They have now fallen to 6.7 per cent. That is the lowest level since the early 1970s. What it means is that, for a family paying a $100,000 mortgage back, that is a saving of $256 a month. That is a saving equivalent to a $100 a week increase in the average wage. So the difference between us and Labor is that the average wage earner has received an interest rate cut which is the equivalent of a wage increase of $100 a week. All of that has occurred in the space of two years. Under Labor's industrial relations system there were only 237 enterprise flexibility agreements approved by the AIRC. Under Labor, we spent $450 million to reform the waterfront, and all that happened was that we went further backwards in the world competitiveness of our waterfront. But under this government, as a result of the reforms that have been introduced by the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business, we now have the courageous act of the National Farmers Federation of Australia, which is providing leadership to the Australian business community.Let me take the opportunity of congratulating the National Farmers Federation of Australia for not only powerfully representing the interests of their own constituency but also giving a very fine example to the rest of the Australian business community. For years the business community of Australia has begged for somebody to have the courage to reform the waterfront. Now they have a government that had the courage, with the assistance of Labor's newest recruit, Cheryl Kernot - I repeat that; and thank you, Cheryl; thank you for obliging; with Labor's newest recruit - to change the law to break the monopoly of the Maritime Union on the supply and the recruitment of labour. They also now have in the National Farmers Federation a group of men and women who are prepared courageously in the national interest to take advantage of that legislation to provide competition on the wharves, to give new hope to people who have lost millions over the years because of the lack of competitiveness and the lack of productivity under the system which the Labor Party encouraged and maintained on foot.The comparisons are very stark, indeed. Let me tell the opposition and let me tell the Australian public that over the months ahead the Australian people will be hearing a lot more about the comparative economic record of my government over the last two years and the deplorable economic record of which the failed finance minister opposite was the principal architect under the Keating government. </DOC>

 - I wasn't quite sure whether you had finished or not. I think your point was that the situation now was nearly as bad as it was in 1995. Is that your point? I think that was your point - that foreign debt is now the worse since 1995. Was that your point? Yes, that was your point. I assume it was worse in 1995 when you were in government. Was that your point? - What is the point of your question? The point of your question is that we are only a little bit better than you; we are not miles in front of you. Is that the point of the question? - I will take the subsequent question, too, which is about the Asian economic crisis. I have said consistently that the Asian economic crisis is something that will not be in Australia's interests. - I am pleased to be of such amusement to the cockies on the frontbench of the Australian Labor Party. We, as a government, have been part of IMF programs for Thailand, Indonesia and Korea. There are only two countries in the world that have done that, and they are Japan and Australia. No other country in the world has been as active as we have been in meeting the financial crisis in Asia; no other country in the world, bar Japan and Australia.We took a lot of criticism about that from various sources, not necessarily the opposition, in the Australian community who said  why was it that Australia was taking such an active role in relation to stabilising the Asian financial system. The point I made at the time was this: it was in Australia's interests to have a strong Asia and we will be doing what is necessary in Australia's interests to try to secure Australia's interests in the region. - That is now the third question that he has asked, and I will go to the third question as well. Point No. 1: no other government in the world bar Japan's has been as active as this government has been in relation to the Asian crisis. Number No. 2: he then asks what did we do before the Asian crisis. I will tell you what we did, old tiger: we took $10,000 million and determined to turn it into a surplus. And where would we have been if the Australian Labor Party had been building up $10,000 million deficits in relation to the Asian crisis? We had a failed finance minister - Australia's worst finance minister ever: the Leader of the Opposition - who in two years presided over $27,000 million of losses.I often say: imagine a crowd of 23,000 at the Sydney Cricket Ground and imagine that every one of them stood for $1 million. That is his record: $23,000 million. While he was the finance minister, he racked up -  - You say what did we do before the Asian financial crisis. We took a $10,000 million deficit and we determined to turn it around. And what did the Labor Party do? The Labor Party tried to stop this process at every turn. It was not enough that they created the crisis; they then tried to stop us solving it. The best thing about it is that they were incompetent in doing that, just as they were incompetent in their management in the first place.We as a government sat down and we took the hard decisions - fought all the way by the Australian Labor Party. We decided to put some fireproofing into the Australian economy when Labor said it did not need it. We decided to attend to Australia's budget position when Labor said it was not warranted. We decided to deal with inflation when the Australian Labor Party said they would sue us. You were going to sue us over our agreement with the Reserve Bank for low inflation.Now the Leader of the Opposition wanders up to Sydney and says, `Hey, guess what the Labor Party policy is now?' The Labor Party policy, after running a decade of deficits - and you ran $23 billion worth - is to produce three years of surplus. Guess what the Labor Party policy now is on inflation? To endorse an inflation target with the Reserve Bank of Australia. - The question was: what has the government done to address the crisis in Asia? Not only do we have inflation down, not only have we brought the budget back, not only had we overcome the Australian Labor Party but I tell you what else we are going to do: we are going to get a better system of industrial relations in this country. You are against that. You are against any reform in relation to industrial relations. We  are going to get a better taxation system in this country. You are against that.You can get up here and talk about current account deficits, but what is your policy? To have indirect taxes on exports sailing out of this country. That is your policy. That is the tax system that you are defending. You are opposed to Australian exporters being given opportunities on world markets. And why? I will tell you why. This is an opposition that has no policy, no principle, no credibility, no economic literacy, no future and no hope.</DOC>

 - Mr Deputy Speaker, I would ask that you convey my commendation to the outgoing Speaker. I wish him well.In respect of the question by the member for Stirling, I want to say Australia is the second driest continent in the world. That is paralleled by the environmental problems which exist the length and breadth of this land. The coalition government is committed to doing something about it in a very pragmatic and very practical way to help turn the tide.In that regard, I want to bring to the attention of the House a particular example. The asset test - the nub of the arguments which are being pushed by Labor comes from hanging onto the coat-tails of a distinguished publication of this country rather than doing their own homework, but they have come on the trail - is to examine what happened in Tasmania. I refer to Tasmania because Tasmania is the one state where Labor has, in terms of area, the majority of representation. In the rest of Australia, the coalition, the Liberal and National parties, is well in front. The asset test with regard to all of this saga is whether the seat of Lyons, the majority of land mass of Tasmania, received more than  the average or less than the coalition-held electorates in Tasmania, such as the seat of Bass.That question deserves a thorough answer at this point  in this debate. It is a very interesting answer because of the outcome in respect of Tasmania - that one part of the country where one member of the opposition does have some area coverage. What was the outcome? The outcome was that the seat of Lyons received 42 of the 64 electorate specific projects, as opposed to state wide projects. In fact, under the Natural Heritage Trust funding the seat of Lyons received $1.2 million, or around 60 per cent of the allocation for the state of Tasmania. So our bona fides stack up.There is no whiteboard. There is a proper process, and it is vindicated by this example from Tasmania. Your problem is the rest of Australia. The problem is simple enough: the National Party members - the country Liberal members - represent over 90 per cent of the land mass of Australia. My own electorate of Farrer is larger than the entire area represented by the parliamentary Labor Party in this House. That is something you ought to think about. It would help if you did your homework for yourself in relation to these matters. I am even happy to table the breakdown in respect of Tasmania as a gesture of goodwill on this matter.It was at the shadow cabinet meeting in Blackstone, ably chaired by the Prime Minister, that the foundations were laid for the very correct decision to privatise Telstra and provide for Natural Heritage Trust funding. It was a very significant meeting. It has enriched many thousands of Australians and it has gone on to allow us to tackle the environmental problems which exist over the length and breadth of this land. The Prime Minister has carried that policy right through. It is a successful policy, and that is why you do not like it.We will continue with the Natural Heritage Trust funding. It is doing the job. It is starting to do the job a whole lot more in turning the tide. It will include a land and water resources audit of over $30 million. I challenge the  member for Lyons to stand up and say whether he has made representations in relation to those projects, 42 of which were approved by Senator Robert Hill and Minister John Anderson. I table the document.</DOC>

 - If I remember rightly, the deliberate claim that was made during the 1996 election campaign that was plainly wrong to the person who uttered that claim was when you ran around Australia saying that the budget was in surplus. You actually had the material in front of you. - Unlike the Leader of the Opposition, I did  not make statements which I knew when I made them were absolutely false. The Leader of the Opposition absolutely knew about the deficit. He knew the statements were completely false. - I know the sensitivity of the Leader of the Opposition on this issue. You know that you said to the Australian people as finance minister that your budget was in surplus and you knew then that it was in deficit. Your Prime Minister knew that it was in deficit and you knowingly lied to the Australian people on that subject. - If the Leader of the Opposition is sensitive, I withdraw that and I substitute `deliberately misled the Australian people.' - Deliberately decieve - try that!</DOC>

 - It seems that the need for reform is obvious to everybody except those on the other side. There have been some very interesting statements about the need for reform, which I think are summed up in the excellent editorial in today's Daily Telegraph . It says:The central and immovable issue in the battle over who runs Australia's waterfront is the massive cost of inefficiency.It isn't the right of union coverage, or the right to start up a new stevedoring company. It is the burden of waste and poor productivity which is shoved on to all Australians.This inefficiency, often appearing as featherbedding, clearly doesn't make life easy for stevedoring companies.It also has become a back-breaking load on all our export industries, and a drain on the household budgets of consumers at home who end up paying for the lurks and fiddles.How true that is. The silence of the Labor Party on this issue just shows how they are bound hand and foot to the MUA. In the face of the most outrageous rorts and the incredible cost to the Australian economy with jobs and living standards, they sit there mute, completely incapable of saying anything in the national interest, because they have to bow down to John Coombs. What a contrast it makes going back to the pilots dispute. Reading extracts from the pilots dispute would keep any interested politician up all  night. This one caught my eye. This is from the Australian  on 16 September 1989, and these are the words:The Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, made an impassioned plea to Australia's domestic airline pilots yesterday to abandon their union - would you believe it - and to return to work for the good of themselves and the nation.What a contrast this makes! The article continues:In a personal letter, Mr Hawke warned pilots the government would not back down and said if they wanted to be re-employed they must sign individual contracts with the airlines.What an unbelievable contrast! Let us go to Mr Beazley on the radio this year. He has hardly stuck his head up on this issue, and no wonder. What an embarrassment he is. He is asked:Mr Beazley, the NFF has not broken any laws. What is wrong with a bit of non-union competition on the docks?He replies:Let me just say, dock reform is important and dock reform progress has been made.How pathetic! You weak leader; you weak person. Then you are asked:But you have to be a union member to work there. Could you confront that one?Talk about Mr Mealy-mouth, Mr Flim-flam; and his answer to a simple question is:And the MUA is concerned to ensure that they have a capacity to bargain for their membership on the docks.You are pathetic; you are truly pathetic. As an example of the long list of rorts and inefficiencies on the waterfront, it is hard to go past this following example. I raise this example because one of the claims of the Waterside Workers Union is that part of the problem is the management. I do not say that the management are beyond blame. But it is true - as this example shows - that the problem on the Australian waterfront is that the management are not allowed to manage their businesses. The so-called statement by the MUA and the ACTU the other day called for an improvement in productivity, but here is my rort for the day for the House. Last week  the MUA pulled a four-hour stop-work meeting at Container Terminals Australia Ltd. The stoppage related to the MUA allocating labour. In other words, the management does not decide where you work; the MUA decides where you work. In this particular case, an union officer allocated the company's two best crane drivers to doing lashing work and the company disagreed. So they took out the whole place for four hours because the company wanted the people best able to drive the cranes to actually do that job. It is like a football match. Let us say you might barrack for -  - Matthew Lloyd is a full-forward. If you have a great full-forward, most weeks you put them in the full-forward position so that they can kick a few goals. What do the MUA do? They take the full-forwards and put them on the half-back flank, they put them in the centre and they put them at full-back. Why do they do that? Because they allocate the work - and this is the rort - to make sure that everybody gets a slice of the overtime. It is the overtime culture which means that the place is not run properly, and we have higher costs, higher inefficiency and fewer jobs. Commonsense dictates that the Labor Party in the national interest ought to at least be able to stand up and say they oppose rorts. It shows how you are bound hand and foot to the unions, but you cannot even say that.</DOC>

 - I assure the Leader of the Opposition of a number of the things. The  first of those is that in relation to the health policy, or indeed any of other policies that I put before the Australian public at the last election, unlike you, I did not deliberately mislead the Australian people. I repeat that; I did not deliberately mislead the Australian people. You did. And also unlike you, the coalition is the only side of politics in Australia that is making any serious attempt to defend and improve the Australian health system.	 In the two years that you have been in opposition you have deliberately embarked upon a policy to undermine public confidence in the Australian health care system. You have deliberately set about destroying and eroding public confidence, having watched the level of private health insurance -  - When the Labor Party introduced the Medicare system in the early 1980s, the level of private health insurance in this country was 61 per cent. Through a policy of deliberate and malign neglect, that level of private health insurance fell from 61 per cent down to the fifties, into the forties, and by 1990 it had reached a figure of about 39 per cent. It was at that particular time that the former Labor health minister sounded an alarm bell and said, `Unless we as a Labor government are prepared to provide incentives for private health insurance, it is going to decline further.' The now Leader of the Opposition, the then Prime Minister and the member for Fremantle all got together and decided, `It is a good thing to drive the level of private health insurance down further because we have an ideological opposition to it.' - They say it is rubbish. If it is rubbish, how is it that when you came to power in 1983 it was 61 per cent and when  you lost office in 1996 it was down to about 34 per cent? You deliberately drove it into the ground. You have an absolute gall to attack a government that has at least made an attempt to stabilise the levels. As the health minister said last night, if we had not introduced the rebates that we introduced after the last election, the level of private health insurance would have been a lot lower, and I suppose you lot would have been a lot happier.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Boothby for his question and recognise his particular interest in many of these important issues. The United Nations Security Council unanimously passed a resolution today Australia time - and 3 March New York time - concerning the situation in Iraq. The resolution first and foremost endorses the agreement concluded on 23 February by the Secretary-General of the United Nations and Iraq and, as the government has done, commends the United Nations Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, for his initiative to secure a commitment from Iraq to comply with its obligations.The resolution makes clear the Security Council's determination to ensure Iraq's immediate and full compliance with relevant Security Council resolutions without conditions or restrictions. The resolution importantly sets out that any violation by Iraq of its obligations will have severest consequences.The council is acting under chapter 7 of the United Nations charter, which envisages the use of force if necessary. The government previously stated its view that there is sufficient basis already under existing resolutions for military action to be taken in support of the United Nations Security Council resolutions. The resolution adopted today reinforces this view. The resolution also states that  Iraq's failure so far to comply with its obligations and to allow UNSCOM unrestricted access has delayed the council being in a position to consider a modification to sanctions. That is a very important matter from a humanitarian point of view. Saddam Hussein is to blame for these delays. His obstruction of UNSCOM's work is but one example of his complete disregard for his own people.The unanimous message from the council is that Iraq must comply with the agreement and with the United Nations Security Council resolutions and any failure to do so will result in severest consequences. It remains the government's strong hope that Saddam Hussein will fully live up to the fundamental commitments he has made in the agreement and that resort to force will be averted. It is important to put Saddam Hussein's preparedness to live up to his part of the bargain to the test, and it is for this reason that the Australian government will keep forces in the region to ensure Saddam Hussein understands the resolve of the international community - reinforced by today's Security Council resolution - for full compliance.</DOC>

 - I really do not know what cuts the member is referring to. But, now that you have asked me what advice you should give your constituents, the first piece of advice I would give them is this: for heaven's sake, do not ever vote Labor again federally. If your constituents were to vote Labor at the next federal election, they would put at risk the cut in interest rates worth a $100-a-week increase in wages that they have received under our government.The fact is that Western Australia has been very well treated by my government. The rate of economic growth in Western Australia is very high. During the Australia Day weekend I had the opportunity of spending a couple of days with the Premier of Western Australia, during which I announced a contribution of over $80 million to the Jervis Bay infrastructure project that is going to underpin the oil and gas industries of Western Australia and provide a marvellous strengthening to its infrastructure.The Western Australian economy is in a very good condition, which is due to the combined effect of the policies of the Western Australian Liberal government and the federal coalition government. So my advice to the constituents of Moore at the next election is to vote Liberal, under no circumstances vote Labor, and retain the Court Liberal government in power and continue progress in a state which is growing at the fastest rate of any state in Australia.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. There have been some quite extraordinary comments in the media recently, but one possible good thing has come out of it: at least the Leader of the Opposition has discovered health. The Leader of the Opposition, though, has made the extraordinary statement that his solution to fix this would be to put more money into hospitals. That is a ridiculous statement and shows that he has no understanding of the health system whatsoever. The first point I would make is that that was exactly what was done in the 1993 Medicare agreement. You were such fools that you signed a Medicare agreement that allowed the states to slip the money out of the hospitals, so you were no better off. The second point is that what  happens in public hospitals is independent of what happens in private health premiums. -  - No, you have got to understand there is not a linkage between the two. There might be in your little mind, babbling to yourself, but Modecate will fix that. The third point is that if you have a look at the Industry Commission, the biggest single cause of increases in private hospital premiums is the public to private shift. That public to private shift came as a deliberate result of your 1993 Medicare agreement.	 The opposition spokesperson on health has been using words such as `crisis' and `deluge', which is extraordinary given that the rate of drop-out in the last six months is actually the best result we have had for 10 years. It is also extraordinary coming from a political party where the former Labor health minister, Graham Richardson, said this:I steered a package through the cabinet but resigned before I could sell it to the caucus. Practically the whole package died when I left as the Labor Party had always been a bit biased against private health insurance, and without a sponsor any proposal . . . was doomed.If we are in a position today that is of some difficulty, it is because in 1995-96 the health insurance funds lost $122 million. In 1996-97 they lost $113 million. This year, with a bit of luck, they might actually break even. The fact is they have suffered long-term neglect and long-term decline by a party that even its former health minister admits is a bit biased against private health insurance, and this sort of overblown humbug is complete rubbish.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Richmond for his question, and I am delighted to hear that the members of communities in the electorate of Richmond have embraced work for the dole there, as have members of communities around Australia. This government has rebuilt the relationship between young people and their communities in a way that desperately needed to be done. When we came into office we found that a third of young people could not read and write properly. The apprenticeship system had been almost killed. While he was employment minister, the Leader of the Opposition had the appalling record of pushing youth unemployment up to over 32 per cent. He added to the  ranks of the long-term unemployed by 95,000. The Labor Party has absolutely no credibility in this area whatsoever. It despises the unemployed.This government has taken a whole series of actions to build a comprehensive strategy to help young people get back into the work force, to build up their skills and to build up their work enthusiasm and work ethic. At the end of January this year, the Prime Minister made a very important announcement that, from the middle of this year, all young people aged from 18 to 24 who have been out of work for six months or more will be expected to undertake some other activity in addition to receiving the dole. This announcement will reinforce and rebuild some very fundamental values in this country. First and foremost, it gives young people the opportunity to take personal responsibility in choosing the activity which will best fit them for the work force, whether it is voluntary work, whether it is part-time work, whether it is work for the dole or whether it is added literacy and numeracy training. The government is also, through this program, rebuilding the support, the sense of mutual obligation, between young people and their communities. Eighty thousand additional work for the dole places will be created over the next four years under this announcement.One of the most important aspects of this announcement is that the government is preparing to provide to young people who have missed out on those crucial literacy and numeracy skills in school a major program of literacy and numeracy training. There will be 48,000 extra places provided over the next four years at a cost of $139 million to get that literacy and numeracy training.In addition to this, the Prime Minister announced that the government would be ensuring that there are an additional 8,800 JPET places for homeless and disadvantaged young people. This is a excellent program that the previous government tried to abolish which we have revived, which brings out the very best people in our communities committed to helping young people rebuild their future lives under conditions when they are  most distressed. What a contrast this is to the attitude to the unemployed that we see from the other side of the House. The Leader of the Opposition said about young unemployed who were not on work for the dole that they would just continue to lie around in bed. That was his view of young people on 2BL on 12 March 1997. The member for Batman in a press release last week said, `People will seek to get on welfare even if they have to cheat to get there.' Unemployed people are cheats in the minds of the Labor Party. On 10 February 1997, the member for Batman in a radio interview with Pru Goward said that young people `just go home and go back to bed or watch TV for the rest of the week'.So unemployed people, in the eyes of the Labor Party, are lazy; they are cheats. You have no regard for the unemployed people in this country. That is why you betrayed through your policies a generation of young people - and that is why this government is acting to restore some fundamental values on which the future of the next generation in this country will be built.</DOC>

 - The honourable member obviously does not understand the process under which the government may or may not be able to approve premium increases. The legislation gives a very limited basis on which premiums can be knocked back. If that basis is not met, then the premiums cannot actually be disallowed. There has only been one occasion in the last 20 years when a minister has been able to actually disallow a premium increase, and then that was overruled in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.But I do understand the concern that older Australians feel and I do understand why they are angry. For example, in 1985 the former government took away the bed day subsidy; in 1986 they made health funds pay for the difference between the 75 per cent Medicare  rebate and the schedule fee; and between 1984 and 1989 the government took away its $100 million a year contribution to the reinsurance pool. The net effect of those three decisions has been to make private health insurance 30 per cent more expensive than it would otherwise be for your constituents. So the message I would give to the people - and, unlike the majority of people on the other side, I do have private health insurance and I understand how frustrating it is when the premiums go up - is that it is 10 to 15 per cent, probably 18 per cent, cheaper than it would be without the incentive scheme. If you lot ever get in and take it away, premiums will go up overnight by 18 per cent.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Canning for her question. She is a great fighter for small business. I recognise her tremendous commitment to ensuring a fair deal for the small business community. I am delighted to be able to say that we are leading the charge when it comes to providing a better deal for the small business community. This week it seems that every day there is some additional benefit which we are putting in place for the small business community. Yesterday we had the extension of the banking industry ombudsman scheme. That is a fantastic boost for the small business community, and it is one in which we took the lead.In respect of retail tenancies, that is another area where this government has taken a lead. I must say I am very disappointed at the member for Cunningham's complete lack of understanding of what we are actually doing. It is bad enough that they did nothing for 13 years, but now they oppose what we are  doing only to find that they do not even understand the extent and the magnitude of the changes that we are making. Yesterday he said that we had failed to deliver uniform retail national tenancy legislation.	That was never our objective. We do not want two sets of legislative schemes, federal and state, for retail tenancy. Nothing could be worse, nothing could be more costly and more burdensome for the small business community. So what we have done is set out - we set them out last year - a set of principles which ought to underpin the approach which is taken by the state parliaments. That has been a very successful approach.It is a long road, but we are effective, we are pushing this agenda. As the member for Canning has said, we are committed - and the member for Cowan backed her up. We took this to the meeting of ministers and parliamentary secretaries last year, and this is what the communique said that the ministers and parliamentary secretaries endorse the objective of establishing consistent legislative or regulatory minimum retail standards across the Australian jurisdiction. They went on to say - and this is not just coalition people but Labor people as well - that the initiatives are major steps towards achieving greater consistency in the business environment across Australia. What else did they say? They said that the ministers and parliamentary secretaries commended the package of initiatives announced by the Commonwealth on 30 September.What a contrast to the `13 years and 17 reports do nothing' approach of Labor. I will tell you what: if Labor were ever in, they would again do nothing for the small business community, except tax them, put more red tape on them and generally make their life as difficult as possibility. So, in the retail tenancy area, we are certainly driving this agenda in a way that has never been done before at the Commonwealth level. Similarly, in the franchise area - the Labor Party had a voluntary scheme for big business, and it was not working in the interests of small business. So the Reid committee said, `We want a mandatory code; we will require people to meet reasonable standards.' And we have introduced that.The Labor Party had a recommendation to that effect and they knocked it back. Who was sitting in the cabinet when they knocked back that benefit for the small business community? None other than the old Leader of the Opposition - old Mr Anti-small business. Doing the bidding of Finance and Treasury, he opposed the sensible measure for the small business community. To cap it off, here we have the most important legislative package for the small business community in 20 years, and yesterday this is what the member for Cunningham had to say. He said, `Mr Reith has the hide to accuse the Labor opposition of stalling the legislation which his own government hasn't even introduced into the Senate.' That is what he said yesterday.I refer honourable members to page 10401 of Hansard of 4 December last year. I think my colleagues are picking up the message. The second reading speech was moved by Senator Ellison:I move:That this bill be now read a second time.I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard .Leave was not granted. He said that we did not introduce it into the parliament. We took it into the Senate and they refused the first measure to get it under way in the Senate before Christmas. The best package in 20 years and you people are out there deceiving the Australian small business community about your attitude. The fact is that you want to delay this measure, you want to filibuster this measure and you have the cheek to say that we have not introduced it into the Senate. As the Hansard  shows, it is in the Senate. No wonder he is an embarrassment to you.</DOC>

 - This House should know that in the Senate yesterday Senator Vanstone revealed that the shadow spokesman on legal affairs, Senator Bolkus, had leaked details of confidential action being taken to recover overseas assets from one of Australia's most wanted fugitives: namely, Christopher Skase. Senator Bolkus has been captured red-handed on video revealing to the media the contents of confidential Federal Court documents. It appears those documents have been unlawfully or improperly given to Senator Bolkus or unlawfully or improperly obtained by him.What Senator Bolkus has done is help Christopher Skase. Senator Bolkus has given Skase the opportunity to know about the action being taken. This will enable Skase to take countermeasures to prevent recovery of the assets. He is acting against the interests of the Australian public. The Australian public want those assets returned for the benefit of creditors.This is a matter for action by the Leader of the Opposition. It is a time for leadership; a time for responsibility. Does the Leader of the Opposition disapprove of the shadow Attorney-General acting against the public interest? Does the Leader of the Opposition have control over Senator Bolkus? Does the Leader of the Opposition accept that, like ministers, shadow ministers must meet appropriate standards of conduct? To each of these questions the Leader of the Opposition says no. By doing nothing he says no. - </DOC>

 - You shouldn't telegraph these things quite so much. I inform the House that I have been informed that the situation in relation to this matter is as follows: the Australian Labor Party, through the member for Denison, is referring to the Yallobup Creek catchment project. I am informed that Dianne Crane and Nicky Crane did sign documents supporting funding bids under the NHT as part of community support for the application. The project, so I am informed, is directed at fencing and revegetation, and the planting of native trees and shrubs. It is part of a large-scale, coordinated effort to -  - Stolen goods? For somebody whose mate has been caught on video handing over confidential court documents, that is a pretty good effort - and his leader is too gutless to do anything about it. Mr Deputy Speaker, they talk about stolen goods; how on earth can you tolerate having somebody on your front bench who is aiding and abetting Christopher Skase? How can you tolerate it? He has set out deliberately to undermine the pursuit of Skase; he has deliberately tried to undermine Skase's position - and you know  that. Returning to the question, I apologise. I was -  -  - I was provoked by the interjection by the member for Hotham. As a result of that, I got diverted. I apologise. - Provoke me again, please, Simon. - Returning to the question asked by the member for Denison -  - Mr Deputy Speaker, I realise that it was the member for Canberra and not the member for Hotham who interjected. I apologise to the member for Canberra for not giving him his due publicity. I know they are sensitive on the front bench about how much Hansard  space they get. - Yes, they are very sensitive about Canberra, too. To return: if I could be protected from interjections, I might be able to finish this answer. - Could I just say in reply to the member for Denison -  -  - The project is directed -  -  - I was saying that the project is directed at fencing. -  - Mr Deputy Speaker, they asked a question yet they do not want to listen to the answer. I will simply wind up question time.</DOC>

 - The national account figures that were released today show that the Australian economy grew by 0.5 per cent in the December quarter, to yield an annual growth rate of 3.6 per cent. That annual growth rate compares very favourably with most other countries. If we had not taken the corrective measures that we did when we inherited the $10½ billion deficit you left to us, then the Australian economy would not now be as strong as it is.So far as the Asian troubles are concerned, it is beyond argument that, if we had not taken the measures we have taken, Australia would not have the lowest inflation rate in the Western world, we would not have such a high level of business investment, we would not have turned a deficit of $10½ billion into a prospective surplus and, importantly, we would not have delivered interest rate cuts to average Australians that are the equivalent of a wage rise of $90 to $100 a week.The truth is that, if our opponents had been in charge of the treasury bench over the last two years, we would not have been able to deliver those interest rate cuts, wage and salary earners would be $90 to $100 a week  worse off in equivalent terms and the Australian economy would be infinitely more vulnerable to the turmoil now sweeping through the Asia-Pacific region.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Kooyong for his question. I am sure members of the House will welcome the fact that today's national account figures show Australia growing at one of the fastest rates in the developed world at 3.6 per cent. Good, strong growth up around 3¾per cent, which is the government's forecast for 1997-98, is consistent with good employment growth. I am sure all members of the House will also welcome the fact that, over the last five months, 140,000 new jobs have been created in Australia. That is one of the benefits of the growth which we are now experiencing.The small business survey released today in conjunction with the Yellow Pages index showed an increasing confidence amongst the small business sector. It was noted that developments in Asia, of course, will have an effect on confidence. Dr Marsden of the small business survey said, `The impact of the Asian crisis is widely expected to take the gloss off what would otherwise have been near boom conditions.' I am sure all people in small business will welcome that.The positive news in relation to the small business sector also showed a remarkable step-up in small businesses reporting increases in economic growth and economic outlook. Today's national accounts not only confirmed strong growth in the Australian economy consistent with good jobs growth but confirmed another record for Australia: an inflation rate down at 1.2 per cent in economy-wide terms. That is a position the Australian  economy has not been in for many an occasion.It is because of that low inflation outcome that the Australian public will experience another benefit in relation to interest rates: interest rates down to around 6½ per cent on the standard variable home mortgage. That is now the lowest home mortgage rate since the 1960s, which I am sure members of the House will also welcome. That gives young people the opportunity to buy homes which they would never have had under the high interest rate policy of our predecessors. Young people are getting the opportunity to get security and a life and to get into a home with a 6½ per cent interest rate, which they have never been able to do in the last 30 years in Australia.This side of the House believes that strong economic growth, and the employment growth that goes with it, low inflation and the low interest rates that go with it, can bring great benefits for Australians and their families and, as far as this side of the House is concerned, these are good news results for the Australian public.</DOC>

 - My understanding of the legislation is that the withdrawal has not been occasioned because of any change of heart in relation to the -  - No; it has nothing to do with that either. Just quietly listen: you had 13 years to get a decent industry policy and you failed. The reality is that the change is to incorporate another aspect of the plan. It has  absolutely nothing to do with any lack of resolve so far as the government is concerned.The other part of the honourable gentleman's question goes very much to the heart of confidence in the Australian manufacturing industry, and it gives me the opportunity to say a couple of things about that. I might remind the House that the industry statement I delivered on behalf of the government on 8 December last year was widely applauded, and rightly so, throughout the Australian manufacturing industry. It was seen as striking the right balance between the government taking a limited but strategic role so far as industry is concerned but avoiding the mistakes of a number of our Asian neighbours who have embraced industry policies that were far too interventionist.It would be very interesting to comb through the statements made by the member for Hotham seven or eight months ago about the level of intervention that was needed in the economy and have a look at that in comparison with some of the levels of intervention in the economies of the Asia-Pacific region, which are now seen as being directly responsible for a lot of the economic troubles those countries are now experiencing. Many of the statements the member of Hotham was making a few months ago were perilously close to the very models of intervention that are now roundly condemned by the International Monetary Fund and others. He has been caught red-handed in cranking up the desirability of government intervention in the economy.What Australian manufacturers want is low inflation. They want low interest rates. They want stability of economic policy. They want the predictability that a government surplus, as distinct from the instability of a government deficit, has delivered. The message I get from the Australian manufacturing industry is that at long last we have a government that attends to the economic fundamentals and the important foundations. We have created a climate of growth and confidence that has produced 140,000 new jobs over the last four or five months. That is the greatest vote of confidence you can have in our economic management.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Makin for her question. As I said yesterday, Senator Bolkus has been captured red-handed on video revealing to the media the contents of confidential Federal Court documents relating to Christopher Skase. Those documents, as I said, appear to have been given to Senator Bolkus unlawfully or improperly or obtained by him unlawfully or improperly. The exposure of the information has the potential to frustrate completely the considerable efforts being made to recover Skase's assets overseas. In view of the significance of the leak, the Minister for Justice has requested the Australian Federal Police to investigate it.When he was leaking the contents of the document to the media, Senator Bolkus is apparently recorded as saying, `I can't give this document out, but maybe if I just read it off the record.' This is the proceedings in court. In the circumstances there seems to be no doubt that Senator Bolkus would be able to assist the Federal Police with their inquiries.The Australian public has a great interest in the Skase affair and there are many creditors owed millions of dollars who have a great stake in the attempt to recover the overseas assets. What should happen is this: the Leader  of the Opposition should instruct Senator Bolkus to stand down and cooperate with the Federal Police. Will the Leader of the Opposition do that? No, he will not. The Leader of the Opposition does not control people like Senator Bolkus. The Leader of the Opposition does not require his shadow ministers to adhere to any proper standards of conduct. Will the Leader of the Opposition stand Senator Bolkus down? No, he will not. The opposition will continue to do whatever it takes to score a political point, no matter what the consequence, no matter how reprehensible the conduct.</DOC>

 - By way of -  - Oh, it's a cop out! I can understand why the Leader of the Opposition says that. I am reminded by my colleague the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs that the level was 32 per cent when the Leader of the Opposition was minister for employment. Not only was the youth unemployment 32 per cent, but the general rate was 11.2 per cent, he gave us over a million unemployed and he left us with a deficit of $10.5 billion. That is a trifecta of failure and deceit that has not been matched in the Australian parliament ever.I am asked about the policies of the government in relation to youth unemployment. I want to thank the member for Batman for giving me the opportunity to say a few things about them because it is, as I know the member will agree, an extremely important and critical issue. It enables me to remind the House that my colleague announced last year a new approach to apprenticeships and traineeships that will create 100,000 - not 10,000; not 20,000 - new apprenticeships. It gives me the opportunity to remind the House that the new industrial relations legislation that was introduced by my colleague the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business has given far greater flexibility in, and therefore far more opportunities for, the creation of traineeships which are suitable to the needs of individual employers and employees.I also remind the House that one of the changes that was negotiated in relation to the passage of that legislation was the postponement of a very foolish proposal from the former government which would have phased out the youth rates allowed under the then and now the continuing law. If that had not been done, if we had not enlisted the aid of the minor parties in the Senate to do that, we may have put at risk the jobs of over 200,000 young Australians.You were hell bent on a course of action - because you had been told to take it by the ACTU - which would have abolished the youth award rate, which would have pushed up the price of their labour and which would have thrown perhaps 200,000 young Australians out of a job. And you have the nerve to get up here and pose as a friend of the young unemployed!Of course, the evidence of the indifference of the Labor Party does not stop there. One of the things that we have introduced to help instil the work ethic and a better sense amongst young people who are finding it hard to get work is the work for the dole scheme - a scheme which has widespread community support and a scheme which is acclaimed by young people as well as the community generally. At every stage the Labor Party is opposed to work for the dole. It was their  instantaneous reaction. You are a prime example of it - you nod your head again. You hate the work for the dole scheme, don't you? And if you got back into government one of the first things you would do is abolish the work for the dole scheme.I tell the member for Batman that not only has the work for the dole scheme been introduced, but in my federation speech in January of this year I announced a major expansion of the mutual obligation principle - a principle that says that, if people cannot get work, they are entitled to look to the government for support but the government is entitled, on behalf of the community, to ask them, if they are able to do so, to put something back. You do not believe in mutual obligation. You want to destroy the work for the dole scheme and, by your slavish adherence to the union line on award wages, if you had continued in office you would have threatened another 200,000 jobs for young Australians. You have no credibility at all asking me questions about youth unemployment.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. It is the Labor Party that is holding up the passage of this legislation. The bill has now been re-presented for a second time to the Senate and we can only hope that commonsense will prevail and that these important reforms for the benefit of small business can go through.This has been one of the greatest fiascos of industrial relations policy in the history of the Federation. Really, no single measure could have done more damage to the small business community than that measure which was introduced by the Labor Party, introduced by the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Kingsford-Smith, who still sit on the Labor Party frontbench and whose actions today are preventing the passage of legislation which will finally start to fix up the problem which they were responsible for.But it is worse than that. This is a record on behalf of the Labor Party not only of massive failure in respect of the small business community but also of deceit, because if you go around the electorate I can tell you what small business is saying in the member for Paterson's electorate. They are saying they want this exemption.Do you know why I know what they are saying? Because the Labor candidate, Bob Horne, the former federal member, and the shadow minister for unions over there had a $100 a head so-called function for the small business community. They only got 30 to turn up, but the next day Bob Horne on ABC Newcastle said that this issue of unfair dismissal had actually been raised during the meeting. He said, `We have got to try and build up our permanent jobs. Employers are resisting putting people on the permanent staff simply because of things like unfair dismissal.'So he denies the problem. His candidate knows what the problem is because small  business have said so. But the deceit of these people is absolutely mind-boggling. The reporter asked him, `So is there a chance then that changes to those particular areas would be in any ALP employment policy that might be put forward before the next election?' Well, he's just had a function with the shadow minister for employment, he's asked the question, `Might you fix up the problem?' and this is his answer: `Well, I'm sure we would be looking at streamlining those factors, yes.' So he is out in the electorate saying, `Yes, it is a problem, we hear small business,' and his mates are back here stopping the measure going through the Senate, and even worse - the hypocrisy of these people knows no bounds - their policy, the draft policy last year, the one that was going to have another review in it, was:. . . Labor will seek means of giving small business a greater incentive to provide jobs, particularly for the long-term unemployed. . . But they took that out because the unions wanted that out and instead they put in that they will support small business `provided that firms meet their social and industrial relations obligations by implementing fair and cooperative relationships with workers and their representatives'.This is unbelievable. The small business community, when Labor was in, had a government that delivered one of the great fiascos of industrial relations which damaged small business - in fact, right across the board their policies damage small business - and when we move to fix up the problems, whether it is unfair dismissal or chasing Skase, we have got your little mate up there in the Senate supporting Skase against the interests of small business.Who do you reckon is in the long list of people who are owed money by the fraudulent practices of Christopher Skase? None other than literally thousands of small business people in this country - another example of the damage you did to small business. And what is your answer to your little mate in the Senate? He sits there, mute and embarrassed when he has got one of his own frontbenchers admitting publicly that he should not be publicly releasing this information. He says,  `I can't give this document out' - a public admission that he should not then do what he proceeded to do - `but maybe if I just read it out off the record.'This is a disgrace. When it comes to the small business community, not only are you preventing the remedies being put in place to overcome the damage done by the Labor Party when they were in government but, here you are, you have frontbenchers who are actually supporting somebody like Christopher Skase and the shadow Attorney-General publicly admitting that he was wrong to release confidential material on a court file and then proceeding to do so. We had it on tape, we effectively got photos of the bloke, scripts of the bloke, video of the bloke and this weak leader, who so damaged the interests of the small business community, sits here unable to discipline one of his own frontbenchers.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Aston for his question and recognise his  role in the committee system. I want to make the point that overarching all trade last year was an all-time record of $104 billion of exports in both goods and services to the world and beyond Asia as we sought to diversify beyond Asia. So some of the countries increasing in exports are: Iran, up 71 per cent; Egypt, up 51 per cent in the Middle East; South Africa, up 31 per cent - and Minister Moore and I conducted the first joint ministerial in South Africa midyear last year - and Mexico, up 24 per cent. If we turn to the Trade Outcomes and Objectives Statement in absolute terms, detailed in here is some of those breakthroughs. In the negotiations, as we injected real energy into the bilaterals -  - I wish to add some additional information to some aspects of the statement. I remind the House - and you may not like it - that we have put energy into the bilaterals; you neglected the bilaterals for years. The words for that come from John Button, not from me. We put effort into getting increased market access. One example in the services area is coal, canola and wool to Mexico. Japan opened up the insurance market previously closed to Australia. I could go on to detail other countries.What we ought to realise very clearly is that if we had not tackled your $10½ billion  deficit our exporters would not have had this secure basis on which to operate. If we had not restored the economic fundamentals our exporters could not have reached that $100 billion level. If we had not pursued the bilaterals we would not have the improved market access we have today.Since the period covered by the statement - to acknowledge the point taken by the Leader of the Opposition - I emphasise in the seven months since, we have in fact put in an extraordinarily good export performance against the odds, notwithstanding everything that is happening in Asia. The reason we have done that is that we have been pro-active on the bilaterals for our exporters, we have provided a balanced budget strategy and we have provided real, direct and focused assistance to ensure that our exporters have a fair go.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Gellibrand for his question. The Job Network that the government is putting in place is going to provide greatly improved services and assistance to unemployed people in getting jobs. It will do that for quite a number of reasons. But it will do it in particular because there will be many more job vacancies provided by the agencies in the Job Network, there will be many more sites available to unemployed people to get assistance - some 1,404 sites  will be available for basic job matching services and other services compared with less than 300 through the CES at the present time -  - The question addressed the results that would be coming from the Job Network. The most important result is that there will be a focus on getting unemployed people jobs. - Within the west and inner Melbourne area, there are over 25 contracted  providers. They have been selected on the basis of quality and value for money. - Oh! - Of course, value for money for the taxpayer was of no concern to the member for Hotham because he spent $500 million on a program that cost $143,000 a job. In the context of the tender round for establishment of the Job Network, there were over 1,000 organisations which tendered. Every organisation went through, first of all, a very rigorous financial viability check and, secondly, a very rigorous scrutiny of the quality of the tender which was made. The system is a results based system because, for the first time, the successful tenderers will be paid according to their capacity not to place people in programs, not to churn them around to change the statistics on employment, but on the basis of their capacity to get people into jobs and take them off benefits.It is somewhat invidious to name the successful tenderers in West Melbourne, but I will identify one or two to give members of the House a sense of the quality of the successful tenderers in West Melbourne. Mission Australia has been contracted to provide new enterprise incentive scheme payments - that is, NEIS services. There has been a contract provided with the Russian Ethnic Representative Council of Victoria - obviously to provide services to a particular section of the community. There has been a contract provided to the Salvation Army - an organisation which has enormous respect - to provide intensive assistance to the most disadvantaged jobseekers. One of the ways in which the Job Network is focusing on results - and one can be confident it will achieve results - is to ensure that by far the largest financial incentives being paid to providers will be paid when the most disadvantaged jobseekers are assisted. Another successful tenderer in the West Melbourne area was Job Futures Ltd, which got many contracts for sites around Australia and is a consortium of the Brotherhood of St Laurence and a number of other major community providers.There can be no question of the quality of the organisations - their links with community and their experience - which will be carrying  through the government's commitment to unemployed people and, particularly, the most disadvantaged people. Every one of the organisations that the member for Gellibrand mentioned had a chance to tender. They may well believe they have provided - and maybe they well have - good services in the past, but in the end they were not as competitive as the organisations which got contracts. They were subject to the most close scrutiny as to their outcomes, and members of the public can be very confident in the quality of the organisations which have received contracts under this tender process.Finally, let me say that the entire tender process was subject to the independent probity auditing of Blake Dawson Waldron. Blake Dawson Waldron have signed off that they are entirely satisfied with the probity with which the tender has been conducted and with the fairness of the whole tender process to every single tenderer. </DOC>

 - In answer to the honourable member for Hughes, I have over the past few weeks become aware of some spending and revenue proposals emanating from the member for Dobell, who is the shadow minister for health, that would directly attack the living standards and the disposable incomes of ordinary Australian families.To start with, the member for Dobell, if he were to become health minister in a Labor government, would immediately take away the $450 a year tax rebate for private health insurance. For the last six months he has been running around Australia. Every time he opens his mouth he tells us how unnecessary and what a failure the health rebate has been. One can only conclude that if the member for Dobell were to become health minister in a Labor government - presumably that would be so if a Labor government were to be elected because he is the shadow minister for health - then his policy, his first act, would be to increase the private health insurance premiums of average Australian families by taking away the $450 a year.It does not end there. On top of that the very same shadow minister for health over the last six months has racked up spending commitments of between $5 billion and $6 billion over a four-year period. You can go through the list. He has committed himself to completely reverse the savings that were made in relation to therapeutic premiums and to support in full the additional demands made by the states in relation to the Medicare agreement. Those two commitments alone add up to about $2 billion over a period of four years. You can go through them item by item, list by list, and you get to a situation where the shadow minister for health has committed himself to spending proposals under a Labor government of between $5 billion and $6 billion over a period of four years.I put the members of the opposition on notice. It is about time they realised that this business of being in opposition is not a sleigh ride. You cannot run around the country slagging everything the government has done, saying that a particular health subsidy is of no account, or promising to reverse spending cuts and then imagine that nobody on the other side is going to do their sums and ask the very fundamental question of where the money is coming from. So, on two counts, he is going to take away the private health insurance premium, and that will increase the premiums of an average Australian family by $450 a year. So I say to all of those average families that have health insurance: if you  vote Labor your premium will automatically go up by $450 a year. Not only will that happen, if you vote Labor you are going to lose the interest rate cut that is equivalent to a pay rise of $100 a week. Why is that going to happen? It is going to happen because if a Labor government were elected they would put at risk the budget surplus that we have built up over the last two years. If you elect a Labor government they will embark upon a spending spree and our little mate from Dobell has already given us $5 billion or $6 billion. - I thought that in the Australian lexicon `little mate' was pretty endearing. But if anybody on the other side is offended by it, I unqualifiedly withdraw. I would have thought that over the last 20 years that is a pretty endearing expression. Michael, I would not get offended at that; people have called you much worse things than that. But if you are offended, far be it from me to give any offence to anybody on the front bench of the opposition.This is not a costless game. You cannot have the luxury of being an opposition that nobody takes any notice of. You can run around the country saying, `Look, vote us in and we will spend another $3 billion or $4 billion. Vote us in and we will fix all this up.' At the end of the day your political opponents and the commentators start doing their sums and start saying, `Hey, if he is against the health insurance premium that means he is going to take it away. If he is going to spend all of this money then that is going to have a consequence.' And do you know what the consequence will be? It will be higher interest rates because if you blow out government spending you will have a large government  deficit, those interest rates will go up and that $100 a week will disappear.This is instalment one in getting back to reality, living in the real world and making the opposition understand that you cannot go around the length and breadth of Australia making all sorts of reckless spending and taxation promises without being drawn to account. You were irresponsible when you were in government and you are being irresponsible in opposition. I ought to give you notice that over the next few months the Australian people are going to find out just how irresponsible and how out of touch and irrelevant you really are.	Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Batman for his question. Like every other question that he has ever asked me, it has been based on false assumptions and inaccurate claims. The bid by Employment Interactive, like every other bid, was assessed on its merits relating to the financial viability of the tenderer and the tender. Employment Interactive demonstrated in that bid that it was financially viable. - Members of the House ought to note the fact that the opposition is engaged at the moment in making completely unsubstantiated allegations against an individual contractor. These allegations made outside the House might well place that contractor in a  position where he might want to consider action to protect his reputation. It shows how low the Labor Party will sink.Let me put the facts on the record. This particular tenderer and every other tenderer demonstrated his financial viability to provide the services for which he tendered. The Labor Party has made no answer to that or put any facts on the record that refute that. This tenderer and every other tenderer demonstrated that he had the strategies to help unemployed people, that he had appropriate experience and that he would be able to provide services for unemployed people. I am advised that this particular tenderer had a number of years direct personal experience in assisting unemployed people and obtained very good references in support of the effective assistance which he had been able to give unemployed people.Many organisations, large and small, who have only recently been advised of the success of their tender are now in the process of establishing their offices and hiring staff to provide Job Network services. This is perfectly normal given the fact that the results of the tender round have just been announced. The Job Network was established to allow new players to enter the market. The government had a responsibility to unemployed people to give all those many people in this country who have excellent experience and ideas an opportunity to put them forward, to stand up and to offer to provide services to unemployed people. It is not at all surprising that the new entities which the government set out to attract would not have a full complement of staff or be established at contracted sites. It has been claimed in the course of public comment that this entity does not have a registered business name. I am advised that this tenderer's business name was registered on 19 March 1997. So those claims are completely false.The facilities and staff of all tenderers have to be in place by 1 May 1998. It is not required that these facilities and staff be in place this week and, as I say, many of the contractors, including some very large and established ones, are now in the business of setting up new sites and hiring staff. Subcon  tracting is entirely acceptable because it is a way of attracting into the Job Network those people with additional experience and skills in the community to help unemployed people and to ensure that the quality of the Job Network is the highest it can possibly be. All subcontractors will have to be approved by the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs.It is apparent from what I have just said that untrue and inaccurate statements have been made by the Labor Party and by others in the media about this particular contractor. I suggest that they very carefully consider whether it is appropriate to be attacking, on completely unsubstantiated grounds, a person who has demonstrated experience and financial viability to provide quality services. - No, it was not.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Hindmarsh. Might I say, by way of introduction to my answer, that somebody interjected while the honourable member for Hindmarsh was asking her question with the comment, `What about the South Australian economy?' I can say this about the South Australian economy: it is a damn sight better as a result of the industry policies decisions that my government has taken. The decisions that were taken in relation to the motor vehicle industry have resulted in additional investment of hundreds of millions of dollars, and the combined statement of the industry and the trade union movement in South Australia has unanimously supported those decisions that have been taken by my government.The honourable member asked generally about the state of the economy. Occasionally one hears a comment from somebody that really does encapsulate what is happening, and I heard that from none other than my colleague the Treasurer yesterday when he said that the Australian economy was really motoring down the highway - neither too fast nor too slow. I think that really did encapsu  late the degree of control that the government's economic management has brought to the affairs of this country, and there is no section of the Australian economy or the Australian population that has gained more from the economic management of my government than Australian home buyers.Australian home buyers have benefited enormously; they have benefited richly; they have benefited regularly from the interest rate reductions that have occurred under my government. Over the past two years those interest rate reductions have been worth the equivalent of a wage rise of $90 to $100 a week. That is the good news. The bad news is that, if the Labor Party were to win the next election, that interest rate gain would be wiped away. That interest rate gain would disappear because Labor in government was the party of high interest rates.People will never forget that home mortgage rates went to 17 per cent under the stewardship of the former government. People will not forget that, when we came to office barely two years ago, housing interest rates were over 10 per cent. They are now 6.7 per cent. They have fallen by an average of $256 a month or the equivalent of a wage rise of $100 a week. All of that would be threatened if the Australian people were to re-elect a Labor government, because Labor will not do anything differently in government in the future than they did in the past.You can assume from that that, if they were elected again, we would once again see housing interest rates going up and we would once again see those affordability demands rise on the average wage earner. Every single deed that they have embraced since going into opposition indicates that all of the high spending, big deficit, high debt, high interest rate policies of the past would be resumed if, unfortunately, the Labor Party were returned to the treasury bench of Australia.So I can report to the honourable member for Hindmarsh that not only has the economy of South Australia benefited enormously from the particular policies of my government but more generally the economy of Australia is, in the words of the Treasurer, motoring down the highway - neither too fast nor too slow -   and there is no more contented spectator of that motoring journey than the Australian home buyer. That average home buyer is the equivalent of $100 a week better off in the pay packet so far as a wage rise is concerned with the lowest interest rates since the late 1960s - a testament to the shrewd, careful and sensible economic management of my government.</DOC>

 - I am somewhat surprised, in the light of my last answer, that the member for Batman would return to making these allegations against Employment Interactive. What I recall saying on ABC Radio last week was that no-one would be awarded a contract who was not financially viable. - And it could not happen that somebody would be awarded a contract who was not financially viable. The most rigorous financial viability checks were made of every tenderer, and this tenderer demonstrated his financial viability. This tenderer also demonstrated his capacity to deliver the services, on the basis of his experience.The Job Network will be greatly improving the quality of services to unemployed people. It will be doing so because, as I said on ABC radio on a number of occasions, it will provide many more vacancies, it will provide a much wider choice of agencies and it will be improving the dignity of unemployed people because they will be able to choose the agency which best meets their needs, includ  ing people in the Islamic community of Sydney. In other communities where there are many non-English speaking people there have been a significant number of organisations contracted to provide specialist services to those people. There is no foundation for the claims which are being made by the Australian Labor Party in this regard.I have seen the comments of Mr Fitzgerald. I understand that they relate to the issue of subcontracting. As I have said, subcontracting is in fact a feature of the new arrangements which will allow people with skills and experience who have not themselves received directly contracts to offer those skills and experience to unemployed people. As I said - and I do not know whether Mr Fitzgerald is aware of this - every proposal to subcontract will have to receive the permission of the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Groom for his question. It is appropriate that this question should come from the honourable member as the Chairman of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties. He has done, I think, a quite excellent job for this parliament and for the people of Australia over the last nearly two years in that role.Before the last election there were widespread allegations in the community, and there was a lot of uncertainty in the community as well, about the previous government negotiating treaties in secret and not consulting the public before the ratification of those treaties. This government when it came to power decided it would rectify that, come clean with the public and be transparent in the whole of the treaty making process.As a consequence of that, the government established the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, of which, as I said, the member for Groom is chairman. We table all treaties in parliament with national interest analyses and leave them open for debate, and a Treaties Council has been established for consultation with the states. So with this government the process is not secret; it is completely transparent. With that background, imagine my surprise when I read just the other day a press release put out by none other than the member for Kingsford-Smith. - Yes, the member for Kingsford-Smith, criticising the government for negotiating the multilateral agreement on investment, the OECD agreement, in secret and hiding behind a shroud of secrecy. I can only say that the hypocrisy of this press release completely astonished me.Those of you who were elected since 1993 may not remember, but the member for Kingsford-Smith will remember that during the election campaign in 1993 the member for Kingsford-Smith, as the Minister for Industrial Relations or as parliamentary secretary, whatever he was then, arranged for the then government to ratify International Labour Organisation Convention 158, of course without consultation with the public and without consultation with the parliament. He did not even put out a press release letting the public know that this convention had been ratified and subsequently legislated in industrial relations reforms, which were a debacle, on the basis of that convention. For a man with that record to accuse this government of hiding behind a shroud of secrecy in the MAI negotiations shows that the Labor Party is not even slightly credible.The fact is that we are very happy to be transparent in these negotiations. The government, the Treasurer and I in particular, are only too happy to allow the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties to examine this issue. As far as we are concerned, these negotiations can go before the treaties committee today or tomorrow. We are quite happy to refer these negotiations to the treaties committee at any time. There is no secret and there is no  secrecy in the government's approach to this or to the negotiation of treaties of this kind in general. The fact is that the transparency and openness of this government's approach stands in stark contrast to the previous government.Let me conclude with one point and that is that the member for Kingsford-Smith and some of his apparent newly found friends in the Greens and Democrats in the Senate -  - And people like the League of Rights, the member for Oxley and their kind - the kind of Far Left and Far Right - are running around saying that the MAI is some sort of deathly secret. It just shows how technologically illiterate the member for Kingsford-Smith is, because this MAI draft treaty can be found on the Internet. It is not a secret. It is on the Internet. If you knew how to work the Internet, if you could type in a password and that sort of thing, you might be able to find out something about the MAI rather than running around with what could only be described as a childish scare campaign.Those who think the Labor Party is serious in what it said will reflect on the words of the Deputy Leader of the Labor Party when he was the Minister for Foreign Affairs. When it was said when he was the Minister for Foreign Affairs that treaties should be considered by the parliament, he said, `Treaties shouldn't be subjected to the vagaries of parliament.' The great democrat himself! Ho hum!</DOC>

 - A free employment service will be provided by the government through the new Job Network. It will provide upgraded facilities to all unemployed people, whether they are on benefit or not. Those not on benefit will have access to upgraded facilities through Centrelink. They will have access to a greatly expanded list of job vacancies, they will have access to computers to do their job resumes and they will have access to photocopiers, to faxes and to phones to phone the employer. They will have access also to the vacancies on the touch screens.The providers, the major providers particularly, of the services through the Job Network have been advising us that they will be happy to seek to place the best person in any vacancy that they have, regardless of whether that person is on benefits or not. The facts of the particular case that has been raised by the member for Fremantle I am unaware of and I will look into.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Fisher for his question. The truth of the matter is that Australia's wholesale's sales tax system is unfair and needs to be reformed. At the moment, the wholesale sales tax system has rates of zero, 12, 22, 32, 37, 41 and 45 per cent. There are complications in relation to classifications. There are every  day necessities which are taxed whilst there are extravagances that go untaxed, such as caviar. This is very unfair on those people that are trying to operate the system. As well as that, the wholesale sales tax system imposes costs on our exporters. It imbeds tax into their products which they have to have, increasing their prices when they go out to sell on world markets.That is why this government is in favour of tax reform. We want to make tax fairer in this country. We can only wonder why it was that for 13 years the Australian Labor Party presided over such an unfair system and why they would take no steps to improve its fairness. When the coalition proposed reforming tax in the past, the Labor Party always said that it was too hard and it could not be done. They always said, and they are going to say it again, that they could reduce income taxes without having any changes in relation to indirect tax. We can all remember the deceit of the Australian Labor Party in the 1993 election. Remember when they said they had a policy of reducing income tax? Not just a policy - it was l-a-w, they said before the election, to reduce income tax. After the election, the l-a-w was taken away, and what did they do in relation to indirect taxes? They went into increases for indirect taxes, pushing all rates up from 10 to 12 per cent, from 20 to 22 per cent and from 30 to 32 per cent.I do think there may be a little bit of movement, however, in the Australian Labor Party. I happen to know that there is a new publication circulating in the streets of Dandenong. It is not the Dandenong Journal, it is not the Dandenong Courier; it is a new newspaper which has been founded by the member for Holt. I do not know if you are going to believe this, Mr Speaker, but this new journal published by the member for Holt is called The Gareth. If you get two of them at your house, it is called `The Gareth the Gareth'! It has got on its front page a picture of the member for Holt. It has got on its second page a picture of the member for Holt. On the second page it has also got the member for Holt talking about the fantastic restaurants across the electorate. He says:There are some great budget choices on offer in the Dandenong Central Food Court, where I take every opportunity to work my way through the counters. - Yes. I believe he actually recommends the Caesar salad down there, Mr Speaker. The thing that really caught my attention on the back page of The Gareth  was this advertisement: `If you would like more information on issues such as GST, Gareth Evans can help you.' I think there may be some movement in the Australian Labor Party. We would like Gareth really to help us engage in tax reform, and we would suggest to the progressives of the Australian Labor Party: get on board.</DOC>

 - In answer to your direct question: did I make comment - no. - In answer to the remainder of your question, what we have put in place - in case you have not been observant and  noticed - is a whole system of mechanisms to assist Defence Force spouses find employment. We have published a handbook of assistance. We have put in an Internet terminal which is operated by DCO. We indeed work with difficulties they have in getting registration from one state to another for their qualifications. In other words, there is a whole system of assistance that is put in place. If you would like -  - Thank you, Mr Speaker. I would have thought what the Leader of the Opposition has just shown us is that he is not the slightest bit interested in the welfare of the spouses - not the slightest bit. He is only interested in trying to call some quirky, tricky -  - Thank you, Mr Speaker. I think the Leader of the Opposition protesteth too much. The fact of the matter is that you are clearly not the slightest bit interested in their welfare. Never before have they been catered for so well. Under your lot, let me tell you, nothing was done. Not one thing was done to assist those spouses - not one. Indeed, if I can say, the degree of angst that they had that was left over from your administration -  - You know, Mr Speaker, I can only say about the Leader of the Opposition: if you can't handle the heat, get out of the kitchen. - Do you want another go? - I told you. Your direct question was: did I make comment? I told you, the answer was no. - I have told you that we have put in place an entire range of assistance for spouses of Defence personnel, which you neglected to do when you were indeed in the job. I have told you before, and if you would listen more carefully, never before have Defence Force spouses had more done for them. - Mr Speaker, just to assist again the Leader of the Opposition, who clearly, I would repeat, has absolutely no concern about Defence spouses at all - none - because he makes the comment -  -  - Oh really! - Oh really! -  - Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. In case the opposition again just cannot understand what has been put in place, the Leader of the Opposition says that there is only a screen put in place. I have said that there is a whole package of things that have been put in place for Defence Force personnel. Indeed, the concern which you have about the things that Dr Kemp has put in place, very simply he explained to you in his answer that, where people are either on the dole or not on the dole, they are still entitled to have access to all the programs that he has put in place without a fee. That applies exactly to Defence personnel spouses as well.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Petrie for her question. This government does have a very firm commitment to increasing the number of women in decision making positions in the community and in government. For example, 27.3 per cent of the new appointments in the Senior Executive Service in the public sector last year were women. This is an increase of nearly 15 per cent since our government took office. Since coming to government we have also appointed eight female heads of mission,  and I congratulate my colleague the Minister for Foreign Affairs for that.In government we have a woman as President of the Senate, we have four women ministers and we have three women as parliamentary secretaries. But this government does not believe in quotas. We have done very well without them, and I would draw the House's attention to the vast number of women we have on our benches without the need for quotas. By contrast, Labor stumbles from one failure to another in a mock attempt to get more women into parliament.It is not normally my role to defend people in the Labor Party, but the people of Australia should know the dreadful things that the ALP does to women seeking preselection and trying to stand for positions of office. In the fiasco in the seat of Oxley, Ann Scott is standing for preselection for Labor. But, when push comes to shove, the men in the Labor Party are pushed in and the women are just shoved aside. Ann Scott said on the ABC today:As early as August of last year I was threatened by a very senior member of the opposition front bench that if I did not back off in Oxley, I could expect to have a bucket of muck tipped on me.Some of the blokes in the hierarchy of the Labor party have a great deal of difficulty in preselecting women in winnable seats. And they don't mind women in marginal seats because the women may not win. . . but when it comes to winnable seats, well they want those for their mates.Who is dictating to Ann Scott and the other women in this way? I call on the Leader of the Opposition to name the senior frontbencher who made this outrageous threat. If the opposition leader does not know the name and does not know the person concerned, what is he doing as leader? Who is running the Labor Party? Is it Kim Beazley or is it Gary Gray - or is it the anonymous senior person on the front bench who made this outrageous threat?We have a Labor Party running around the country trying to get people to believe that it is the coalition government that is pushing women back into the home, but I can tell you that it is really the Labor Party's agenda to push women back home. Labor's hypocrisy regarding women is absolutely outrageous.  Labor has a woman who is wanting to give it a go - Ms Scott, in the seat of Oxley - but it is saying, `No. We think you should stay at home as a good, compliant wife; you are just a woman after all.' The people of Australia can now see the true colours of the Labor Party because, when push comes to shove, they push the men in and they shove the women aside.</DOC>

 - The result that we have had for the first year of the introduction of fees for undergraduate places is a very good result for the first year of a new policy. The government has been requested by the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee to continue to pursue that policy and undoubtedly they would have great concern at the Australian Labor Party threatening not to continue that policy. They would be concerned about that for this reason: that it is a very equitable and fair policy which is expanding places in Australian universities for all students. We know that under the Australian Labor Party tens of thousands of students were locked out of university and that Australian students were denied the right of entry to Australian universities on terms which were being offered to overseas students. It was up to this government to restore equity and fairness to Australian students in this matter.One of the important features of the fee policy for undergraduates is that, in a great many cases, when an undergraduate pays a fee for a course, they are vacating a government funded place. That government funded  place is then available to the next student, who may or may not be able to afford a fee paying course. In other words, not only are students able to get their first preference by paying a fee if they are unable to get a government funded place but students who would otherwise be denied access to a university entirely are able to get a place at the university.These basic, simple facts are very difficult to understand for the Australian Labor Party. All it understands is spending more and more of taxpayers' money, as it did when it achieved a situation which locked thousands and thousands of Australian students out of Australian universities.The policy that the government put in place has had an excellent first year. It is achieving more places at Australian universities than ever before. It is worth making the point that total enrolments in Australian universities this year will be higher than ever before. There will be 10,000 more government funded places in Australian universities this year than there were in the last year of the Labor Party government.There were some 53,000 new places in TAFE last year. Traineeships and apprenticeships under the new apprenticeship system are going gang busters - it is a word that has a certain nostalgia about it. There will be more Australian students in post-secondary education and training this year than ever before, and that is because of the very fair, equitable and successful higher education policies which this government has put in place.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Boothby. On that Monday, 5 January, newspapers in the News Ltd stable carried a general story about government actions to freeze Skase assets. It was that day, the one referred to by the member for Boothby, at 11  o'clock, I am told, that Senator Bolkus held the press conference just referred to.What Senator Bolkus told the media then went well beyond what had been carried in the newspapers. He revealed, among other things, the jurisdictions around the world where action was being taken to recover assets. He also read parts of the confidential Federal Court document to the media. He said, as I said yesterday, that he could not give the document out but he would read it off the record.But later that same day part of an affidavit which contained the parts read by Senator Bolkus at the press conference was boxed in the press gallery here. It revealed even more details of action being taken. The question, of course, is: who boxed the document? If Senator Bolkus is taken at his word at the press conference, he could not give it out. But a spokesman for Senator Bolkus told AAP yesterday that the senator merely quoted from a document that was on the public record and he regarded it as being in the public domain. The lack of action on the part of the Leader of the Opposition in relation to Senator Bolkus is reprehensible. I call on the Leader of the Opposition again to stand Senator Bolkus down.</DOC>

My recollection is that prior to Christmas we announced in here some support particularly for remote dwellers in Western Australia to get additional assistance to receive SBS signals. As to the current arrangements with regard to transmission from satellites and Optus, which has a role with the commercial network over there, many of those matters are commercial-in-confidence.

 - This government is committed to ensuring that the Australian Securities Commission works hard on law enforcement and that it has the full support of the government in doing so. In 1997-98, the ASC had over $100 million in its budget to ensure the proper enforcement of Corporations Law. It had some significant wins for investors, most notably the proceedings brought against Permanent Trustee Australia and its guarantor for $100 million.It is not an easy task for the ASC to enforce Australia's corporate law. The ASC is still trying to clean up some of the actions from the 1980s in defence of Australian shareholders. It is of no help whatsoever to the ASC or to law enforcement proceedings if there are people in Australia who are prepared to compromise confidential court matters. Senator Bolkus, the shadow Attorney-General, went before a media conference on 5 January 1998 and disclosed the fact that proceedings were being undertaken not only in Australia but also in Spain, London and the Cayman Islands in relation to the Skase assets.Max Donnelly, the person who is charged with administering that estate for the benefit of creditors, said:Of all the information that's been made available to the media, the affidavit material is the most damaging.That is what he said about the disclosures of Senator Bolkus to the Australian media on 5 January 1998. This is Labor's shadow Attorney-General. I repeat:Of all the information that's been made available to the media, the affidavit material is the most damaging.It is a lame excuse in the extreme for Senator Bolkus or his statement, as is quoted on AAP, to say:I've done nothing wrong. I merely quoted from a document that was on the public record.That document was not on the public record. The Federal Court of Australia, New South Wales Registry, wrote to Senator Amanda Vanstone on 5 March 1998, making it clear that affidavits in court proceedings can only be released upon a court order and making it clear that there was no court order for the release of the affidavits in that case.Here we have Senator Bolkus first of all reading it to the media, then saying it was on the public record when the facts were that it was not. And, what is worse, he knew this was not on the public record. He knew it was not on the public record because he said, `I can't give this document out.' It was an admission by him that he knew it was not a public document and, what is more, that he should not have got it out. He went on to read from that document, which made it entirely clear that the publication of the matters concerned would be prejudicial. Listen to the words he read from the document:If this matter comes to the attention of the respondents, and in particular the attention of Mr Skase before the interlocutory orders can be obtained in all jurisdictions, I have serious concerns that steps will be taken to prejudice the substantive proceedings.That is what he read. In other words, he was saying that the disclosure of this material will prejudice the proceedings and off the record here it is. There is no doubt whatsoever what happened. There is a photograph of the man  who would be the first law officer of the Crown under a Labor government saying, `I can't give this document out but maybe if I just read it off the record, this is the proceedings of the court.' The would-be first law officer of the Crown stands condemned by his own words.But this is now much bigger than him. I say to the Leader of the Opposition: if you want to lead, you have got to show strength. This is a great test for you. You have to call Senator Bolkus in and say, `As the first would-be law officer of the Crown, I demand your resignation.' Nothing else will suffice to show your leadership or lack thereof. This is the great test for the Leader of the Opposition.You do not have to go back far enough to remember in this place the then Labor government baying for the resignation of the present Minister for Defence because - remember it - an envelope which had come into his office was opened by a member of his staff. They came in here one by one and they said that the now Minister for Defence had to resign as a shadow minister. He had the decency to do it too. Senator Bolkus does not have the decency to do it. You have just one decent thing to do: call him in and demand his resignation.</DOC>

 - We prepared a PPQ on this matter because yesterday morning on AM  Mr John Coombes was interviewed. He said in his interview in relation to something that  we were happy to provide to the Sydney Morning Herald :There'll be some questions to be answered in parliament for sure.The MUA, the organ grinder. Having said there will be questions to answer, up jumps - it would be unparliamentary, wouldn't it, to say what the member for Melbourne is in relation to John Coombes? This is pathetic.My department issues 25,000 urgent passports a year. That is around 500 a week. They clearly get dozens and dozens of phone calls, as does my office. Of course people ring the office of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and say, `How do I get an urgent passport?' Do you know what we do? We refer them to the department and the department issues an urgent passport, and that is how efficient we are. To give credit where it is due - and, Mr Speaker, you know I always do - the previous government had the same system as well.After your pathetic little Dubai game, I did check with my office to find out whether they knew anything about these applications. No-one in my office had any recollection. On the other hand, it is perfectly possible that someone rang my office and asked how they could get an urgent passport and my office would have told them how to. Big deal! What an extraordinary thing.I was not in the parliament during that week when it was raised by the opposition. I was in Ottawa signing the land mines treaty, doing something your government never did - that is, committing Australia to ban land mines - and you were asking questions about some Dubai training exercise. So I was not able to answer the question I would have been asked had I been here. But I will say now that the first time I ever heard of this little exercise of training waterfront workers in Dubai or wherever it was that you got so excited about - it was not even illegal; it is not that exciting - was when I got a report in Ottawa that the Labor Party had gone feral about something of no consequence whatsoever. That is the answer. We receive 25,000 applications a year for urgent passports, and my department delivers.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker -  - Thank you, Mr Speaker, for your attentiveness and interest in small business policy. I thank the member for his question. The government has announced a whole series of policy reforms for the benefit of the small business community. The capital gains tax reform, for example, is a tremendous incentive back in place for the small business community. We have cut the number of unfair dismissal applications by half in the federal system. That is a huge benefit for a lot of people in the small business community. We fixed up the $10 billion deficit we inherited from the previous government, with the Labor Party now committed to going on a spending spree and putting up their interest rates again. That is another benefit which we provided to the small business community and which we have given great priority to.In the amendments to the Trade Practices Act which we have announced, we have also introduced a protection for small business against unconscionable conduct. This concept of providing for the small business community the same protections against big business that consumers have is an idea that has been proposed for something like 20 years. It took the election of a coalition government to put together a committee under the chairmanship of the member for Bendigo, Bruce Reid, and his colleagues to go to the small business community, to identify their concerns, to report back to government and then to have the government in an expeditious way come to one of the most significant policy decisions made by any government post World War II, and certainly in the last 20 years, and that is the policy commitment to introduce a law to provide protection for small business against unconscionable conduct.What a contrast that makes to the failures of the previous Labor government, of which the Leader of the Opposition was a principal member. During all their years in government not only did they dismiss the interests of small business but they spent a lot of time dealing with a lot of people representing big business. If you look back particularly over the late 1980s when there were a lot of large-scale bankruptcies in Australia by certain well-known big business people, you will see they were the associates of the then Labor government.It can hardly be a surprise that some of these people defrauded literally thousands of small businesses. One of the legacies of Labor's time in office was a high level of bankruptcies amongst small business. Not only did Labor give comfort to those practices - because there was a failure to amend the Trade Practices Act - but when you had people like Skase going bust this government basically sat silent and idle as he was able to leave the country with the assets of the small business community.I must say that those in the small business community are angry indeed that this Leader of the Opposition sits there while one of his frontbenchers, the alternate first law officer of the Commonwealth, by his actions still provides protection to his little mate Skase. I say on behalf of the small business community, as their representative within the government and the cabinet, the small business community is angry and demands that you deal with Senator Bolkus, Skase's little mate. It is an absolute outrage that we now find the confidential documents on a court file being released by this man who claims to be the alternate Commonwealth law officer -  - And as I conclude, he also recognises his guilt when he says, `I can't give this document out but maybe if I just read it out off the record.' That is sleazy, deceptive, misleading and reckless in the interests -  - of the small business community. He deserves to be condemned, and so does this Leader of the Opposition who never lifted a finger for the small business community and now protects a person who is defending Mr Skase overseas.</DOC>

 - The question relates to what is known as annual recurrent funding. The Aged Care Act that was passed last year was contributed to by views from the industry. They knew when they entered into it that they had to make a choice between taking the ARF money or the accommodation charge. What some are now saying is that they want to have both. Clearly, the law that they contributed to putting in place was known to them at the time they made those choices. I have said to them that I will discuss those matters with them. I have also indicated that the technical reference group that I set up two weeks ago, chaired by an independent party, and on which the nursing home proprietors and the consumers have representatives, will also discuss that matter as a matter of priority and urgency, and they will report back to me in due course.As to the matter of nursing home proprietors not getting access, that is obviously denied. They know that is not to be regarded as accurate in any way. There has been one particular spokesman who has been somewhat outrageous in his claims, and he can be expected to get treatment from my office the way that he treats us.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Robertson for his question. I know that he is very concerned about the misrepresentations being made by the Australian Education Union. In his local paper the Sun Weekly  I notice that Australian Education Union members at Umina High School along with union members elsewhere in Australia have been running a shameless and irresponsible campaign of misinformation - its mouthpiece in this House, the member for Werriwa, has been running a similar campaign - that the government is running down funding to government schools and is transferring funding into non-government schools.These claims by the Australian Education Union and the member for Werriwa and the Labor Party are totally wrong. Let me kill these claims stone dead. Total Commonwealth funding for government schools this year, 1998, is $127 million higher than it was in Labor's last year of 1996. In Tasmania government funding is up $3.7 million more than Labor. In South Australia funding for government schools is $7 million. - Government funding for government schools in Tasmania is $3.7 million more this year than it was under the Labor government. In South Australia it is $7 million more, in Western Australia it is $14.5 million more, in Queensland it is $28 million more, in Victoria it is $28 million more and  in New South Wales it is $41 million more. That is extra money in the bank for government schools. It is more money for government schools.From the budget as a whole, government schools will be receiving $2 billion more than they would have received had we held funding at the levels of the last year of the Labor government. What this demonstrates is the government's unwavering commitment to quality education for all Australian children. - You may not like the truth. We have seen that in your comments in other policy areas in question time today. Even more important, the extra money that the government is spending is being supported by policies which actually address the needs of students in government schools. Literacy standards are being improved. A pathway is being built for the 70 per cent of students not going on to university. Schools are being encouraged to help their school leavers get jobs. Increased choice is being provided for parents in low income schools. That is a great contrast with the situation that we found when we came to office - a situation for which the Leader of the Opposition, who was minister for education between 1991 and 1993, bears responsibility. - At that time, Mr Speaker, a third of Australian school children could not read properly. The Leader of the Opposition failed as minister for education. He failed as Minister for Finance, he failed as minister for employment and he is now failing as opposition leader because he will not take action against his shadow Attorney-General, Senator Bolkus.</DOC>

 - I strongly stand by what I have previously said on this matter both outside the parliament and inside the parliament. I would add, with regard to the electorate allocations, individual Natural Heritage Trust projects were identified by electorate by departments only for the purpose of announcing successful projects. This was a common practice under the previous government. Electorate information was never made available, I am advised, to the Minister for the Environment, Senator Hill, or to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Anderson, until the announcement stage had been reached. That is not an unreasonable circumstance and I would remind the House that for argument's sake, with regard to Tasmania, who got the majority of allocations in respect of Tasmania? Sixty per cent went to the Labor held electorate represented by the member for Lyons.</DOC>

 - The House would be aware, I think, that good economic policy in Australia is providing benefits to small business and to home buyers and to those who are dependent on lower interest rates, including those in the Hunter. I am sure that in the Hunter home buyers, who are taking advantage of 6½ per cent interest rates, will be very proud that they have been given the opportunity to take advantage of the government's good policies. If the Labor Party could have done it, they would have done it. The fact that they did not do it meant that they could not do it. I am sure that those people in the Hunter will be very concerned and very interested to hear the Labor Party threatening Australia with a return to the days of deficit and debt.A Labor Party re-election means high deficit, high debt, high interest rates, lower economic growth, growing unemployment and, as a result of the release of the labour force figures today, which show the unemployment rate at 8.1 per cent for the month of January, we can say that unemployment in Australia is now at its lowest since 1990 - the lowest in seven years. I think even members of the Labor Party would be happy to see that unemployment is as low as it is. - As I said earlier, the benefits of the government's economic policy are there for all to see. Part of that, as the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business said earlier, is ensuring that Australia has a very good system of business regulation, that Australia has a very well ordered  securities commission which can deliver certainty to small business to make investment decisions.I think all Australians would be appalled with the actions of any person who interfered with the administration of Australia's proper securities law, and I think that this is a matter of such import to this House that I seek leave to move	a motion of censure.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, I want to take the opportunity of saying to the Leader of the Opposition that the new arrangements will provide to job seekers unrivalled services that they have never had before. These represent once again a major reform. They represent a new and better approach.There is a very systematic attempt under way, and it was in evidence again on Saturday in the Sydney Morning Herald when an attempt was made to say that there is going to be a squeeze on the long-term unemployed.  It is very relevant to the question asked by the Leader of the Opposition. - They can be looking for a long time. - Mr Speaker, the article suggested that job seekers would be charged a fee. I want to quote not from a statement made by a colleague but rather from a statement made by the managing director of Employment National. Employment National is only the privatised arm of the Commonwealth Employment Service. They sneer over there, but this is an organisation that has forgotten more about finding jobs for people than you have ever known. - Drawing on the statement made by the managing director of Employment National, the facts are these: Employment National will be encouraging all job seekers - and that includes the people referred to by the Leader of the Opposition - whether on benefits or not, to register with Employment National for job placement services.Let me spell it out in case the Leader of the Opposition does not understand it. It means that the 50,000 married women to whom he referred are included in that description. That has always been the situation and, if he had not deliberately distorted it and tried to mislead the married women of Australia in  the way he has tried to do, then some of these articles would not have appeared.Secondly, Employment National went on to say:Employers will not and should not know whether a candidate is on benefits or not. Employment National is committed to finding the best person for each job vacancy. If fees are to be paid by employers, it will be for services we provide and will not be determined by whether or not the job seeker is on benefits. - `Not much', he says. This is only the managing director. The old hatchet man from the ACTU has destroyed more jobs than most of us have had. The hatchet man from the ACTU says, `Not much'.It concludes, rather resoundingly and comprehensively:No job seeker, whether or not on benefits, will be charged a fee. - If I were the Leader of the Opposition - Mr 11½ per cent unemployment, Mr 32 per cent youth unemployment - would not be running around talking about unemployment. He has no credibility on the subject.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, I know all members of the House will be continuing to feel deep concern about the deterioration which has taken place in the Indonesian economy. I know that those who concern themselves about the future of that country will be anxious that it secures not only greater economic stability but also greater political stability in the weeks and months ahead.The fall in the value of the rupiah has had very significant adverse consequences for ordinary Indonesians. We want - and I know that all members of this House want - a strong, stable and prosperous Indonesia. We believe, in order to achieve that, not only the  involvement of the International Monetary Fund but also Indonesia's strong commitment to an effective program of help by the International Monetary Fund is necessary.But, on behalf of the government, I want to make it clear that we believe that the International Monetary Fund package must be implemented with care and sensitivity towards the impact of that package on social stability and social cohesion within Indonesia. We do understand the concern of the Indonesian government to stabilise the rupiah and, over the past two weeks, I have discussed the matter with the Prime Minister of Singapore and with the President of the World Bank, particularly in the context of organising food aid for Indonesia.My colleague the Treasurer has been in touch with the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, and I have also written again on the subject to President Clinton, the Prime Minister of Japan, Mr Hashimoto, and to President Suharto himself. I hope that the IMF review can be quickly concluded and that a productive partnership between the IMF and the new Indonesian government can be developed as quickly as possible.As honourable members will know, Australia has responded sensibly and effectively to what has happened in the Asia-Pacific region. We are the only OECD country along with Japan to have participated in the three IMF rescue packages for Thailand, Korea and Indonesia. We agreed in February of this year that EFIC could provide insurance cover for exports to Indonesia on a case by case basis drawing on the national interest account.In the context of that, I announce today that the government has approved EFIC providing up to $380 million insurance cover for the balance of Australia's wheat sales to Indonesia this year on the national interest account. This step has been taken of course to help an Australian exporter. It will secure Australian jobs, but it will also be of benefit to the ordinary people of Indonesia. These arrangements are subject to a sovereign guarantee from Indonesia and discussions on that sovereign guarantee are under way at present. Practical support for the Indonesian people, and that includes ensuring food supplies, is one of the principal objectives of our policy. We have a national interest in a secure Indonesia. We have a national interest in a cohesive, stable Indonesia. We therefore have a national interest in a rescue package for Indonesia which pays proper account for the obvious need of the Indonesian people to have access to plentiful supplies of food at affordable prices.A rescue package that does not accommodate that very legitimate concern is a rescue package that is going to impose unreasonable strains upon the ordinary members of Indonesia's society. I wish the people of Indonesia well in their enormous difficulties. I know that the ordinary people of that very populous and important country carry the goodwill and the good thoughts of all members of this parliament whatever their political complexion.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Canning for her question. The fact of the matter is that reforming superannuation arrangements and their treatment upon a dissolution of marriage will be of enormous benefit to women in Australia. Superannuation is increasingly becoming a major asset of families and a major asset which should be properly and justly disposed of in the situation of a dissolution of marriage.Whilst superannuation is being more often recognised in property settlements arising from marriage breakdown today, it is being done in an incomplete and unsatisfactory way. There is no consistent way of putting a value on superannuation. Nor is there a simple way of apportioning in relation to particularly defined benefits schemes. There is no mechanism to divide superannuation between spouses if they should decide that this would be the best outcome. - Prior to the 1996 election, the coalition promised to examine the treatment of superannuation following the dissolution of marriage. I can report that the coalition has kept that promise and the coalition announced, by way of a speech from the Prime Minister on Sunday, a very important reform in this area.We will be guided by six principles in relation to this: that superannuation should be taken into account in division; that there should be clear rules; that parties should be encouraged to settle their own affairs; that the treatment should be consistent with the broader goals of retirement income policy; that the reforms should minimise the complexity and cost; and that the reforms should be conducted in a fair and just way. The government will be developing a position paper based on these principles to be released in the coming months. Last week I wrote to the state governments concerning this matter and also wrote to interested key constituencies such as the Australian Superannuation Funds Association.These reforms will be of particular benefit to Australian women because it is Australian women who now have the opportunity in relation to that very large asset to have clear lines, clear rules, the opportunity to settle that up in the dissolution of a marriage. However, I also point out that the reforms will work both ways and will also be available to men on the dissolution of a marriage where the superannuation should be a major asset of the ex-wife concerned. The issue will be considered alongside family law property reforms generally. These are being developed by the Attorney-General. This is an overdue and welcome reform, and it took a coalition government to do it.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, if I may say so, I think those remarks are very well taken. The questioner is referring to a particular contractor who has only recently been informed that he has obtained a contract. That contractor has passed not only the financial viability checks but also the quality checks and is, contrary to incorrect statements made by the opposition in the media, of experience in helping unemployed people. He has, as I informed the House last week, a registered business name. Like many other people who have recently been informed that they have contracts - large and small providers - he is, as I understand it, in the process of setting up his facilities. He is not required to have those facilities in place at the date of the awarding of the contract. He is required to have those facilities in place on 1 May when services commence.One of the great features of the tender round which has just been completed and of which the results have been announced is that, like this particular tenderer, there are many in the tender round who are new providers in this market because the government has been determined to break out of the traditional club of providers to find the very best people in Australia to help unemployed people. Our responsibilities are to unemployed people. They are not to particular organisations; they are to ensure that unemployed people get the best option.</DOC>

 - As we examine the situation facing rural and regional Australia, I pause for a moment to reflect on the tremendous and horrific circumstances faced by those in northern Australia so far this year at Townsville, Katherine and also now around Burketown and Normanton from the deluge. The federal government is supplying the Royal Australian Air Force and elements thereof for national disasters relief. I highlight this because they have so many concerns out there at this moment and we are doing our best to deal with them.What has now been revealed though over the last two weeks is an extraordinary deal by elements of the Labor Party and elements of the elite Aboriginal leadership group known as the A-team to gag Father Frank Brennan, Jesuit priest - no mean feat, dare I say, in  gagging a Jesuit priest. But, nevertheless, they have gone down that particular path. - Happily, Mr Speaker. What we now have is the exposure of a Labor Party plot which is simply to use Wik and abuse Wik with regard to partisan political advantage in every way, shape and form. - The question, of which I just happen to have a copy, refers to the attitude taken by groups -  - I am honest. I am not denying that. The question refers to the attitude taken by groups in the community and the impact on rural and regional Australia. That is clearly in order and I will give my answer in that order. - Thank you, Mr Speaker. Let me quote in respect of the letter Father Frank Brennan wrote to Peter Yu on 13 January after being told to be silent. He said:As you head down a double dissolution path, be assured of my cooperation through my silence from here on in.  - The comparison is clear-cut when you turn to the next quote. - You don't like it because your shabby deal has been exposed. You might try to silence Frank Brennan, but you won't silence me. - You big bullies! - What we now know is that, as the Prime Minister's efforts to reach an agreement for rural and regional Australia with regard to the 10-point plan and native title were beginning to show success with stakeholders, the Labor Party decided to move the goalposts. - Happily, Mr Speaker. I will do so by one further quote which is  very relevant and brings this matter entirely together as to why people want a fair deal from Wik and why our legislation should be backed in that regard. I refer to the article in the Eureka Street  magazine written by Father Brennan when he said:Despite the populist appeal of this Labor amendment, the opposition parties should back down in the interests of certainty, justice and workability for all stakeholders.</DOC>

 - The government, as it has amply demonstrated over the last two years, is strongly committed to the protection of privacy and to the provision of access to documents under the FOI Act when contracting out any functions. To this end, on Thursday last week the government introduced the Privacy  Amendment  Bill  1998  into  this  House. The bill amends the Privacy Act to extend its coverage to all contractors who hold personal information for the purposes of providing services outsourced by the government. All private sector organisations providing employment market services under contract will be covered by the amendments and will be required to comply with the information privacy principles contained in the act.If individuals believe their privacy has been interfered with by an employment service, they will be able to complain to the Privacy Commissioner. She will be able to investigate, conciliate and, if necessary, make a determination awarding compensation or other remedies. In addition, contractors, including employment market services, will be part of the Privacy Commissioner's audit program.During the drafting of the bill, the Privacy Commissioner's office was consulted and its comments were taken into account. It would appear that the Deputy Privacy Commissioner's comments were taken out of context or misquoted. As he would be well aware, the bill places the new employment services in the same position as the government agencies. In fact, I have been provided with a letter from the Deputy Privacy Commissioner dated today. - Mr Speaker, I will not take the time of the House to read the letter, but the effect of the letter is that the Deputy Privacy Commissioner pointed out that what he said to the reporter was that the new private sector employment services would not be directly covered by the Privacy Act; they would in fact be covered by this new bill. Could I just mention something. Last year, the Reform of Employment Services Bill 1997 was passed by this House and sent to the  Senate where it was emasculated by a combination of the Labor Party and the Democrats. - It was emasculated by amendment. - That contained express, specific provisions relating to privacy protection that, by your actions, you prevented being law already. - Part of them are. - I table what I was reading from, Mr Speaker.</DOC>

 - Last Friday, 6 March, Senator Bolkus told the 7.30 Report  that what he had been caught reading to the media at his January press conference was only two pages of a 30-page affidavit. It is curious that he thinks reading only part of a confidential document would in any way lessen the seriousness of the improper behaviour. Coincidently, the two pages Senator Bolkus read from were the same two pages that were boxed in the press gallery later that day. Curiously, the pages that were boxed in the gallery had certain sentences highlighted and these were the very same sentences Senator Bolkus read to the media.What is the defence that Labor put up to this charge of improper behaviour? The Leader of the Opposition defended Senator Bolkus last week by asserting, with no evidence, that it was Senator Vanstone's office which had leaked the affidavit. At that time, Senator Vanstone's office had not had the affidavit. How could they leak it? In fact, the document Senator Bolkus read to the media was a document of such confidentiality that a Federal Court order was required to allow anyone not directly involved with it to have it. The Federal Court has notified the government, as was pointed out last week, that no such order had been sought and no such order had been made.The Deputy Leader of the Opposition defended Senator Bolkus by saying that all the information in the leaked article was in the Daily Telegraph article of the same day. The member for Holt went on to say:Then this article went to the location of the assets. We are told that there was a lot of significant material in the affidavit about that. Maybe there was, but it was already here in this particular article, which said - and it referred to where Skase was reputed to have bank accounts. Either the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has misled the House or he cannot read a newspaper. The article simply did not detail the location of the assets being sought. In fact, it stated:The proportion or location of Skase's hidden fortune which has been identified has not been revealed. - I will table it. - By their statements, the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition reveal that Senator Bolkus has no defence.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Curtin for his question, and I welcome him back to the House of Representatives in this new session. Normally speaking, the question of whether or not costs would be deductible would depend on whether they went to capital or whether they were determined to be of an income nature. That would certainly be the application of the current taxation law. It would vary, I would imagine, according to the nature of the business that was engaged in and the nature of the remedial work.Having said that, I think it is proper that the government does take the decision on this. The honourable member for Curtin will know that the government has established a very high powered committee, and ministerial responsibility for that is with the Minister for Finance and Administration and the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism. One of the terms of reference of that committee is to look at the taxation consequences and make recommendations to the government, which I will be very happy to receive.

 - I thank the member for Bowman for her question. There is no doubt that, in circumstances where a big business goes bust and the attempts to recover moneys from the residue of such a business are thwarted, the people who suffer are those many thousands of small businesses which simply do not have the legal resources to chase the Skases of this world. That is why those small business operators really are reliant on the `system' - that is, government and the appropriate agencies - taking the appropriate action to ensure that funds are recovered.In this particular case, a lot of small businesses were impacted and suffered as a result of the fraud and associated activities of Mr Skase. For example, one small business was owed $1,700 for catering services. That business eventually, presumably for a number of reasons, went bankrupt, but they were not helped by a system where the Skases of this world are not properly pursued with the full might of the law. Another business - a chauffer and hire car company - was owed $1,859. It is now in liquidation, no thanks to the failure of the previous government to chase Mr Skase. Then there is the secretarial service which was owed $1,733.40 and the gallery which was owed $5,465.These are small amounts and, from the opposition's point of view, a small amount is nothing when it comes to looking after one of their mates. If one of their mates has been protecting Christopher Skase, they think their obligation is to protect that mate - in this case, Senator Bolkus - instead of standing up for the small business community that deserves a system which will see every effort undertaken to bring these people to book.The Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition have form on these issues. They are both pattern protectors. They were the defence legal team for Mal Colston when they were two new members and ministers back in the early 1980s. They were the two who buried the Colston affair. Now we find they are protecting Senator Bolkus. They are doing so by standing up in the House, as they did last week,  and misleading the House about the facts and the circumstances. To show you how low these people will go: they were making allegations that the minister had the affidavit, when her office did not even have the affidavit. I can assure the Leader of the Opposition and his sidekick the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that the small business community is very angry at your failure to deal with Senator Bolkus, and they will continue to remind you of it.</DOC>

 - The reason why the country is in difficulty with regard to funding for nursing homes is that the opposition had 13 years to address the issue. - I can well appreciate why they are so sensitive, because  this is the graph that tells the story. That is your neglect. That is why people in this country -  - As I was saying, it is absolutely necessary because of your neglect to address the need for capital needs in nursing homes. The accommodation charges I have indicated over the four-year period provide the same amount of money as was required by the Gregory benchmarks. These funds will be applied by nursing homes to the capital upgrades. I have announced an additional $20 million -  - There seems to be a fundamental misunderstanding by the opposition. The money raised by daily fees goes to nursing homes; it does not go to the government. It goes to upgrading nursing homes because of your neglect. The range of other matters that I have announced already for the benefit of the aged in this country improved markedly their position compared with what you did in the 13 years you had to look after the aged in this community. -  - You know that this confected indignation and outrageous interjections are all to do with politics, nothing to do with caring for the aged in this community.</DOC>

 - I have seen a media release put out by the HIA - I did not know it was centred in the electorate of Parramatta; may it long be centred in that electorate - headed `Builder confidence grows as housing sales rise'. Isn't that good news for the Australian economy! I think all members of this House will be pleased to see the housing industry in a very positive state in a very positive economic climate. The HIA noted:Australia's home builders are confident they can defy the Asian financial fallout. They reveal that 41 per cent of all builders recorded higher sales over the six months to December and 49 per cent of builders expect higher sales in the first half of 1998. I think all members of the House would be pleased to see the home building industry growing and optimistic. It went on:19 per cent of builders say they are likely to hire more workers compared to only 4 per cent anticipating a reduction in employment.So we have an optimistic home building industry and good prospects for more jobs, together with today's ANZ job advertisements. Again, I think both sides of the House will be pleased to see that the number of ANZ job advertisements went up 5.1 per cent in February. I see the Deputy Leader of the Opposition shaking his head and looking mournful about the fact that there are now greater opportunities for job seekers in Australia. Let me make it clear: as far as the coalition is concerned, an increase in the number of jobs is a good thing. We actually welcome it. This is the party that believes in employment opportunities for the Australian public. We actually think it is a good thing to see the housing industry on a positive basis.Housing affordability, which is at an all time record, has been led by a policy of low interest rates. On this side of the House, we like giving young people the opportunity to buy their own home and to have low interest rates. Since March of last year, the standard variable interest rate - which has gone down to 6.7 per cent - has meant that an average family on the average Australian mortgage of $100,000 would now be saving $300 a month in interest payments. Young families have the opportunity to get into their own homes because of the low inflation and low interest rate policy of this government. But it cannot be produced out of nothing.There is a risk, if people support the Labor Party at the next election, that interest rates would go right back to where they were. Under a Labor government, that would mean you would be paying $300 a month more on your mortgage. Under a Labor government, rather than being 6.7 per cent, interest rates would be right up there where they were when Australia's worst ever financial minister left the Australian economy - back at 10½ per cent. And he thought that was a great success because he was coming off a 17 per cent mortgage interest rate!Mr Speaker, they have not learned a thing. They are still up here - and listen to the member for Jagajaga; she'll do it in a moment - promising money they do not have to everybody who has ears to listen, running the Australian budget out into deficit, climbing up debt, pushing out inflation and, worst of all for the young people of Australia, pushing up interest rates again. The young people of Australia have had the benefit of a low inflation, low interest rate environment and this side of the House intends to keep it that way.</DOC>

 - No, we have not changed our policy. The accommodation charges go to the capital upgrading, as does the additional $20 million which I have previously announced, also the $10 million dollar, and the daily fees go directly to nursing homes, as the member for Jagajaga knows. What the opposition has to do is start to explain to the Australian people why they did not do anything for 13 years and what they are going to do for the future of people in nursing homes in this country, 65 per cent of whom are full pensioners? We have not heard a constructive piece of policy from the opposition. There was nothing at their convention in Hobart, and I listened very carefully. All there was was the intimation -  - As I was about to say, how are you going to fund the needs of the aged in this country? As I revealed in question time just before we broke for Christmas -  - As I was saying, the needs of the aged in the nursing homes sector in this country are catered for by the policy prescriptions put forward by this government and have been articulated and continue to be articulated by myself as the minister. The question I want answered is: how are you going to fund the needs of the aged in this country? As I was saying, just prior to Christmas we saw one of the leading Victorian MPs announce that he thought a death duty should be applied. Is that how you are going to fund it? You have said nothing. You are playing politics. - Mr Speaker, I think I have made my point. The funds that are generated by the accommodation charge go to correcting the wrongs that you delivered to the sector and the daily fees go to the nursing homes. You have done nothing, you have announced nothing and you are playing cheap politics with the aged of this country.</DOC>

 - I am aware of the decision in the Federal Court. At the present time, we are considering whether it should be the subject of an appeal. For that reason, I have to exercise some care in relation to the comments that I might make. - One of your colleagues has seen fit to comment, and I will refer to that as I go through my answer. Let me make it very clear that I am very concerned about any decision that allows a non-citizen who has been convicted for possession of almost 1½ kilograms of heroin with a street value of over $3 million to remain in Australia preying upon the children of Australian families.My advice is that the arguments in this case are linked with the rights of an applicant's child as they relate to the Convention on the Rights of the Child - in other words, the rights of an applicant's child in Australia, but not the rights of Australian children generally. Yet we have Senator Bolkus quoted as saying on behalf of the opposition that this is a `government bungle'. Let me make it very clear: this is a matter that this government has been desirous of seeing fixed in several ways. The matters are before the Senate now. You have the capacity to show whether or not you are on side in dealing with these issues by the way in which you respond to this legislation. I do not want to go outside my own area, but the Attorney-General's bill -  - Yes, I will. But the Attorney-General's bill that deals with the administrative decisions, the Administrative Decisions (Effect of International Instruments) Bill 1997 , is one that you could give support for. It is one that you supported when you were in government. It is one you have walked away from on the basis that you are  now arguing that Teoh's case was not going to have any effect on administrative decision making.You can also support the legislation that will enable us to deal with the whole range of character issues, which you opened up when you amended the Immigration Act to take away from the government the onus of the issue of the applicant's character. You can put that back if you are prepared to agree to that legislation. Finally, you have the legislation dealing with the privative clause. If you are going to leave the decisions in relation to these matters in the hands of the courts, you will continue to have difficulties of this sort - on and on.</DOC>

 - The surprising thing about questions on after school hours care is that the recent changes that have been announced -  -  - It would be of interesting for members, and particularly the opposition, to listen to this. The interesting thing about questions about the affordability  of those who are using after school hours care - which is one of the range of options for parents to access for care of their children - is that for the first time in this government's tenure, and indeed in this country's history, parents will have access to the child-care assistance regime. It will be available to those who are utilising those services from 27 April. - Why don't you let me finish for a change? The reason this is being done, as honourable members would know, is that a pilot study was started some two years ago, under your government, as to what was the best way to deliver assistance to those parents who were utilising those services - because they previously did not get that assistance. We decided, on seeing the completion of those pilot studies, that the best way to do this was to offer child-care assistance. From 27 April, 51,000 families who previously got no assistance are now going to get access to assistance. The reason is that the money goes directly to the parents. You know, in social policy terms, that it is far better for that money to be in the hands of the parents. That is why we did it. It was a pilot scheme that you started; you would have come to the same conclusion, because it is possessed of equity. It is the far better way to deliver these  after school hours services to Australian families. - No, you should listen. The other thing to remember about after school hours care in this country is that it is the least sophisticated of the delivery mechanisms for child care, because it is the smallest. There are a variety of after school hours care services in this country. They came to me and said, `We need some assistance in administering these new arrangements.' We provided them initially with $12 million. Only two weeks ago I provided a further $8 million to help them. I said I would keep it under review -  - to make sure that they could administer these arrangements for the benefit of Australian parents. As to the matter of the fees, because the arrangements have changed, there will be a higher level of administration required of after school hours care. That is why they are being provided with an additional $20 million. That is on direct representation and support of the after school hours care sector. You're sitting here and misrepresenting the facts has a direct analogy with what you are trying to do in aged care - trying to scare the old people of this country. Now, through misrepresentation and dodgy surveys which your political mates are putting into circulation, you are trying to scare the parents who are seeking quality child care.We are committed to quality child care in this country. Finally, on 19 November in this place you asked a question about child care - the only other question you have ever asked about child care - and wasn't it ironic? It was the day after you supported the new child-care act in this place. You are a bunch of hypocrites.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Longman for his question. There are reports in the press today of discussions going on between the Maritime Union of Australia and Patricks - one of Australia's two leading stevedoring companies - about terms and conditions in the Sydney operations of Patricks. It is also quite clear that the MUA is intending to take industrial action later this week. It has already given advance warning that it will be taking 48-hour strike action on Wednesday and Thursday. I think anybody who has followed this dispute will appreciate that the real reason for the MUA taking action  at the end of the week is that it is just a payback for the fact that Patricks acted in its business interests in subleasing part of its property at Webb Dock. This is a campaign of vengeance by the union which is attempting to undermine the right of a business to go about its lawful business. That matter was the subject of a commission hearing, where the union had a chance to put its point of view, and they were ordered back to work by the Industrial Relations Commission. Then the matter was again in the Victorian Supreme Court. The MUA had an opportunity to say what it wanted to say, to put its case. The judge said that the damage was alarming and that the industrial action taken by the MUA was unjustified. He granted an injunction to the benefit of Patricks to keep that business going.This latest attempt by the MUA is nothing other than industrial thuggery of the sort we have long seen from this union. Sadly, it is supported by the silence of the Labor opposition who, when in government, were never able to actually address these issues. They oversaw the spending of $420 million and we still have the rorts and inefficiencies on the Australian waterfront that are costing Australians jobs, costing us export income and other opportunities. In the latest Bulletin, No. 33 - which should be in members' offices by the end of the day and will shortly be on the Internet - we have the latest rort which is being defended by the Labor Party. It says:At Patrick's Newcastle there is an Enterprise Communications committee designed to improve company employee communications. The committee is supposed to meet during idle time.Currently in Newcastle, idle time - namely, when there are no ships in port - is about 67 per cent. In other words, the employees are working less than two days a week and having the rest off on full pay. That actually is not my rort for the day, because I have raised that particular issue before. The Bulletin goes on to say:The rort has to do with the grandly titled Enterprise Communications Committee.The Newcastle wharfies recently refused to attend the committee meeting unless they were paid an extra quarter day off and an $11.20 meal allowance.  There is no end to the rorts and the rip-offs on the Australian waterfront. Labor had 13 years to do something about it and failed to do so. And this week, whilst we have industrial thuggery in the port of Sydney, these people, the opposition, who are tied hand and foot to the MUA, cannot even speak up in the national interest against rorts of that sort.</DOC>

 - Why do we call him Kylie Minogue? I should be so lucky! Here is the Australian Labor Party reminding us that indirect taxes can be put up. Do we need any reminding? - Were we all here in 1993 when we heard Mr Keating say, `What I am promising is not to put up tax'? - Did we hear him talk about his income tax, which was not a promise? It was? - Were we here after the 1993 election when we saw the Labor Party take the wholesale sales tax rate, which was 10 per cent, and make it 12 per cent? Did we see them take the 20 per cent rate and make it 22 per cent? Did we see the l-a-w disappear as a big l-i-; I am not allowed to say that, Mr Speaker! That is a question which is worthy of publication in the next edition of `The Gareth' and, if he does not do it, I will.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Riverina for his question. What I would like to draw attention to is that we do in fact owe thanks to the member for Batman. As a result of his earlier question today and remarks that he has been reported as making in the media, we immediately know what the truth of any matter is: it is the opposite of what the member for Batman has said or implied.The most recent of the inaccuracies that the member for Batman has put about was what he implied in his first question about Allhands Hire. I have now had advice about the actual facts of the situation. The member for Batman claimed that Allhands Hire is for sale. The facts are that All Hands Hire - as we are informed by the company itself - is not for sale. The financial viability check was carried out, and the company demonstrated an operating profit and a satisfactory financial situation to pass that. The company has a contract for some 2,000 job matching places. - Let me make the point - because the point is raised that people are being given contracts worth a lot of money - that one of the great advantages of the new system is that no-one gets any money unless they place an unemployed person in a job. The payment is made when they get unemployed people into jobs; that is what the new system is about. It is not like your system which handed out money hand over fist, whether or not the performance was granted.Let me make the point, to put the facts clearly on the record, that if a company which has a contract in the new Job Network decides to sell the business as a commercial consideration, the contract does not automatically transfer to the purchaser of that business. It would require the agreement of the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, who would assess the new owner's viability before any agreement would be made.In other words, exactly the same rigorous process of assessment would apply. The procedures apply to any company that wants to sell within the 19-month period of the contract. That is by no means the limit of the inaccuracies that we keep getting from the member for Batman. On 7 March, on Canberra radio news, he stated that over 400,000 Australians will no longer be entitled to a helping hand - to that free employment service that used to be part of Australia's endeavour to get our unemployed people back to work. That is absolutely wrong. He is trying to spread fear and anxiety amongst unemployed people. He has never cared about unemployed people. We know the contempt in which he holds them, and we know that the Labor Party has only ever used its policies for unemployed people to try to manipulate the statistics.The Prime Minister read to the House the statement issued by Employment National which clearly put paid to that matter. Every unemployed person in Job Network gets access to greatly upgraded facilities through Centrelink. They get an expanded vacancy list and they get access to a free computer, faxes, photocopiers and telephones to contact employers. All the major providers in Job Net  work have clearly indicated to us that they will take any unemployed person and seek to match the best person to the vacancy. Not only has Employment National said that, as the Prime Minister indicated, but Drake has also said, `If they come to us, we would consider taking them for that job, along with everyone else who was the best person for the job. I can give you that undertaking.' The Salvation Army and Mission Australia have given us precisely the same undertakings. The Labor Party will say in this matter anything it takes to get a cheap vote - whatever it takes. The government is putting in place an outstanding system to help unemployed people and the Labor Party should stop trying to spread disinformation, fear and anxiety amongst the people in this community who need help.</DOC>

 - I thank you for the question. It is a shame that you waited a week to ask me a question about the tourism industry when we have had three months  off from this parliament, but you might recall that in some of the answers I gave you last year I said that, as a group of people charged with these sorts of responsibilities, we should take a realistic attitude and not be hysterical about it and that we should look to the diversity of our tourist product and our tourist markets rather than concentrating all our eggs in any one basket. In the case of Cairns, which I took the opportunity to visit on Saturday morning last week at the invitation of the honourable member for Leichhardt, Mr Entsch -  - Daryl, they are crocodile, not alligator, and, if you had ever spent any time in Queensland, you would have known that; but, with a policy on Wik like yours, you wouldn't want to set foot in that state. -  - I think he has learned his lesson. Among the things we discussed was not just the durability of our product -  -  - When you look across the entire spectrum of tourist product and our tourist markets, not just Cairns, you see that some of our markets are doing rather well. For example, preliminary figures from January indicate that we have increased arrivals from the UK, New Zealand and the United States. These are higher yielding markets than some of the Asian markets that have fallen off. So if you are going to deal with it in some particularity - you are suggesting a specific rescue package for Cairns in that sense - you have to examine things such as the supply of hotel accommodation at that end of the spectrum. For example, I spent Friday night staying in a backpacker lodge in Cairns to see what it was like. I did it anonymously. I walked in with my adviser. I might say I enjoyed it. - I did not take my sleeping bag, but I did not need it because it was so hot. - It was; it was the International Hostel on the Esplanade. What became clear was that at the backpacker end of the market things are booming. Mine was the last room in that hostel and the other hostel was full. We know from research on this that backpackers yield more than tourists from some of the markets that have slumped. If you are going to be serious about a particular destination, you cannot just focus on particular markets where it is selling its product, in this case Korea and other markets in Asia. What we are not going to do, as I am sure you will do if you gain office, is to unionise the tourism industry.</DOC>

 - I am aware of the letter from Ms Leonie Green that the member for Batman refers to. This letter is from a person who did not get a tender within the recent tender round. She was one of 700 tenderers out of 1,000 who were not awarded contracts. I have read that letter, and it is wrong on every factual count within it. Of course you would expect the member for Batman who day after day is apparently going to get up in this House and canvass the most inaccurate information put to him by people - many of whom one could have a great deal of sympathy for - who are disappointed because they were not as competitive as others in their ability to provide services to unemployed people in this country.I am prepared day after day to get up here and answer questions about these particular cases of people who did not get contracts. If that is all the Labor Party has to say about the employment services market, it is no wonder that unemployed people in this country have lost faith in the Labor Party. What we are doing is putting in place through this reform one of the most important social reforms that  Australia has seen for decades. It will provide unemployed people with the dignity they were denied by Labor's system.The system that you kept in place that forced them to go to one government monopoly provider was never a system paid on results, and only 20 per cent of the vacancies had a limited number of points of access around the country. If that is the best you can do, you will have no credibility whatever in this country. This country will be flying the flag of equity and social justice on behalf of Australia's unemployed people.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Sturt for his question. This government has been at the forefront of measures in the international community to respond to the emerging situation in Asia. Our government is one of only two in the world that has agreed to be part of international financial rescue efforts. Later on this week, the government will be introducing legislation to make good on Australia's commitment to international financial packages in respect of Korea and Indonesia.There is obvious concern in the Australian business community over expectations in relation to Asia. Even today we had the release of the ACCI-Westpac survey, which showed that in respect of export deliveries certainly expectations were down for the March quarter and the June quarter, obviously as a result of what is happening up in Asia. It is a very serious situation. -  - I do not think even in his most humbuggist mood the member for Hotham would claim that the government is responsible for the situation in Asia. - That is tomorrow's allegation, is it? Can I make it clear what is important in relation to Australia as we confront this external challenge - a challenge which Australia has not had to confront in the last couple of decades. All the time during the last couple of decades, regardless of what was happening in the Australian economy, Asia was an impetus to growth. Even when Labor had the Australian economy in recession in 1990, 1991 and 1992, Asia was still a stimulus.This is the first time in the last two decades that Asia will not be a stimulus to the Australian economy. What that means is that we have to work as hard as ever to secure the Australian economic situation. The first thing we have to do is deliver on our historic commitment to take the Australian budget out of the red and put it back into the black. This is a very important part of an economic strategy to face the emerging crisis. That means that all of the unfunded promises that are now being made in the name of the Australian Labor Party are utterly irresponsible in the face of an external challenge of the dimension that we are facing. Every day the Leader of the Opposition walks into parliament, he makes another unfunded promise. It is almost as if there is a bit of magic when he goes through those doors. He talked this morning as he came in about $1.7 billion in relation to health: `Whipping $1.7 billion out is basically taking it out of the states one way or another, so they certainly need that put back with an appropriate set of terms.' That is what he said this morning.He made a $1.7 billion unfunded promise just this morning, which you can put together with all of his other unfunded promises in relation to foreign aid, in relation to nursing homes, in relation to R&amp;D syndicates and in relation to all of the tax dodgers. All of these are unfunded promises which would be utterly irresponsible in the face of the current situation.What else does Australia need to do in the face of the current situation? Let me make this point. For an island nation whose exports go out through ports and wharfs nothing  could be more damaging to the Australian economy than a sclerotic waterfront that has restrictive work practices and that operates in an unproductive way. What do we see? The Australian Labor Party would choke the lifeblood of the Australian economy because it will not support reform on Australia's waterfront. Nothing could be more irresponsible than for the Labor Party to give comfort to those who want to make Australia uncompetitive. The Labor Party should join this government to support waterfront reform.What else do we need to do in the face of the external challenge? In the face of the external challenge nothing could be more important to Australia than tax reform. Why would we sit back complacently like the Australian Labor Party and say that we will imbed indirect taxes into our exports at a time when our exports are struggling on world markets? What could be more complacent than that? Yet the Australian Labor Party say there is no need to reform our taxation system. They say there is no need to take the fundamental restructuring which is required in Australia to get the Australian economy going again. - At a time when we face an external challenge of dimensions which Australia has not faced before, it is more important than ever that Australia improve and work on fundamental economic reform, that we work on surplus budgets, that we work on an improved waterfront, that we heighten the labour market reforms and that we take the important challenge of tax reform and we take it by the horns and we accomplish it for the sake of Australia at a time when it is more needed than ever.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker -  -  - I thank the member for Prospect for her question. I have read the letter from Sister Mary-Louise. I have also had Sister Mary-Louise's views conveyed to me by the member for Lindsay. Sister Mary-Louise has provided good services to unemployed people in the electorate of Lindsay for a long time. I am naturally sympathetic to Sister Mary-Louise because in the end the bid that she did submit was not competitive compared with those that were accepted for that area.In the letter there were a number of factual inaccuracies. I am happy to put the facts on the record for Sister Mary-Louise in relation to the increasing assistance which unemployed people will be getting in St Marys. First of all, unemployed people will have access to the services of Mission Australia in  St Marys, which will be able to assist hundreds of long-term unemployed people to get jobs in a way which will be tailored to their individual needs. - Our responsibility in the end is to the unemployed people of this country. Our responsibility is to help in the best possible way that we can those people who are most disadvantaged. It is no criticism of someone who has been offering services for a long time to say that the government has received a better plan to help unemployed people in that area. In addition to that the government has contracted other providers within the general St Marys area who will be assisting over 2,000 unemployed people. Anyone who is unemployed in St Marys will be able to go to those other providers as well. So they will have for the first time a choice of a number of agencies to provide them with help in filling job vacancies.Let me return to the point that I made before. If all we are going to hear from the Labor Party are the views of those who have not got contracts in this tender round - a very high quality tender round with lots of excellent proposals - all it will do is underline to the people of Australia that the Labor Party has no constructive plan whatever to help unemployed people. The only people in this country who are putting forward a creative, innovative, soundly based plan to help the unemployed people in this country are the coalition.You are a policy vacuum. When you were the Leader of the House, you added 95,000 to the ranks of the long-term unemployed. You failed as the Minister for Employment, Education and Training. You are failing as the Leader of the Opposition. It is up to the coalition to put forward these constructive people to help people in this country.</DOC>

 - As honourable members will be aware, in the 1997 budget the government announced the allocation of $1,000 million into a fund designed to mark the centenary of the federation of the Australian nation. The bulk of that money was to be committed towards major projects of lasting national significance and benefit. Many of these projects will generate large numbers of jobs in the construction phase and they will make a very valuable and ongoing contribution to Australia, to Australia's infrastructure and to the Australian economy.Already the following Federation Fund projects have been announced: the National Museum of Australia, which includes the Australian Institute for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies to be constructed in Canberra at a cost of $147 million; the Darwin to Alice Springs railway, which has attracted a commitment of $100 million - and I remind the House that that was promised by Bob Hawke in 1983 and for 13 years Labor did nothing about it. I know, they were going to do it in the 14th year - of course they were! I do them a disservice. Also out of the Federation Fund we are making a contribution to that magnificent building, the National Gallery of Victoria.When I was in Western Australia on the Australia Day weekend, I had the opportunity of announcing, with the Premier of Western Australia, Mr Court, a contribution of $80 million to the Jervoise Bay infrastructure project which, I point out, unless my geogra  phy deserts me, is in the electorate of the honourable member for Fremantle. Could I be wrong? Could she be a Labor member? Indeed, it is in the electorate of the honourable member for Fremantle. Dear, oh dear - $80 million.Another project is the Corowa bridge construction, which will be an important and historic link between New South Wales and Victoria of $12 million. Also, my colleague the Minister for Sport and Tourism announced the other day the contribution towards the refurbishment of the historic St Andrew's Cathedral in Sydney of $5 million which will make a very significant contribution, along with an equal amount of Commonwealth subvention for refurbishment of St Mary's Cathedral in Sydney, in the restoration of those very fine buildings.Having recalled what has already been announced, I would like to inform the House of two other important government decisions which carry implications for all honourable members without exception. In relation to $100 million of the Federation Fund -  - Out of the Federation Fund, there will be an amount of $70 million set aside for medium sized cultural and heritage projects, particularly -  - They cannot help it. They have learnt nothing. If you really want to jump in and get on the sticky paper, they are the world's best at doing it. I repeat, $70 million will be set aside for medium sized cultural and heritage projects costing up to $5 million. In relation to the final $30 million, the government recognises that a proper observance of the centenary of Federation requires the development of events at the  grassroots and appropriate recognition of the importance of federation involving local communities. Borrowing from the highly successful example of the Australia Remembers program which provided an equality of funds to each federal electorate irrespective of political representation throughout Australia, my government has decided to make available a sum of $200,000 to each federal electorate irrespective of its political representation in this parliament. -  - Come on; keep coming! - That $200,000 will be made available and it will be the responsibility of whoever is the federal member to get together a local committee to put forward a proposition to the minister in charge. There will be criteria laid down and I will be writing to all members of the House. Everybody will be treated equally because the centenary of Federation does not belong to one or other side of politics. It belongs to all Australians and this is a practical demonstration of that commitment.</DOC>

 - I have already answered the question raised in relation to married women. Let me make it very clear to the House that the difference between our approach and your approach is that we are offering the unemployed hope and choice. They are two things that you never offered them, because when you were in government you drove unemployment to a post-Depres  sion high. The bloke who now leads your party, the Leader of the Opposition, presided over an unemployment rate of 11.2 per cent. That is the worst unemployment rate that Australia has had since the Great Depression. The same Leader of the Opposition presided over a youth unemployment rate of 32 per cent. All that those opposite can do -  - I think he was here when I read out that letter from Employment National. I think that letter from Employment National completely answers it. But, as the honourable member for Batman has given me the opportunity of saying so, let me again remind the House that what we are embarked upon with this new job market scheme is a drive to give to the unemployed of Australia  a sense of hope, a sense of optimism and the reality of choice that was never available under the former government. Only the other day, when I was visiting an electorate - I was in the electorate of the member for the Northern Territory - I had a number of people come up to me. There was a level of enthusiasm within the business community of Darwin that would put even the cynicism of the Labor Party to shame. There was a tremendous sense of hope and optimism. A number of people came up to me and spoke very enthusiastically about the government's new labour market system. - I answered it very specifically yesterday. It is perfectly obvious that all the Labor Party wants to do on this new plan is whinge and carp. I will finish on this note. It is a very interesting piece of double standard on the part of the opposition. When it comes to the Natural Heritage Trust, it is wrong for -  -  - When it comes to the Natural Heritage Trust, the Labor Party is running around Australia saying, `Isn't it shocking? Isn't it terrible that the minister should have any authority to take any decisions?' But when it comes to the labour market program, they are running around saying, `Isn't it shocking that all the decision should be taken by an arms-length group of public servants?' Every question time they are begging the minister to intervene and to overturn decisions that have been made by an arms-length group of public servants, yet in relation to the Natural Heritage Trust they are alleging that that amounts to corrupt behaviour. - You are a mob of hypocrites on this issue.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I did see reports of this. Firstly, it was on the Today Tonight  show on Friday, 27 February and, secondly, it was picked up by the Leader of the Opposition in a speech that he gave last night. The Leader of the Opposition said:In the Hunter, bulk-billing is now virtually unobtainable for ordinary families.I was concerned about the Today Tonight  report, so I asked the Health Insurance Commission to give me the data on the level of bulk-billing in the Hunter to get some objective evidence as to whether or not the claims were correct. - The honourable member should be aware that, on about 12 October, the Australian Medical Association started what effectively is industrial action in the Hunter in an attempt to increase GP rebates, so if there was any effect on this you would expect to see it in the December quarter figures from last year, which are the last quarterly figures we have.There are 680 general practitioners who live in the Hunter region, with 220 in Newcastle. Of the 680 GPs who live in the Hunter region, it is true that 12 do not bulk-bill at all - eight part-time and four full-time GPs. The rest bulk-bill some or all patients. -  - Just wait a second, sucker. - If you look at the doctors in Newcastle who were the subject of the report, there are 220 GPs in Newcastle. Of these, 36 are not in active practice, so there are 184 doctors practising. Of the 184 doctors, 30 per cent bulk-bill everything - 30 per cent of all the active doctors in Newcastle bulk-bill 99 or 100 per cent of all their medical services. Of the other doctors, if you look at the overall bulk-billing rate in Newcastle, 77 per cent of all general practice services in the December quarter were bulk-billed. Far from bulk-billing being virtually unobtainable for ordinary families, the fact is that 30 per cent of doctors bulk-bill everything, and 77 per cent of all services are bulk-billed. Out of the 680 doctors in the Hunter, only 12 bulk-bill nothing.The second point that was made on the Today Tonight show related to the incomes of GPs. Dr Mellows said that `if you look at the average income of GPs, which is reported to be $42,000 a year, you would wonder why people do medicine'. If that were true you would wonder why people would do medicine. I also took out the aggregated figures on incomes for doctors in Newcastle. Some 10 per cent of GPs in Newcastle last year received billings of between $250,000 and $320,000 - that is before practice payments of $13,000 to $42,000 a practice, before above schedule fees, before work cover, before medico-legal and before any sessional fees. Far from having an average income of $42,000, general practitioners do rather well. I admit that this is before practice costs, but even after practice costs it is still a very substantial income.I will make a few points on this. I do not mind people earning a high income. The overwhelming majority of doctors are hard working and they work for their money. I do not blame Today Tonight for being duped by a small number of doctors. But it appears that what has happened in this case is that a handful of GPs in Newcastle have got together, decided to take this action and sought media attention for their plight. If this is true,  it may constitute collusive behaviour in breach of section 45 of the Trade Practices Act, and I have decided to refer the matter to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, with a request that it be investigated and, if necessary, that action be taken.I make a final point. I have some sympathy with general practitioners in that their rebates have not gone up in the last five years as much as for other doctors. This is because of a decision taken in 1993, when the Leader of the Opposition was then Minister for Finance, to half index GP rebates across the forward estimates and in perpetuity. The net effect of this decision has been to take $1.25 per consultation off general practitioner incomes. Far from bleating that you can hardly find a doctor who bulk-bills, the Leader of the Opposition should examine his own motives and realise that it was his decision that has reduced GP incomes by $1.25 per consultation.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Makin for her question, because I know how well she represents families in her electorate - families who are struggling under the current income taxation system. In 1954, an average wage earner paid 17½ per cent tax on additional earnings; so if they earned an additional dollar, they would pay 17½ per cent tax on it. By next year, an average wage earner is going to be paying 43 per cent tax on each additional earning. In 1954, a taxpayer had to earn 19 times average weekly earnings to go on the top marginal tax rate, and by the year 2000 a taxpayer will only have to be on 1.2 times average weekly earnings to be on the top marginal tax rate. What does that tell you about the taxation system? What it tells you is that the taxation system is no longer fair on average earners. That is why this government is determined to improve the Australian taxation system for average wage earners. You can get even worse and more unfair results out of the Australian taxation system if you add in the fact that people going into the work force face not only high marginal tax rates but also clawback in relation to social security. - The member for Werriwa is only too well aware of the social security system. I welcome the support of tax reform by the progressive members of the Australian Labor Party.It is not true that all of the members of the Australian Labor Party are as illiterate on matters of tax as the Leader and Deputy Leader of the Opposition. If you take a family with two children aged seven and four and both parents unemployed and one of the parents goes into the work force and gets a job paying $200 per week, the effect of income tax plus clawback of social security benefits will mean that, out of the $200 they earn a week, that person will receive only $64 - an effective marginal tax rate of around 70 per cent of what they actually earn. If they went to get a job getting an additional $150 per week, the take home pay would increase only by $24 a week; that is, they would lose nearly $130 out of the $150 that they earned by going into the work force.Clearly, what this is saying is that the interaction of the income tax system and the social security system is impacting very unfairly on average taxpayers. That is why this government wants to improve the tax system. We think that the tax system is unfair. We cannot understand why the Australian Labor Party defends such an unfair system, why the Australian Labor Party will not join with us and say, `Taxation reform is necessary in Australia.' We cannot understand why, after 13 years, the Australian Labor Party did nothing about it and, now that they are in opposition again, why they will not join the government in favour of tax reform.There is one side of Australian politics that wants to improve the tax system - one side of Australian politics that wants to make it fairer. - We say to the progressive members of the Labor Party - the member for Werriwa is one of them, the member for Melbourne is another one; some of those who  are able to think out past the failed Keating Labor years - that you ought to be joining the government on this. You know we are right. In your heart, you know we are right. You ought to be joining the government in favour of tax reform. Do not follow the failed Keating Labor ministers into an unfair tax system. Why not join with the government and improve it?</DOC>

 - I should be so lucky. In answer to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, I have seen a newspaper report, presumably the one that you quoted from. I have not personally had a discussion with Senator Gibson, but let me make it very clear that we, as a coalition in government, are prepared - unlike you - to have a go at reforming Australia's old-fashioned, out-of-date taxation system. We are prepared to have a go.The Liberal and National parties are prepared to put a political commitment down to really try to fix the Australian taxation system. Can I tell you what the Australian people are telling us. If you cared to listen, they would be telling you exactly the same thing. They think the present system is unfair. They want the present system changed and, provided what comes out of the change is in aggregate a fair alternative to the present system, they will embrace it.I laid down five principles when I announced in August last year that we would be going to the next election with an alternative taxation program. This is the crowd that had 13 long years -  - I was asked a question about the taxation reform designs of my government. I am answering that question by reminding the Australian people that we have the political courage to try to improve an unfair system - Labor does not. We have the political commitment to provide relief to ordinary Australian families - Labor does not. We do not have the track record of having told the Australian people in 1993 that we were against higher levels of indirect tax and then, immediately on getting re-elected on that false promise, jacking up every indirect tax in the country. We are not the party that ran around promising l-a-w tax cuts and then repudiating them.I want to remind the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that five principles were laid down when I announced that we were going to have tax reform. I can assure the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that when our plan is unveiled all of those principles will be met. All I can say to those opposite is: ask me more questions. Ask me questions every day about taxation reform. Every time you ask me a question, it gives me the opportunity to tell the Australian people that we are in favour of having a go at fixing the taxation system and that you are against it. - As I was saying before that unwelcome monologue, there were five principles that were laid down. Those five principles will be honoured. I say to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition keep doing us a favour, keep asking these questions, keep giving us an opportunity to remind the Australian public that the coalition is for tax reform and you are for doing nothing. - I have finished.</DOC>

 - I think all members of the House would be interested to know that the basis of the industrial action being taken by the MUA tomorrow is to take all the rorts and the rip-offs which they today get by allowance and overtime and put all those into a base salary. On top of that, they have got the hide and the greed to ask for a pay increase of $4,500 a year.This is a claim based on greed and vengeance by the MUA which is being supported by none other than the Labor Party. For years, they were responsible for the rorts and the rip-offs on the Australian waterfront, which is one of the contributors to Australia's foreign debt because of its inability to efficiently move goods across the Australian waterfront. Now, by their silence, the Labor Party are sitting, applauding and endorsing the MUA and their campaign of greed and their campaign to maintain the rorts and the rip-offs which are so evident on the Australian waterfront.The wharfies are asking for an extra $90 a week at a cost to the employer of approximately $130 a week per employee. That will add an extra $22½ million to the cost of stevedoring operations in Australia, which is, in effect, another tax being imposed by the MUA on all those goods which go across the Australian waterfront. It is an outrage that this weak Leader of the Opposition, in the face of a guerilla campaign by his mates, is simply incapable of at least showing the leadership to stand up to these people.There is no doubt that the example of the crane driver who is on $90,000 a year but sits on his crane for only 14 hours a week is really starting to hit home. Yesterday, I received a letter from a wharfie in Brisbane. He said:I am truly getting sick of listening and reading about how much we earn for the year and the 14½ hours that I and my colleagues operate the crane and that we earn $90,000.He then set out to correct me. He said that, for the year ending 30 June 1997, he earned $80,414. In the year before, he only earned the average - $74,000. Now his mates back in Sydney, with the support of the Labor Party, are asking for another $4,500.In response to the member's question, I can tell him that the average wharfie is on about $74,000 a year and you are lucky to get 30 hours a week out of them in any average week. As a comparison, nurses and policemen - who really do put in for the community - earn something like half that amount. It is a continuing testament to the weakness of the Leader of the Opposition because he is yet to condemn the guerrilla and thuggish tactics of the MUA.</DOC>

 - I am aware of this closure and the general circumstances, and I understand it is in the member's electorate. Let me say on behalf of the government that, where employers fail to meet their entitlements, the employees are certainly entitled to take action. The Office of the Employment Advocate is available to those employees, as it is to any  employees who have been duded by their employer. - The awards management branch of the federal department for which I am responsible will certainly sit down with those employees and, where we can take action, we will. I say to any employer who fails to meet their entitlements and obligations they have to employees that the government will stand shoulder to shoulder with the employees and we will take every action against those employers. We will support the rights of employees, as we will support the rights of employers, to the full protection of the law.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Cowan for his question. I know that he is dedicated to expanding apprenticeship opportunities for young people. He himself left school, I think, at 16 to take up an apprenticeship, and many like him have gained a wonderful start to their careers through apprenticeships. Unfortunately, the message that the Labor Party gave young people in this country was that it was all right to drop out of school and live on the dole.This government has made a major commitment to the 70 per cent of school leavers who are not going on to university, and we have put the resources into backing that commitment - $187 million over four years. In fact, during the first term of this government, we put four times as much money into supporting  vocational education opportunities in schools as Labor put in in its entire 13 years of government.As a consequence, in the last year of the Labor Party, there were only some 3,000 students in Australian schools actually undertaking industry endorsed programs of vocational education. In 1997, as a result of this government's policy, there were 38,000 students in schools - a 12 times increase. We put our money where our mouth is. In 1996-97, there were some 98,000 commencements in new apprenticeships, and I am very pleased to be able to inform the House that this year the government will more than exceed its promise to create 100,000 new apprenticeships.This is a wonderful opportunity for young Australians with a commonsense, down-to-earth, practical policy that provides them with opportunities. The only regret we have is that, while everyone in Australia is pleased with this, there is one group who is not - that is, the Australian Labor Party. The member for Werriwa said on ABC radio in South Australia on 15 October last year:I really fear, particularly under this federal government, that the balance is tipping away towards the vocational end.Make no mistake: the member for Werriwa has let the cat out of the bag. If Labor gets back into office, it will take away these apprenticeships and it will cut opportunities for the 70 per cent not going on to university. Labor tried to kill the apprenticeship system when it was in office in favour of the schemes favoured by its union mates, and it will try to do it again.</DOC>

 - I have absolutely no information on the subject. -  - He is claiming it is. I honestly have no information whatsoever. But I can say that one of the tasks of the Office of the Employment Advocate is to ensure that the freedom of association provisions of the federal law are observed, and the advocate has been very active in pursuing instances and examples where unions have required people to be members of a union.We had a recent example of this down at Webb Dock where a non-union truck driver attempted to enter the Patrick property. He was prevented by some of your mates from the TWU, and a complaint was lodged with the Office of the Employment Advocate that very day. By the end of the day, a non-union truck driver and other persons, regardless of whether or not they were members of a union, were able to access that site.The fact of the matter is that we have a very strong ban on compulsory unionism. The advocate is doing an absolutely excellent job. If you have genuine concerns, instead of making political points, you ought to raise them with me.</DOC>

 - The confidential document to which the member for Grey refers is, of course, the one that was used by Senator Bolkus at a press conference on Monday, 5 January. That document is one to which access could be given only by a Federal Court order, and the court has informed the government that no such order had been sought or made. Yesterday I pointed out that the Leader of the Opposition's defence of Senator Bolkus  using the document - namely, that Senator Vanstone leaked the affidavit - was quite wrong. Yesterday I also pointed out that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition's defence of Senator Bolkus - namely, that the material leaked was already in the Daily Telegraph  article of Monday, 5 January - was also quite wrong.Let us have a look at what Senator Bolkus says in his own defence. On the 7.30 Report last week Senator Bolkus said that the document was with the media. However, no evidence was offered. Senator Bolkus asserted last week through a spokesman that the document was on the public record and that he regarded it as being in the public domain. There does not seem to be any evidence of that either. The Telegraph article did not refer to the affidavit. At his press conference, which was after the article had appeared, Senator Bolkus read from it. But if the affidavit was already in the media, why did he then say that he could not give it out and he would proceed to read from it off the record? It cannot be mere coincidence that copies of the two pages from which he read and the two passages to which he referred and which were underlined -  - I say again that it cannot be mere coincidence that the two pages from which Senator Bolkus read, containing the passages he read underlined, were boxed in the gallery later the same day. The material was in the media, but it was only there after Senator Bolkus put it there. The inconsistencies between the evidence and the defences put up by Labor spokesmen reveal that there is no defence.</DOC>

We have plans and they will hit pay dirt, as the Prime Minister reminds me, and they will deliver a fair deal to country Australia - a fair deal on transport fuel taxes and a fair deal for PAYE taxpayers who have carried far more than their fair share of the burden of government under Labor.

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. In the same speech that the Leader of the Opposition made last night, where he was using Today Tonight  as his personal research department, he also made claims that the government had taken $1.7 billion from public health, whatever `public health' means. He amplified that on radio this morning when he somehow defined the fiscal contribution that states have made to the Commonwealth's budget deficit reduction task as public health, which only shows that the Leader of the Opposition has no understanding of how the hospitals run, or no understanding of how financial assistance grants run.The simple fact is that this was made on a voluntary basis by the states as a contribution of $320 million a year. It has nothing to do with public health. It really only shows your foolishness and your buffoonery, and the fact that you are prepared to say or do anything to achieve an end, no matter how false it is. - The reason the states were giving this fiscal contribution was that the former Minister for Finance, now the Leader of the Opposition, left a $10½ billion deficit that they were prepared to help us address. The second point that the Leader of the Opposition somehow claimed was related to public health was the Commonwealth dental program, announced in the dying days of the 1993 election campaign by the then Prime Minister, Paul Keating, as a four-year program. Six months early, when the number of claimed or promised cases had been treated, we met the original promise made in the dying days of the 1993 election. We did not keep it going when you, yourself, had not made any promise to keep it going. The third point is that the Leader of the Opposition claims that the PBS is somehow taking from public health programs. This year we are spending $235 million more on the PBS than we did last year, and last year we spent $211 million more than we did in the year before.What we have simply done in the PBS is reorder our priorities for which we make no apologies. We have reordered our priorities to  fund higher cost newer drugs. We have reordered our priorities to make sure that these are available in a timely manner rather than merely funding `me too' drugs. The Leader of the Opposition attempts to claim that we have somehow cut $1.7 billion from health; his figures do not stack up. To note that a fiscal contribution could somehow be taken from public hospitals simply shows he does not have a clue how they work.</DOC>

 - I thought Gareth was good. - That is not a bad achievement; that is a very considerable achievement.The member for Hotham is engaging in that age old Labor Party tactic: you talk gloom and doom. You talk the Australian economy down. He invites me to talk about employment. I will talk about employment: employment has risen by 145,000 in the last four months. I will talk about investment: business investment in Australia is running at record levels. I will talk about inflation: inflation in Australia is the lowest of any country in the OECD. I will talk about rate of economic growth: our rate of economic growth is equal to or better than any member country of the G7. Let me warm to the task. Let me talk about interest rates. - Of course it is relevant. Having dealt with employment, having dealt with investment, having dealt with inflation, having dealt with growth, let me deal with interest rates. In just over two years, interest rates have fallen by the equivalent of $300 a month for the average home buyer in Australia. I know that nobody opposite likes to be reminded of this, but that is the equivalent of a wage rise of $100 a week for the average worker - $100 a week for the average worker.As a result of that, the great majority of the Australian people are simply not going to listen to this talking down of the Australian economy. They are not going to listen to this doomsday talk from those who sit opposite. They are going to recognise quality economic management when they see it.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Gilmore for her question. It gives me the opportunity to report to her and the House that the government has approved a comprehensive reform of Australia's anti-dumping and countervailing duty mechanisms. - The workers in the electorate of Gilmore and for that matter all around Australia can now look forward to speedy relief if there is unfair dumping of products in Australia. Australia will have the fastest anti-dumping mechanisms in the world and also, I might add, the fairest. - Under Labor, under the former government, it took 220 days before a final decision could be made to impose dumping or countervailing duties. Under the coalition, under the new arrangement, this result will be achieved in 155 days, and interim or provisional measures can be put in place in 60 days. - Labor's complicated two-stream process is to be abolished. The Anti-Dumping Authority is to go. We will have a single, thorough and efficient system which will deliver rapid results to Australian industry. The parties will be consulted throughout the process to ensure that it is fair and equitable. - Another very important point is that this announcement fulfils yet another coalition election promise to deliver faster anti-dumping mechanisms. I have been interested in the interjections from the honourable member for Hotham. He has been running  around the countryside telling us how slow and ineffective the current mechanisms are. Senator Murphy has been echoing that as well. In the Advocate  he described the process as too slow, repetitive and inefficient. Let me remind the House who introduced these proposals. It was those opposite. The Labor Party introduced this slow, cumbersome system that they are now so vigorous in criticising.Not only did they introduce the system, but when they were in government they said it could not be done any faster or any better. The honourable member for Hotham said in the House of Representatives on 25 November 1992, `One cannot magically shorten the anti-dumping period and expect to have better anti-dumping provisions.' In government they could not do it any faster. We will deliver faster results.</DOC>

Daily fees that are paid by residents go to the care needs of those residents and those funds go to the hands of the providers. That is the factual situation. What you are trying to do -  - There is really nothing further that I can add to what the factual situation is. The problem that you have is that you have come into the House - to ask probably the last question before question time finishes - to try to keep this issue alive.

 - I sincerely thank the member for Moreton for his question because today we could not get one from the other side on waterfront. Where is my Kylie Minoguer? The Prime Minister got one and the Treasurer got one. These guys are so politically embarrassed about the waterfront and their own defence of the indefensible that they cannot even muster the political courage to stand up here and ask me just one question about the waterfront. So I do sincerely thank the member for his question.The industrial action that we are about to see in Sydney is the culmination of years of failure by the previous Labor government which has led to the circumstance today  where Australia's exporters, Australia's farmers, those people who rely on the $120 billion worth of goods going across the Australian waterfront are unable to obtain an efficient and reliable service on the Australian waterfront. You can trace it all the way back to the time when the Leader of the Opposition was the senior member of the then Labor government. They had a report done on the waterfront. The advice to the government was at page 31, volume 1, of the report by the Interstate Commission entitled Waterfront Investigation - Conclusions and Recommendations. It stated:Although there was general agreement that the number of waterfront unions should be reduced, more concern was expressed in the second round about possible abuses of power by a single maritime union.In other words, they were told nearly 10 years ago, back in 1989, that if we are to have an efficient waterfront and if we are to do away with the rorts, inefficiencies and the industrial action 10 times the national average then we would have to have a more competitive system on the Australian waterfront. If we were to do something about Australia's foreign debt these guys would have needed to have the courage to stand up to the thuggery of the MUA and require a far more efficient waterfront.They failed to do so for years and today they do not even have the guts to stand up and ask a simple question about the state of the waterfront. It is no wonder, given those inefficiency. For example, the rort of the day is that of the three man lashing team. It is a variation on the Three Musketeers motto - `All for one and one for all.' Except in the wharfies case for the lashing team it is `One sick, all sick at full pay.' One sick and they all go out.This is what you think is admirable about the Australian waterfront. This is why you are embarrassed to ask questions. You do not even have what it takes in your own tactics committee to say, `Listen guys, it's about time we finally had a position which is somehow distant from the MUA.' You are bound hand and foot. You must be the weakest Leader of the Labor Party we have seen in 30 years. It is absolutely pathetic. The Labor Party are the  architects of the circumstance on the Australian waterfront. Not only was WIRA a failure, but its failure is evident on the waterfront today. I will give you two examples. The first is the rorts and rip-offs that we have seen for years.The second is that after they forked out $420 million to wharfies to become redundant, we now find that in the Patricks organisation alone there are 290 wharfies, who are classified as casual, who were actually paid out in the WIRA process. They were paid out $80,000 to $90,000 plus superannuation. Those in the Patricks organisation were paid out $25 million to $29 million to get rid of them and they are still there, in this particular case, earning $30,000 to $40,000 a year as casuals. This is the legacy of Labor's ties to the trade union movement. You are still bound hand and foot to them and it is testimony to your chronic weakness.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Swan for his question. I inform the House that the Senate has today censured Labor's legal affairs spokesman, Senator Bolkus, for revealing the contents of a confidential Federal Court affidavit. The resolution passed by the Senate is in these terms:That the Senate - (a)	 notes:	 (i)	 that Senator Bolkus, during and after a press conference on 5 January 1998, revealed certain contents of a confidential Federal Court affidavit,	 (ii)	 that this affidavit formed part of legal proceedings undertaken by Mr Max Donnelly, trustee of the bankrupt estate of Mr Christopher Skase, to recover assets allegedly concealed by Mr Skase,	 (iii)	 that Federal Court affidavits may only be obtained by leave of the court or a judge,	 (iv)	 that in relation to the affidavit revealed by Senator Bolkus no such leave had been obtained, and	 (v)	 that Mr Donnelly had not authorised the release of the affidavit by either his firm or solicitors acting for him;(b)	 censures Senator Bolkus for:	 (i)	 revealing the contents of a confidential Federal Court affidavit,	 (ii)	 his disregard of the larger public interest in putting at risk the success of Mr Donnelly's legal attempts to recover assets belonging to the bankrupt estate of Mr Christopher Skase, and	 (iii)	 his knowingly taking a course of action directly contrary to the public interest.The Senate has today reinforced the decision of this House last week to censure Senator Bolkus. Clearly, the parliament of Australia believes that Senator Bolkus has behaved improperly. It is disturbing that Labor continues to deny that there has been any wrong doing. The message to the Australian public is that Labor will do whatever it takes to score a political point and Labor does not care about the proper operation of the legal system. When caught red-handed Labor denies wrong doing.What the Leader of the Opposition and Labor's legal affairs spokesman are saying by their continued denial of any wrong doing is that they will do it again. By his silence, by his inaction and by his inability to enforce appropriate standards on his frontbench, the Leader of the Opposition is just as responsible as Senator Bolkus.</DOC>

 - Can I say in answer to the honourable member for Hindmarsh that the government emphatically is in favour of proper ethical standards. I think it passes very strange for an opposition that has asked two questions about alleged - and I underline the word `alleged' - non-compliance with ministerial guidelines that that same party is led by a man who does not have the guts to sack Senator Bolkus. The only issue about ministerial standards before the parliament at the present time is whether the Leader of the Opposition can summon the courage, can actually whistle up the courage to get rid of Senator Bolkus.Senator Bolkus shamefully, for the basest of political motives, absolutely betrayed the  fundamental principles of his office as shadow Attorney-General by releasing what he knew to be a confidential court document. I think it is almost without precedent that the same frontbencher should have been simultaneously censured by both the House of Representatives and the Senate. -  - In the Senate censure motion the government was joined by senators who hardly ever vote for the government on anything. I cannot remember the last time the Green senators supported us. I cannot remember the last time, except the industrial relations legislation, when the Australian Democrats supported us.The truth, the reality is that we have caught red-handed a man trafficking in confidential documents. We have caught red-handed a man who is prepared to do anything in defiance of the commitment he made when he became a shadow minister, a man who would be the first law officer of the Commonwealth. He is prepared under the cover of some kind of phoney anonymity in terms of his relationship with the media of Australia to peddle not a document authored by himself but a sworn document of which the trustee in bankruptcy said the publication would prejudice the case against Christopher Skase.The last thing Senator Bolkus was worried about was whether the small businessmen and women who have been taken to the cleaners by Christopher Skase would ever get their money back. He was not interested in them. He was not interested in the truth. He was only interested in scoring a cheap political point, and the spineless Leader of the Opposition does not have the guts to sack him.</DOC>

 - I will take the last four-fifths of the question on notice, but the first fifth of the question which relates to standards in public life I will answer. I will answer that by saying that the first requirement of any person who puts themselves forward as a significant figure in public life is to respect the processes of the legal system of this country. That applies most particularly to a man who would be the Attorney-General of Australia. Senator Bolkus, while ever he remains in that office, will run around the country saying, `I should be the Attorney-General of Australia. Don't worry that I traffic in secret court documents.' - I am telling you about standards and ethics. I am telling you that Bolkus has neither. I am telling you that in a political context Senator Bolkus has betrayed the fundamental obligation, and you are led by a man who does not have the courage to get rid of him. - You should go to a question drafting school - you ought to work out how to draft a question. You asked me about ethics. The first obligation of anybody who sits on the front bench of the alternative  government of this country is to understand the responsibilities of the office they exercise. If you are the shadow Attorney-General of Australia, you have an obligation to honour the legal processes of Australia. You have an obligation not to dishonour them. You have an obligation to respect the confidentiality of court documents. You have an obligation to help the law enforcement authorities. You have an obligation to look to the interests of the consumers of Australia. Senator Bolkus has failed every single test. Every single obligation has been failed by Senator Bolkus. That is why Senator Harradine joined us. That is why the two Green senators joined us. That is why the Australian Democrats joined us and that is why the Leader of the Opposition has an irresistible obligation to summon the guts and get rid of Senator Bolkus.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Wannon for his question. One of the most solemn promises that we made to the Australian people before the last election was that if elected we would introduce a charter of budget honesty to ensure that any future government, ours or any other government, could not go to another election and try to  practice the deceit which Mr Beazley tried to practice as finance minister before the 1996 election.We said that we would introduce a statute which would require any incumbent government after an election was called to notify the Australian people of the state of the books. We said that we would introduce legislation to require mid-year reviews. We said that we would introduce legislation which would require those making promises to make them in a responsible way. We did that for the sake of the Australian people.There was one political group which did everything it could to prevent the Australian people having access to full and free financial information. This bill could have gone through 12 months ago. Yet the Australian Labor Party sneaked its way around trying to delay the passage of this bill because it did not want provisions put in place to prevent it trying to return to the scene of the crime before the 1996 election. It wanted the opportunity to try a repeat attempt at cheating, just as it had in relation to the March 1996 election.As recently as yesterday morning, AAP was reporting that the Leader of the Opposition had told his caucus meeting that he was prepared to fight an election on all four double dissolution potential triggers: the Wik Native Title Bill, changes to the Public Service Act, small business exemptions from unfair dismissal, and a charter of budget honesty. But by 8.05 last night -  - By 8.05 yesterday evening, AAP was  reporting that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition had been seen skipping around the press gallery with the information that, far from taking their big stand against the charter of budget honesty, the Labor Party had backflipped during the day and were now going to remove their  objections. It is a backflip which we totally welcome.There was no reason for the Labor Party, for 12 months, for concocted reasons, to try to hold up this legislation. What it did was waste the time of this parliament in a concocted argument, trying to cover up legislation which was required because of the deceitful nature of the Leader of the Opposition. This was the Leader of the Opposition who, in February 1996, said that the Australian budget was in surplus when it was $10,000 million in the red.The charter of budget honesty, which will be a great contribution to Australian legislation, was introduced to make sure that a man like him could never try to repeat the same trick and could never go to the Australian people and try to deceive them as to the state of the true accounts when the Australian people were in a mood before an election where they could be deceived in that way. The charter of budget honesty is world-class legislation. - Mr Speaker, it is weak, worthless legislation which he has now decided to vote for. Is that right? I will tell you what is weak and worthless, old son, and it is not this legislation. - You can look in the mirror. Mr Speaker, this is world-class legislation. This is legislation which is designed to prevent a repeat of the experience of 1996. This is legislation which this government promised before the election. It is legislation which we will deliver and it is legislation which will be of lasting benefit to the Australian people.</DOC>

 - On this occasion I will take the first four-fifths of the question on notice. But I will deal with the last fifth, that is, the responsibilities of a party leader to remove from office those on their front bench who are no longer fit to occupy that office. I will again remind the House that it is now 18 minutes past two and the Leader of the Opposition has still not indicated a readiness on his part to remove Senator Bolkus.Senator Bolkus has been undeniably indicted, not just by the House of Representatives but also by the Senate. He was voted down in censure not just by the Liberal and National Party senators, but also by the Independent senator, Senator Harradine, by the two Green senators and by the members of the Australian Democrats. By a vote of 44 to 27, the members of the Australian Senate adjudged that he was no longer fit to hold the office of shadow Attorney-General.The Leader of the Opposition knows his duty. The Leader of the Opposition has been told his duty by the House of Representatives and by the Senate. The Leader of the Opposition remains impotent and incapable of summoning the courage to remove Senator Bolkus.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Murray for her question. The Howard government is firmly committed to ensuring that women are included in and have access to all the decision making processes in this country. Our government has a very impressive record of achievement in this area. For example, the number of women appointed to Commonwealth boards has increased to 30.6 per cent and the number of senior executive women has increased by nearly 15 per cent. We have appointed a record number of women to head our foreign posts and missions.The opposition cannot boast the same credibility. It stops women in the starting blocks. It prevents women from being preselected in winnable seats. I have already advised the House of the Labor Party's shoddy treatment of Ann Scott, who is seeking Labor preselection for Oxley. She claims Labor boss Gary Gray told her that he would tip a bucket of muck over her if she did not withdraw. - Ann Scott claims that the Labor boss, Gary Gray, told her that he would tip a bucket of muck over her if she did not withdraw and she claims that she was threatened by a senior member of the frontbench. I called on Kim Beazley to expose this frontbencher but, in another test of leadership, he has failed. - I called on the Leader of the Opposition to expose this frontbencher but, in another test of leadership, he has failed. While the Leader of the Opposition does absolutely nothing, Ann Scott's position has worsened. For rightly complaining about this appalling treatment she has been charged with disloyalty and engaging in conduct harmful to the party. If these charges are upheld, she will be expelled from the Labor Party. In my view, it is Gary Gray and the anonymous frontbencher who ought to be charged, not Ann Scott.Labor women are outraged, too. Senator Margaret Reynolds said on radio 4QR this morning, `If people in the Labor Party can't express a point of view, it is pretty tough and it is undemocratic.' What is even more worrying is that Senator Reynolds also admitted, `I have my own Ann Scott story that may eventually be told.' The opposition talks about promoting women, but behind the scenes it is intimidating women into silence. - The Labor Party is intimidating its women into silence. It is not into promoting its women at all. The Ann Scotts in the Labor Party should come forward and demand leadership on this issue from the Leader of the Opposition. Clearly, the Leader of the Opposition cannot control his own party and he has reneged on Labor's commitment to women. Let us expose the ALP blokes for what they are. They are bullyboys. They are thugs. They are captives of the trade union movement. They are determined to drive women back home.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, as to the first five-sixths of the question, I will - as I have in relation to the others - take the question on notice. As to the remaining one-sixth of the question which relates to trusts abuse and action against tax avoidance, it is rather ironic that the member for Hotham, who was out  there with his hand up in favour of the rorters in relation to all the R&amp;D syndicates and who is the great friend of the R&amp;D syndicate rorters, has asked this question. Can I say in relation to him that he will find as the months go by that this government's resolve in relation to the tax avoidance abuses that were left untouched during the 13 years that his mob were in government will be very impressive indeed. Every time you ask a question about tax avoidance and every time you allege that it now goes on in large measure, what you are doing is indicting 13 years of Labor neglect, 13 years of the Labor Party's indifference to do anything about tax avoidance when it had an opportunity of doing so.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Dawson for her question. I could not help but overhear that, when she asked the question about benefits for families, the member for Calwell said the question was incoherent. - It is, is it? We do not think it is a matter of incoherence to give benefits to families. In fact, we on this side of the House quite like helping Australian families. - Mr Speaker, we would like to give the Labor Party a demonstration of coherent benefits for families. One of the most coherent benefits for families is to bring their mortgage rate from 10.5 per cent to 6.5 per cent. That gives a coherent benefit of about $330 a month. - Three hundred and thirty dollars a month. Another coherent benefit for families was the family tax initiative which, together with hospital and ancillary health insurance incentives, benefited Australian families by $10 a month. Another coherent benefit! But it is always a tale of two elections, is it not? You cannot just look at 1996 and say that families are $430 a month better off as a result of the 1996 election. Let us compare it with what happened after the 1993 election: tax promises which had been put into l-a-w were abolished, and that left families much worse off; all wholesale sales tax rates were increased by two per cent; and home mortgage interest rates were raised from 8.75 per cent to 10.5 per cent, which took away from families $150 a month.So we can compare and contrast the figure after the 1996 election, $430 per month better off, with the figure after the 1993 election - $150 per month worse off in relation to interest alone. The fact is that, if the Labor Party were elected, it would try to introduce the same old policy: spend money it did not have, drive the budget into deficit, run up debt, push up interest rates and make families much worse off.The member for Batman is already saying he thinks that the government should be digging into the surplus. The Leader of the Opposition is saying he thinks there should be surpluses for the next three years. The member for Jagajaga is making unfunded promises for nursing homes. The member for Werriwa is making unfunded promises in relation to education. The member for Kingsford-Smith is making unfunded promises in relation to aid. The member for Hotham is promising to  reintroduce R&amp;D syndicates. Mr Speaker, you have got to have a hide, if you are the member for Hotham, to get up and talk about tax avoidance, don't you? You really have to have a hide. The parliamentary voice for the R&amp;D syndicates -  - He asks about trust legislation. The fact is that we have in the Senate at the moment legislation to prevent trafficking in trust losses. The firm of lobbyists which is lobbying against that legislation, Kortlangs firm, accidentally sent me a fax which was designed for the Australian Labor Party. - Of course, Mr Speaker. Part of locking in the benefits for families is to ensure that we have a good, coherent budgetary situation in this country. The charter of budget honesty, a coherent benefit for good economic policy, will be a lasting reminder to Australia of the need that there was after the last election to legislate to ensure that what happened before that election - the conduct of the finance minister in that election - is never repeated.The one good thing we can say for the conduct of the finance minister, as he then was, before the 1996 election is that the rules have been changed forever to make sure that nobody ever tries to do again what he tried to do, so that the Australian people will be protected.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Cook for his question. Sadly, a lot of those wharfies at Port Botany would not know productivity if they fell over it. The truth is that, on any reasonable international benchmark figure, productivity in the Port of Botany is absolutely woeful.I will give the member some indication of those figures. For example, with regard to the crane rate in Sydney, the last published figure put out by the independent analysis was actually below the national average. We had published in Australian newspapers at the end of January a survey of international shipping companies looking at Australian port performance. They surveyed 18 ports, a number in Australia and 13 or 14 internationally. They looked at reliability. And where did Sydney come in a reliability test out of 18? It was eighteenth out of 18, dead last, on the issue of reliability.On the question of turnaround speed, where did Sydney rate compared with others in Australia and internationally? It came dead last, unable to compete even with those ports in Australia, certainly unable to compete with competitors like Auckland, Los Angeles and elsewhere. On value for money, a key ingredient, a key factor of the capacity of the port to  run efficiently, it came second last to another Australian port.	On any reasonable criteria, the fact is that Sydney does very poorly indeed.Here we have the world's highest paid wharfies on a wage claim of $4,500 in return for which we get the world's worst practice. And they are supported by none other than the Leader of the Opposition and the spokesman for the MUA who sits on his front bench. They have no defence to the indefensible work practices in Sydney.I conclude by saying this: my Sydney rort of the day, which goes out on the Internet to all members and interested parties, is the one headed, `Who needs new exports rort'. This relates to an Australian company trading into the South Pacific which had set up a business, a growing trade, in bagged cement to several island nations. They were doing pretty well; they were getting a few customers; their product was well received. Bagged cement, being a high volume, relatively low cost product, is sensitive to stevedoring and shipping costs. Recently, the Australian company noticed that instead of growing its business, it was starting to lose business, so it investigated why it was losing business. The answer was that the lower price being offered by New Zealanders was attributable to the lower costs of wharf handling and sea transport out of New Zealand. That was the essential difference.The New Zealand competitors were paying one half of what the Australian company was paying in stevedoring costs. When it investigated the work practices, in New Zealand the cement was loaded at 400 pallets per shift; in Sydney they were only able to load them at 230 pallets per shift. The conclusion of this rort was that the Australian company lost the entire business of providing its product into those island states. We have another loss of jobs as a result of inefficiency and lack of productivity. Today they have the cheek to be taking industrial action in Sydney and these people are so weak that they cannot stand up for the national interest.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Hume for that question and acknowledge the significant contribution made by the member for Hume to the sale of ANL in a former role. I thank him very much for that contribution. The sale of ANL is proceeding on schedule. - As I was saying, the sale of Australian National Line is proceeding on schedule. It is targeted for completion by 30 June this year and the sale itself is being managed by the Office of Asset Sales. Advertisements appeared in domestic newspapers on 29 January last and in international newspapers on 12 and 13 February. The government has released an information brief to all parties who have expressed interest. The expressions of interest are required to be lodged by 3 April, after which the government will consider those expressions of interest and short list the potential bidders before progressing the matter further.I am encouraged by the responses we have received to date from companies which have shown an interest in the Australian National Line, not just Australian companies but companies based in other parts of the world - Asia and Europe. The government's preference is to sell its 100 per cent shareholding in Australian National Line completely; that is, in one go. We have reserved our right to sell it in parts, should the bids come in in that  way. We have given ourselves some flexibility in that regard.The sale of Australian National Line is something which should have occurred a long time ago. This brings me to the second part of the honourable member's question, contrasting the approach that has been taken by this government to that of the former government. - Mr Speaker, I want to address the second part of the honourable member's question which clearly relates to the progress that this government has made in the course of 1998 compared with the progress on this issue at another time. I can say that the progress on this issue at another time has absolutely nothing to do with legislation that will be introduced into this parliament in the next 24 hours or so.In respect of the progress made previously, the sale of ANL was first mooted by the Labor Party in 1991. In fact, the announce  ment was made in the 1991-92 budget. For some four years we went through this charade of an attempt to sell the Australian National Line until it fizzled out in 1995. - Thank you, Mr Speaker, for your guidance on that matter. As I indicated, the sale that was previously proposed fizzled out in 1995. I do not think that surprised anybody, because over those ensuing four years it was clear that the ultimate decision on the sale of this asset would be determined by the unions. It was never going to be the decision of the government; it was to be determined by the unions. - As we will proceed with this sale, rest assured that the government is determined to take all steps to protect taxpayers' funds. That has occurred in other areas of assets sales - not ANL, but AIDC, HLIC - which you could not do -  - This particular area is just one other step that this government has taken to ensure that taxpayers' funds are protected and that sensible management occurs. We will continue to take those steps where necessary.</DOC>

We are doing that with indirect tax, personal income tax and business tax; and after we have done it and worked out ways to help Australian families, ways to encourage incentive and ways to make the Australian taxation system fairer we will be announcing it.All I can say to the Australian Labor Party is this: you have not announced one policy in two years in opposition - not one policy. You have a whole series of unfunded promises out there, and the reason why you have no credibility is that you have no discipline and no leadership. Until you get a Leader of the Opposition who can control his own frontbench and announce a policy and cost it, you are going nowhere.</DOC>

 - The government most certainly does continue to support in full the agreement that was concluded between the police ministers in 1996 in the wake of the Port Arthur tragedy. I believe that, in saying that, I speak on behalf of all members of the House and also on behalf of all members of the federal Senate. I want to inform the honourable member that, since that agreement was concluded between all of the governments of Australia, I have been advised that there has been no sanctioning of any watering down of that agreement by any jurisdiction - any sanctioning on behalf of my government - and nor has there been any sanctioning on behalf of the Australasian Police Ministers Council, which was the ministerial body through which the agreement was originally concluded.I think I speak on behalf of all Australians when I say that they saw the achievement of that agreement as being a milestone in guaranteeing a higher level of public safety in this country, and they would bitterly resent any attempt to water it down. I certainly do, and I know I speak on behalf of all my colleagues and I think I speak on this occasion on behalf of most of those who sit opposite.I inform the House that I will list this matter for discussion at the Premiers Conference, which is taking place on Friday week. It will be an opportunity for all heads of government in Australia to reaffirm their commitment in full to the principles to which their governments so fulsomely subscribed in 1996.</DOC>

 - I am aware of the case of Ms Pippas. What this illustrates, first of all and above all, is the need for the improved services that the government will be putting in place from 1 May through Job Network. The improved service starts on 1 May, and it will be a significant improvement over what is currently available, - Which was Labor's system. Labor's system failed unemployed people. The Labor Party is not interested in unemployed people. If you have not got a union card, the Labor Party is not interested in you. That is why the member for Batman -  - Ms Pippas is a resident of Hoppers Crossing. I am pleased to inform the House that, in the Hoppers Crossing and Werribee area, from 1 May there will be five  members of Job Network, including Employment National. Employment National has made it very clear that it will be helping every unemployed person - whether on benefits or not - and, without discrimination, will be seeking to place the best person in the job. I also draw the opposition's attention to the fact that there will be other providers besides Employment National in the Werribee and Hoppers Crossing area. I suggest that people in this situation may well care to shop around. They will have the chance to choose the provider which best helps them. They will have, under the government's Job Network, the dignity of being able to choose the employment service that provides them with the best opportunity to get a job. Until 1 May, the CES will continue to service all job seekers.</DOC>

I would like to thank the National Competition Council and its President, Graeme Samuel, for their work in producing this important report. The main recommendations are that Australia Post retain a universal service obligation to provide an Australia-wide letter service, that household letter services remain reserved for Australia Post with a continued uniform rate of postage, and that there be competition in business letter services and in international mail services. - I am sure the member for Grey will welcome the fact that the universal service obligation will be retained, and will welcome the reservation of household letters for the bush. It is good for region  al Australia and I am sure the member for Grey will welcome that. The young tyro member for Werriwa who is interested in economic reform interjects that this is just status quo. But what the National Competition Council did recommend was that there be competition in business letter services. I am sure that the economic reform minded member for Werriwa will be pushing the trade union bosses on his own frontbench to endorse that reform. I hope he does, because it would be an example of the Labor Party standing up to a trade union, which would be a rather rare event. I was quite surprised when the Communications Electrical and Plumbing Union wrote to me, saying:Dear The Hon CostelloOver recent months, the Federal Treasurer, Peter Costello, has authorised the National Competition Council to conduct a review . . . This is not an accurate letter. It was not an accurate campaign. It did not engage in honest assessment of the Australia Post position. It was just another union campaign, as you might imagine. I hope that the representatives of the trade union movement who sit opposite do not join them.In fact, I think that the representatives of the trade union movement who sit opposite, who are sent here to do the work of the trade union movement here in the Australian parliament, should remember that the competition review which we have undergone was actually pursuant to a competition agreement which the previous Labor government had entered into. This was, of course, while they were in government. This review has been followed through as a result of that policy. It was a good policy to engage in competition reviews. I congratulate the Labor Party, when it was in government, for having the foresight to be interested in reform.This is a report which the government will consider, and the government will assess the competing objectives. But I make it clear that, as the NCC has recommended, this is a good report for the bush. The government welcomes the retention of the universal service obligation and the reservation for the letters. The member for Grey will be very pleased to  see that, once again, the government looks after rural and regional Australia.</DOC>

 - Of course, I have seen the figures and of course I anticipated that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition would ask me a question about it. It is as regular as clockwork: scour the newspapers for any negative story and get up and say `The Australian economy is in trouble.' And if you cannot find any bad news, you try to create some. I will say this to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition: you can take no credit for the downturn in Asia. I know you would have done it if you could have. You take great glee in the downturn in Asia but you can take no credit for it. It was done independently of you. You may well take great delight in that, but the consumer confidence report of Westpac made it quite clear that consumers were influenced by events in Asia. It said that this was the first convincing evidence that the Asian crisis is starting to impact on householders' confidence.Of course it would. If you see the situation in Indonesia on the front pages of the newspapers, of course you would take that into account. The great thing about this is that this was a government that took steps before the Asian crisis to strengthen the Australian economy. Where would we be now if we had  had two 10-billion dollar deficits led by the finance minister? Where would we have been now if we had taken the Labor Party's advice against a monetary policy agreement with the Reserve Bank? Where would we have been now if you had taken your legal action to sue us over the monetary agreement which ushered in and locked in low inflation in this country? Where would we be?How can a complacent operation like the Australian Labor Party - which, on the one hand, says it is worried about the situation in Asia - say, `But we refuse to cooperate in reforming the waterfront'? How can you possibly maintain the position that on the one hand you are worried about foreign debt while on the other you are prepared to penalise every exporter in this country by maintaining the cosy arrangements of the MUA? The first thing that you could possibly do would be to come out and condemn your mates. Why can't you do that? Why can't you stand up with some strength? - So where do we now find the Australian economy? We have: highest growth in the OECD; lowest inflation for 30 years; interest rates the lowest for 30 years; movement into surplus; labour productivity up; and a budget which will, on current estimations - in the absence of a Labor Party victory - halve the debt to GDP ratio in Australia. All that Labor ever offered Australia was deficit and debt. All that Labor ever offered Australia was high interest rates. This side of the parliament had the foresight to put in place the economic policy which would protect us from external and adverse events, and we were opposed root and branch by the Australian Labor Party.When the Australian Labor Party - and this is a very important point - had all of the  stimulus coming out of Asia in 1990-91, do you know what they managed in terms of domestic growth? Recession. You were running recessions, with a stimulatory external position, and who was the minister presiding over 11.3 per cent unemployment? The Leader of the Opposition. The best thing we can say about you is that although you fought us all the way you were unsuccessful and we were able to put in place those policies which would strengthen the Australian economy just at the time it was needed.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Dunkley for his question and acknowledge his interest in these issues. He is a former adviser to the Victorian Minister for Conservation and is one of a number of members of this House who stand up for the interests of Australia in international negotiations, not the interests of other countries.It was drawn to my attention by our embassy in Washington that the Australian Conservation Foundation's acting director, Mr Michael Krockenburger, has written to the American and apparently also to the British environmental negotiators criticising Australia's successful outcome in the Kyoto negotiations and asking that that position be reconsidered in the conference of the parties which next meets in November of this year.I think that is regrettable. It is regrettable that an Australian organisation should go out and ask other countries to take a stand against Australia. We would have expected Australians to be on Australia's side. So naturally I regret that, although I would not have thought, frankly, that the British government or the government of the United States of  America would be rocked to their foundations by a Mr Michael Krockenburger from the Australian Conservation Foundation.What is interesting is that the government, having achieved such an outstanding success in Kyoto on behalf of Australia, is not only being attacked by the Australian Conservation Foundation, which is a well-known lobby group - and perhaps we would not be surprised that they should take that position - but by the Australian Labor Party, the alternative government in this country.What is interesting about the Labor Party is that they think they can get from here to the next election without any policies. They think they can come in here and abuse and denigrate people but that they themselves can produce not a single page of policy between now and the next election, and they are going to try to achieve it. If you examine what the Labor Party is saying on this whole issue of climate change, you realise that, if the Labor Party were elected at the next election, Australia's successful position at the Kyoto conference would be undone by a Labor government. A Labor government would undo Australia's successfully negotiated position in Kyoto.Admittedly, in a period of three months the Labor Party has had three different positions on this issue. In November the Leader of the Opposition attacked the Australian government saying that we would never achieve anything and that we were isolated in the Kyoto negotiations. We remember it all. He said that we were isolated and that we should be on the side of everybody else and how dare we stand up for Australia. There you were saying that we should go into those negotiations arguing for stabilisation. You said that, didn't you, on 18 November? That was your argument. You said, `Give the game away. Don't stand up for Australia. Go in there and just make sure everybody thinks you're a good fellow,' because being a good fellow is apparently more important than good policy. - Mr Speaker, that was November's position. Then in December we had the member for Denison trotting along to Kyoto with all his background briefings of the Australian media and so on during the conference and tut-tutting about the disastrous techniques that we were pursuing. That was his argument. He then told the Melbourne Age  that Australia should accept a target of plus five per cent, that that was generous and that Labor would sign such a treaty in government. So we had zero from the so-called Leader of the Opposition and we had plus five per cent from the member for Denison. One month later, in January, we had the Hobart conference of the Labor Party. - You do not want to hear this and that is why you take points of order. The fact is that, if you noticed anything at the Labor Party conference - for those who noticed anything happened there at all except Cheryl Kernot's removal van went into her house - the member for Denison and his cohorts were there arguing against the Australian government's successful outcome in Kyoto and arguing for a reduction in Australia's greenhouse gas emissions between 1990 and the years 2008 and 2012.So what is the Labor Party's position? Let us nail you down. Your position is clear. Your position is that you want to reduce emissions by 2008 to 2012 and, in doing so, you will whack 2½ per cent off our GDP and you will cost a minimum of 90,000 jobs. It is cant and hypocrisy for the Labor Party to say it cares about employment on the one hand while on the other it is going to wipe out tens of thousands of jobs by changing our green  house emissions policy and by abandoning our successful outcome in Kyoto if the Labor Party should ever be returned to government. We would like to hear a lot more about where you stand on this issue and plenty of others instead of hiding away behind smut.</DOC>

 - I made a statement last night regarding the allegations contained in the questions asked by the member for Hotham. The member for Hotham is involved in muckraking. The member for Hotham, along with the Australian Labor Party, is disinterested. It is very, very interesting that, on the day on which unemployment in Australia is at its lowest level for five or six years, the first question contains a personal attack on somebody, without foundation and without substance. It would appear that there are a number of things that the Labor Party opposes and one of those is successful businessmen. - I addressed the issue raised by the honourable member for Hotham. He is muckraking - avoiding issues of interest to the Australian community. - On the day that unemployment has fallen to its lowest level, what does this character do? He muckrakes. I say, on behalf of the Australian public, that they are fed up with your muckraking. They are far more interested in real issues. - I have finished my answer.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Lindsay for her question. Today the Australian Bureau of Statistics reported that there are 8,529,000 Australians in jobs - the highest number of Australians ever in work in Australia - and that employment increased by nearly 15,000 jobs in the month of February. What that means is that the unemployment rate in the month of February  of 8.1 per cent is the lowest unemployment rate in Australia since December 1990. It is the lowest unemployment rate for more than seven years. I think all Australians will welcome the fact that unemployment is now at the lowest level in Australia for the last seven years. It is the lowest unemployment rate since Mr Keating called the recession `Australia had to have' and put Australia into recession in 1990.We do not rest on those results. We do not say that having the lowest unemployment in the last seven years means that we can stop. There was a lot of damage done to this country by the Keating Labor recession of 1990. The fact that it has taken seven years to get back to where we were before then means that we as a government have to keep on working to get more Australians into jobs. What does that mean? It means that we need to have a disciplined approach to the budget position. Any political party, and the Labor Party is one of them, which believes that you can enter into unfunded promises and run up deficit and debt is pursuing a policy of higher interest rates and throwing the economy into reverse.People should understand this: Labor's policy to increase the deficit and run up interest rates is a policy to lose jobs in Australia. That is why this government works so hard on getting the budget settings right - because it means that we can keep interest rates low. People should also understand that this government's determination to lock in low inflation is part of our strategy to have low interest rates. It is low interest rates which have been driving economic growth in Australia. To keep those economic growth rates up - as they now are - amongst the highest in the developed world is consistent with continuing the creation of jobs here in this country.As we look back from this vantage point of February 1998, we see that we have finally got back to the best employment position since the Labor Party threw us into recession with 17 per cent interest rates in 1989-90. My message to the parliament and my message to the Australian people is this: we have to continue to keep working in a disciplined way  to produce these results, to give job opportunities to young Australians and to create employment prospects in this country.</DOC>

 - I might observe, in thanking the member for Wannon for that question, that one might have thought that question might have come from the opposition; but, no, they are not interested in the number of people in work in Australia. They are not interested in Australia's international financial reputation. They are only interested in tearing down the reputation of decent men -  - Muckraking. Well may the Leader of the Opposition look just a little  bit uncomfortable, because I think he understands that the Australian people are a bit tired of all of this muckraking and that they really want a little bit of commitment to issues that affect mainstream Australia.I am pleased to say that this morning's press reported that the international ratings agency Standard and Poors did not expect the Asian currency crisis to affect Australia's long-term foreign currency credit rating. That is very good news indeed for the Australian economy. It is very good news for the Australian people because it is further evidence of the fundamental strength of the Australian economy. That is something which all Australians should derive considerable satisfaction from. It is further evidence that the coalition government's responsible economic policies have helped insulate Australia from the turmoil that has gripped much of Asia.A key to Standard and Poors' outlook for Australia is that the government's economic policy direction remains consistent. What that means is no return to the years of deficit and debt. It means no return to the years of $10½ billion deficits. It means the preservation of the economic circumstances that guarantee that Australians have a chance of hanging on to those interest rate cuts - those interest rate cuts worth $100 a week wage rise that would be at risk if the Labor Party were re-elected. They are the issues that the Australian people are concerned about.The message out of Standard and Poors is: do not under any circumstances put the control of the Australian economy back into the hands of the men and women who ran up a deficit of $10½ billion and then misled the Australian people about the true state of the books. Do not under any circumstances vote out of office a government that has given Australia the lowest inflation rate in the Western world. Do not under any circumstances take control of the Australian economy away from the people who have given the Australian economy considerable stability and considerable international respectability.I want to assure the House that this government's fiscal rectitude will be very much on show when the 1998 budget is released in May. The benefits of the Austral  ian government's economic policies are everywhere to be seen. We would have been in a much weaker position if the former government had remained in office. Our interest rates would have been higher, our unemployment would have been higher, our inflation would have been higher and our international financial reputation would have been dramatically lower. - With pleasure. I will tell you what - it goes on much longer. Would you like me to read the rest of it? There is a very good point. - No, I am sorry, you asked me a question. - No, you asked me a question. - Mr Speaker, let me say it again. Not only will I table it, but I might start from the top and read it right through. Would you like me to do that? - Why not? This morning's press reported -  - Mr Speaker, let me -  -  - I am a generous bloke. Let me -  - Mr Speaker, I would love to do it. I was invited to do it. I am doing it. - I was invited to do it. You asked me, and I am answering your question. I insist on the right to do so. - By way of response and by way of supplementation, can I continue. The benefits - this is very interesting; I had not mentioned this earlier - from the government's policies in helping Australia better withstand the economic shock from Asia have also been directly endorsed by the OECD. In its 1998 economic survey of Australia released earlier this year, the OECD stated that recent developments in global financial markets underline the importance of measures taken to raise national saving, in particular fiscal consolidation. If you wash out of that the OECD-speak, they are really  saying, `Thank God, the Australian government got rid of Beazley's $10½ billion deficit.' That is what that really means.The very fact that the confidence of domestic and international investors in our economy has been maintained is testament to the government's responsible economic policies - policies which stand in stark contrast with the high debt, high deficit, high interest rate policies of Labor - Simon, thank you very much. - Yes, you can have the lot.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Wakefield for his question. The facts of the matter are that, when Skase shot through with the funds, the various authorities were set in pursuit of Mr Skase. Every attempt should be made to secure the return of those funds. Labor were in office. They failed in the Skase chase. Now that they are in opposition they are doing everything they possibly can to jeopardise the proper pursuit of the Skase assets.The facts are quite clear now not just from the interpretation placed on these facts by members of the government but from the very careful analysis of this matter in the Senate. We find that the Senate has censured Senator Bolkus for the release of confidential documents out of the Federal Court. Those listening to the political debate would discount the claims made by the two major sides of politics, but when this matter was debated in the Senate it was not just the government senators who voted to censure Senator Bolkus; it was people like Senator Brian Harradine, the Independent from Tasmania. He looked at the issue and he quoted the claim that Senator Bolkus had revealed certain contents of a confidential Federal Court affidavit. Senator Harradine said:That has been made out. It is clear. It is correct in that that occurred.Then he went on to the fact that the affidavit was part of legal proceedings brought by Max Donnelly, the trustee. Senator Harradine, the Independent, concluded on this issue:Again, that is a fact. - Then Senator Harradine referred to the fact that you could get affidavits only by way of leave of the court. He wanted to know whether there was any authority for Senator Bolkus to have that affidavit and to box it in the gallery to help Mr Skase. He said in respect of that allegation:Again, that is correct.It further says that there had been no authority from Mr Donnelly. So what did Senator Harradine say on that:Again, that is clearly not in dispute.Who suffers as a result of this? Is it Senator Bolkus? No, because he reckons he is doing it for a bit of coverage for himself. He thinks he can get a few cheap political points to be scored against the government of the day and the minister. But who hurts in the end? It is the small business community. It is the bloke who is owed $1,160 because he provided plants and services. It is the bloke who runs a car hire business who loses $462.84. It is the local florist and the local physiotherapist. In fact, there are loads of people in the small business community who had an interest in seeing the full pursuit of Mr Skase.Who betrays that action being taken against Skase? None other than Senator Bolkus. He was censured in the Senate. What does the Leader of the Opposition do? He mounts a muckraking case against an honest minister so as to protect one of his own. Here he is. The great protector: the protector of Mal Colston and now the protector of Nick Bolkus. People talk in this place about conflict of interest. I tell you the true conflict of interest is the conflict of interest between the actions of Senator Bolkus and the failure of the Leader of the Opposition to do something about him.</DOC>

 - I would have thought that the question at issue here is whether there has been a conflict of interest such as to require the minister's removal. Are you saying that the children of a minister of the Crown are not entitled to share in the assets of their parents' earlier activities? Do you want a parliament full -  -  - I think what this crowd opposite really wants is a parliament -  -  - You can make as much noise as you like, but nothing is going to get you out of the obligation of getting back to what is really involved here - and it is not muckraking about somebody who was successful in business. That is what you are about. What do you expect the man to do when he becomes a minister? Throw it all away. Of course not. You want a parliament composed entirely of trade union officials and former political staffers. All I can say is: pity help Australia if we end up with that. If the opposition has some decent allegation of conflict of interest, let it make that allegation. If you imagine that I am going to inquire of the details of bona fide family business in relation to my colleagues you have another think coming.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dickson for his question. I think it is time to update the House since recent debates of the intervention of three people not noted for their support of the coalition government - Father Brennan, Gary Johns and Peter Walsh. What we now have is a comprehensively exposed grubby and politically driven strategy to force Australia into a race based election. Father Frank Brennan SJ is reported in the Australian  as stating:I was asked to be silent, I agreed to be silent.Father Brennan confirmed in his most recent utterance that Aboriginal negotiators wanted to bring about a double dissolution which they hoped Labor would win and then scrap the 10-point plan. Father Brennan said, `Pigs might fly.' That is a comment of Father Brennan. He went on to state:First Labor would need to get elected, and then in government -  - Clearly they do not like a healthy dose of Jesuitical realism. What did the Aboriginal negotiators and Labor not want Father Brennan to say? They did not  want him to emphasise the fatal flaw in their amendment to the Racial Discrimination Act. They forget very neatly what happened when they were in government and sought to do the same.I now move on to Mr Gary Johns. Mr Gary Johns has introduced new material into this debate this day. Gary Johns has said that Labor's view was:. . . that past valid freehold and leasehold grants extinguished native title . . . it not only assumed the High Court would confirm this view in Wik, it prayed for that outcome.When Labor spokesman Daryl Melham announced recently that he had always believed co-existence would occur on pastoral lease, it served to confirm that no-one else on the Labor side did.Daryl, you are on your own. What we now have from Gary Johns is the absolute reality. He goes on to state:The reality of the RTN is that, in conjunction with an easy test for registration, with the flimsiest of evidence claimants can extract from miners rent in the form of royalties, jobs and training from what would have otherwise been unproductive land.Gary Johns, a former minister of your party, stated:This Robin Hood mentality shows the flaw in Labor's thinking. Why should special rights attached to a title held by one race be used essentially against one industry?To which I would add, why should farmers be made second-class citizens with a second-class set of rights under Labor's approach? On top of that, we have former Senator Peter Walsh, who is a distinguished columnist for the Financial Review  - sometimes - making it clear recently:Let us be clear, the superficially innocuous right to negotiate is an invitation to extract rent by extortion.It is very clear that it is not a common law right. What the government is about is getting in place - and the sooner the better - a set of circumstances and a framework which will allow the fair processing of native title and farmers to get on with their lives. What your approach is about, which is threatening to bring on a race based election, is that you have no honesty on this subject, you have no integrity on this subject, and Kim Beazley has  absolutely no leadership on the subject of Wik.</DOC>

 - I have no reason to alter anything I said yesterday, but can I just make the observation that it is now half past two and we have had nothing new, nothing different -  - No new facts; nothing different. You still have not been able to establish where the conflict of interest is. By references to specific amounts of money, all you are trying to do is to develop some kind of view in the community that it is wrong for somebody to have been successful in business.I am very proud of the fact that I have within my ministry a number of men and women who were remarkably successful in business. They were men and women who were prepared to take risks to invest. They were prepared to generate jobs; they were prepared to employ people. Apparently, what this crew opposite believe is that, when you get into the ministry and if you have that kind of background, you are meant to say to your children, `You don't get any benefit from my hard work. You don't get any benefit from the risks that I have taken. You're not going to share in it. What I am going to do is throw you to the wolves.'I believe that, throughout the whole of this episode, my colleague Senator Parer has behaved with honour and with honesty. I illustrate that point simply to emphasise that, when I was going through some of the the papers, I came across one of the letters that  Senator Parer wrote to me. Part of that letter reads as follows:Changes in investments held by the Parer family trust. Changes are: (1) . . . I ask honourable members to listen to this very carefully because it goes very much to motive and it goes very much to the state of mind of Senator Parer long before these events occurred, and is therefore far more reliable evidence about his motives and his desire to comply with guidelines and to do the right thing. This is what he had to say:Disposal of CSR shares. I discovered that CSR had a 20 per cent interest in Nabalco which mines bauxite. No decisions made which affect Nabalco.In shorthand, what that is saying is two things: that because the trust held some shares in CSR, which in turn had an interest in Nabalco, which mined bauxite, he thought it expedient and proper - he thought it the right thing to do - to see that those CSR shares were got rid of. He also went on to say that he had not made any decision which affected Nabalco.They are the actions of a man conscientiously trying to do the right thing; they are also the actions of a man who understands business; they are also the actions of a man who understands the mining industry - in other words, the actions of a man who is a fit and proper member to be a minister of the Commonwealth government.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Dawson for her question. Rural Australians have not had good access  to Medicare and that is something we have been remedying over the last 18 months. We have had a Medicare easyclaim facility that is now into its second rollout. The first rollout saw 110 facilities offered around Australia; 104 of the pharmacists took them up. That was completed on 5 October last year.We are now in the second rollout where we are putting another 106 facilities in. The facility at Proserpine in the member's electorate was one of the first to go out. We have already put facilities in places such as Glen Innes - in your own electorate, Mr Speaker - at Maryborough in Bendigo and at Goondiwindi in Maranoa. Today, in the electorate of Riverina, a facility is going in at Cootamundra. Next week we are putting facilities in at Karang and Cobram in the honourable member for Murray's electorate. We have finished planning for the third rollout, and that will happen by 30 June this year when another 140 facilities will be underway. I am pleased to let the honourable member for Ballarat know that two pharmacies in Stawell will be offered facilities - and this might actually get him off my front doorstep for a while.In October 1997, we also trialled a second facility by using a touch screen. We are doing this in four pharmacies: two in Seymour and two in Wonthaggi. This touch screen trial will go over six months. We are also doing a trial in Palmerston in the Northern Territory to have a look at what happens in an outer metropolitan area where you have a larger volume of claims.The Health Insurance Commission has had almost universal support for this. Patients have found the electronic funds transfer facility perfectly good. They appreciate having a facility where nothing existed whatsoever. The sorts of comments and feedback we have had are typical of one that we got from Kilcoy: `The HIC easyclaim is a boon for the town because the facility helps keep money and business in the town.' I am sure this will please the honourable member for Fisher. All up, we will have around 400 facilities implemented six months from now. This will complete an election promise where we committed to extend Medicare facilities to  country areas. I thank honourable members for their help in rolling it out.</DOC>

 - Thank you, Mr Speaker. In relation to the matters raised by the honourable member, let me just shortly state that  the government is obviously aware of what is happening in Indonesia. We keep a close watch on matters that relate to their economy and their future and endeavour to assist in a very positive way. I think that has been demonstrated by the way in which the government and the foreign minister have addressed these issues. There is no evidence that there has been any outflow of people from Indonesia. Obviously, while we would be alert to any changes that might occur and plan appropriately, there are no matters which we are aware of at this stage which would give us any concern at all. I am very confident that we will be able to address any situation that arises.</DOC>

 - First, I thank the honourable member for the Northern Territory for his question and say to him and the House that this government, ever since it came to office, has given a very high priority to doing our best to contribute to an end to the bloody conflict on the island of Bougainville, which is so close to Australia. We at the outset took a very strong stand against the former Chan government's decision to pursue a military solution to the Bougainville conflict and, in the end, the stand that we took was vindicated. Since June last year, the Australian government has been playing a very significant role in helping to take forward the whole of the Bougainville peace process - everything from hosting meetings in places such as Cairns, through to providing transport to a range of different meetings for the officials on the Bougainville as well as the PNG government side.At the moment, out at the Eaglehawk Resort near Canberra, a meeting is taking  place of the parties to the Bougainville peace process to consider a range of technical issues which are fundamental to the peace process. As the honourable member for the Northern Territory pointed out in his question, the meeting includes officials from the PNG government, as well as from the Bougainville transitional government, the Bougainville interim government and the Bougainville Revolutionary Army. There are also representatives from the Solomon Islands, Fiji and Vanuatu.I understand that significant progress is being made on issues such as the drafting of a cease-fire arrangement, reconstruction and policing issues. Discussions are also being held on the role and structure of the peace monitoring group that is to replace the current and very successful truce monitoring group after 30 April. The delegates will also address the issue of the role the United Nations will play in the peace process. This meeting is helping to pave the way for the leaders meeting, which is scheduled to take place on Bougainville itself in June.In conclusion, Australia is doing a great deal more than providing transport and venues for various meetings in the peace process and diplomatic support for that process. I think the most fundamental role that Australia can and is playing is the role we play in the reconstruction of Bougainville.As a government, we have committed $132.4 million to the reconstruction process over the next few years and today, as part of that package, we are announcing an additional $1 million allocation for the Bougainville provincial rehabilitation project. That will provide building materials to help rebuild schools, health facilities, roads and bridges. It will allow people on Bougainville to start to resume their normal lives.What we are doing on Bougainville - other than facilitating the peace process - is providing a peace dividend. We are ensuring that, as peace comes, the people of Bougainville know that peace will bring better lives for them, better educational opportunities, better health services, better transport and so on. The government is proud of what it has been able to do to facilitate the Bougainville peace  process. It has been a very important component of the government's foreign policy, and we will continue actively to be engaged in this issue.</DOC>

 - It is a quarter to three and there have been no questions from the opposition on jobs, no questions from the opposition on interest rates and, might I say, no evidence that Senator Parer has been involved in a conflict of interest. In case those opposite have missed the point, this is all about whether there has been a conflict of interest. It is not about stoking the politics of envy, nor is it about the Leader of the Opposition imagining that, somehow or other, like `Mr Clean', he can slide away from the responsibility of this muckraking against a decent, honest and respectable minister.The Leader of the Opposition has sat there hoping that, somehow or other, it would all sail over his head and that, if it happened to fall in a heap or to blow up on the member for Hotham, it won't matter. He just sits there hoping that it will all work but, if it doesn't, he can say, `Oh dear, Simon ran that, didn't he.' That is your approach. If you have an allegation that this man has been involved in a breach of the conflict of interest requirements, then you make it. Until then, why don't you get back to issues which affect the Australian people?</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Bowman for her question -  - I thank the member for Bowman for her question. - Thank you, Mr Speaker. -  - On two occasions this week, I have come into the House to outline the very important policy initiatives that this  government has put in place to address issues that are important to women. Those policies include, amongst others: women in leadership; women in the work force - and, in particular, women's participation in the work force; and women and safety issues.If you look at what the Howard government has done in two short years in office, it is interesting to contrast that with the ALP's draft policy platform. If you examine the ALP's draft policy platform, you will find that it contains 180 pages but, of those, only two pages are dedicated to policy to do with women.I would like to raise three of those policy issues. The first one says that Labor resolutely supports equality and choice for women in all aspects of life. I have to say that, after hearing the sneering interjection of the member for Prospect yesterday, I do not think they respect choice. - As I said, Mr Speaker, after the sneering interjection of the member for Prospect yesterday, I do not think that they respect women's choice. They do not respect the choice of women who want to work in the home, to work with their families, to care for the sick and the elderly. The second policy point in the ALP's policy  document says that they want to ensure that women have access to adequate retirement income. -  - It has taken the Howard government just two years in government to deliver sensible and sound policies for women in retirement. The ALP had 13 years to give the women of Australia security in their retirement years. What did they do? They did absolutely nothing. They ignored that issue altogether.The other point I want to raise in the ALP's draft policy document says that Labor will increase the representation of women in parliament. Let's examine their record of getting women into this place in the current round of preselections. They have not done anything about women's representation in the seat of Batman, the seat of Gellibrand, the seat of Melbourne Ports, the seat of Cowan and the Senate. Women have been forced to withdraw from all of these seats, and now we see the fiasco in the seat of Oxley.In reality, women really do not matter to the ALP. The ALP wants to send women back to the kitchen. Yesterday was a very important test of leadership for the Leader of the Opposition who should have distanced himself from the interjection made by the member for Prospect. Instead, he repeated the name calling and claimed that it was apt because our policies are driving women out of the work force. Let me tell the House the truth of the matter. The statistics on work force participation, particularly in relation to women with dependent children under the age of 15 -  - The figures have remained very consistent since 1996. Furthermore, ABS figures show total employment of women rose in February.</DOC>

 - I have a couple of things to say on that. The first thing is that the  existence of the shareholding in QCMM Group (ESP) was disclosed to me. - I am sorry, it was. - To me, that is right. Yes, it was disclosed to me. And it gets better. While I am on the question of disclosures, I notice in the course of this debate that the members of the opposition and some members of the media have made great play of the fact that there was an inadvertent omission from the registry in the Senate. - Well may you laugh. You may well have been one of the people to whom my predecessor was referring when he said on 29 April 1992, `A number of members, including ministers, have inadvertently left information off the register.' I simply say that, if we are going to get the nonsense that inadvertently leaving something off the Senate registry represents some kind of hanging offence, it is starkly at odds with the practice of ministers in the former government and certainly with the attitude which was taken by the former Prime Minister.The existence of Senator Parer's interests in that company was disclosed to me. I repeat what I said last night. On the basis of the information I have been given, I do not believe that Senator Parer has breached the guidelines. I say again: you can talk as much as you like about corporate structures, you can stoke as much as you choose the fires of political envy - you are playing the politics of political envy because you are trying to denigrate somebody by reference to the fact that he, by dint of his experience, his skill and his hard work, has accumulated some assets for his family - but as yet you have not been able to demonstrate to my satisfaction or, I believe, to the satisfaction of the great majority of the Australian people that Senator Parer has done anything wrong, anything dishonest, that he has been involved in a conflict of interest or that he has failed to match the obligations of being a minister of the Crown. He has been a competent minister  and an honest man. Nothing that you said either yesterday or today has altered that unassailable fact.</DOC>

 - The answer to this question is another piece of good news which will no doubt upset those opposite who do not like to hear any good news. One of the really great successes of this government in economic management is the way in which it has reined back inflation which members opposite could do absolutely nothing about.Motorists, particularly in country areas, are amongst those who are seeing the real benefits of that success in bringing inflation down to low levels. In fact, Mr Speaker, the CPI increases are now at the lowest level for 30 years - the lowest level since the Beatles and Elvis; the lowest level since Menzies and McEwen. That brings very real benefits to Australian motorists because federal excise rates are linked to the CPI. They are adjusted every February and every August in accordance with movements in the CPI index. Last month, Customs was able to announce that, because of the very low movement in the CPI, there would be no increase at all in excises for this half-year period.I might add that this is the second six-monthly interval in a row that there has been no CPI increase. This means that, for more than a year now, there has been no increase in fuel excise. That is the longest period - more than a year - without excise increase since indexation was introduced by Labor in 1983.So it does demonstrate the real benefits to all Australians of having low inflation. It does demonstrate also what would happen if there were per some chance a change of government and we were to go back to the horrible old days when inflation was out of control.  Voters would be paying everywhere they went, but they would certainly be paying every time they went to the petrol bowser. Every time they went to the petrol bowser the price would be higher because Labor cannot control inflation. The CPI would go up, and motorists in electorates such as that of the member for Kennedy would be those who would be paying.</DOC>

 - That is the ultimate proof they have nothing new. You always sort of trawl over things. I tell you what I will tell the member for Hotham. I will tell him precisely this. I got Warwick Parer's declaration of pecuniary interests, which he is required to provide as a minister in accordance with the procedures that I established, early in 1997. I referred that directly to the secretary of my department. The secretary of my department certified to my office in writing that, after examination, he was satisfied it complied with the guideline.Frankly, Mr Speaker, as far as I was concerned, I had other preoccupations like repairing the economic mess that had been left to us by the Leader of the Opposition and devoting myself to the service of the people of Australia. If you imagine that I am going to second-guess every piece of correspondence of a considered type and considered kind that I receive in my office, after a proper inquiry has been made, you have forgotten everything you may have learned when you were a minister.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, I thank the member for Fisher for his question. The government's objectives in relation to universities are to increase the access by Australian students to university places and to increase the total resources and quality of Australian universities. And this policy is working.I am aware that there is a scare campaign being run by the opposition claiming that the government is cutting back resources to universities and cutting student places. Let me put the facts on the table, Mr Speaker, so that every member of this House knows the truth of the situation.The simple fact is that the universities have never had more resources than they have today, and there have never been more students attending Australian universities than there are today. The government-funded operating grant per fully-funded student this year at $11,400 is the highest it has been in this decade. Total university revenue this year is at record levels. In fact, the universities have received, over the last three years, a billion dollars more than if revenue had remained at 1995 levels.	So, when members of this House hear the extreme statements from the opposition on university funding and student places, they will know that these statements are absolutely false.The George Orwell who is sitting down the end of the seat there, who is going around the country telling everybody that university places have been cut by 21,000, needs to know the truth, that this year there are 19,000 more students in universities than there were in the last year of the Labor government. And the only clear statement about policy from that side on universities is that they will be cutting places. The promise of the Labor Party is that they will cut out the opportunity for 800 Australian students who this year have their first preference places. They will cut those places away from Australian stu  dents, and reduce the access of students in this country to university opportunities.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, I can say it with the greatest of confidence, on the basis of what I said last night, and on the basis also that at no stage during this saga - and I think it is very important for me to make the point, for those who may be trying to follow this debate on the basis of its merit, rather than on the basis of its rhetoric, prejudice and muck-raking - has the opposition, and this includes the question belatedly asked by the Leader of the Opposition, produced any evidence that Senator Parer has been involved in a conflict of interest. Where is the evidence that Senator Parer made specific representation on behalf of companies in which he had an interest? Where is the evidence that there has been a conflict of interest?The opposition is engaged in a muck-raking exercise. The opposition wants to create the circumstance in this country where people who have been successful in business are no longer interested in going into politics. If you continue to conduct a witch-hunt against men and women in Australia who have been successful in their pre-parliamentary lives, you will end up with a state of affairs, as I said earlier, where this place is filled with none other than former trade union officials and former parliamentary staffers. Noble though both of those pursuits may be, I think the Australian experience demands more; it  ought to have more: but, the way the opposition is heading, it will have much less.</DOC>

 - There certainly are indications that the union will want to try to spread this dispute. The reason they are doing that is because they are running a campaign of vengeance against Patricks, because Patricks has sublet part of their property to the farmers. It is also the case that they are running this dispute, which is another example of the uninhibited greed of these people. What they are seeking to do is to take all the rorts, all the allowances and all the other good deals that they have for themselves over the years, build those into an annual allowance, and then they have the cheek and the greed to ask for a $4,500 a year wage increase. 	 This $4,500 wage claim that they have got is their stated reason for the dispute. The dispute is clearly having a damaging impact. We have 4,000 containers stranded; 120 of those containers are of wheat flour, which is meant as aid to Syria and other countries in the Middle East. There are also exports of rice, wool hide, skins, cotton - all farm produce which is being held up by the MUA.The member asks whether or not there is any support for their industrial action. There is no support in the Australian community for  this action, except for the support which the Labor Party continue to give to the MUA, defending the absolutely indefensible. Why is it that the Labor Party defend the MUA? The reason is obvious. You only have to look across to their front bench to see all the old hacks of the trade union movement, sent here by the trade union movement. There is the member for Hotham, the ex-ACTU president, then there is his left-wing mate the member for Batman.They do not have many new members in the lower house. If you want to see who the new members of the Labor Party are, go over to the Senate and you will see that the place is chock-a-block with new members, all of whom have come from the trade union movement. Senator Bishop is a union secretary; Senator George Campbell is famous as the one who lost all the jobs and created unemployment in early 1981-82. There is Senator Conroy - an apparatchik, if ever you have seen one, from the trade union movement. There is Brenda Gibbs, from the AMIEU. Nobody has done more to lose jobs for Australia than the AMIEU; she is another one. There is John Hogg - no-one has heard of him - from the shoppies. There is Kate Lundy from here in Canberra, from the CFMEU. She is the one who reckons she built Parliament House and the next day she was tearing it down. Then there is Sue Mackay from Tassie - another nondescript union boss. There is Kerry O'Brien from Tassie; no-one has ever heard of him before. He is just another union boss that they sent up here to do the bidding of the union movement.The Labor Party talk about conflict of interest. The real conflict of interest is the conflict of interest you have from all these Labor front benchers, senators and others, who are ex-union bosses, who are doing what they are told by people like John Coombs. Chardonnay Coombs, the farmer from near Bowral who runs the wharfies and reckons it is okay for a wharfie to be a farmer, but it is not all right for a farmer to be a wharfie. The hypocrisy and the weak leadership are there for all to see; their silence is an embarrassment. </DOC>

 - I am satisfied that the information that I gave to the House 10 days ago on this matter, which was based on advice I had received, is accurate. But, Mr Speaker, can I take the opportunity afforded by the question asked by the honourable member for Hotham that, in order to successfully pursue this matter, you have to demonstrate that there has been an actual conflict of interest and you have failed to do that. - You can interject as much as you choose. Until you can demonstrate that Senator Parer has been involved in a conflict of interest, your attack is irrelevant and it is not one that is having any impression on the government.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. The offer that the government has put to the states is as follows: in the last five years we have spent $27.3 billion on Commonwealth-state health care agreements. The forward estimates show that that would rise over the next five years as a matter of course to $30.3 billion. There is a $3 billion increase built into the forward estimates already. Over and above that, the Commonwealth has put the following on the table: $1.5 billion in the base funding over the next five years; an extra $750 million for full cost purchasing of veterans in public hospitals: $500 million for initiatives in efficiency and effectiveness in hospitals, particularly in the area of information technology; and $120 million on waiting lists, to make a total offer over and above the forward estimates of $2.9 billion of new money. This is a 6.9 per cent real increase in the first year of funding, moving to a 15.4 per cent real increase over the five years of the agreements.The agreements also bring in a number of innovations. In  terms of looking at growth in hospital funding, we have a fairly complicated indexation formula, but one that takes into account age, sex, population, the level of private health insurance and what is called utilisation drift. This is a big advantage on the 1993 agreement. If the level of private health insurance coverage drops, the Commonwealth will on a formula driven basis add $83 million a year to the health care agreements. The states will not need to claim the money. It will simply be there on the basis of a formula.Further, over and above everything we can possibly think of that might increase hospital utilisation, we have also added a one per cent drift factor which can be largely accounted for by new technology and inherent underlying demand. This one per cent drift is consistent with what has happened over the past decade.  Unlike 1993, once the states sign up they can reasonably expect that all the contingencies will be accounted for. We are also offering them something that is not of financial benefit but very practical benefit in running their hospitals, and that is substantially greater flexibility. The system is silly at the moment because, if a state was to put in place a very comprehensive program say to stop older people breaking their hips, and in fact they were successful, they would be penalised at the moment because they would not be doing so many hip operations for broken neck of femur. Clearly, we want to prevent illness as much as treat illness.These agreements allow states to put in place measures that may shift treatment from in-hospital into the community and it puts in place arrangements that allow states to bring in prevention programs to try and stop doing the operations in the first place. Also we are bringing in a measure and share arrangement which would allow states to have a look at arrangements whereby the Commonwealth-state boundaries could be broken down. This will mean an end to cost shifting and give us a chance to work cooperatively for the first time ever.The states are asking for $1.1 billion over and above whatever the Commonwealth chooses to put on the table at any point in time. This means 300,000 additional operations per year and, quite frankly, there are not that many people around needing operations. All that would do is one of two things. The first is that it would create demand which is not there, which can certainly happen in health. The second thing it would do is allow the states to pull out their own funding for hospitals, which is what happened in 1993. Honourable members will be interested to know that after the 1993 health care agreement the Commonwealth has increased its funding nearly 20 per cent in real terms. The states reduced their funding in the first year by 12 per cent. For the benefit of honourable members, I table a graph with Commonwealth Grants Commission data showing health care funding at Commonwealth and state levels over the last five years.Finally, the honourable member asked whether people in her electorate will be affected. I would say to her that health funding is going up $3 billion anyway on the forward estimates, and we will stick by that forward estimate. But if states do want to access the extra $2.9 billion, if they want to access the flexibility or if they want to access the measure of share, then we expect them to sign an arrangement.</DOC>

 - As I indicated to the parliament, the existence of the company QCMM was referred to in the disclosure that was made to me, and I am satisfied, from the information that I have been given, that full disclosure has been made. I would also commend to those sitting opposite - and no doubt it will be available to you shortly - a detailed letter which Senator Parer has, I understand, tabled in the Senate this afternoon which fully canvasses the issues raised against him last week; for example, the claim made that in some way when he was in Japan he was advancing the interests of a coal mining company in which his family trust held shares. The reality, as disclosed by the record of conversation taken by an officer of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade during that discussion, demonstrates no such thing. - It is being tabled in the Senate, and I am perfectly happy for the internal processes of the Australian Labor Party to supply a copy of it to you here. You will also find when you get hold of that  information that there will be a minute from the relevant person from within Senator Parer's department attesting to the fact that at no stage was any decision taken by him that could represent a conflict of interest. You might also, on an examination of the Hansard  record in the Senate, acknowledge the fact that your colleague Senator Ray has acknowledged that the opposition is not alleging that Senator Parer has been involved in any dishonesty, nor has he been involved in any conflict of interest.What is involved here is an attempt by the Labor Party to stoke the fans of envy politics. The Labor Party does not have any evidence of a conflict of interest, and I say to those who sit opposite: you demonstrate where Senator Parer has been involved in a conflict of interest, you demonstrate where Senator Parer has behaved dishonourably, you demonstrate where he has failed his ministerial duty, and then you will have an argument of substance. But I can assure those of you who sit opposite that the politics of envy do not wash with me, they do not wash with the government and they do not wash with the Australian public.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Wannon for his question, and I acknowledge the good work that he is doing on behalf of this parliament on the finance committee that he is involved in. I think most people in the House would know the steps that the government has taken to get the macro economy strengthened in Australia, the steps we have taken to reduce debt, and the steps we have taken to overcome the financial neglect of the Labor Party, to lock in low inflation and to get low interest rates. But it is also a very big part of this government's reform program to reform the regulation of the Australian financial sector.It has been our aim to make the Australian financial sector world class and state of the art in terms of regulation. We have done that by commissioning a financial report known as the Wallis inquiry and, in the course of the last week, I announced measures to speed up financial reform in Australia including the appointment of a chief executive officer to the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, Mr Graeme Thompson, and a chairman, Dr Jeff Carmichael. I also  announced the establishment of an Australian Securities and Investment Commission to look after consumer regulation as well as corporations regulation and to establish a payment system board in the Reserve Bank of Australia.The Credit Union Services Corporation described these appointments as showing a commitment to making APRA a first-class regulator. The Institute of Actuaries of Australia said that the government is serious about setting high standards of regulation in this country. I think this shows the absolute opportunity we have in this country - looking out and seeing the financial instability in the region - to make Australia a base for the financial services region here in Australia and to give Australians an opportunity to get involved in this very exciting industry.In addition to that, in the course of the week the government announced a comprehensive overhaul of Australia's corporate law to improve Australia as a base for doing business in the region. We have made it easier for small business to raise money through an offer information statement. We have clarified the duties of directors with a business judgment rule. We propose to introduce new takeover rules which will enhance a more competitive takeovers regime in this country and to adapt regulations to facilitate the introduction of electronic commerce. The ACCI said:The changes to fund raising, business judgment rules, takeovers, application of electronic commerce and other elements of the package will improve the competitiveness of Australian business, leading to greater investment and job creation.The National Executive Director of the Master Builders Association said:The changes would empower small and medium sized businesses to help drive the revitalisation of the Australian economy.These are major reforms. These are substantive reforms. These are the kinds of reforms that Australia needs to improve its business climate and to make Australia a base for the financial sector in this country. These are big parts of the government's economic reform program and, at the end of the day, they mean a better climate for business and more jobs for all Australians.</DOC>

 - I am not aware of - and nor could I be expected to be aware of - the sequence of events in relation to native title claims. The question of whether Senator Parer should have made some declaration in relation to the native title debate is a matter that Senator Parer and the Senate will address. - They will. Why do you say, `Oh, yeah'? Unlike in this place, you actually have a few numbers in the Senate. Senator Parer will be addressing that matter. Let us go back to what is involved here. Where is the conflict of interest? - Oh, there's the conflict of interest. Are you saying that Senator Parer set out to directly enrich himself by that behaviour? Are you? Are you suggesting that, are you? The fact of the matter is you have no evidence of a conflict of interest, you have -  - Senator Parer has not been involved in any conflict of interest, and you have not provided any evidence to substantiate that because there is no evidence. You are flailing around with indirect linkages that do not involve any conflict of interest. The government and I stand by our support of Senator Parer.</DOC>

 - The honourable member for Groom and all honourable members would know that, prior to the last election, the government made it very clear to the Australian public that, if elected, we would seek legislation to enable the sale of one-third of Telstra. That legislation, of course, was forthcoming and a very successful public share offer occurred which allowed some 1.8 million Australians to take a share in one of Australia's greatest companies. That company is in one of the fastest growing sectors in the economy, the telecommunications area.The one-third sale of Telstra allowed Australian share ownership to soar to over 40 per cent of adult Australians. That indicates a clear desire for Australians to invest and to share in the nation's growth. Of course, Mr Speaker, Labor tried to stop that particular process. The Prime Minister and the government have now made it very clear that we  will seek a mandate to extend that growth in share ownership for Australians taking an interest in one of the fastest growing sectors of the economy.The benefits are not necessarily restricted to those who have actually taken up the opportunity to invest. All Australians will benefit from what the government does with the proceeds of a further sale. It will allow this government to deliver a knockout blow on the high government debt that was a legacy of Labor. The record shows that in June of last year there was some $95 billion of general government debt. That has come down somewhat since the sale of one-third of Telstra. We have used the proceeds of that sale to significantly reduce government debt. A further sale could allow up to $40 billion to be taken off that debt that Labor left us. That, when it is combined with the budget surpluses which this government is moving towards, will allow us to eventually, by the year 2001, reduce the approximately $100 billion left to us by Labor down to about one-quarter of that. The actual timing of that is dependent very much, of course, on what the market will demonstrate as to when such a sale should occur if the legislation is forthcoming.I also want to make it abundantly clear to all members of the House that, despite what Labor has been seeking to do in recent times, under no circumstances is Telstra a public monopoly. Labor itself was the government some years ago that moved to introduce a competitive regime. That competitive regime will ensure that the benefits flow on to the people of Australia - to the users. Only last week there was an article - there were articles every second day but this one showed very clearly that Telstra was preparing itself for a battle on local calls. There is Optus, there is Vodafone and there are licences being given to everybody else. We welcome that competitive pressure because the benefits flow through to all consumers of telecommunications, particularly in relation to the telephone.Last week as I watched the Leader of the Opposition on television seeking to oppose what the government has announced it will seek by way of mandate at the next election it was clear to me that the body language said  everything. The body language showed that the Leader of the Opposition had absolutely no stomach for the words that he was mouthing, so much so that what we saw happen was an unelected member in Cheryl Kernot being appointed as the spokesperson on the Telstra issue. Obviously the Leader of the Opposition wants to keep it as far away from himself and the official spokesman as is possible and he is seeking -  -  - Well that was what was clearly given by way of demonstration by you last week. The embarrassment probably flows from what we heard from the CEO of Telstra in 1996. In 1996 when Mr Blount, the CEO of Telstra, was asked what the details were of the job description he was given he said, `Look, I wasn't given a brief but I was told that it was an agenda item depending upon how things progressed.' I am waiting for the day that the Leader of the Opposition tells this House that he was the one who gave that clear indication that privatisation of Telstra was on the Labor Party agenda. Mr Speaker, what we are about is fixing up the economy, fixing up the national accounts and using the proceeds of Telstra to overwhelmingly retire that $100 billion of debt, and that will give a benefit to all Australians year in and year out - indefinitely.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and I acknowledge his interest in and expertise on tax matters. He would know that this government believes in a fairer taxation system for all Australians. We actually believe that parents with children should be given more incentive. We think it is better to have an indirect tax system which is fairer. We want a more internationally competitive business tax system, and we want to make sure that people who are currently avoiding their liabilities have to pay them, which I think is only fair.On Thursday of last week I saw something which we have not seen for a long time; something that gave us all a bit of a shock.  We saw from the opposition a policy announcement. It is true; we actually saw a policy announcement from the opposition, and it was in relation to taxation. It was from the so-called economic spokesman of the opposition. He was on Melbourne radio on Thursday of last week and he was asked about the Australian Council of Social Service saying that negative gearing should be abolished, and he said:Well, that's certainly one option that could be contemplated. . . Then the interviewer said:Last time the Labor Government flirted with it, it was a disaster for the rental market . . . The Deputy Leader of the Opposition said:Obviously you've got to think about the implications for the property market, but there are ways of addressing that which are not necessarily across the board and that's one of many, many options that we are certainly considering.So we thought, `Here is a policy from the opposition to abolish negative gearing - the old Keating policy of 1986.' We thought, `Well, that's good. We ought to encourage the opposition to get on with some policy development.' Even though abolishing negative gearing is not a very good idea, it was an announcement and we welcomed it. But that was in the morning. In the afternoon, we actually had a statement from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. It said:I was asked today about ACOSS's proposal to abolish negative gearing. We do look seriously at all ACOSS proposals . . . We are not, however, proposing to embrace ACOSS's proposal to end negative gearing.So AM GMT, they are going to abolish negative gearing; PM GMT, they have given up on the policy of abolishing negative gearing. The policy was announced in the morning and abolished by the afternoon, GMT - Gareth mean time. It is a policy that lasts before lunch and gets abolished after lunch. This was the man who said on 17 August 1997 that he was in favour of states biting the bullet on inheritance taxes. On 25 August 1997, he reversed his position. This was the man who, on 13 May, said that the services part of the economy was not pulling its weight and on 21 May said that he was against the services tax. This was the man  who said on 1 October that there was a case for increasing revenues and on the afternoon of 1 October was reported in the Sydney Morning Herald  as backing down. This is an opposition which cannot hold a position on tax from the morning to the afternoon. The people of Australia are going to ask themselves this question: why is it that the opposition grub around on every issue except a policy? Why is it that they grub around on all these sorts of things? They grub around because they cannot announce a policy on tax, on health or on any other issue.We have a Leader of the Opposition who wants to deliver surplus budgets, while his shadow ministers are promising $6 billion of unfunded promises - $6 billion. We have a Deputy Leader of the Opposition who wants to abolish negative gearing in the morning, and then turns against it in the afternoon.So I was really surprised, after that experience on the Thursday, guess who came out on Meet the Press to announce a new tax policy? It was the old grub man himself, the member for Hotham. He went on Meet the Press on 22 March, last Sunday, after we had had this appearance on negative gearing which had lasted for all of about two hours. He said this: the ability to offer tax cuts is there if we can grow the economy faster. He is out offering tax cuts. So, $6 billion of unfunded promises, a surplus budget, the abolition of negative gearing, and income tax cuts from the spokesman on - what are you the spokesman on? - the manufacturing industry. An R&amp;D syndicate for every Australian; that is what he believes. - Yes, Mr Speaker. I did, Mr Speaker. An R&amp;D syndicate for every Australian, and income tax cuts as well - Mr Speaker, no wonder they grub around on this kind of stuff.</DOC>

 - The answer to the honourable member's question is that I do remember tabling that, and I think I also remember saying at the time that the action taken by him in doing that was evidence of good faith. -  - You say `Yes'; you are right on this occasion. It was evidence of good faith, and it is very apparent - and it will be very apparent when the honourable member for Hotham reads it - from the very detailed letter that Senator Parer has sent to me. -  - It is very interesting that the honourable member makes reference to QCMM(ESP) Pty Ltd. The reference to that particular company was contained in the return that he provided to me. Can I just read from the letter that was written to me by Senator Parer. Under the subheading of QCMM(ESP) Pty Ltd, it states:As outlined above, I personally hold 44 shares in QCMM(ESP) Pty Ltd. These are worth approximately $56,300. There was no disbursement in 1996-97 and only one disbursement in 1995-96 on 14 November 1995.If I remember rightly, the member for Rankin was the Minister for Resources on 14 November 1995. Listen to this:The disbursement was for $533.85. The only reason the disbursement took place was the departure of a former principal shareholder. QCMM(ESP) Pty Ltd was a vehicle for investment in listed shares and property with a view to building a portfolio of assets for distribution to the participating employees at a time deemed to be appropriate by the directors of the company. The shareholding is maintained and is akin to a `preserved benefit' which applies in the superannuation industry.The company was established on the basis of professional advice in 1993 as an employer sponsored investment plan designed to offer an efficient savings mechanism for employees and directors of participating employers as an alternative to superannuation.Once again, there is no evidence of any conflict of interest.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Gippsland for his question. - If there is a one-sided view, it is because we have not as yet heard a point of view from the Labor opposition. The government condemns this strike action; we condemn this action outright. It is about time the Labor Party had what it takes to stand up in the national interest and also condemn this campaign of vengeance and greed being run by the MUA. The reason we have not heard from this weak and pathetic Leader of the Opposition is that he is bound hand and foot to the MUA and he is unable to condemn their tactics.As a further example of the guerilla tactics of these people, last week we were told they were going to run an eight-day campaign, starting this week. So the company has to reschedule, starting from tomorrow, and divert ships and provide for all the other damage associated with this strike. Now we find the  MUA announcing this morning that it is calling off the first 24 hours of the strike - as if that makes any difference. The damage is already done, and these people in the Labor opposition again have failed to condemn the strike.The union well knows that the company will be unable to reschedule ships at the last moment, and it again highlights the fact that these people are running a guerilla campaign. Their official reason for doing so is that they are seeking a wage increase of $4,500 on top of their second demand, which is to take all the rorts, inefficiencies, allowances and overtime and build them into a base rate which today already gives them an average salary of $74,000 a year.This is nothing other than a campaign being run by the leadership of the MUA against the company which employs many of their members. I say to the rank and file: you are jeopardising your own jobs by running a campaign against your employer. In the meantime a lot of companies and a lot of small businesses will suffer unnecessary damage as a result of this vengeful campaign. Nothing could better sum it up than the comments of Dennis Cahill, who is an exporter who has been in the business for 40 years. This is what he said on radio last week:Well, I mean the costs really come down to costs of interest and usage of funds, additional time where your containers are held at the terminal. But more importantly is of course the question of your overseas buyers and once you lose their confidence, they'll turn their attention elsewhere and we lose - we could lose market share and therefore we get - we are then forced to sell product possibly at a lower level to keep it moving.That is the voice of someone who is actually in the business. I think what he says is commonsense. It is another reason why the Labor opposition should be ashamed at their inability to support a bloke like this who is genuinely out there looking after his business, giving other people jobs and boosting export income for Australia.What is the Labor Party's policy on this? I could barely believe my ears when I heard the Leader of the Opposition asked the other day what his policy response was. His response was, firstly, basically to do nothing until the  next election and then, secondly, if Labor were to be re-elected what would he do? He would bring back Bob Hawke. The then Minister for Finance and now Leader of the Opposition would bring back his great mate Hawkie. You were in the cabinet together. You were the people who oversaw the last reform process, which cost of $420 million and never fixed the problem. You have the cheek, the audacity to suggest that we bring back Bob Hawke. We might as well bring back Laurie Brereton. If you have a problem with the deficit, if your policy is to have a surplus, bring back Kim Beazley, the $10½ billion deficit man.I conclude by re-emphasising the extent of the problems on the waterfront and the failure of the unions and the Labor Party to address our need for productivity. It was rammed home to me in what will be the rort of the day in the bulletin on the Internet and available to all. In January a ship was being stevedored in Fremantle on 21 and 22 January. It was interesting to see that in the first shift they moved 10.4 containers an hour. In the second shift the rate was 16.8 containers an hour. To show you that these blokes can really move containers when they put their minds to it, in the last shift they moved 29.7 containers an hour. For Fremantle this is basically world record stuff - 29.7 containers. - I will certainly do that, Mr Speaker. The deal basically is that you get paid for the whole shift, and if you finish early you still get paid for the whole shift. The explanation for this one was that the blokes were going to go down to the pub to see the strip show after work. They were  going to do that, and therefore they had a real incentive. The incentive was to get to the strip show at the local pub. It shows you again what an absolute outrage the latest strike action in Sydney really is.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for that question. The first thing that ought to be understood is that, when it comes to health policy, there is one thing that Kim Beazley wants to do: he wants to abolish the health insurance rebate. Every family in Australia ought to know that, if the Leader of the Opposition were to win the next election, the first thing he would do would be to abolish the health insurance rebate. Let me say to the Leader of the Opposition that there has been no double counting. The only person who did some double counting - in fact, he did more than double counting - was the Leader of the Opposition when he misled the Australian public before the last election about the size of the deficit; the man who left us with a $10½ billion deficit having gone  through the election campaign with his former leader, Mr Keating, ensuring the Australian public -  - We are talking here about health care agreements; we are not talking about payments to the states regarding dental treatment. Let me say to the Leader of the Opposition that there has been no double counting in relation to palliative care. The fact remains that the offer made by the Commonwealth government to the states at the Premiers Conference last week was by any measure a fair and generous offer. It represented an increase of 15 per cent - I repeat: it represented a 15 per cent increase - in real terms over a five-year period. For the first time, this agreement contained an adjustment factor relating to people who may drop out of private health insurance in the future. Unlike the agreement negotiated by the former government, it provided for reimbursement of $83 million a year to the states for any one per cent further reduction in the number of people covered by private health insurance.We can be absolutely certain that if we want to preserve existing membership of private health insurance funds, the last party the Australian public would embrace is the Labor Party because its first policy priority in health is to abolish the private health insurance rebate. It wants to take away from the families of Australia the $450-a-year subsidy that my government introduced in July last year.Not only has there been a real increase in the health funding grants made by the Commonwealth to the states, but also, when you look at the totality of Commonwealth payments to the states, you get a very interesting comparison. If you project forward to 1998-99 and compare that to the current financial year, you will see that the states'  total revenue, according to the fiscal outlook, is expected to rise by 1.9 per cent. About 41 per cent of the states' revenue comes from the Commonwealth all sources. The remainder of about 59 per cent comes from the states' own revenue raising sources. Interestingly enough, of that 1.9 per cent overall increase in the states' total revenue, the Commonwealth's contribution of 41 per cent will rise by three per cent in a climate of zero inflation but the states' own source revenue will rise by only 1.9 per cent.In other words, what is happening under my government is that, in relation to the payments the Commonwealth makes to the states, we are being more generous and are making a greater contribution to the states than the states themselves are prepared to make in their revenue raising efforts. In reply to the Leader of the Opposition, I will quote the member for Fremantle - it has not been often in this place that I have. There is a quote that she made when she was minister for health that caught my eye a moment ago. - I think the member for Batman, the member for Hotham and the member for Dobell will be very interested indeed when I read this. In parliament on 28 March 1995 she made this statement:It is not just that we are putting in more; the states are actually taking funding out.. . .              . . .             . . .We are seeing money going in through the Medicare agreements - very substantial increases - to provide access for public patients but the states are pulling it out of the bottom drawer.. . .              . . .             . . .The reality is that the states have not only been withdrawing effort but also, in addition to that, shifting costs to the Commonwealth budget - and also to the private health insurance funds and consumers.The reality is that when the Leader of the Opposition was the finance minister in the former government, he completely agreed with that assessment made by the then minister for health regarding the respective contributions of the Commonwealth and the states. I think the states were foolish in the  extreme to have walked out of the Premiers Conference, but I make it very clear to the patients of Australia and to the public of Australia: you will not suffer because of the petulance of the premiers. Every single dollar contained in the offer that we made will be delivered in full and on time. We will not lack generosity to the patients of Australia. We will not allow the petulant walk-out by the premiers of Australia to divert us from the obligation that we owe to the Australian people. We are increasing their hospital funding by 15 per cent in real terms.The states were irresponsible to walk out. I do not believe they served the interests of their electors and the interests of the health systems in their states. They badly let them down. I say to the Australian people: we will stand by you; we will not desert you; you will get every dollar that we have offered.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Aston for his question. I am aware of the report by the Dusseldorp Skills Forum which shows the full extent of the betrayal of young people in this country over the decade that the report covers - 1985 to 1996. It highlights the collapse in apprenticeship opportunities that occurred under the previous government. It shows the collapse in the pathway from school to full-time employment - the number of young people in full-time employment fell from 32 per cent to 17 per cent of the age group. It shows that the proportion of young people in TAFE fell from 30 per cent to 20 per cent. It shows that, in addition to the teenagers trapped in unemployment, over 100,000 teenagers were trapped in a cycle of marginal employment and unemployment or had dropped out of the labour force altogether. The report refers to the fact that opportunities had `deteriorated at an accelerating rate'. There had been a reversal of improvements  and no progress at all compared to other groups in society.The Leader of the Opposition ought to provide an explanation to the young people and parents of this country as to why he allowed this situation to develop. He was the minister for employment and the minister for education during this period, and he did nothing to address these fundamental structural problems which were being faced by young people. This report totally vindicates the government's determination to rebuild that pathway from school to employment for young people. That is why this year Australia's first national apprenticeship system is up and running. That is why this year Australia's first national literacy plan is up and running and all the states and territories have agreed to a national standard for literacy. That is why we are now bringing about a revolution in the senior years of schooling to have schools increasingly act as employment agencies for their young people, and now over 1,000 high schools are participating in this plan.The Leader of the Opposition as employment minister disadvantaged young people. Now he has the gall to want to be Prime Minister of this country. If Labor were ever to come to power, the greatest sufferers would be young people, and there is no chance the people will put you in as Prime Minister if they care for the future of young people in this country.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Lowe for his question. From the outset, I will say that the government remains committed to the long-term operating plan as far as fairly and equitably sharing and distributing aircraft noise around Sydney is concerned. I might point out to the House that on 14 February 1997 the member for Lowe actually indicated that in a release he put out. He said:The Coalition Government is delivering solutions by equitably spreading the aircraft noise burden. - He continued:I have strongly endorsed the flight plan to the minister and look forward to its early implementation.From the outset, the government has remained committed to implementing this policy without fear or favour. It is a process that is being progressively implemented and is being supported by the community and by both sides of politics. It is all about achieving the targets that we identified early in the piece. Those targets are 55 per cent of movements to the south over water - that is what the member for Lowe wants us to achieve; 17 per cent to the north - that is over his electorate, the Prime Minister's electorate, the member for Grayndler's electorate and the member for Sydney's electorate; 15 per cent to the west; and 13 per cent to the east.That is in stark contrast to the former minister, the member for Kingsford-Smith, when he had one per cent going to the east and nearly 50 per cent going to the north - 50 per cent going over the member for Lowe's electorate, 50 per cent going over the electorates of the member for Grayndler and the member for Sydney. That could not be termed as being fair. What our government has set out to achieve here, and we are well on the  way to achieving it, is a fair sharing of the noise from Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport around the clock. We are well on the way to achieving those targets, and our government will do that without fear or favour.Just recently, as I am sure the member for Lowe is well aware, as we are implementing this policy progressively, with the endorsement of the Sydney Airport Community Forum as well as with the safety checks that Airservices Australia apply to each one of the new modes of operation, there have been new modes that have been suggested by SACF, and they go exactly to the point that the member for Lowe raises - generating more take-offs and so more noise over the water, over Botany Bay. I put it to the member for Lowe that he jumped ship a bit too soon, because we are implementing what we set out to implement and we are delivering on that policy.</DOC>

 - The industrial disputes figures that came out last week show the best result since before World War I. What an interesting contrast that makes, because look at what the ACTU was saying before the last election. The Canberra Times  headline was `Union Chief Predicts IR War' and in the Age  it was `Unions Prepare for IR War'. Not to be outdone, the member for Hotham got a run. He had `Crean Backs Wage War Threat' in the Australian  a couple of days later.So before the last election we were told that, if the coalition was elected, basically it would be mayhem, there would be industrial chaos, the country would be paralysed by economic warfare orchestrated by the trade union movement. What has happened? Have we had industrial war, as predicted by the  Labor Party? No. What has happened is that we have had an outbreak of industrial peace unparalleled since records were first kept. Not only have we had the best numbers per 1,000 employees since before World War I; we have also had the actual lowest number of disputes since back to 1940, since before the Second World War.What a fantastic record that is. Of course, Labor's record makes an interesting contrast. The average number, when Labor was in office, was 190 working days lost per thousand employees. Under us it has been 74.An incident having occurred in the gallery -  - Last year the member for Canberra said that our legislation, the Workplace Relations Act, would be tested on a number of criteria, including how many disputes there were. We now hold the world record for the lowest level of industrial disputes.Why has the Workplace Relations Act been so successful? The reason is that we now have decent bans in the Trade Practices Act against sympathy strikes or secondary boycotts. The Labor Party's policy is to repeal the very provisions of the Trade Practices Act which have given us industrial harmony. They will also repeal the provisions which provide a ban on primary boycotts affecting international trade. They will also abolish, we believe, from what they said last week, the provisions which prevent people being rewarded for taking industrial provisions - the same provisions we have federally as Bob Carr has in New South Wales Labor. They would abolish the Office of the Employment Advocate, which is a great help to people who want to have real choice as to whether they are in a union or not. That is another factor which has led to industrial peace that Labor will abolish. Lastly, under our legislation, we allow people to sit down at work and harmoniously enter into an Australian workplace agreement. What is the Labor Party's policy? Their policy is to repeal that provision. Under us, we do now have record low levels of industrial disputes. That is a function of the excellent Workplace Relations Act. We now have it officially from the Labor Party that they will repeal the very provisions that have given us this fantastic outcome.</DOC>

 - We have seen the willingness of the opposition to drag into the parliament the names of specific businesses which they are seeking to vilify without any specific fact whatever. There is no cause for concern over the tender processes that have been run by the government. We have heard a reference to the amount that a particular contract might be worth. Let me repeat that no-one in the Job Network gets any money for filling a job vacancy unless a person is put into that job. Money is paid by results; it is based on performance. It is the first time that performance pay of this kind has been introduced. Let me also make the point that every successful tenderer was subjected to the most rigorous financial scrutiny. - This tenderer and every other tenderer would have been subjected to the most rigorous financial scrutiny and also rigorous scrutiny as to the quality of their particular proposals. Every tenderer was subject to scrutiny as to their experience. Where they had no previous experience in delivering labour market programs for the previous government they had to submit references that were investigated; they had to deliver a strategy to help unemployed people that had to stand out as an excellent strategy; and they had to demonstrate their capacity to give access. Thirty per cent of all the tenderers in the Job Network have been tendered to provide services to specific groups of unemployed people, including disabled people and including this -  - The people of Adelaide will have access to many more services to place unemployed people in jobs than they have had under the CES. They will have access to more specialised services. They will have access to services that are paid on results. I am not going to accept the particular facts that the member for Batman has put forward in relation to this tenderer without investigation. But I do say that it is quite inappropriate for the Labor Party to be dragging before this House the names of specific businesses which may damage them in the course of their business and which, if repeated outside the House, may subject the Labor Party to some action on the part of those businesses.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dawson for her question. At the last election the Liberal and National parties made history in this place by presiding over the largest number of women ever elected to the federal parliament. This was done without the introduction of a quota system. We have no intention of introducing a quota system to get more women into parliament, but we do have every intention of increasing the number of women in parliament.We have historically had the support of women voters in the community, and we will continue to have the support of those voters because the unprecedented number of women who have been elected to our side of this House are continuing to effectively represent the interests of women in the community. This government is also giving to Australian women issues of substance. We are looking at issues of substance for Australian women, unlike Labor, who simply talked about issues to do with women.We will not patronise women. Despite the patronising quotas and the cheap talk of Labor about getting more women into this parliament, Labor is preoccupied with a preselection process which is dominated by bitter brawls and standover tactics. The level of dissatisfaction within the Labor women's ranks is unprecedented. We have seen a public protest by Labor women in the seat of Melbourne Ports - an unprecedented public protest. They were protesting against the preselection of Michael Danby in the seat of Melbourne -  - The fact is that Labor women have spoken out. It is not the first episode we have seen in their preselection  process. Jacki Willox was forced to quit, and Mr Danby said that -  - When Labor women complained about Mr Danby's -  - As I have said, we made history in this place with the unprecedented number of women who were elected, and we have done it without quotas and we have done it without the so-called Emily's List. I note with interest that the Labor Party have said they will now use $40,000 from Emily's List to inquire into why women are not supporting the Labor Party. Mr Speaker, I can tell you why they are not supporting Labor. - It is these kinds of patronising processes that send a very strong signal to women out in the community that Labor have turned their backs on women, and that is something that we will not do. We will put in place processes that support women and address the real issues that affect women and their lives.</DOC>

 - I am interested that the member for Canberra has asked that question. Can I just say a couple of things in reply. The first thing I would say in reply is: what did you do for the 13 years that you were in power? Nothing. -  - What did you do? You drove unemployment to 11.3 per cent, you created the greatest postwar recession in Australia's history and you have the nerve to get up -  - After 13 years in office you in the Labor Party bequeathed to us the  very law that you are now saying should be further changed. Once again it is a matter that you were going to do it in the fourteenth year. You had 13 years to fix the law; you did absolutely nothing to fix it and now you are turning around and you are saying that we ought to do something in our first two years that you refused to do for the 13 years that you were in power.The only mate you have left in office - and that is Bob Carr - has huffed and puffed about this. I think it is very interesting. This is the priority the Labor Party really has on this issue. Bob Carr wrote to me before the Premiers Conference and he said, `Would you mind listing this on the agenda of the Premiers Conference?' I wrote back and said, `Yes, I am happy to discuss it.' What happened? He spat the dummy and walked out before we reached it.Not only did certain premiers walk out because they did not want to discuss guns but, in the case of Bob Carr, he walked out because he was not sincere. He was totally and utterly insincere. Bob Carr is the master of release first and sign later. The letters he writes to me are in the press gallery before he has signed them. That is his normal practice. Can I say in relation to the substance of the issue which I and I think are all members on my side of the House are genuinely interested in - we are not posturing on it - that I have done a number of things. In relation to the latest Woodlawn incident, we are doing what we have done in relation to Cobar; that is, institute an ASC examination of the activities of the company concerned.You know that when you were in government you examined the possibility of altering the order of application of assets in the event of the insolvency of a company - and you as a Labor government specifically rejected doing the very thing that the retrenched workers are now asking us to do. Let me repeat that for the benefit of the parliament and for the benefit of the member for Canberra: you examined this issue and you specifically rejected the idea of altering the order of the application of assets so that retrenchment pay would rank ahead of secured creditors. You did that for solid com  mercial reasons. You are a hypocrite for now suggesting that we should do it.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Macquarie for his question. I have seen several reports on this subject. -  - You are not suggesting that I take either of the two former Ministers for Defence instead, are you? There was a report in the Age  this morning which suggests that the Prime Minister is expected to announce on Anzac Day the withdrawal of our troops, to apply not long after that. It is news to the Prime Minister and it is news to me; and it is utterly without foundation. When these reports come forward, they should be knocked down.The Australian government took the decision to commit a contingent to the Gulf, based on our grave concerns about Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. UNSCOM must be allowed to do its job, to meet the United Nations obligations under the UN Security Council resolutions, in particular 678 and 687. We will be there for as long as it takes. As at 23 March, today, there were 168 Australians deployed overseas on this operation. Of these, 167 are in the coalition area of operations. We have Special Forces personnel there together with the New Zealanders - we have 94 and they have 23. They are in Kuwait and some of them are patrolling the Kuwait border and on mounted patrols. When Iraq provides unfettered access to the sites and is prepared to allow UNSCOM to complete its work then the coalition will, in consultation with our partners, look at withdrawing our forces - but not before. I have recently spoken to the US Secretary for Defense, Bill Cohen, and he has  verified that the Americans will be in the Gulf, as will we, for as long as it takes.</DOC>

 - Can I say, in relation to the last part of the question, that it has long been the practice of both sides of politics that in relation to the details of disclosures that are made by ministers to prime ministers - and this was a practice followed by both my Labor predecessors and also by the former Liberal Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser - that documentation is kept confidential. I do not intend to table any of that information any more than Bob Hawke, Paul Keating or Malcolm Fraser would have tabled any of it. I think the idea that we should be tabling that kind of information is absolutely ridiculous. The answer, therefore, is no.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Sturt for his question. It truly would be a tragedy if the Senate rejected again the government's bill to provide an exemption for small business from the operations of the unfair dismissal law. It was Rob Bastian of COSBOA who said some time ago that the passage of this legislation would encourage the small busi  ness community to create something like 50,000 jobs. The refusal by the Senate to pass this legislation will cost Australian jobs to the tune of 50,000. Therefore the onus is on the Labor Party and the Democrats to think again about this legislation and pass it.The Labor Party would have you believe that this matter is a low priority, that it is of little interest to the small business community. All the evidence is irrefutable on this issue: it is a matter of real significance to the small business community. We have helped a lot with the Workplace Relations Act changes that we have already made. The number of applications in the federal jurisdiction is down by half, so there are something like 7,000 or 8,000 businesses out there that today do not have an unfair dismissal claim because of the changes we have already made.Small business is different from big business and the parliament should recognise that. It is time we had a fair break for the small business community. The State Chamber of Commerce in New South Wales has just released a survey. In a press release dated yesterday it says:An overwhelming 85% of small businesses have nominated unfair dismissals as a key factor affecting businesses with 15 or fewer employees.It also says:Over 42% of businesses believed that the prospect of an unfair dismissal claim was a deterrent to employing more staff.Katie Lahey, who runs the chamber, also said:One third of the businesses interviewed indicated that they had experience with an unfair dismissal claim and of these 51% felt that the current law was a deterrent to employing new staff.This is just commonsense backed up by clear, unequivocal survey evidence which proves it. Yesterday the Sun-Herald  reported a survey from Recruitment Solutions. It was a survey of the pharmaceutical companies and related industry sector. The Sun-Herald  report says this:The survey taken over the past three months showed 22.2 per cent of companies in pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, chemicals, engineering and health care cancelled or suspended plans to recruit a permanent staff member as a direct result of the unfair dismissal legislation. If the Labor Party again refuse this sensible measure for the benefit of the small business community - a measure which would create 50,000 jobs in the small business community - they will reveal again the incredible political cynicism which lies behind their policy. This is against the interests of small business. Anybody who genuinely wants to see more jobs created should vote for this measure and anybody who votes against it, as the Labor Party are determined to, is simply not fair dinkum when it comes to creating jobs.</DOC>

 - The situation is that I have been informed that the shares held by QCMM (ESP) were disposed of before Senator Parer became a minister. I repeat: they were disposed of before Senator Parer became minister. Is the member for Hotham claiming that somebody who became a minister in March 1996 is in some way to be criticised for a commercial interest he may indirectly have had -  - No amount of flustered hectoring from the member for Hotham can alter the fact that you owe the parliament an explanation as to why you made a false allegation. You owe the parliament an explanation. My advice is that those shares were sold before he became a minister. - Noise is no substitute for substance. According to my advice, these shares were sold in 1995, before Senator Parer became a minister. As to what Senator Parer said in the Senate yesterday, I will have a look at what Senator Parer said. I have long since learnt not to take the word of the member for Hotham for what somebody says in another chamber.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Wakefield for that question. As I know all members of the parliament are aware and the Australian public is aware, the agreement willingly and freely entered into by all states and territories and the Commonwealth in 1996 brought to this country an unprecedented prohibition on the possession and use of dangerous firearms and was in  response to an outraged Australian community in the wake of the Port Arthur tragedy. That particular decision represented a collective determination by the governments of Australia, representing the people of Australia, to reject in this country the gun culture and to avoid Australia going down the path of the United States.I think it is fair to say that, overwhelmingly, that agreement has worked well; that there have been hundreds of thousands of weapons reclaimed in the buyback, which was financed by a special Medicare levy; that those weapons have been destroyed; and that Australia is undeniably a safer country, particularly for women and children, than it was before the nationwide agreement was concluded in 1996. It is therefore a matter of some concern to my government, and I think it would be a matter of concern to all members of this House, that there are some signs that some jurisdictions are endeavouring - however much at the periphery that endeavour may be - to water down in some way the national agreement.I want to say on behalf of the government that we are totally opposed to any watering down of the national agreement. It had been my intention at the Premiers Conference last Friday to put a proposition to the premiers and chief ministers to the effect that, firstly, all present should endorse the national agreement concluded in 1996, that there should be an examination and a report to the next COAG meeting about the extent of compliance with that agreement by the various jurisdictions and that in the meantime no state or territory government should take any action at all that could be regarded as watering down the agreement.It is now a matter of record that the premiers and chief ministers chose to leave that meeting and deliberately rejected my suggestion that the matter should be discussed. As a consequence of that, I have examined what steps can be taken by the Commonwealth to further strengthen observance of that agreement, having in mind the fact that the Commonwealth has no direct constitutional power to prohibit the sale of firearms in the various states. As a result of that, any action  that we might be able to take under existing constitutional power would be limited to our authority regarding customs and some other matters, perhaps including the taxation power.I am therefore pleased to inform the House that as a first step the government will be putting a recommendation to His Excellency the Governor-General this afternoon so that, with effect from midnight tonight, there will be a ban introduced on the importation of weapons designated as category C in the 1996 agreement. The two exceptions allowed under that agreement are primary producers, subject to a police authorisation test which requires the police to certify that the user is a primary producer; and, secondly, sporting shooters, subject to a test that they meet the narrow exception for clay target shooters in the agreement. That will require the written authority of the Commonwealth Attorney-General.The amendments to the customs regulation will also allow licensed dealers to import a limited number of such firearms to be kept in bond for use by individuals who meet the tests and to take effect once appropriate custodial arrangements are in place. That is the first step being taken by the government to further strengthen compliance with the agreement.Let me say again to the states, let me say again to the premiers of all states, that the overwhelming desire of the Australian people, wherever they live, is to have full compliance with this agreement. We have limited constitutional power in this matter; the states have most of the constitutional power. I say again: we will use all of the constitutional power we have to enforce observance of the agreement. I hope a like attitude is taken by all premiers and all chief ministers.</DOC>

 - I will come to that but, before I do, I would like to, if I may, deal with a question that the member asked me yesterday. He asked me a question about Senator Parer and Kiskin. He asked me to tell the House whether Senate Parer told me that his $2 million holding in QCMM also involved 100 per cent ownership of a subsidiary called Kiskin.The situation is that there is a holding in Kiskin by the Parer family trust and that represents about two to 2½ per cent of Kiskin. As Senator Parer, I understand, told the Senate yesterday, the acquisition of the shares in Pan Aust. took place without any knowledge at all by Senator Parer. That was perfectly obvious because Senator Parer was not in fact involved in any way in the operation of QCMM when the acquisition took place.As the Leader of the Opposition will be aware, and as others in the opposition will be aware, the draft proposal regarding blind trusts that was circulated to the opposition and to the Leader of the Australian Democrats at the time quite correctly made the observation that references in guidelines to families ought to imply and ought to state that those references are meant to include spouses and children who are dependent upon the person who makes the transfer.Let me say to the honourable member for Perth that the whole purpose of the prohibition is to prevent a situation where somebody transfers nominal ownership of something to a body or a group of people over whom he has control. That is self-evidently the case with dependent children. When you have made a transfer to adult children, which is the situation in relation to Senator Parer, that clearly does not apply. - Could I further say to the honourable member for Perth -  -  - That debate can, in any event, be put to one side. The reality is that, for the circumstances that I explained on the first occasion when this matter was raised, Senator Parer has not been involved in any conflict of interest. The reality is that Senator Parer has not used his ministerial position to advantage his interests or the interests of his children. Senator Parer has not been guilty of any dishonesty. Senator Parer has not been involved in any conflict of interest. You have had now 2½ weeks to find a conflict of interest. You have totally failed and in the process you have deliberately misled the Australian parliament.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Deakin for his question. I appreciate very much the interest that the member for Deakin displays in immigration questions and the constructive approach he takes on these matters. I am aware of the tragic case involving the student who died on the Gold Coast over this last week.The first point I would like to make in relation to the immigration program itself is that all migrants and long-term entrants to Australia are required to meet stringent health criteria that are designed to protect the Australian community and designed to protect us particularly from active tuberculosis where there is the possibility of transmission to other people.Those measures, which have been in place over a long period of time, are a very important part of the immigration program. In this particular case, the student was assessed, X-rays were taken and those X-rays divulged that he was suffering active TB. Unfortunately, he had been visaed incorrectly before that particular information had been received by the overseas post. That visaing should not have occurred. It had a tragic outcome for the student because he would have obviously been able to be treated if it had become known at an appropriate time. Certainly, that would have been the case because this was some seven months before he died.It was a tragic loss of his life, and it disclosed a number of irregularities which I will draw to your attention. First, a locally engaged staffer had the authority to deal with student visas. That locally engaged staffer incorrectly issued a visa without that information being taken into account. That locally engaged staffer has now been dismissed, because, quite clearly, he was not -  - I might say to the honourable member for Denison that it is a very tortuous route you go down if you want to go down that path and look at the nature of the  delegations that were put in place under you and your colleagues -  - Which I have been systematically reviewing and continuing to review to put right what has occurred. But I do not think you want to go down that path.There are further matters that are the subject of investigation, because this matter is of very serious concern. As a result of what we have discovered in relation to this matter, we have now embarked upon systematically checking, urgently, all of the visas that have been issued to students over the last 12 months, starting particularly in New Delhi, but also following those posts where TB is known to be a factor. We will then move to check all students who have been visaed because we want to be assured that there are no other students who have entered Australia in these circumstances.The further step that I have ordered to be taken is that from today all health deferrals issued by the Health Assessment Service in Australia will be entered on my department's movement alert list. That should ensure that even if a person receives a visa in future inappropriately, they will not be able to be entered into Australia because they will be on the movement alert list. This is a very important step. I want to assure the House that I regard health testing as absolutely crucial to being able to maintain an efficacious system.One ought not to be alarmist in relation to these matters because there is little evidence that there is significant transmission of active TB to the Australian born population from visitors or migrants overseas. In fact, it is more likely that contact is liable if somebody is travelling outside of Australia and meeting with people in other places where they are likely to have TB.The further information I would like to provide to the House is that the data from the national micro-bacterial surveillance scheme shows that Australia has experienced no increase in the incidence of tuberculosis over the last 20 years. In fact, over the last 10 years the incidence of tuberculosis has re  mained at between five and six cases per 100,000. This is the lowest rate in the world, equalled only by Norway.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his  question. I have some good news for him. We have been determined to get more doctors into rural areas, as evidenced by the fact that we were prepared to have a substantial fight with the organised medical profession to introduce legislation in December 1996 that would make sure that doctors were fully trained before going into general practice.We have also instituted a number of reforms since coming to government, such as the John Flynn scholarships. Today 10 per cent of the medical students in Australia are on these scholarships, which give them exposure to rural and remote practice. By the end of the year, 20 per cent of all the medical  students in Australia will be on such scholarships. We have allowed tax deductibility for communities supporting someone from their area to go to medical school. We have established departments of rural health, and we have improved arrangements for locum relief.I have just been made aware of the figures for the number of doctors practising in rural and remote areas for 1997 over 1996. Australia-wide, the number of GPs practising in urban areas dropped slightly, down 0.7 per cent. The number of GPs practising in rural areas went up four per cent in 1997 and the number of GPs practising in remote Australia went up nine per cent in March 1997.The pattern shows that what we are seeing is a lot of doctors who have not quite finished their training working in remote areas for a period of time. Even when you look at full-time equivalent doctors, for the first time in very many years in 1997 we had more doctors going into rural and remote areas than was the population growth in those areas. It is a good start. We clearly need to do a lot more, but it is a very welcome success.</DOC>

 - Another example that this is nothing new; just a repackaging. As you have not given me a new question, let me give you the bottom line of this whole situation. Senator Parer has done nothing as a minister which has in any way advantaged himself or any member of his family. Let me say that again: Senator Parer has not used his  position as a minister to enrich himself or any member of his family. While he has been a minister, Senator Parer has not derived any income at all from any resource investments; Senator Parer has not been involved in any conflict of interest; Senator Parer has not done anything dishonest; and, on top of that, Senator Parer is a minister of great ability, and he continues to have my total support.</DOC>

 - Thank you, Mr Speaker, for allowing me to answer a question on interest rates. You will never get a question on interest rates out of the Labor Party in the House of Representatives; you will never get a question about tax out of the Labor Party; you will never get a question about jobs out of the Labor Party; and you will never get a question about debt out of the Labor Party. And, when you do get a question about interest rates, you have the brains trust of the Labor Party trying to prevent it from being answered. I welcome the fact that there are, on this side of the parliament, people who are interested in the things that the Australian public is interested in, particularly interest  rates - and the member for North Sydney in particular.The member for North Sydney draws attention to the fact that there is a very low difference between long-term interest rates here in Australia compared to the United States. It was not always the case. In March 1996, Australian investors were paying 2.2 percentage points more in interest rates than they were in the United States. That was in March 1996. After the government brought down its first budget in August 1996 and set out a path to take the Australian economy back into low inflation growth with a budget coming back into balance, the differential had fallen to 0.5 percentage points - about a quarter. Today, as the government goes about its fiscal repair target, the differential is minimal, at only 0.2 percentage points. That is great news for Australians. No longer do Australians have to pay more for their interest rates than Americans or other people in other parts of the world. Why? Because we are making the big economic decisions. It reflects the fact that our policies have given the lowest inflation rate amongst industrialised nations, an economic growth rate which is amongst the highest in the developed world and a budget which is due to move into surplus for the first time in a decade. It is good news for Australian home buyers.We also look at the situation at the moment where we face one of the big challenges we have not faced in this country for a long time - the Asian financial downturn - something that no other Australian government had to grapple with in the last two decades. As you get weaker external demand with the strong internal demand, you will have pressure on the current account, a point that I have made on a number of occasions. But the good thing about the situation we now find ourselves in is that we go into this cyclical turn with much stronger financial fundamentals. In 1994-95, during the current account blow-out, the differential on interest rates was 2.5 percentage points; today it is 0.2. In the 1998-99 blow-out on the current account, the differential was 4¾ percentage points; now it is 0.2. And in the 1985-86 banana republic Labor first current account  crisis the differential on the interest rates was 6½ percentage points. That was the first current account deficit crisis of Keating-Beazley Labor. At the moment it is 0.2 per cent compared to a position of 6½ percentage points.You might say that with good, strong growth, with low inflation, with a budget coming back into balance, and with the lowest standard variable mortgage rates that we have seen in the last 30 years, there are a lot of people who are going to say, `Perhaps you could risk the irresponsibility of Labor again.' But you cannot; people have got to know this. The Labor Party still has the same policy: unfunded promises, a budget deficit, a build-up of debt - pushing up interest rates and pushing up the burdens on Australian home buyers. I say this to the Australian home buyers, the people who are saving nearly $3,000 a year in relation to their mortgage interest rates: you cannot trust Labor. They have not learned a thing. And now is not the time to risk your financial affairs on an incompetent group like the Labor Party.</DOC>

 - The Leader of the Opposition has asked - what is it? - the sixth or seventh question - not on interest rates, not on unemployment, not on health, not on anything that has any relevance to the mainstream of the Australian community. - All of the questions that have been asked by the opposition so far this question time are irrelevant to the mainstream interests of the Australian community. They are absolutely irrelevant. Mr Speaker, the code has been published and I have said repeatedly that the ministerial guidelines are a guide; they are not a death sentence. I have said that repeatedly before and I will say it again. -  - I will also say to those who continue to interject opposite that the intelligent, commonsense thing to do in relation to guidelines is to look at the quality and the substance of an individual's behaviour. I say again that Senator Parer has done nothing that has in any way advanced his interests or the interests of his family. He has not been engaged in any dishonest conduct. He has not received any income stream and as far as I am concerned he remains a highly competent and respected member of my ministry.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Boothby for his question. The member for Batman yesterday got up in this House and made sweeping allegations about Workskil Inc. Of course, the member for Batman was running true to form; he was wrong on every count of the claims that he made. He is very reliable: he is always wrong. These comments were completely misleading and irresponsible. Not surprisingly, when the journalist rang up yesterday after question time and talked to Workskil they found that the organisation was not guilty of the charges which the member  for Batman had made. The organisation is financially viable.The member for Batman criticised in particular the fact that the government had awarded a contract to this organisation - a contract that he said could be worth around $7 million. He said that it was simply irresponsible to award a contract that could be worth this. Admittedly, in our case, if someone gets a job then Workskil gets paid, but he said it was irresponsible to award this contract.I have done a bit of investigation into the contract history of this organisation with the government. We have checked the facts, which the member for Batman has not done. I have discovered that Workskil Inc. was awarded contracts by the previous Labor government. How much were these contracts worth? Were they worth $50,000 or $1 million, perhaps? Four million dollars? Eight million dollars? Ten million dollars? Fourteen million dollars in contracts were awarded to this organisation by the party which says that the government should not enter a contract with them.Not satisfied with this scurrilous attack, he then went on to condemn the premises of this organisation as being unsuitable premises for an organisation wanting to help unemployed people. Of course, as we know, the member for Batman never does any research into these questions. If he had actually travelled there and visited the premises of this organisation, he would have seen on the wall a bright shining plaque which says, `Opened by the Honourable Simon Crean on 1 February 1996.' I can see that the member for Hotham remembers. He looked rather queasy yesterday. And I thought the solidarity between these presidents of the ACTU was much better. Just give him a few tips next time.The member for Batman has no credibility. He just bungles away. They have no plans to help the unemployed - no policies. We have a plan and we are putting it into effect.</DOC>

I go and have a look at what I have said in context. Again I say to the Leader of the Opposition, and I will keep repeating this because it goes to the very substance of what this issue is all about: at no stage has Senator Parer done anything where he has enriched himself or his family or in any way advantaged himself and his family as a result of his ministerial position. That is point No. 1.Point No. 2 is that he has not received any income from the resource investments that have been referred to during the course of this saga. Point No. 3 is that he has not been involved in any conflict of interest. He remains a competent minister, he remains an entirely honest person, and he retains my full support. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Lindsay for her question. I am pleased to have a chance to answer a question about the waterfront. Perhaps after he has been Leader of the Opposition for 10 years the Leader of the Opposition might work out how to run tactics during question time. This dispute and industrial action in Port Botany is certainly serious indeed. In fact, we have seen now a running campaign of industrial action by the MUA against Patricks in a campaign of vengeance and greed against their own employer for the fact that the union is opposed to the actions of Patricks in subletting a part of their property to allow the farmers to establish a new business.This government fully supports the right of the farmers to set up a new and competitive business and we wish them well. It is about time we had a bit of decent competition on the Australian waterfront. As for this weak and pathetic Leader of the Opposition, his very own party conference resolved to support  competition on the Australian waterfront, yet, when John Coombs rang you up and gave you your starting orders, you walked away from your own party resolution. There is no clearer example of the weakness and the pathetic lack of leadership we have from these people -  - Mr Speaker, I am delighted to address my remarks to you because, as a distinguished member of the Australian parliament, there will be, I am sure, no question in your mind about the extent of damage being done by the MUA, supported by the Labor Party, in the campaign of industrial action they are running against their own employer.Just look at the facts. We have now got delays on clearing imported goods of seven days. We have got delays costing shipping lines $25,000 a day. We have got shipping customers who are facing the dreadfully debilitating circumstances of being held up in the operations of their shipping schedules and the containers being reshuffled at Patricks' expense. -  - The excited interjections we have from the opposition show you what an embarrassing issue this is for these people. I address my remarks through you, Mr Speaker, to the Australian people. I say particularly to exporters and to importers that the government stands shoulder to shoulder with those who are in the business of exporting and we will stand shoulder to shoulder with all those Australians whose jobs rely on having an efficient waterfront. Where do the Labor Party stand? They stand shoulder to shoulder with the MUA. That is why they are unable to condemn this outrageous industrial action by their mates in the MUA, and their only response is a series of pathetic juvenile interjections from a crowd who are unable to state the public interest and who sit weakly behind this weak and pathetic leader.As this may be the last question and answer during question time, let me take the opportunity to go on and say that the latest excuse  from the MUA for taking industrial action is that they want to be paid while they are taking industrial action. What that does is bring them in conflict with the Workplace Relations Act, which under its provisions ensures that people are not rewarded for taking industrial action.I understand the impatience of the Leader of the Opposition, who wants to get onto other matters, but let me assure him that the embarrassment of your position on the waterfront is going to be placed in front of you so that you cannot forget and so that you cannot walk away from the embarrassment of your position. - I may go to 3 o'clock because, to be relevant to the question that has been put to me, a full and comprehensive answer, to the embarrassment of the Labor Party, is hereby required. The point about the Workplace Relations Act is that -  -  - Mr Speaker, let their interjections flow. Let the level of their response escalate, because it demonstrates -  - Mr Speaker, I appreciate your support. - I will, Mr Speaker. I conclude by making this point: all through this dispute we have seen the effective operations of the government's Workplace Relations Act, whether or not it is the Trade Practices Act bans on secondary boycotts or, in this most latest episode, the bans which prevent companies rewarding employees for taking industrial action - which is, from the MUA, the reason for this week's industrial action. - I am concluding. The stevedoring industry award provides a requirement that overtime be worked, and they have imposed a ban on overtime. So, clause 22 of the stevedoring industry award ends up as catch-22 for the union when dealing with this issue. Unlike the opposition, we condemn this industrial action.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for the question. I think it is a very apposite question, given not only the report of the Taxation Office but also the matter of public importance that appears in the name of the newly rediscovered Deputy Leader of the Opposition, who is sort of trying to get back into the game after having been put in the shade a bit. He did not get much of the sort of conflict of interest actions, so he decided he wanted to get back into the game on this.The other important aspect of this is the report of the Commissioner of Taxation about the growth of trusts in Australia. One of the most interesting things, of course, is that the Commissioner of Taxation's report entirely relates to the period that the Labor Party was  in office before the last election. So let it first be understood that trusts exploded under Labor. It is under Labor that trusts exploded, and in case the Deputy Leader of the Opposition or indeed any other members of the opposition are minded to say, `What are you going to do about trusts?' I will reply, `Why didn't you do something about them over the last 13 years?' No doubt the retort will come back, `Oh, we were gonna do it in the 14th year.'Let me say that again: if there is any argument about the explosion of the uses of trusts in this country, if there is to be criticism of that, that is a damning indictment of the administrative performance of the former Labor government, because it was under Labor that trusts became a fast growing industry. It was under Labor, if there are any alleged abuses claimed in relation to trusts, that those abuses occurred.I want to say on behalf of the government that we naturally do not accept responsibility for what occurred under Labor, but once again, as with the deficit, although we were not responsible, we will endeavour to fix problems and we will endeavour to fix abuses.	We had to fix the deficit. The Leader of the Opposition left us with a $10½ billion deficit. We not only had to fix that deficit but had to face obstructive tactics from the Labor Party in our efforts to fix that deficit.Let me go further and make it very plain: our attitude in relation to any tax avoidance practices is that they will be addressed, and they will be addressed properly. I remind the parliament that only two nights ago the Senate passed some government legislation which prohibited trafficking in trust losses. That was an earnest of my government's determination to stamp out abuses, whether they occur under family trusts or whether they occur under any other area. May I repeat to the parliament, for the benefit particularly of the opposition, that the attitude of my government in relation to the taxation issue and in relation to family trusts is that the government parties in any taxation changes we make will not be acting in a manner which would seriously damage, or indeed damage at all, the small business community.I also want to make it clear that we will take, if necessary, action against the abuse of trusts. We have always taken action against the abuse of trusts, and that will be the attitude we will bring to the formulation of our taxation policy. But let there be no cant and humbug from the opposition: it was under the Labor Party that the use of trusts exploded. The report of the Commissioner of Taxation was not about our period in office. Trusts did not arrive on the Australian political scene on 2 March 1996; they burgeoned, they flourished, they grew like wildflowers under the Keating and the Hawke administrations, and any attempt to pretend otherwise is absolute humbug.</DOC>

 - I have seen the letter issued by the Clerk of the Senate. The Clerk of the Senate issues letters from time to time on a miscellany of subjects. Some of those letters are accurate and some of them are not so accurate. One that I saw recently about section 57 of the constitution, according to the legal advice the government has received, was quite inaccurate. I will be analysing Mr Evans's letter in relation to the matter that he spoke of yesterday. As to the other part of the honourable gentleman's question, just as I like to satisfy myself about the accuracy of quotes made in relation to my colleagues, I will do the same in relation to him.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Eden-Monaro for his question. The Labor Party, the Democrats and the Independents have today rejected the government's bill which would have provided an exemption for small business from the unfair dismissal laws. In doing so, I think it is fair to say that the Labor Party have destroyed their credibility on the jobs issue. This was a measure which was aimed at providing opportunity and encouragement to the small business community to give people jobs. It has been estimated by small business itself that the passage of this legislation would have created 50,000 jobs. -  - You can tell from the interjections on the other side that the Labor Party think this is a smart political game to play. The Labor Party think that if they do what the ACTU tells them this is somehow smart politics and this justifies their rejection of this proposal. Today the Labor Party have not rejected the government; they have rejected small business. You have rejected the 50,000 people who now will not get a job because of your weak policy. That is the consequence of this. The Labor Party would tell you that they are concerned about unemployment. When they get a chance to actually vote to give somebody a job, what do they do? They play politics and vote against a measure which by any reasonable standard was a fair and commonsense proposal to give people a chance of a job.This issue has been around for some considerable time. The opposition say, `Where is the evidence for the benefit of this particular proposal?' The evidence to justify this particular proposal is absolutely overwhelming. The small business community itself has made it clear that they would create more jobs. COSBOA, the Council of Small Business Organisations of Australia, said that this measure, if passed, would create 50,000 jobs.  The 50 major small business organisations which form the Small Business Coalition met in Canberra last month and they unanimously supported this proposal. The micro-business consultative group, which had on it people who were nominated by the Labor Party, unanimously supported this proposal.This is genuinely a very sad day, as the Labor Party has rejected the opportunity for 50,000 people to get a job. It destroys their credibility on jobs. It shows us that the hypocrisy of the Labor Party is now complete on this issue. Their credibility is in tatters. It reveals again that when we need some national leadership and we look to the Leader of the Opposition we find a person unable to speak on behalf of the 50,000 people who would have got jobs from this change.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, I might rhetorically ask through you, if I may, why did you not disclose to the parliament when you asked that question that the very same announcement to which you referred said in its first paragraph that a resolution was passed by QCMM Group on 31 October 1995? In other words, the transfer took place before Senator Parer became a minister. The fact that the transfer was not registered until after he became a minister is no fault of Senator Parer's. - I table the document.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I think it is very instructive that, since the parliament resumed this week, we have not had one question from the Labor Party about reform of the waterfront. We have had no question about the most important industrial relations issue facing Australia in 1998. There is a very simple reason for that and that is that the Labor Party, and particularly its leader, is scared stiff of the issue of reform of the Australian waterfront.The problem is that the Leader of the Opposition is bound to the Maritime Union of Australia. The Leader of the Opposition does not have the courage to stand up for the public interest against the bullying tactics of the Maritime Union of Australia. You never hear the Leader of the Opposition condemning the bullying tactics. You never hear the Leader of the Opposition speaking out in favour of reform in the national interest. All he does is say, `Let's have another meeting.' When you were in government you had a meeting on taxation and that collapsed. You had a meeting on native title and that ended up with the 1993 native title mess that we now have the responsibility for sorting out.Waterfront strikes are nine times higher than the national average across all industries. Despite the fact that the Labor Party spent over $400 million of the Australian taxpayer's money on an absolutely useless, pointless and unproductive reform process for the Australian waterfront, the Australian waterfront has suffered scandalous levels of productivity and scandalous levels of uncompetitiveness and has been way behind the standards required to make this nation a truly competitive export country. Despite all of that, what is the answer of the Leader of the Opposition? The answer of the Leader of the Opposition is to  march down the road, bound to John Coombs, the Secretary of the Maritime Union of Australia.This is what the Leader of the Opposition had to say, this is what the alternative Prime Minister had to say, on 2 February 1998 on 3AW:If you look at the record of the last eight years, one after another those bad practices have fallen over.What an extraordinary sort of tick to give. What an extraordinary blank cheque to give to a union whose record of industrial thuggery is reaching its height in the way in which it is behaving in relation to Patricks at the present time. What do you hear from the Leader of the Opposition? Instead of getting up and condemning the Maritime Union of Australia in the public interest, instead of standing up for Australians and instead of standing up for the battlers of the trade union movement instead of the MUA, who are the elite of the trade union movement, what does the Leader of the Opposition do? The Leader of the Opposition puts his hand up and says, `It's perfectly all right. Don't anybody worry, I will fix the waterfront. I will solve all of these problems. I will do what has not been done for the last 30 years. If I happen to get elected at the next election, I have a solution: I'll have a meeting.'That was the solution that Bob Hawke offered us; $420 million later we still had an unproductive waterfront, $420 million later we were still uncompetitive and $420 million later our crane rate was 18 a day versus 30, which is the average of our Asian competitors. The Labor Party, because it is bound hand and foot to the trade union movement of Australia, has no answer, no suggestion, no policy and no decent alternative on the waterfront because it is hopelessly bound, hand and foot, to the Maritime Union of Australia.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I respect the work of the member with regard to building on our export efforts, particularly from the Central Coast area of New South Wales.I am pleased to be able to inform the House that Seafreight, the official journal of Liner Shipping Services, the body representing Australian shipping interests, recently reported a survey of 750 businesses by the New South Wales Chamber of Commerce on the waterfront. In answer to four questions, which I  draw to the attention of the House, the following was the response: `Do you believe the overall performance of the Sydney waterfront is unreliable?' Yes - 81 per cent. `Do you believe this waterfront performance is inhibiting your business growth?' Yes - 81 per cent. `Do you support the introduction of competition on the waterfront?' Yes - 88 per cent. `Do you support the federal government in pushing for waterfront reform, even if it meant disputation and disruption on the waterfront?' A resounding yes - 90 per cent.That is the level of support. That is why Australian exporters' support for waterfront reform is not just comprehensive, not just widespread but absolutely overwhelming. -  - Clearly they are very sensitive about this issue - no questions, no policy, no commitment and no achievement in their 13 years of government with regard to waterfront reform.There is another poll relevant to the answer to the member's question. I refer to the Rural Press farmpoll in The Land of 12 February. In that poll the question was asked: `Do you support the NFF setting up its own stevedoring operation?' The answer from cropping farmers was yes, 86 per cent; from woolgrowers was yes, 94 per cent; from beef producers was yes, 90 per cent; from dairy farmer was yes, 94 per cent; total farmers in support of the NFF stevedoring operation, another resounding yes, with 90 per cent.The support continues to roll in. In a media release from the Australian Meat Council dated 25 March, Executive Director Christopher Creal said that the red meat export industry is fully in support of a competitive waterfront marketplace and, effectively, the sooner the better.Yes, I am honest enough to admit there was a little bit of static - not from this mob with any effect - on AM this morning. I just happen to have a letter from R. J. Quirk, Executive Director of the Australian Council of Wool Exporters Inc. I quote from the letter:Further to our conversation earlier today, I would confirm that the wool exporting community totally disassociates itself from the recent comments made by Mr Frank Beaufort regarding Patrick Stevedores. The coalition government, including the minister, Peter Reith, are trying to get our waterfront truly internationally competitive - and the sooner the better for the sake of all our exporters. To all of this I would add just one other thing. -  - We support fair pay for fair work and we support every shift on the waterfront being as productive as the stripper shifts, and the sooner the better.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Moreton. I have had some correspondence. I got a letter the other day from a wharfie in Brisbane - probably from the member's electorate. The letter said, `I'm sick of the government misrepresenting how much we earn.' He went on to say, `I don't earn $90,000, and for proof of it I will tell you what I earned last year. It was $80,414.'We have had a lot of correspondence on this issue. The correspondence is providing overwhelming support for the government's support for waterfront reform. The State Chamber of Commerce had a very good poll out yesterday on this question of support for reform. It is an interesting one which reflects public opinion. I quote from the press release from the executive director. It says:According to the survey, support for the Federal Government has risen from 34% in the last quarter to 50.8% in the March quarter - according to Katie Lahey - The Prime Minister's personal support level rose from 38% to 46.5% - which is no surprise because she gives the explanation. She says:The Howard Government's willingness to actively pursue tax reform and to confront problems on the waterfront may have played a part in this increase in support . . . That is no surprise because this government and this Prime Minister have taken the lead to ensure that Australia's waterfront problems are finally confronted and finally fixed. One of the reasons for widespread support for the government's program is that, whilst we like to see somebody earning a decent pay packet - of course we do, and it is our policy that people should earn more - in return for earning a decent pay packet we expect people to put in a decent day's work. -  - The truth is that on the Australian waterfront the average wharfie is  on a very good wicket indeed. The member asked whether there is independent evidence on this issue. There is -  -  - There is an analysis - and no amount of interjection can drown me out. It is a report prepared by the authoritative -  - Resuming quietly, in answer to the question that has been put to me, the National Institute of Labour Studies have done a report on this. What they show is that the average wage is $71,000 and $73,800 at Port Botany. In comparison to others in the Australian community, a nurse's average salary would be around $43,000. A nurse, of course, would put in a lot more hours than the average wharfie.John Coombs - I call him `Chardonnay Coombs' because he has his weekender and grows chardonnay grapes; good luck to him - likes to contest the figures. Continuing to speak quietly, the breakdown for the average weekly hours of a crane driver in Fremantle is 50.3 hours. But, of that, relief time and other duties is 14 hours; holidays and sick leave - and remember you get 22½ per cent, which is the increment for these guys - is 10½ hours; idle time and training 8½ hours;  and meal breaks 3.2 hours. So, therefore, they spend 14.1 hours a week on the crane for an average annual salary of $90,000. It is a pretty good wicket. Whilst there are skills involved in being a crane driver on the Australian waterfront, quite frankly, it is not such a difficult and burdensome task.I want to conclude by paying tribute to Carmel Egan, who is a female journalist with a major Australian news outfit. She went down to Webb Dock and obtained her certificate to drive a portainer. There are two interesting things there: firstly, this industry has had very few women working in it - and, in that sense, she is a glimpse to the future for this industry where women will also be able to work in stevedoring - and, secondly, she has demonstrated that people who are prepared to put in a decent day's work and go through the training effort can also achieve high levels of productivity and be able to undertake that work. It is time for reform. This government remains absolutely committed to it. - I did not have any confidential material. This is the media release from St George. These are the figures on how much they earn. These are the average weekly hours at Fremantle. This is the National Institute of Labour Studies submission. The rest of it is for the other question. - I didn't have a letter. - It is hardly a surprise that you would not hear with the din coming from the other side. - What I said, for the benefit of the honourable member, was that I had a letter from a wharfie in Brisbane. I am sorry, I do not actually have it with me. - Before the excitement gets to fever pitch, I read out part of this letter last week. Furthermore, I will, provided the member for Watson respects the privacy of the person who wrote to me, give him a copy of the letter after question time.Just so there is no question about it, I will also table a letter that I have from the Maritime Union of Australia that I had in my hand when I answered the question. I will table the minutes of a meeting I had with John Coombs in 1996 on the question of waterfront productivity. I will table a minute from my office on Mr Beaufort's slowly, slowly catch a monkey quote from this morning. What else would you like? I will table an article from this morning's Australian newspaper with annotations from my office as to where the figures are wrong. You would like that one, would you?What else is there? I will also table the rest of a draft answer from my staff that I did not get round to because I was having too much of a good time. Just to completely finish off the member for Watson, the heading on this piece of paper is `Those crane drivers earn $90,000 a year for the 14 hours of work a week in the crane'. It details in minute detail how these blokes are ripping us off. All tabled!</DOC>

 - Oh, really! What on earth did you do for 13 years? Nothing. What did you do to reform the taxation system? Nothing. You allowed these practices to accumulate. You did absolutely nothing. Having been a member of the government who for 13 or 14 years did absolutely nothing to curb the alleged tax avoidance practices - and I stress the word `alleged' - against which he now rages in some kind of confected sort of latter-day concern, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has got the nerve to come into this parliament and say, `Why haven't you done something about this?' You ran down the Australian taxation system. You allowed the Australian taxation system -  - I find the intervention of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition quite extraordinary. He says we have a new problem. The taxation report dealt with the period between 1991 and 1995-96. Apart from the last three months of that period, the Labor Party was the government of this country. They are asking the Australian people to believe that, because we were in government for three months of that period, in some way it is our responsibility.Let me say again to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that we are committed in our taxation proposals which will be presented to the Australian public before the next election. We are committed in those taxation proposals to do a number of things. One of those things we are committed to doing is restoring the fairness of the Australian taxation system - which you ran into the ground for 13½ years. I repeat: you ran the taxation affairs of this country for 13 years. You have no moral authority at all, or political authority or political credibility, to come into this parliament and give us lectures about the fairness of the taxation system. If the Australian taxation system is now unfair, it is Labor's fault. If the Australian taxation system discriminates against low and middle income earners, it is the Labor Party's fault. If the Australian taxation system now allows high wealth individuals to avoid their tax responsibility, it is the Labor Party's fault.Unlike the former government, we are not prepared to allow people to evade their tax responsibility. Every single item of that tax report relates to a period, bar three months, that the Labor Party was in office. It has no capacity to lecture us in relation to tax avoidance matters. If the Australian system is now unfair, which it demonstrably is, that is an indictment of your 13 years in government. Unlike the Labor Party, which wants to preserve the present system, we are prepared to reform it. Unlike the Labor Party, which wants to maintain the unfairness, we are  prepared to get rid of it. Unlike the Labor Party, which tolerated tax avoidance for 13½ years, we will not. You will see the measure of our resolve in the tax reform plan that is revealed before the next election.</DOC>

 - I was rather astounded by the comments of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition this morning. He never ceases to amaze us with the comments that he makes on his way into parliament. It may well be that I am the only person who ever reads them, but I would commend them to other members. They are a source of great amusement early in the morning.Yesterday the Taxation Office released a report which showed the number of taxpayers in 1995-96 compared to the number of taxpayers in 1991-92. It is important that members understand the dates. The Commissioner of Taxation was reporting the number of taxpayers in the 1995-96 financial year. Members will remember that this government was elected in March 1996. These numbers showed that, whereas in 1991-92 there were approximately 300,000 trusts in Australia, in 1995-96 the number had grown to 398,000 trusts in Australia - an increase of 32.5 per cent between 1991-92 and 1995-96.	Who was in government between 1991-92 and 1995-96? Who was the then Minister for Finance in the government?The Deputy Leader of the Opposition cannot resist what he thinks is an opportunity when he sees one. He walked in to the doorstop this morning and, with all the solemnity that he could muster, said, `We have got a big tax problem.' He put out a media release which had these words: `We have got a big tax problem.' As I said, one of the advantages of actually reading what he says is that you can remember things. You can remember  Gareth Evans, on the Nine Sunday program on 17 August 1997, saying this:Those who say that the tax system is broke are really being quite a bit absurdly breathless.We have a big tax problem. In 1997:Those who say that the tax system is broke are really being . . . a bit absurdly breathless.Gareth Evans at the National Press Club said:Tax reform is a second or third order public policy economic issue.Their whole case for the last 18 months has been this: there is no need to reform the Australian tax system because it ain't broke. This morning: `We've got a big tax problem.' We know there is a big tax problem in this country and we know who created it between 1991-92 and 1995-96. We know that. That is why we want to fix it. That is why, for example, this government passed legislation on Monday night clamping down on the trading and trust losses. This is why this government passed legislation addressing tax avoidance by the misuse of charitable trusts. This is why this government announced measures to deal with franking credit trading through discretionary trusts. This is why this government introduced the measures to deal with R&amp;D syndicates.When I became the Treasurer and I had a report from the tax office on the level of deductions that were being claimed under R&amp;D syndicates, I was moved immediately to announce that we would be closing them down. One of the reports I had was that a company - this is a confidential report - with a gross turnover in 1996 of $930 million paid $14,000 in tax. The group first entered into R&amp;D syndication in 1993, generating $39.2 million tax losses between 1993 and 1996. Who was in government between 1993 and 1996? Who was the finance minister? Who was the government that closed down R&amp;D syndicates? And who is the opposition that wants to reopen them again?The member for Hotham runs around after Senator Parer and trusts and he has promised on behalf of the Labor Party to reintroduce R&amp;D syndicates. That is a Labor Party policy. And you have a weak Leader of the Opposition who cannot control his frontbench. He cannot control the member for Hotham. The  member for Hotham, as anybody in the Melbourne business community knows, is running around the Melbourne business community offering tax breaks to whomever he wants as a chosen friend, and the Leader of the Opposition does nothing about it. 	We have a tax problem in this country and it was created by Labor. But we have a government in this country which is determined to fix it and an opposition which stands against tax reform, and we are not going to take any lectures from the authors of the R&amp;D syndicates on tax.</DOC>

 - I am not aware of that particular decision, but I will have a read of that decision, and if there is anything useful that I can add to the answer I will. I take this opportunity - across the confected and phoney outrage of the Leader of the Opposition, the man who now pretends that he is interested in the welfare of the less fortunate in the community but who drove unemployment to 11.2  per cent when he was in charge in employment in Australia -  - The Leader of the Opposition asked me whether I had read a particular case. I went immediately to that point and I choose to add something else to the answer, and if you do not like it that is your bad luck. You do not like being reminded of your lousy record for the downtrodden and the battlers when you were part of the government. That is your problem. The problem with you lot in the Labor Party is that when you had a chance to help the battler you ignored it. You discovered the battlers in opposition. -  - I wonder which political leader in Australia used an autocue at his national conference. It was not the leader of my party. I remind the Leader of the Opposition that the law that we have passed in relation to unfair dismissal in no way affects the right of people who are the victims of discriminatory conduct. That discriminatory conduct is well defined under the legislation.I say again to the Leader of the Opposition: what you have done in another place today is to destroy the job prospects of 50,000 Australians. What you have done in another place today is to strike another blow against the interests of small business in Australia. What you have done in another place today is to remind the Australian people that when the ACTU snaps its fingers Kim Beazley comes running. What you have done in another place today is to remind us that your defence of the Maritime Union of Australia is no one-off aberration; it is part of a long pattern of conduct. You in government ignored the battlers, in opposition you try to rediscover them, and you demonstrate all the time that when push comes to shove you are the handmaidens and the lackeys of the trade union movement of Australia.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for the Northern Territory for his question, because the operative word is `mess' - and certainly we were left with a mess from the previous Labor government. To put it very firmly, the report that came out from the Public Accounts Committee yesterday showed that the awarding of the contract in the first place to Telstra was, indeed, the responsibility of the Labor Party government.There is plenty of evidence now on the record that the original recommendation was to give it to AWA and General Electric as the preferred contractor for Defence, but it was overridden and, indeed, the contract was awarded to Telstra - a billion dollar contract with a company with absolutely no experience in the area.Furthermore, Telstra was able to give a government funded guarantee about overruns, whereas AWA, as a properly prudent company, wanted to limit that to $50 million. You could hardly say that was a fair competition. Nonetheless, the mess that resulted from that only became worse when the former Labor government changed the benchmarks for the payment of money. Eighty per cent of the money was then paid for 20 per cent of the work, and that is an absolute government scandal by the Labor Party.Further, it meant that we got so far behind in the performance of the contract that the Labor government allowed a feud to exist between Telstra and GEC-Marconi for two years without intervening at all. The net result is that we acted when it was brought to our attention on 24 May 1996 by Mr Blount, who spoke to the secretary to the department and said they wanted out of the contract.From that point on we have worked assiduously to put in place a new manager of the contract, RLM Management Pty Ltd, which is a joint venture of Lockheed Martin - which has since taken over GE, the company which was the original partner with AWA - and Tenix. I might point out that, in this report tabled yesterday, apparently they failed to pick up that Transfield Defence Systems changed its name at the end of last year. It is now Tenix, not Transfield.I might say further that we have worked so that we can be assured in this country that we will see the proper performance of this contract, we will see the capability acquired, and we will see proper management of the contract. The buck for the mess that was left rests squarely with that Labor Party government.</DOC>

 - That is another example of the Labor Party, on this occasion, asserting one thing in government and asserting and doing the complete opposite in opposition. When the member for Fremantle was the minister for health in the Labor government she argued, as late as less than 12 months before the 1996 election, that what was happening with public hospitals in Australia was that the federal government was putting more money in -  - And the state governments were shifting the money away from hospitals into other areas of expenditure. - Much as the member for Fremantle may now be embarrassed and she may call out and she will say it is in another context, that in reality is what the member for Fremantle argued. -  - The Leader of the Opposition gives me the opportunity to say again that at the Premiers Conference last Friday we made an extremely reasonable and fair offer to the states. That involved a 15 per cent real increase over a period of five years. The  general revenue funds going to the states in an era of zero inflation - I repeat: in an era of zero inflation - rose by 4.8 per cent in real terms. Of the 40 to 41 per cent of the revenue that the states will get from the Commonwealth in 1998-99, it will rise by three per cent in real terms, whereas the states, from their own sources, will increase their revenue by 1.9 per cent. In other words, on any criterion, on any basis and on any judgment, the Commonwealth has made a fair provision to the states.The states have primary responsibility for public hospitals. The states are ready, whenever something positive happens in their area of administration, to claim total credit. When something negative happens, the mantra - particularly of the New South Wales government led by Mr Carr and Dr Refshauge, his very ill-informed health minister - is to say that it is the fault of the federal government. The states have primary responsibility for health care. We have made decent provision.Any suggestion by the states that we have not made them a fair offer is wrong, and any attempt by the Leader of the Opposition to contradict blatantly what he asserted and supported when he was in government just demonstrates once again that Labor's doctrine is: you say and do one thing in government; you say and do the complete opposite when you are in opposition.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Gilmore for her interest in this area. There is some good news on this. This morning I met with 23 community and professional groups who are supporting the government's Immunise Australia plan. They signed an Australian childhood immunisation charter which gives us the opportunity to try to increase childhood immunisation to levels  of 95 per cent by the year 2000. These organisations are very diverse, ranging from the Pharmacy Guild of Australia to the Australian Nursing Federation to the Deafness Forum, and they have all put in action plans as to what they can do to help fix Australia's very low rate of childhood immunisation.Not all the news is bad. Data from the Australian childhood immunisation register suggests that kids under 15 months of age now have a 76 per cent rate of completed immunisation, which is still far too low but a lot better than it was 12 months previously. Also the data that has come out of the advertising campaign that we ran with baby Amy shows that parents now put immunisation as a much higher health priority, and in fact 99 per cent of parents support immunisation while 91 per cent strongly support it. These figures are very much up from when the survey was last done.On the issue of measles, measles is actually a serious illness caused by a virus. It is contracted by coughing or sneezing and the incubation period is about 14 days. One in every 15 children who gets measles will get pneumonia. One in every 2,000 children who gets measles will get inflammation of the brain or encephalitis, and of those, of every 10 who gets that, one will die and four will have permanent brain damage. One in 25,000 children get a disease called SPE, sclerosing pan-encephalitis, which is invariably fatal.We estimate that there are 360,000 children in Australia who are not properly immunised against measles. If we did nothing, by the end of the year that would be 400,000 children who were not properly immunised against measles. Measles epidemics come with a regular periodicity and we are expecting an epidemic in the next 18 months. New Zealand had one last year. The only way we can stop this is to try to vaccinate all of Australia's primary school children. This is a task that has never been undertaken before in this country. So between 20 July and 23 August this year we intend to offer every school child in Australia at primary school a dose of measles vaccine. We are doing this in cooperation with the states and the state education departments and state health departments. It  will cost us just under $31 million but, if we can prevent an epidemic of measles that we know is coming, I think it is very good expenditure for the money.</DOC>

 - I said at the outset of the discussion about matters of aged care that where there are individual cases I will always deal with those, and I will with that one if you bring it to me. No-one in this place would want someone to suffer in any way that is adverse. There are hardship provisions, and I do not believe bringing into this place someone's individual circumstances advances the debate at all.Furthermore, this question continues a pattern from the opposition to misrepresent policy, to heap on confusion for the Australian public and to pursue a political aim. You have done nothing for the aged in this country. The reason we have a problem is that you ignored it. We will fix it. We will fix it fairly and with equity for the needs of the aged people of this country.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Riverina for his question. He, like other members of the government, is certainly committed to the welfare of our veteran community in our country. Even in this 80th anniversary year of the repatriation system in Australia, the government remains committed to the responsibility for the delivery of health care for our veteran community. We also remain committed to the improvement of the way we deliver that health care to our veterans.I can confirm that the government intends to move to pay the states fully for the treatment of entitled veterans and war widows. Under this new direct purchasing arrangement, the government expects to inject an additional $150 million annually and $750 million over the next five years into the public health sector. This means that states will no longer subsidise the cost of veterans' treatment and the states will then be able to direct the current subsidy that they are paying for veterans into the treatment within their public patient sector. Veterans and war widows will continue to be admitted as private patients with a choice of medical practitioner, and all the costs will be met by my department. Veterans' and war widows' care will continue at the same level under these new arrangements and with the same range of services being available, but the new arrangements will give veterans more options for their treatment and care.The payment arrangements for the states will be negotiated on a bilateral basis, and that is important because of the history of the former repatriation hospitals. The way they were divested to the states or the private sector is an important consideration in the way we negotiate the arrangements between the states.The bottom line is that, while the states have money freed up to treat public patients, the Commonwealth injection of $750 million over the next five years means that veterans will have more choice in their health treatment and the best possible access to hospital services. The additional $750 million being  injected into the state and territory health systems for veterans' health care over the next five years means that this is another very good reason why the states should accept the health care offer that was made to them last week.</DOC>

 - I am very pleased to inform the House that I had the opportunity - and I think it is the first occasion that this has occurred in Australia - to convene a gathering this morning of representatives of various welfare organisations, a group of companies and other organisations concerned with philanthropic activity in the Australian community. The purpose of this meeting was to see whether it might be possible to develop more effective partnerships between the government, the community sector and the corporate sector so that some of the goals that we as Australians have in common as we go towards the 21st century might be more effectively realised.I am very pleased to say that at the meeting this morning there were people of esteem in their respective sectors, such as Margaret Bell, who, as many members will know, is the Chief Executive of Volunteering Australia, Ms Elizabeth Cham of Philanthropy Australia, Mr Everald Compton of Everald Compton Pty Ltd, Mr John Fairfax AM of Marinya Media Pty Ltd, Mr Rob Ferguson of Bankers Trust Australia, Mr David Gonski of Wentworth Associates and Mr Frank Lowy of Westfield Holdings. All of these people were brought together in response to a request from the government that these three sectors might explore more effective ways, in partnership, of delivering not only better outcomes for the community in relation to the welfare sector but also other objectives that I think we hold in common as a community.I told the gathering this morning that the government was taking this initiative now because it believed that in the 1990s there was a better balance in the Australian community towards the respective roles of the government, the corporate sector and the community sector. In the 1960s and 1970s there was a view that the government, by excessive intervention, could solve every problem. In the 1980s that was rejected, perhaps in an overreaction by what has been loosely called `the me generation', but in the 1990s I think there is a more mature balance in the Australian community, and there is a recognition of a bedrock of a role of the government to provide an effective safety net in the social security system. It is one of the proud boasts of my government that we have maintained the integrity of the social security safety net in full, and it will remain an objective of my government to maintain the social security safety net in full. The time, therefore, has come for a more practical partnership between the government, the philanthropic sector and the community sector.One thing that I believe has not been fully recognised in the context of this pursuit is the contribution that is made by many Australian companies to the welfare sector and to philanthropy generally. One of the goals of this round table - and I know one of the objectives of those contributing to it - is to recog  nise and, through that greater recognition, to give further encouragement to those in the corporate sector who do not contribute.I regard this as a very important exercise - one that has received very enthusiastic support from those who are participating and one which recognises that if we are to achieve the goals we want for Australia as we go into the 21st century we need a shared endeavour between the government, the corporate sector, individuals and the welfare sector. The government cannot do it all, the welfare sector cannot do it all and the corporate sector cannot do it all, but in an effective shared endeavour I believe those goals can be realised.Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper.</DOC>

 - I would like to say a couple of things about trusts, including the legislation that was passed by the Senate. The first observation that ought to be made about trusts is that you had 13 years to fix the abuses and you did nothing. For every question that you ask about this, you will be reminded that you had 13 years and you did nothing. You had 13 years to fix the ramshackle tax system. It got worse every year  that you were in office. For you now to come into this parliament and pretend some kind of latter day outrage and with confected concern talk about the state of our taxation system, I think that is an outrage that the Australian people will see through. I can say to the House that the deliberations of cabinet are not things that I normally talk about. That was the practice of my predecessors, and I am satisfied that correct procedures were followed.</DOC>

 - I am very pleased to inform the House that this morning during a visit to the headquarters of the RSL I announced that the government has gone much further than the commitment it made during the election campaign regarding linking pension increases to average male weekly earnings. We have decided to take that further and to afford the same linkage to recipients of the war widows pension. As a result, with effect from the pension payment on 9 April -  - I notice that the member for Hotham interjects when I am about to announce to this parliament an increase of $6.80 a fortnight for the pension paid to war widows. You ought to tell him to keep quiet. I am very pleased to say that with effect from the pension payment on 9 April the pension paid to Australia's 100,000 war widows will rise by $6.80 to $378.60 a fortnight. - I hope on behalf of all members of the parliament that this nation remains immensely in debt to those men and women who put their lives on the line in the defence of our country over the years, and a discharge of that debt includes properly caring for the widows and widowers that they left behind or people who were subsequently made widows or widowers as a result of the subsequent death of men and women who served in the armed forces during war.The cost of this measure will be $168 million over the next four years. It provides a continued linkage between increases in the old age pension and increases in the pension paid to war widows. I would remind the parliament that the commitment that was made at the time of the last election, and indeed the provisions of the legislation only relate to pensions generally, but the government has decided to extend this measure because of the special status of war widows and the special debt that is owed by the Australian people and the Australian community to the war widows of Australia. I say again on behalf of all the members of this parliament our thanks, our gratitude and our respect to these 100,000 fine Australians. They are deserving of every cent of this increase.</DOC>

 - The answer to the last part of the question is no. The answer to the second part of the question is that I do not  accept the assessment made by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. The answer to the first part of the question is that the assessment of trusts and the review of trusts have not been buried. I would remind the Deputy Leader of the Opposition of what I have said and what the Treasurer has said on this issue on a number of occasions - that is, that will be included in the very comprehensive tax review that we are conducting. I can remind the honourable gentleman of this again and again: it will be included when our taxation policy is released.I say on behalf of the government that we have absolutely no intention of allowing the abuse of trusts as a tax avoidance vehicle to go on unabated as the former government allowed it to do. The former government had 13 years to fix the abuse of trust, and suddenly we are invited to believe that the use of trusts as a tax avoidance vehicle arrived on 2 March 1996. The reality is that for 13 long years you had an opportunity of fixing this problem, but for 13 long years you neglected to do anything about it and so many other things.It lacks conviction and plausibility for the Leader of the Opposition, who did nothing except embrace malign neglect for 13 years, to now turn around and say, `I am the self-proclaimed concerned citizen concerned about the level of tax avoidance in the Australian community.' If you were so concerned about trusts and tax avoidance, why did you not do something about it when you were a member of the Hawke and Keating administrations? The reality is that, as in so many other issues, you say and do one thing in government and you say and do a completely opposite thing when you get into opposition.You ignored the battlers of Australia when you were in opposition. You ignored the working people of Australia when you were in government. You are now trying to rediscover them in opposition. I think they see through you as do the great bulk of the Australian community.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Hughes for her question and acknowledge the presence of her constituents from Hughes in the gallery. A very big welcome to all of you. Make sure you send back the member for Hughes after the next election. - I am sure the people of Hughes will be glad to know that last night this parliament passed world-class legislation. The charter of budget honesty will make sure that governments in this country report honestly to the people of Australia before every election and at every budget time from now into the future. This is world-class legislation. It requires twice a year an economic and fiscal outlook; it requires a pre-election report on where the state of the Australian economy is at; and it provides an intergenerational report to be delivered every five years to protect the interests of young people in the future of our society. This is world-class legislation and we can all applaud the outcome.However, I regret to say that the legislation was necessitated by some very regrettable events in Australia. This legislation was necessitated by the conduct of the Leader of the Opposition before the last election in March of 1996. At a time when the Australian accounts were $10,000 million in the red, on 1 February 1996 the Minister for Finance said:We're operating in surplus and our projections are for surpluses in the future.That was one month before the election. I do not think the Labor Party will ever show that it is equipped for office again until it has the decency to confront its past and apologise for the deceit that was practised before the March  1996 election. The failure of the Labor Party to confront the deceit that occurred before that election includes the Deputy Leader of the Opposition two years later, on 22 February 1998, saying that that $10 billion deficit, which the then Minister for Finance tried to cover up during the election campaign, was not the product of any big spend-up; it was just some lousy figuring by Treasury.Less than one month after Mr Beazley made the statement that the budget was in surplus, when we were $10,000 million in the red, the Treasury was able to come in the day after the election and tell us what the true state of the accounts was. There was no lousy figuring. The only lousy figuring was in the office of the Minister for Finance. He would not pick up the phone and ask the Treasury because he did not want to know the truth. He was trying to say to the Australian people that his failure on the budget could be covered up. Regrettably for him, he lost that election and the truth was known.The one good thing that could come out of that tawdry episode of the then Minister for Finance, Mr Beazley, is that legislation has now been passed in Australia to outlaw forever the kind of conduct that he engaged in. It makes sure that nobody in the future should ever try to repeat that episode, try to hide from the Australian public information that they need. The one good thing that can come out of the failure of the Leader of the Opposition is that he has now given birth to world-class legislation designed to stop the kind of behaviour that he engaged in, and that will be a much better thing for the Australian public.</DOC>

 - There is nothing new on Parer if this is all he has to say. I will say just a couple of things in response. As always with the member for Hotham, I will carefully check the detail of the question. The other day he asked me something about QCMM (ESP) Pty Ltd and he was wrong. The Leader of the Opposition has now caught the disease because he was wrong when he asked me a question about unfair dismissal.Can I just say generally in reply to the member for Hotham that I am proud of everything my party has done to expand share ownership in this country. One of my great ambitions is to see Australia become the greatest share owning democracy in the whole world. As I said at my party's convention, just as the founder of the Liberal Party of Australia made Australia the greatest home owning democracy in the world, it is my hope that under my government - which will stretch years into the future - Australia will become the greatest share owning democracy in the world. Unlike the Labor Party, we like the idea of people buying shares in the companies they work for. Unlike the Labor Party, we want share ownership to expand, and I defend every action taken by my colleague, the then shadow Treasurer, the now Treasurer of Australia, to expand share ownership in Australia. That is not something of which I am ashamed; that is something of which I am proud. It is about time you realised that this ridiculous muckraking is right off cue in so far as the mainstream of the Australian community is concerned.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I think the House would be interested to get some idea of the debt position of the Commonwealth and what the government intends to do about it. Just to put this in perspective, when the Whitlam government came to power in 1972 the Commonwealth net debt was about $1 billion or 2.5 per cent of GDP. That had been the level of Commonwealth debt throughout the 1960s and 1970s. As a result of recession in 1982-83, when the Hawke government came to office in 1983 Commonwealth debt was about $9.7 billion or about 5.6 per cent of GDP. -  - I acknowledge the concern of the Labor Party that debt had gone from about 2.5 per cent to 5.6 per cent of GDP. I acknowledge their concern that it was as high as 5.6 per cent of GDP. When this government came to office in 1996, after 13 years of Labor government - which had started off with debt at $9 billion or 5.6 per cent of GDP - debt had gone to $95 billion or 20 per cent of GDP. -  - I do acknowledge the concern of the Labor Party that debt was at 5.6 per cent in 1983. Where is your concern about it being at 20 per cent in 1996? -  - As a proportion of a growing economy, it had quadrupled. In terms of absolute numbers, it had gone up by 10 times, from $9 billion to $90 billion. I have actually gone back and done some historical analysis. The historical analysis shows that the two worst years in the post-war era in  terms of accrual of debt for the Commonwealth were the two years from 1993 to 1995, and the finance minister of the time was -  - The statistical analysis concludes, without a shadow of a doubt, that the worst finance minister in Australian federal history was the Leader of the Opposition. He was the worst finance minister in Australian federal history. In two years he presided over an increase of $26 billion of debt. When Labor had come to office, the Commonwealth, in the whole history of federation up to 1993, had accumulated $9 billion of debt, and in two years he had accumulated three times what had taken 83 years to build up. This government has put Australia on a path which will take debt to GDP down from 20 per cent to 10 per cent by the year 2000-2001 - isn't that great? - to get the liabilities off future generations of Australians.With the government's privatisation proposal in relation to Telstra and repaying debt we could take Commonwealth net debt back to four per cent of GDP - back to pre-Labor levels. We could finally with that privatisation get the debt to GDP level back to pre-Hawke-Keating-Beazley levels; and wouldn't that be a great achievement for the young people of Australia? The young people of Australia would have their debt liabilities brought right back to historical standards by this government. That is one of the reasons why we engage in privatisation.Just to pick up on a point that was made before: we actually believe in employee share ownership schemes unqualifiedly. To give an example of one of the best employee share ownership schemes you have ever seen, in relation to Telstra - which the Australian Labor Party opposed and which the unions of the Australian Labor Party opposed - the number of Telstra employees who took up shares was 92 per cent. That was opposed by the Australian Labor Party and opposed by the unions which pull the strings on the Leader of the Opposition. They were opposing giving the workers a share and a stake in a great national asset. That is why we stand  with the employees of Telstra, 92 per cent of whom agree with us and took up shares.</DOC>

 - The advice that I had was that there was absolutely no relationship in a business sense -  - but, most importantly, there was no common pecuniary interest between Senator Parer and the company - and anybody who has an atom of understanding of commercial practice would know how absolutely ridiculous your proposition is. The fact that you might have the same lawyer involved in relation to a couple of companies does not indicate a common pecuniary interest. You just illustrate by these questions that you do not have any allegations of substance against Senator Parer. You have no allegations of any conflict of interest. You have not demonstrated that he has enriched himself, and the more you go on with these inane questions, the more you aggravate the Australian community.</DOC>

 - In the last few days -  -  - I am invited to start with a rort for the day. Why disappoint them, Mr Speaker? Today's rort of the day is the fact that Patricks have a terminal in Rockhampton which is idle for about 60 or 70 per cent of the time and one of their employees, in respect of the terminal at Rockhampton, actually lives in Mackay. Every now and again Patricks have work that they want done in Mackay, which is the town where he lives, but because he is registered to work in Rockhampton, when they ask him to work in Mackay they have to pay him a travel allowance to fictionally go from Rockhampton to Mackay - when he already lives there! Not only that, when he fictionally transfers himself from Rockhampton to Mackay where he lives, they have to pay him $100 a day to look after himself whilst he is living in his own home town. Then, when he has finished his job, they have to pay him fictionally to go from Mackay to Rockhampton, when in fact he lives in Mackay.Let me return to the question: there has been a debate raging in the papers in the last few days, basically under the heading, `Anatomy of a pay slip.' The wharfies are a bit concerned that the word is out about how much they earn and they have been tabling and giving to the press their pay slips to show people they do not earn 90,000 bucks a year, after all, and they certainly do not earn the $70,000 to $74,000 on average which has been shown by independent analysis. - We can all play the anatomy of a pay slip game. Today I produce two pay slips which have been appropriately sanitised to remove all reference to any individual. One is for someone who works in Port Botany who is on $95,470 a year and the other is on a gross salary of $93,058. -  - I also have here a list of the salaries paid for persons in the stevedoring industry out of particular sites showing the top gross incomes of a series of individuals. The fact of the matter is that the figures that we have produced, which are contested by the wharfies, are in fact independently assessed figures. They give you a true appreciation of remuneration.As I have said repeatedly, by any reasonable community standard, wharfies are well and truly paid in excess of community standards. Sadly, for the balance of the community, we do not receive the level of productivity we otherwise should receive. - I conclude by saying that these figures are one of the reasons the government has overwhelming support for the reform process under way on the Australian waterfront. To give members an idea of the sense of community opinion on this, I will read from some of the letters I have received in recent days on this issue. This one says to the government:Please pursue to the end . . .which puts it rather well. Another says:A Government with enough conviction to do something about our waterfront has been a long time coming . . . This one says:Please do not lose your resolve, and be assured that the majority of thinking Aussies are right behind you.Another says:. . . I wish to express my support with any thing that you do . . . This one says:It is about time the public were reminded and informed of the frequency during W.War 2 when troops had to load the ships on the waterfront due to the contrariness of the waterside workers.Another, addressed to the PM, says:I fully support your strong stand . . . This one says:. . . Australia has been held to ransom by the - wharfies - for far too long.. . .              . . .             . . .. . .. the majority of Australians are definitely not in favour with the MUA stand.This one says, and I paraphrase:I recall when Bob Hawke . . . announced a great victory for his Government whereas the truth was that John Coombs and his cohorts took the Government and the taxpayers to the cleaners. -  - I am happy to conclude; I am concluding. This one - and this is the last paragraph of this letter - says:Your excellent and enlightening response today on John Coombs, together with an outstanding performance by the Prime Minister on Warwick Parer, is the best I've heard for a long time. I tell you what the Australian public want: they want us to keep up the reform process. We are committed to doing so.</DOC>

 - I will come to the question of family trusts in a moment. The first part of the Leader of the Opposition's question related to the new youth allowance. I am delighted that the Leader of the Opposition has given me an opportunity to explain to the  Australian community the philosophy that lies behind the new youth allowance system.The purpose of this new policy - and might I say that I think it is an excellent policy - is to remove the disincentive against participation in the work force or participation in training which exists in current social security arrangements. One of the problems with the present arrangement is that you can often receive more for being out of work than for being involved in study or training. The philosophy that lies behind it is to reverse those incentives to give people an incentive to pursue training, to give people an incentive to pursue more education. Quite wisely, I think the government has adopted the attitude that people should not leave school without a job being arranged or without some -  - He asked me about the new allowance, and I am answering him. - We are for a social welfare system that does not provide a disincentive to people undertaking further education and undertaking further training. One of the cornerstones of the youth allowance proposal is that people should not leave school unless they are going into some kind of training or unless they have a job arranged.The idea that people should simply leave school without any kind of job or after-school training in mind is the sort of attitude and the sort of incentive in the social welfare system that was left to us by our predecessors. That is why we are proposing to introduce the youth allowance system. I think it is a policy that has been very widely applauded.Might I say - I know this will be of enormous interest to many of my own colleagues, both in the Liberal Party and in the National Party - that the regions and the rural areas of Australia and the young people of the regions and the rural areas of Australia will be mas  sive beneficiaries under the youth allowance system. Once again, by asking this question in the way that he has, the Leader of the Opposition demonstrates to the people of the country areas of Australia that he has no sympathy, no understanding and no interest in their future or in their welfare. There are tens of thousands of young people in rural and regional Australia who will be massively benefited by the new youth allowance system because it contains very significant increases in the living away from home allowances for people from the regional and rural areas of Australia.The Leader of the Opposition then moved on to the question of family trusts and the taxation arrangements that apply to them. I would remind you that essentially the taxation treatment of a family trust is a taxation structure that you created, you preserved and you did nothing about in the 13 years that you were in government. They have finally discovered - after being in government for 13 years and being in opposition for two years, and when they read a taxation office report about a period of time that ended almost coincidentally with their ejection from the government benches of this country - with phoney confected outrage, that there is a problem that has to be addressed.Let me simply say to the Leader of the Opposition and to those who sit opposite: you had 13 years; you had your opportunity to fix what you now describe as the obscenity of certain trust arrangements. The Australian people woke up to you. The Australian people threw you out. We will be producing a comprehensive reform of the Australian taxation system. That will include, unlike your pathetic attempts to reform the Australian taxation system, a comprehensive attack on tax avoidance practices that you left unattended over the 13 long years that you were in government.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Aston for his question. It is a timely reminder that this week is the 15th anniversary of the signing between Australia and New Zealand of the closer economic relations trade agreement, or CER. It is a very positive document which has done much to create extra jobs here in Australia as well as in New Zealand. We expect to exceed $10 billion in bilateral trade between Australia and New Zealand this year.The rate of growth with regard to trade between Australia and New Zealand has been around 11.6 per cent annually, greater than the growth of 8.3 per cent for Australian trade over the last 10 years. We have energised and re-energised CER over the last two years. It is a sharp comparison to the actions which took place under the federal Labor government which saw then minister Brereton sabotage the single aviation market in a way which did much to damage and bring to a new low relations between Australia and New Zealand. -  - I note an interjection from the now shadow minister, the member for Kingsford-Smith. I remind him of what Don McKinnnon said about the Brereton decision:We were dismayed at last year's decision on aviation, dismayed on substance but astonished at the way the message was conveyed by fax.That was the state of relations under Labor. What we have done is inject at the highest level between Prime Minister John Howard and Prime Minister Jenny Shipley - and previously Prime Minister Bolger - a very high degree of confidence and contact between Australia and New Zealand. We have built on that in a very practical way by putting real depth into CER relations. The single aviation market has been re-established. The updated joint accreditation system agreement was signed here yesterday. The trans-Tasman mutual recognition agreement is scheduled to be entering into force on 1 May. But, above all, we have done something else. I know that the Minister for Small Business  and Workplace Relations will be particularly delighted by this, as will the former member for Hume. - The current member for Hume. What he did as minister for shipping and transport was drive forward a breakthrough with regard to the long difficulties which existed in shipping between Australia and New Zealand. The member for Hume spearheaded a breakthrough to bring about the end of cabotage between Australia and New Zealand. You may not like it. We did it. You may not like the improved efficiencies that we are bringing to coastal shipping and shipping across the Tasman. We have got the job done under the CER arrangements.It is with pleasure that I salute the 15 years of CER, a great tribute to the fundamental work of Doug Anthony and others over the years. I add one other thing: we have utilised CER to expand relations between Australia and New Zealand and South America. We do not just look to Asia; we look to the whole world for our trading opportunities. We are now building a raft of exports, mining technology and related services to South America. We are taking that a step further.Prime Minister John Howard will host the visit by President Menem to Australia next week. That underlines the links between CER and the Mercosur group of nations in South America. We are getting the job done. We are creating extra jobs here in Australia by better market access and better trade negotiations. We are delivering, especially through the CER arrangement between Australia and New Zealand.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, in respect of Conagra and the NFF, that is entirely news to me. As to the efforts of the Western Australian government in improving efficiency in the regional ports in Western Australia, they have my full and complete support. As I understand it, that has been an open tendering process. That is, however, a matter for the Western Australian government. They, of course, are required as others are to meet appropriate competition principles. But putting that issue, which is a separate issue in one sense, to one side, the fact of the matter is that the Western Australian government has been very strong and supportive of reform. When you look at the circumstances in Western Australia -  -  - They might be keen to promote performance. Look at the circumstances in Fremantle. Fremantle container operations could be improved very significantly compared with what they are today. I know that the Western Australian government is supportive of that. But, as I say, we support their efforts with respect to Dampier and the other regional ports. They are going well in Western Australia to improve productivity. Let us wish them well for the future.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. - That is right. I am well, thank you. I am glad that you are concerned to know. Australia's quarantine and inspection services really constitute a vitally important insurance policy for Australia's farmers, for around $10 billion of our exports, for our natural environment and, probably, our tourism industry as well - given that about 75 per cent of people come here largely because they want to see our pristine environment.But the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service was wrecked by Labor. And the person who had the purse strings for the longest period and who did the most damage during that regime was the member for Hotham. That is who it was. We had to fix it - and we have. We have put real resources into the restoration of Australia's quarantine services. In fact, we have overseen the injection of something like an additional $100 million into upgraded and new operations. For example, we funded the northern area quarantine strategy - over $14 million to look after our front line, if you like, across the north where we front to so many quarantine dangers. We have allocated $6 million through supermarket to Asia to technical offices in Asia. - `A couple of beagles,' I heard somebody say. You ran 19 dog teams around Australia. We are moving up to 42. From 19 to 42. We have put in place very significantly upgraded border control measures and they have seen, for example, new inspection systems for containers, which have detected 16 per cent of incoming containers with external contamination that was previously being missed. Cargo referrals for inspection are up 16 per cent. Mail seizures are up 127 per cent. Airport seizures are up in absolute terms and when expressed as seizures per full-time staff member they are up 18 per cent. We have redesigned and properly resourced the import risk assessment process. We have put in place vastly improved industry consultative arrangements and established a very high quality independent advisory committee known as QEAC.We have also separated out meat inspection from quarantine. The member for Hotham left  it in such an utter mess that we had no choice but to completely rebuild it. It was broke - literally. The member for Hotham left it broke and it needed an injection of $44 million just to pay redundancies. Although you had been billing industry for redundancies you had been spending the money on your out of control ongoing operational expenses. They could not run AQIS. This is the bunch who, under the member for Hotham, had 63 meat inspectors headquartered in towns around Australia where there were no meat processors. Under your industrial relations policy you could not run the thing properly. You could not contain costs. It was out of control. It was nothing other than a demonstration of your incapacity to run something either in a policy or a financial sense.Under us you have had a huge improvement in operational efficiency and work practices which are widely welcomed by industry. That is concurrent with a dramatic improvement in food safety. There are seven major meat exporters to the United States. We are one of them. Under this government, for the first time -  - I have nearly come to the end of it. I just make this point: under the reforms that we have put in place we have the lowest rejection rate of any country exporting meat to the United States.We really had a model here, set up by the member for Hotham, for running something. I probably thought that that was an illustration of the way in which they ran the broader economy. It was all about, firstly, painting yourselves as competent managers while, as we can see from the example of the 63 inspectors in towns where there were no meatworks, you were grossly incompetent. Secondly, you paint yourselves as visionary reformers when you will not tackle any hard issues.  -  - Thirdly, you shout all the more loudly that you have balanced the books when in reality what you have done is develop a big black hole. In fact - what happens? - the member for Hotham establishes the model and the Leader of the Opposition picks it up. - `Private'. - It is marked `confidential'.</DOC>

 - I will be happy to answer it. First of all, I certainly share the concern of many members in this House about the position of those 250 workers. I understand that my colleague, the Deputy Prime Minister, met them. I also understand from the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business that there is a possibility - and I do not want to put it any higher than that but I certainly hope it is realised - that the company may be sold to another interested party in which event it may be possible that the situation will turn out to be better than we now think it is. That is the advice that the minister has been given and I pass it on to the honourable member.The other point I would make is that I was a little puzzled at the member's reference to the Employment Advocate not having the power to pursue the directors of the company. Certainly I would be surprised if it had been suggested that he did because the power to pursue directors and so forth is something that would be done by the Securities Commission rather than by the Employment Advocate. Of course the government is very concerned about these situations. I think the honourable member would be aware that when his party was in power there was a very detailed examination of the law and you looked at and specifically rejected some of the things you are now asking us to do. So you cannot parade a monopoly of concern about workers in these difficult situations. I say to the honourable gentleman that everything will be done to help the workers concerned. I do not think you advance their cause by trying to draw some phoney long bows with other people. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Sturt for his question. He is obviously interested in the quality service that will be provided to unemployed people in this country from 1 May. I am pleased to get this question because there has been a deafening silence from the opposition since the member for Batman bungled his smear attack on Workskil Inc. earlier this week. - I see he is not even in the House today. I wonder if he is going around the country now checking up on how many plaques the member for Hotham has left in premises around the country. The opposition has shown over time that it has no idea whatever of how to get unemployed people into jobs. The Leader of the Opposition himself was responsible for lifting the number of long-term unemployed people in this country by 95,000 and pushing youth unemployment up to over 32 per cent. The fact is you let unemployed people in this country down, and they turfed you out of office.The Job Network will be providing unemployed people in Australia with the best possible chance to get a job. One of the reasons for this is that all those who have been successfully contracted to become members of the Job Network have gone through an intensive quality assurance process through the tender which the government has run and which the smear-a-day campaign from the opposition has failed in any way to dent.There is a wealth of experience within the Job Network. Members of this House may well be interested to hear about the experience of those who have been contracted. Eighty per cent of Job Network providers are existing providers. Fifty-eight per cent of the  existing skillshare providers who tendered are members of the Job Network. So that experience which has been built up over the years will be available in full measure to the Job Network. Fifty-two per cent of the existing contractors who assisted long-term unemployed people in the past are in the Job Network. The Job Network contains an excellent mix of established and experienced expertise and new innovative ideas and new players.Unemployed people have welcomed the change. I refer particularly to the comment that appealed to me of job seeker Despina Sarandogiou, who summed up the response of many unemployed people about the Job Network when she said that under the old system she felt like a number whereas under the Job Network she will feel more like a person. That is because unemployed people will have a choice, they will have personal service and they will have their dignity recognised. While the opposition has no plan whatever to help unemployed people, the government is putting into practice the most significant social reform of the last five decades to help unemployed people.</DOC>

 - There is no review being undertaken of the results of the tender pro  cess. The tender process that has been completed has delivered its results and the government stands by those results. In fact, this is a tender process which has delivered best practice outcomes in tendering. What the member for Richmond was referring to was that there are, as I have said before in this House, experienced providers who were unsuccessful in the tender process who have the capacity to offer training services to those successful providers who have been contracted as members of the Job Network.The government is very keen to ensure that these providers have adequate advice as to the opportunities that are open to them in the Job Network. The Job Network is going to in fact open up opportunities for many agencies beyond the members of the Job Network itself to provide services to unemployed people, particularly quality training services. That is an appropriate part of the Job Network; it is what the Job Network was set up to do. The government is very happy to get advice from the area consultative committees about the operations of the Job Network and the opportunities provided to unemployed people in that region, and that is precisely what the member for Richmond was referring to. He is completely correct in what he says about the determination of the government to ensure that people on the north coast of New South Wales get the very best services that are available.It is also the case that there will be many more outlets for unemployed people in the north coast regions of New South Wales to obtain job placement services than they have under the existing arrangements. I totally reject the claims that were made in the course of the question that, in some way, there will be a restriction on the services available to those people in Lismore. In fact, the people in Lismore will have access to excellent services under the Job Network and, like those in all other regions of Australia, they will find that the quality services in job matching, in preparation for job seeking and job searching and intensive assistance for unemployed people will be greatly enhanced by the services of the Job Network.</DOC>

 - I would like to thank the member for the Northern Territory for his question. I know that he and all his constituents in the Northern Territory are very interested in the outcome of this project. Last year the Prime Minister announced the Commonwealth would contribute $100 million towards this project. Expressions of interest to build the Alice Springs to Darwin rail link closed on 1 December 1997. More than 30 submissions were received by the AustralAsia Railway Corporation from a combination of 60 national and international corporations. A short list has been presented to the South Australian and Northern Territory governments.The Commonwealth, together with the South Australian and Northern Territory governments, has committed $300 million towards this project - and this is being provided all by coalition governments. Compare that with the last promise that the Labor Party made with regard to this project in 1983 when Bob Hawke said:I promise you that only the Labor Government can be trusted to build the Alice Springs to Darwin line.Yet in 13 years of Labor government nothing was done. That was the last promise that the Labor Party made. But there is more. During the ALP conference on 21 January this year in Hobart - remember that fairly flat sort of an affair down in Tasmania - the South  Australian Labor leader, Mike Rann, went on Adelaide radio and said:. . . so we have secured a commitment from Kim Beazley for $300 million - up to $300 million if Labor is elected, to try and make sure that we actually get some tracks laid.Is this the same sort of a promise that Bob Hawke made back in 1983? So the compere of that radio program came back and said:So, Mike, this is in fact a formal commitment so, reading between the lines, if Labor is elected to power at the next federal election, that is a done deal?And Rann started to back away. He said:Well, what we did yesterday is commit the federal Labor Party - my resolution committed the federal Labor Party to providing the capital assistance necessary to ensure that the railway goes ahead.Now we have the Leader of the Opposition making backroom deals with Mike Rann regarding this important project, promising him $300 million. We have not heard anything from the Leader of the Opposition about what is actually going to happen. The Labor Party's shadow spokesman for transport, in a press release, has said:In all our discussions with industry, we have been told that more will be required. That is why Kim Beazley committed Labor to up to $300 million over four years.Is this another unfunded commitment? Where is the money going to come from? The people should be asking the question: where is the money going to come from? The Labor Party is all over the place on this issue. The people in South Australia and the Northern Territory deserve a straight answer from the Labor Party on what they are going to do - or are they going to rely on what Bob Hawke said in 1983 and do nothing?</DOC>

 - One of the most satisfying aspects of the outcomes of the tender round for the Job Network has been the very good coverage that occurs in regional Australia. Every area of Australia which is currently served by the Commonwealth Employment Service -  - This really shows that the opposition clearly do not understand the benefits and virtues of the new Job Network, because every area of Australia which is currently served by the CES -  -  - Listen to this and you will learn something. Every area of Australia which is currently served by the CES will be receiving services under the Job Network. In many areas of regional Australia they will be receiving expanded services because of the increased number of sites that are available. This is the document I tabled for you last week. You have had a chance to consult this document and you could have been better informed. Unemployed people in Cessnock will be serviced by Employment National. - Yes. - Employment National will be providing a range of services, including both basic job matching and intensive assistance. -  - All that the member for Hunter has been able to draw attention to is that the residents of Cessnock and unemployed people in Cessnock received services before and they receive services now. And they will be receiving services under the Job Network. Some point!The whole benefit of the Job Network is that if you go through the areas and towns of the Hunter and north coast region, there are many more places for unemployed people to go to where they can receive services and be matched to jobs. There many more sites in that area than there are at present. The quality of services will be increased and they will have the dignity at last of being able to choose the services that are available.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Groom for his question. I know his interest in this matter. Might I mention also the member for Stirling, whom I also know has a particular interest. Before the election the coalition, in accordance with its constant stand on the question of an end of Vietnam war list, promised to establish the list of people who  had suffered as a result of the quota system that operated during the Vietnam war, whereby 28 people who were in fact recommended for an award were downgraded and 50 people who were recommended for an award in fact received nothing.Indeed, those awards were for meritorious service or gallantry. The difficulty has arisen with regard to the list because in 1992 the ability to recommend to Her Majesty the Queen that imperial honours be awarded was abolished. That has meant that the awards that were recommended back at the time of the war being imperial awards can no longer be given. Had something been done about it at the time that a private member's bill came through this place before 1992, then the medals as they had been recommended could have been given.Because this cannot be done, we are using the Australian honours and awards system. There are no direct equivalents and the difficulty then is to ensure that the most appropriate award is given to the person who missed out previously. In order to do that, a decision had to be made and the decision was made that no order could be higher than the order that was previously recommended.Here is the difficulty. The difficulty relates to six nominations that were made for the Military Medal. It is argued by some people, including Mr Ruxton and others, that the Military Medal should be treated the same as the Military Cross. To have done that would have meant that those six  people would have received a medal higher than the 84 people who received it during the war, the 41 people who received the Distinguished Conduct Medal, the one person who received the Conspicuous Gallantry Medal and the three people who received the George Medal, all of which rank in between the Military Cross and the Military Medal. I have great sympathy for those people who would really have liked to have received their imperial awards. I understand the feeling they have towards that particular medal.But we do believe that the way we are awarding this system is the fairest outcome. To those people who say that to receive a commendation for gallantry is to be regarded  as being belittled, I say that is not so. A commendation for gallantry is a ribbon with an emblem upon it which is mounted on a bar in the ordinary way and worn with pride. Our solution is the fairest solution to fulfilling our promise - and I know that people will appreciate the difficulties that were entailed.</DOC>

I point out to the House that at least our government has taken the opportunity to appoint people to the Civil Aviation Safety Authority who have experience in the aviation field, who have an understanding of aviation and who know what is needed in this industry.Following the obstruction of the mates of the Labor Party over the first couple of years of the life of this government, we have taken the opportunity to get around the industry and get people from the industry into the Civil Aviation Safety Authority who know what they are talking about as far as aviation is concerned, and who have had experience with the big end of the aviation industry in Ansett and Qantas, as far as concerns the management of air space in Australia and the regulation of air safety in Australia.</DOC>

 - In reply to the honourable member for Petrie, I can inform the House that today the Australian Bureau of Statistics released a new indicator of wages growth called the `wage cost index'. This index, which is compiled using a fixed basket of jobs to provide a better guide to underlying wage cost pressures, suggests that wage costs rose by the very moderate annualised rate of 3¼ per cent in the December quarter. That increase is very much within the Reserve Bank of Australia's comfort band for wages and does nothing to threaten Australia's outstanding inflation performance. In fact, Australia now has a headline inflation rate which is the best in the OECD.Most importantly, it is average Australians who are getting the most benefit of this low inflation rate. If you have a headline inflation rate running at minus 0.2 per cent, and Australian workers are being looked after to the extent that their wages are rising by 3¼ per cent - in other words, they are getting a real wage increase of at least 3¼ per cent on an average basis - then that increase is not in any way being eaten up by increases in inflation. I would imagine that Australians who follow these matters would regard a government that has delivered that kind of economic outcome as a government that well and truly has the interests of average Australians at heart. If you can deliver zero inflation, if you can deliver an economic climate where you have zero inflation and wage increases, on average, of 3¼ per cent, you are adding to the real incomes of average Australians. But that is only half the story.The other part of the story is that the policies of the government have resulted in reductions in mortgage interest rates for average Australians of about $300 a month. That is the equivalent of a wage rise of $100 a week for average wage and salary earners.  But the good news on the economic front - and I say this to the member for Petrie - does not end with low inflation, real wage gains and interest rate reductions; it is also the case that over the last six months more than 140,000 new jobs have been created.That figure would have been 190,000 but for the actions of the Labor Party and others in the Senate in blocking our unfair dismissal laws. What the Labor Party is doing, bound hand and foot to the trade union movement - doing the bidding of Jennie George, nodding to Jennie George and saying, `Yes, Jennie, no Jennie; I'll do whatever you say, Jennie' - is destroying jobs. I can say to the Leader of the Opposition: you will be hearing a lot more about the impact on jobs in Australia of what you have done by blocking the unfair dismissal law.You have a picture that there is only one side of politics in Australia over the last two years that has bothered to address itself to issues that affect average Australians - and that is the Liberal and National parties. We have delivered to this country the strongest economic fundamentals for a quarter of a century. We have protected this country against the economic downturn in Asia. We have lowered interest rates. We have boosted real wages. We seen 140,000 new jobs created in the last six months. We have committed ourselves to fundamental industrial relations reform. We are seeing historic reforms - absolutely historic and courageous reforms - on the Australian waterfront.All you get from the Leader of the Opposition is a promise of another meeting. He loves promising meetings. His great mentor, Bob Hawke, had a meeting on the waterfront - and $425 million later we were no further ahead. They had a meeting on native title that was presided over by Paul Keating and we were delivered the native title mess which is now the responsibility of my government to cure.The housing sector also continues to power along. Total dwelling commencements rose by 10 per cent in the December quarter to be almost 20 per cent higher than a year earlier, and there is more to come. If the housing figures are anything to go by, they are almost 25 per cent higher than they were a year  earlier. I repeat: the housing commencement figures are 25 per cent higher than they were a year earlier. That I know is particularly good news in those areas of Australia that are experiencing a lot of housing growth, such as the electorate represented by the member for Hughes, whose constituents are with us today, and the electorates of many other members. We have strong economic fundamentals. I know the Labor Party hates it. I know the Labor Party does not want to be reminded of it, but we have got news for them. They will be hearing a lot more about it over the next six, nine, 12 or even 18 months.Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper.</DOC>

 - My recollection is that, at all times since he has been a member of parliament, the member for Higgins has fought for the rights of people who want to participate fully in employee share ownership schemes - and he will continue to do so. It is a very proud boast of my government that we have done more in two years to expand the opportunities of employees to buy shares in the companies that employ them than you did in over 13 years. In the context of another matter that is very much in the news at the present time, I would remind those opposite that the generosity of the employee share ownership scheme in relation to the sale of  one-third of Telstra was absolutely unprecedented. - The Leader of the Opposition asked me about a statement I made in support of what the Treasurer had said. I am more than happy to remind the parliament that the Treasurer, along with the minister for finance and the minister for communications, was one of the architects of the legislation that led to the sale of one-third of Telstra. It was because of the influence of many of us, who believed that -  -  - the battlers of Australia ought to be able to own shares in the companies that employ them. I know it sticks in the craw of the Labor Party that 92 per cent of people who work for Telstra bought shares in the company. They bought shares in the company because they believe in employee share ownership. I will tell you what: when the Australian people have the opportunity to buy the remaining two-thirds of Telstra, I can assure you that you will get killed in the rush of employees who will want to buy shares in that company. I predict now that, instead of it being 92 per cent, it will be closer to 95 or 96 per cent. You may think that they are indifferent to it, but when the opportunity arises I am sure that the men and women of Australia who are employed by Telstra will welcome with open arms the opportunity to buy shares in the company that employs them.</DOC>

 - I can say to the honourable member for Wannon that I certainly am aware of the announcement which was made by Westpac this morning. - But, even more importantly, I am sure that the hundreds of thousands of small business operators throughout Australia are also aware of what was announced this morning. Those who are not aware will become aware over the hours and the days ahead, because what was announced this morning represents the great interest rate breakthrough that the overwhelming bulk of small businesses in Australia have been waiting for.This represents an absolutely historic fall in the level of interest rates for Australian business. What we have seen this morning is a reduction in relation to the new product introduced by the Westpac Bank; a reduction in the average lending rate for business of two per cent. It is unprecedented in the experience of any member of this parliament. As this graph that I am about to show honourable members opposite will illustrate, you have to go back to the 1970s before you can find a period of time in which interest rates for business were as low as they are now.As this graph indicates very clearly, we had an upward trend in interest rates from late 1994 until they plateaued in 1996. They  continued for a few months and then, after our election, the rates began to come down and the housing interest rate fell. As the graph illustrates, this is the point at which we took over - March 1996. They only stayed up there for a couple of months; then they began to fall. The most dramatic reduction in housing interest rates has now been matched by the fall in overdraft rates for business. No amount of noise, no amount of muckraking against my colleague, no amount of delving into things that are irrelevant to the mainstream of the Australian community, can alter the fact that we now have in this country not only the lowest housing interest rates since the late 1960s, but we now, as a result of this, have the prospect of seeing the lowest small business rates in Australia since the late 1960s.This is no accident, this is not something that has just sort of come along in a random sort of fashion; this is a direct result of the economic policy that my government has followed. This is a direct result of having got rid of Kim Beazley's $10½ billion deficit. This is a direct result of the assault that we made on the federal government's debt when we came to office. This is a direct result of the fact that we have been prepared to give this country its lowest inflation rate for decades. This is a direct result of the courage of my government in tackling the fundamental economic problems of Australia.If we had not got the budget in order, if we had not fireproofed Australia against the ravages of the Asian economic downturn, if we had not been willing to take some economic decisions that were unpopular in the short term, we would not have provided the foundation and the basis and the opportunity for banks such as Westpac to reduce the level of interest rates.I want to congratulate the Westpac Banking Corporation. I want to draw to the attention of all participants in the financial community that we now have a highly competitive financial sector, and this is in no small measure due to the efforts of my colleague the Treasurer in relation to the implementation of the reforms contained in the Wallis report.In just two years we have created the foundations where the Australian economy is stronger, fundamentally, than it has been for over a quarter of a century. We have low inflation, we have high levels of business investment, we are reducing Beazley's horrendous deficit legacy, we are getting rid of the $10½ billion deficit and, by one policy decision alone - that is, allowing the men and women of Australia to buy the remaining two-thirds of Telstra - we will reduce by 40 per cent the total federal government debt of Australia. But, ladies and gentlemen, let us not -  - Colleagues, let us not underestimate the significance -  - Mr Speaker, this is not a ministerial statement; it is bad news for the Labor Party - that is what this is. This is not a ministerial statement. I am proud of the economic policies that have been followed by my government. I would remind the parliament and I would remind the Australian people that every step we took to lay the foundations for this historic interest rate cut today was opposed by the Australian Labor Party. They not only had the indecency to leave us a budget deficit of $10½ billion but also had the supreme indecency -  - Not only did the Leader of the Opposition have the indecency, after having misled the Australian public, to leave a deficit of $10½ billion, but also he compounded that indecency with the political obscenity of trying to block every single measure being taken by my government to clean up the mess. So I say to the people of Australia, and particularly the men and women of Australia in small business: you now have the best interest rate climate for over three decades, by courtesy of the economic conditions created by my government, which has created a situation where interest rates for small business are lower than they have been since the late 1960s, and that is a direct result -  - He is even deceptive about the time. It is not even a quarter past two yet and this is the second question. Let me say again that this is an historic breakthrough for small business. It is fabulous news. -  - I know it hurts the Labor Party, but it is a further endorsement of the wisdom and the strength of the economic policies that my government has followed since 2 March 1996. - I table the graph.</DOC>

 - In response to the honourable member for Eden-Monaro I can say that in the last week the government has made two specific decisions that will generate at least 600 new jobs in regional Australia. I refer firstly to the signing in Melbourne on Friday of the regional forest agreement taking in the central highlands of Victoria. May I pay tribute to the work done by the honourable member for McMillan in bringing about the signing of that agreement. He has been an indefatigable campaigner. - I am getting to the honourable member for McEwen, whose electorate I had the great pleasure of visiting only two or three weeks ago. The esteem in which she is held is evident wherever you go. - I am coming to him too. There are so many announcements that it takes you a while to work your way through them. The central highlands regional forest agreement will lay the basis for 300 additional jobs and conserve an extra 116,000 hectares of forest. It will provide resource security for a period of 20 years. It provides for a $28 million development package. To date, the three regional forest agreements that have been signed by my government - two now in Victoria and one for the whole of Tasmania - have laid the basis for over 1,700 jobs in regional Australia and have conserved over 500,000 hectares of forest.On Sunday I had the opportunity to visit the electorate represented so well by the honourable member for Gilmore and, when I was in Nowra, I declared main road 92 between Nowra and -  - There he goes. This is something that the locals have wanted for 30 years. - They asked you every year for 13 years. I know: you were going to do it in the 14th year, weren't you? - You were finally going to do something. The upgrade of the main road 92 between Nowra and Nerriga -  - has now been declared a road of national importance. - What that means is that it will attract Commonwealth government funding. The upgrade involved in that will generate 300 jobs in regional New South Wales in roadworks, industry and tourism. On 18 March I announced upgrades to the Goulburn Valley highway which are expected to generate another 200 jobs. These are all solid, practical decisions which are creating jobs in regional Australia. They are building confidence in regional Australia, and they are a recognition that only the Liberal and National parties care about the regions and the rural areas of Australia.What is the latest Labor Party insult? What is the latest Australian Democrats insult to the people of rural and regional Australia? It is to reject the unfair dismissal legislation and, in the process, they are delaying - on the words of the small business community of Australia - the creation of an additional 50,000 new jobs throughout the whole of Australia. Labor has no credibility in the region and has no credibility on small business in other parts of our country.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and I especially thank the honourable member for Calwell for his point of order. Apparently, the Labor Party considers reform of the Australian taxation system to be a hypothetical matter. We don't; we actually think it is very important for this country. We actually think it is very important that this country get a new and better taxation system. We actually think it is important to focus on things like interest rates and home mortgage rates. We actually think it is important to talk about jobs. We think it is important to talk about economic growth, but Labor doesn't. They are absolutely pre-occupied with the kind of muckraking which passes as an excuse for policy making in this country. But they are not all like that.I would like to point out to the House that shortly an important new book is going to be published under the title Civilising global capital: new thinking for Australian Labor. It should say `Some Thinking for Australian Labor'. It is written by somebody called Mark Latham, the member for Werriwa. The point I want to make at the outset is that the member for Werriwa should not be condemned for being a thinker in the Labor Party. As far as the Labor Party is concerned, it needs all the thinkers it can muster and the member for Werriwa is on the right track rather than on the wrong track. We congratulate him for standing up to the economic dinosaurs of the leadership of the Labor Party. - No, he was not. The Leader of the Opposition is about to launch  his book, Mr Speaker. Perhaps the Leader of the Opposition would be interested in this quote from the book. According to the member for Werriwa, `There is something frightfully immoral about politicians who hold out the hope that nostalgia might somehow resolve the problems of the present.' He could not be talking about the member for Hotham, could he? He could not be talking about the Leader of the Opposition, could he - `frightfully immoral to hold out the hope that nostalgia might somehow resolve the problems'?Here we have the politicians of nostalgia, who pass all of these questions as an excuse for a policy, being fingered by the delightfully absent member for Werriwa. Did you tell him not to come today? The young and the restless, together with the member for Melbourne, have now become the bold and the beautiful, boldly taking on the dinosaurs of the Labor Party leadership, accusing them of economic nostalgia.In the words of the member for Melbourne, he said in relation to the member for Oxley, `Building a society based on economic security, a fair balance between economic efficiency and social equity, a broad capacity to participate requires new ideas and initiatives,' not a trip down memory lane arm in arm with Pauline Hanson. The member for Melbourne, fingering the leadership of the Labor Party for a trip down memory lane with Pauline Hanson; the other young and the restless; the member for Werriwa talking about the need for a new taxation system; and what do we find? The dinosaurs of the ACTU, Hotham and Batman - Batman and Hotham! - sitting here in the parliament longing for the days of yesterday when the ACTU controlled the economy.The member for Werriwa has done the Labor Party a great service: he has thought, and he should be encouraged to do so in the future.</DOC>

 - One of my colleagues said, `Will you crack down hard on Mark Latham?' There is one thing I will say about the member for Werriwa: at least he has the honestly to identify something you will never identify, that is, the Australian taxation system is badly in need of overhaul and reform.I want to say to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and I say to the Australian people that one of the central elements of our tax reform package will be the elimination of tax avoidance practices, whether they occur in relation to family trusts or in relation to other aspects of the taxation system.Having said that and having declared what will be central elements of our taxation policy, I want to know why it is that the Labor Party spent 13 years doing nothing about the abuse of the taxation system. I want to know why the Australian Labor Party has finally discovered that there may be some tax avoidance -  - That is a lie, is it? - Are you going to withdraw that? - I have a very good idea what people in the public gallery thought of that little immature performance. -  - What a childish performance that is. It was a very instructive little exercise. I remind the Australian people that the Australian Labor Party had 13 years to fix the Australian taxation system. All they ever did during that 13-year period was to allow the system to steadily deteriorate. You had 13 years to discover, through the use of trusts, the abuses which led to a haemorrhaging of the revenue. You discovered those abuses; you did nothing about them. You had 13 years to make it easier for the PAYE taxpayer; you did nothing about it. You had 13 years to ensure that not only were welfare cheats dealt with but also that the big end of town paid its fair share.Once again, it has been left to an incoming coalition government, it has been left to a Liberal and National Party government, to take up the cudgels in the interests of the average Australian. I can assure the battlers of the Australian community that we will do what Labor was unwilling to do - we will give you a fair taxation system. We will eliminate the rorts at both ends of the argument. - We will ensure that Australia goes into the 21st century with a modern competitive taxation system that encourages manufacturing exporters, encourages work, encourages saving and delivers incentives to those who are prepared to take  risks and who are prepared to contribute their fair share. You had 13 years to fix the system, and you did nothing. - You have no credibility when you attack us.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and for his interest in tax reform, which is one of the big issues for Australia's future. The reason why this government stands in favour of tax reform is that we believe in giving Australia the best possible opportunity for the future for jobs and for families - for giving them opportunities for economic development. And we know that Australia's taxation system is not optimal. We know that.If I may say so, Mr Speaker, there are also some people in the Labor Party who take that view. Leadership in the Labor Party does not come from the so-called Leader of the Opposition, but there is the member for Werriwa - who is curiously absent from the House of Representatives. But, don't worry; he can't be sick because he was on Radio National this morning. He was on Radio National this morning, but he is curiously absent from question time today. But, don't worry - he'll be there when the Leader of the Opposition launches his book.I want to tell you, Mr Speaker, that this book does have some very sensible material about tax reform in it. According to reports, Mr Latham refers to the narrowness of the  current indirect tax base which does not cover services. I would have thought that that was a pretty obvious point. Mr Latham refers to the advantages of taxing consumption over income. That is another proposal that he puts forward on behalf of the Labor Party. Specifically, he says that it should be done through an expenditure tax which is a multilevel, value added tax. We are pretty keen to see some thinking coming out of the Labor Party in relation to this.Mr Latham also says in his book, `Whereas the top marginal rate in Australia in the 1950s cut in at 19 times the level of average weekly earnings, this ratio has now fallen to 1.5.' When I read that, I thought to myself, `That is a remarkably similar statement.' I would refer the Labor Party and its latest offering in relation to tax reform to this good little book called The Australian taxation system: in need of reform. - Modesty prevents me from saying who the author of this was. But on page 7 of this booklet, the author - and modesty prevents me from saying who it is - said:In 1954, a taxpayer had to earn 19 times average earnings to pay the highest tax rate . . . By the year 2000, a taxpayer will only have to earn 1.2 average earnings to pay the top rate.That is almost identical to what is going to appear in the member for Werriwa's book. - Before Alan Ramsey gets onto the case, there was no idea swapping between the two of us in relation to that, Mr Speaker. I do not engage in idea swapping with members of the Labor frontbench. -  - As my colleagues point out, the only person you could swap an idea with on the Labor frontbench would be the member for Werriwa; there aren't too many others. We actually welcome the fact that the member for Werriwa is engaging in some thinking. That is a welcome change, I think. It is good to see that somebody in the Labor  Party is prepared to take on the big issues: the issue of what we are going to do about high marginal tax rates; the issue of what we are going to do about the growing services part of the economy; and the issue of how we are going to reform Australia.All I can say to the member for Werriwa is this: none of the material in this booklet is copyright; all of it can be reprinted in his book or anybody else's book. It can even be reprinted in the Australian Labor Party policy handbook, for all we care. We also say to the member for Werriwa that if the Leader of the Opposition cannot lead, he can, and he should, and we congratulate him for doing so.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Curtin for his question. I say to him: I am not aware that the AMP has estimated that compliance with those particular proposals would cost in the vicinity of $50  million, but I take his word that that may well have been the case. What the honourable member refers to is a discussion paper which was put out in December 1996 on the taxation of financial arrangements, or TOFA. That discussion paper was put out by officials and released for public comment. A number of submissions have been received on it since its release. These are currently being evaluated by officials of the Australian Taxation Office and the Treasury. The government will consider the future of those proposals after we have considered the feedback.In relation to the broader question of the taxation of financial services and financial intermediaries, I would point out to the honourable member that this government has been very active in getting down the costs associated with compliance of the taxation system and very active in encouraging new financial products and a reduced cost of funds. I think the proof of that is seen in the fact that not only mortgage rates and business rates are historically low but also margins are historically low.Let me go on from that and say that I think it is very important, as Australia looks out into its region and sees a great deal of instability in it, that Australia be now seen as a site which is stable, well-regulated and, with the Wallis reforms, engaging world's best practice in relation to financial regulation. The last piece of the jigsaw that we need to put in place to make Australia a major financial centre is tax reform. If we put that piece of the jigsaw in place, we can make Australia, after Tokyo, the financial centre of the Asia-Pacific region. That would be a great thing for Australia and a great thing for our industry, and that is one of the determined goals of this government.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Parramatta for his question on this issue. I think it is important to recognise that the two-year waiting period which this government introduced was a balanced measure and one which was quite clearly intended to provide access to refugees and humanitarian entrants to our social welfare system where we recognised that they had come having suffered considerable hardship and having had special needs. But then we move to other categories of entry - the two remaining categories. The first is those who come as skilled migrants, who can offer to Australia skills to help grow our economy, who are carefully selected and for whom there is evidence available that they have very high levels of participation generally and also low levels of unemployment. Then there is the family stream, where sponsors in Australia make solemn undertakings to support relatives if they are allowed into Australia as spouses, parents or in various other categories that are available. In the introduction of that scheme, we ensured that any significant change in circumstances after arrival would be taken into account to ensure that, if a relative had died or lost their employment, benefits would be available. This scheme is a very generous scheme. It remains generous in world circumstances. - I will pick up the comment by the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith. If you look at the United States of America and if you look at most of Europe, their schemes of benefits for people who are unemployed rest upon personal contributions having been made. There would be few migrants who would have been in a position to work and make personal contributions before their arrival in any of those countries. But that is the way in which benefits are generally provided overseas.The interesting aspect about this system is that under Labor it was essentially degraded. The assurance of support scheme was always in place and was intended to ensure that people were supported by their families, but it was something that was honoured largely in the breach while you were in office. It was a  situation in which parents, when they entered Australia, were able to quickly access social security after any assurance of support scheme had been essentially exhausted and, instead of there being a 10-year embargo, which was the traditional position in relation to eligibility for an age pension, people were accessing benefits after a relatively short period of time in Australia. When you look at the figures, the most remarkable part about it is that they essentially came from countries where there were no highly developed social security systems in place - something in the order of 75 per cent of them. That is the way in which the scheme was operating.What I have been interested in is the way in which the Labor Party has wanted to walk down both sides of the street on this issue. What they have sought to do, and the Leader of the Opposition was at it again this weekend, is to say to ethnic communities that this is a measure which, if you look at it, is unfair. I can quote from a speech that the Leader of the Opposition made, and it was typical of many opposition speeches. I heard the Deputy Leader of the Opposition make another one when he spoke to the Teo Chew Association in Melbourne. These speeches were critical of this measure. When they think that nobody is watching in the Senate, they will vote for its repeal. But, when they go to the Federation of Ethnic Communities Councils, he says:. . . we need to address current government policies which have denied recently arrived migrants any access to employment services to help them find work. Many migrants face a critical period just after they arrive in Australia, where if they are not assisted to find work quickly, they and their families run the risk of becoming alienated and impoverished in their new home. It will be an absolute priority of the next Labor government to prevent this type of thing from happening.And this to the rounds of applause from the audience who read into it that maybe something was going to happen. It was not until he went outside and was doorstopped by the honourable gentlemen from above that we got the answer that the Labor Party in office would not be looking at repealing these measures. So what are they about? They are about walking down both sides of the street saying  one thing to ethnic communities to a round of applause in expectation that these measures might be repealed but, when they think it might be reported in the mainstream press, they want to walk away from any substantial change in relation to this measure. I think they need to be judged by the duplicitous message that they are giving out. I heard the honourable member for Denison once talking about people who talk out of both sides of their mouths; that is exactly what they have been doing on this measure, and they have been found out.</DOC>

 - How absolutely fascinating. This is really very interesting: the Leader of the Opposition talking about inconsistency on privatisation. This is the man who swore on a stack of bibles that a Labor government would never privatise Australian Airlines and went ahead and did it. - This is the man who put his hand over his heart and wrote to every member of the Commonwealth Bank Employees Union and said, `Labor will never sell the Commonwealth Bank.' This is the man that no doubt the new Labor candidate for Dickson had in mind when she said:I think Labor in opposition won't sell Telstra, but I'm more worried about Labor in government. That is not me. That is not the men and women of the Australian media. That is the Leader of the Opposition. The great albatross that he carries around his neck is that the Australian people know his duplicitous form on privatisation.The great advantage that we bring to this debate is that we have been uncompromising supporters of privatisation. I can remember back in the middle-1980s when I spoke in favour of the privatisation of the then Telecom and the then Commonwealth Bank. I can remember Bob Hawke and Paul Keating saying, `What a shocking thought.' I can remember Michael Duffy getting up in here and saying, `Selling the Commonwealth Bank is like burning down the gum tree. How could you ever contemplate doing something like that.' Yet one by one, bit by bit, year after year when they got into government and needed a bit of money - and even to the extent of the Leader of the Opposition as finance minister quietly saying, `John, of course you will support the privatisation of the Commonwealth Bank in the Senate, won't you?' - they privatised them.It is the same old story. When Labor is in government, the Democrats bail them out on social issues. Our commitment to sensible economic outcomes means that, if we have to make a choice between a sensible, realistic economic decision and economic vandalism, we will always support the sensible decision. - Little Sir Echo! - This is so relevant to the debate. I know it hurts the Labor Party that I was asked a question about the credibility of assurances on privatisation and I am giving the parliament and through it the Australian  people just a little reminder of some not so ancient history on this subject.The people in the Australian bush will be guaranteed the community services to which they are entitled. The legislation that is going to be introduced into the parliament this week will deliver guarantees you never dreamt of, let alone implemented. Once again you had 13 years to deliver all of these benefits for the bush. - If you were so interested in the bush, why did you not do something about it over the last 13 years. You failed to fix the tax system. You failed to give proper levels of service in the Australian bush. - I can only say -  - Was it a Labor government that introduced the $250 million communications fund? No. Was it a Labor government that introduced legislation such as we have foreshadowed to guarantee community services in the bush? Certainly not. Was it a Labor government that legislated for universal service obligations? In fact it was a Labor Prime Minister of Australia who actually flirted with the idea of having untimed local telephone calls. I know that many from South Australia, in particular, will remember Bob Hawke floating that idea during the by-election in Adelaide in 1988.In other words, wherever you look it is the Australian Labor Party and the Leader of the Opposition in particular who have form on the question of privatisation. We have always supported the privatisation of those government enterprises that ought to be in the ownership of the men and women of Australia. We have been honest. We have been open.  We are being honest and open again. By contrast, the Australian Labor Party in opposition has always misled the Australian people. When it has stumbled into government, it has done the exact opposite to what it promised in opposition. On this issue above all issues it is absolutely bereft of any credibility at all.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Lindsay for her question. I am aware of the highly successful project run by Mission Australia in her electorate at Penrith which is upgrading the Nepean River regatta area in preparation for the Sydney Olympic Games. It is a measure of how little the opposition understands work for the dole that the Leader of the Opposition is quoted as saying, `I'm afraid to say, at the end of the day, there is not one job in it.'The project manager for the Penrith regatta project has informed the government that some 30 - repeat 30 - participants in this project have already left to get jobs or to pursue further education or training. Work for the dole has been a resounding success. Many of the young people that I have met on work for the dole projects say that work for the dole is the best thing that has happened to them for a long time. A number that I have spoken to have wanted to extend the time they spend on a work for the dole project each week.We are now four months into the work for the dole pilot projects and nearly 5,000 young Australians have already taken up the opportunity to participate in work for the dole.  They have welcomed the chance to put something back into their local communities. Already 144 of the 179 projects - that is 80 per cent of the projects - have commenced and this is well ahead of target.I am aware of comments, however, over the weekend by the member for Batman, who described work for the dole as a sham. He is one of the policy dinosaurs in Jurassic Park over there that the member for Werriwa has been forced to speak out against. Of course, the Leader of the Opposition has made it absolutely clear, and every member of this House should be absolutely clear, that if the Labor Party were to get into office they would abolish work for the dole, because they do not believe in communities and young people working together. They have no idea. There is a policy vacuum there on the dole.In fact the only person who has put forward an idea for unemployed people in recent times has been one Mark Latham, the member for Werriwa, whose idea was that unemployed people should be asked to pay back their dole. That is his idea. The member for Werriwa has obviously been appalled by the policy vacuum that he has witnessed in the leadership group on the other side of the House. He has seen these dinosaurs up here with not a single positive idea about how to help unemployed people in this country and he has felt compelled to speak out.He is not interested in his shadow portfolio. If you flip through the index to the book, and you read it, there is not much on education there. There is very little on education and training. Apprenticeships do not crack a mention. By careful study I managed to find the word `literacy' once. He is not interested in the shadow portfolio for education; he is interested in the leadership, and this is his bid. He is very young and he is very restless. He is very restless and he is fed up with that vacuum on the other side of the House. The weak Leader of the Opposition should pull him into line and put forward some ideas on account of the Labor Party itself.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, I can repeat the guarantees that I have already given, that is, we will be legislating to provide all of the community service obligations. We will be legislating to ensure the maintenance of price caps. - The Leader of the Opposition asks about new technologies. New technology is in part coming out of the $250 million fund, which you opposed. The Leader of the Opposition pretends that he is a proponent of new technology, yet he voted against a measure that has made $250 million in new technology available to the Australian people. The Leader of the Opposition has no credibility on this.I can say again to the people of the Australian bush, `You will receive the guarantees that you seek and you will receive through legislation the guarantees to which you are entitled.' I can also assure the people of the  country areas of Australia that they will receive benefits from our communications policy that will give them a world class telecommunications system, on a par with and equal in value and equal in quality, and equal in technological advance and superiority, to that enjoyed and obtained by people living in the metropolitan areas of Australia.</DOC>

 - Yes, Mr Speaker, I am aware of various proposals to change the Workplace Relations Act, and I was aware of them really all the way back when we originally drafted the Workplace Relations Bill in consultation with the ACTU and the employer group, ACCI. What has always been clear is that the ACTU are implacably opposed to some aspects of the Workplace Relations Act. Last week, the official statistics revealed that we had the lowest level of industrial disputes since 1913. One of the reasons for that is that we now have a system in place which requires employees and unions to return to work, where so directed by the Industrial Relations Commission.We also have new powers in the Trade Practices Act which are a ban and prohibition on secondary boycotts and primary boycotts. On the waterfront today, for example, the reason Australia is not in a state of national economic chaos, why we are not in a state of national paralysis, is because the new provisions of the Trade Practices Act make it very difficult for the unions to bring the country to a standstill. When Labor was in, for example, when they were trying to sell ANL, Australia was taken out on a national dispute. That was because there was no effective ban against that sort of action.It is incredible that the ACTU are now proposing the repeal of the provisions in the  Trade Practices Act which have given real protection to the Australian community against industrial thuggery. It is no wonder, therefore, that the Labor Party are now just repeating the directives they have had from the ACTU to repeal these provisions in the Trade Practices Act. If the Labor Party were re-elected, if the Trade Practices Act provisions were repealed, the people who would suffer are not just the Australian community at large but, in particular, all those small businesses that usually cop it by industrial thuggery and blackmail.The ACTU has a big interest in this because some of the affiliates of the ACTU have in fact been taken to court by the ACCC for breaches of the Trade Practices Act. So it is no wonder the ACTU wants those provisions repealed. Who would suffer? The very small businesses today who are protected by those provisions. Why do they want them out of the Trade Practices Act? Because in the Trade Practice Act if you are in breach of that act, you go before a real court and you face real penalties, up to $750,000. You can also face injunctive relief being provided against industrial thuggery.It is a classic case of one area where the Labor Party seem to have a policy but it is not their policy; it is a directive from the ACTU. The ACTU's directive is that they basically want the unions off the leash. They want the unions to be able to run secondary boycotts against small businesses if Labor is re-elected. That is why that is their policy. They will also enhance for themselves the wider powers in the commission again, which is just basically a deal for the trade union movement.They will abolish the Office of the Employment Advocate. Why do they want to abolish that? Because if you are being dragooned by a union into joining a union, the one person you can ring up today and get some real help from is the Office of the Employment Advocate. These directives from the ACTU and the fact that the member for Canberra is happy to mouth the requirements on him by the ACTU show what a risk Labor really is.</DOC>

 - One of the most significant unrepudiated claims in this whole debate is the claim made by the Leader of the Opposition when minister for communications in the former government when he actually intimated to the managing director of Telstra, Mr Blount, that it was the long-term aim of the Labor Party to privatise the entirety of Telstra. - The very interesting thing is that the Leader of the Opposition has never come into the parliament and denied it. The Leader of the Opposition has never done so. - You notice the slippery use of the words. You notice that he is not prepared to say, `I did not tell Mr Blount that I wanted to privatise the entirety of Telstra.' That is very significant, because everybody knows that the Leader of the Opposition has an enormous amount of form on this subject. That kind of slippery, half-smart answer does not convince anybody. I am intrigued that, yet again given the opportunity, the Leader of the Opposition is not quite prepared to bring himself to actually say that he did not make that comment to Mr Blount, because maybe he did. - I know he is very sensitive on these issues because he and his party have an enormous amount of form. He and his party misled the Australian public about the sale of other government assets. Once again, they are misleading the Australian public in relation to the sale of Telstra.As many people said during the last election campaign, the only difference between us and the Labor Party is that we were prepared to say before the election what we were going to do after. Does anybody seriously believe that if the Labor Party had won the last election it would not have gone about selling at least one-third of Telstra? Of course it would have. Everybody knows that. Every man and woman in the gallery knows that. Every Australian knows that. These phoney attempts by the Leader of the Opposition to pretend -  - Their record declares it. - I would say further to the Leader of the Opposition that the legislation to be introduced into the parliament this week by the government will provide the most comprehensive, most detailed, most generous and most enduring guarantees of community service obligations and equality of service for all Australians, irrespective of where they live, that have ever been delivered by any government.I make one other observation. All of the questions asked by the Leader of the Opposition seem to proceed upon the extraordinary proposition that, if you want to make something efficient, if you want to ensure that the quality of service is continually improved, you retain it in 100 per cent government ownership. That has not been the experience of Australia over the years. That has not been the experience of other countries. I do not believe it will be the experience in relation to Telstra.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kingston for her question. The government first heard early yesterday morning that Mr  Nicholas Cheesman and a Thai colleague had been detained apparently by the Democratic Karen Buddhist Army in Burma. We have not been able to confirm at first hand his welfare, but we understand that Mr Cheesman is as well as could be expected in these difficult circumstances and we are not aware that any demands have been made. Mr Cheesman works for a non-government organisation called Burma Issues and this organisation is taking a lead role in negotiating his release and that of his Thai colleague, and my department believes that for the time being this is the best way to proceed.This morning both the Thai and Burmese ambassadors were asked to come in to my department and meet with the head of the South-East Asia division. This was an occasion for the government to register our concerns in the strongest possible way and we sought their assistance in working towards a safe release of Mr Cheesman and his Thai colleague. Yesterday I instructed the embassy in Bangkok to send an officer - I think they are going to send two actually - to Mae Sot immediately. This will help to ensure that we are best placed to assist on the ground.By yesterday afternoon my department had undertaken extensive consultations with our embassies in Rangoon and in Bangkok. Our embassies made contact with the Thai and Burmese governments, and I understand the issue has been raised with the Burmese foreign minister himself and at senior levels in the Thai government. Senior officers in Canberra spoke with the Burmese ambassador and a senior official in the Thai embassy expressing our concern and seeking their assistance.Also yesterday afternoon my department convened a special interdepartmental committee of representatives of departments and agencies with capabilities to contribute in situations such as these. The committee will continue to monitor the situation and, if necessary, recommend further action.Finally, Mr Speaker, let me inform you and the House that Mr Cheesman's parents have expressed their confidence in the actions now being taken by Burma Issues to secure the release of their son. We naturally respect the  parent's wishes and will continue to do all that we can to assist. I know the Australian people would expect us to do so.</DOC>

 - I will naturally have a look at the particular case that has been raised by the honourable member. I take the opportunity afforded by the question asked by the member for Dobell, first of all, to refute completely the claim that the decision taken in relation to the dental service in any way breached the undertaking that I gave in relation to pensions. Not even the fervoured, juvenile imagination of the member for Dobell could persuade anybody that a commitment made in relation to pensions relates to the maintenance of every Commonwealth and state program no matter what it may be. - No entitlement. He does not even understand the meaning of the English language. Because the member for Dobell has asked me the question, I take the opportunity to reminding those who sit opposite that the level of benchmarking of pensions under my government has been more extensive and more generous and indeed beyond the commitments that were made at the time of the last election.I say to the member for Dobell that, so far from breaching a commitment in relation to pensions made at the last election, we have in fact gone beyond what we undertook to do in the pension area. We put it in legislation and, in addition to that, we have extended it in relation to war widows - a decision that I announced last week. That goes beyond what we promised.I say to the member for Dobell, so far from us welching on that promise, we exceeded it. We delivered that promise in full. We went further. Just as we have gone further in relation to relief in relation to small business, so we have gone further in relation to relief for pensioners. I remember that the President of the Pensioners Federation of Australia, I think Mrs Maguire is her name, when she learnt that as a result of the pegging of the old age pension to 25 per cent of male average weekly ordinary time earnings - and that was in legislation brought in by my government - and when she learnt that there was going to be an increase of something like $6.80 a fortnight, she expressed her pleasure and she expressed her surprise.When you bear in mind that this is occurring in an era of zero inflation - I repeat: in an era of zero inflation - what my government did in relation to that was appropriate. It was certainly what the pensioners were entitled to receive. I reject totally any miserable dishonest claim by the member for Dobell that we have broken commitments. We have not broken commitments. - Dishonest - what's your trouble? - It is very accurate. It was. It was very dishonest. - Not only do I reject completely the erroneous claim made by the member for Dobell that the dental service in some way breached the undertaking regarding  pensions, I take the opportunity of telling the pensioners of Australia that we have not only kept all of our promises to them but also gone further. At a time of zero inflation, we have indexed the level of the pension to male average weekly ordinary time earnings. As a result, they have received an increase of $6.80 a week that they would not have received if the former government had remained in office. That is the take-out of this. If you had remained in office and you had applied the CPI, the pensioners of Australia would not have received it.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Casey for what I think is his debutante question in this parliament. Last week, with my New Zealand counterpart, Max Bradford, we agreed a joint statement on future directions in the case of defence relations. In pursuing these arrangements, we will do a number of things, including increasing the senior defence exchanges, planning to increase our ability to mount combined operations and getting together on common equipment buys.I also put to Mr Bradford and other New Zealand officials that they should consider increasing their defence spending in New Zealand. In 1996, in US dollars, the New Zealanders spent $205. In Australia, we spent $455 per head, just 45 per cent of the Australian figure which, of course, is 45 per cent of the current US spend. Both these matters are matters for the New Zealand parliament to decide but, in line with the New Zealand defence minister, who expressed similar concerns, I hold some hope that future New Zealand budgets might improve somewhat. At the same time, I put to them that they should acquire a third Anzac frigate. There is some chance that that might happen later in the year. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. It has been interesting to note some of the questions coming from the Labor Party today about telephone services to regional Australia. People in Australia, particularly the people in regional Australia, should realise that Labor's 1992 decision to close down the analog network by 1 January 2000 was a disaster, an unmitigated disaster. It made no provision for regional areas which receive only analog coverage. Labor mandated a particular technology and, in doing so, ditched the interests of regional Australians.Labor made matters worse when they built their decision into licensed conditions and into a contract with Vodafone. They sold out regional Australia, where analog systems were fairly well-established, to provide a financial incentive to a commercial network operator. Thanks to that Labor decision in 1992, any attempt by this government to legislate to overturn the analog phase-out could expose taxpayers to risk of compensation. In stark contrast to that, we support people in regional Australia. Our government is fixing another mess left by Labor. This has been another unmitigated mess left by Labor.We will see that all areas of regional Australia will continue to get reasonably equivalent coverage after 2000 AD, the year their services would have ceased under Labor. By 30 June this year, the ACA review will look at each regional area which currently has AMPS service to see if Labor's AMPS phase-out would leave that area without any reasonable, equivalent alternative mobile phone coverage. An AMPS service will be retained in regional areas after Labor's cut-off in the year 2000.It has been left to a coalition government to address the needs of regional Australia as far  as telecommunications services and mobile phones are concerned. Labor were going to leave lots of parts of regional Australia completely without mobile phone services and they legislated that way. It has taken the coalition government to come back and address the problem, and we are doing that. All parts of regional Australia will have a reasonably equivalent mobile phone service after the year 2000, when the Labor party were going to cut lots of areas of regional Australia off from having mobile phone services.</DOC>

 - Let me make it very clear that we stand up to providing a very adequate level and an improved level of Telstra services right across country Australia. In relation to ISDN, we already ensure that 93 per cent of Australians can have access to ISDN. We are going to push that envelope further and lift that to 96 per cent of Australians. But we are going to do it -  - This is where the misquote comes in. I want you to understand that the misquote is an honourable error, given the nature of the Laurie Oakes program. If an individual consumer applies for ISDN, provided they are within that 93 per cent at present - 96 per cent by the end of this year - Telstra can, in fact, and will be required to, connect them to ISDN. That is a very reasonable benchmarking. In some cases there will be further benchmarking laid out with our consumer service guarantee and there will be further rafting up of the penalties as already provided for. We are taking a range of practi  cal steps and providing guarantees which you never got around to in your 13 years of government.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Page for his question. I think the honourable member will be pleased to know that the outcome on international trade in goods and services for the month of February, which showed a deficit of $321 million, was an improvement by 42 per cent on the outcome for the previous month. Most people will think that is good news - that there was an improvement in the month of February of 42 per cent on January.The result was much better than market expectations, which were expecting a trade deficit of about $550 million. Merchandise exports rose about 2.9 per cent. Non-rural and other exports increased, while services exports rose by 0.2 per cent. Merchandise imports rose 0.3 per cent after falling sharply in the previous month and, while capital goods and intermediate goods imports rose 1.6 and two per cent respectively, imports of consumption goods actually fell by 3.5 per cent. A good picture in relation to the international trade for the month of February: credits, that is, exports of goods and services, rising by about two per cent and debits, that is, imports of goods and services, staying constant. I think all Australians will welcome that outcome.Having said that, this is of course one month's figures. The government would expect, in the forthcoming year 1998-99, the current account to widen somewhat as a consequence of the external situation, particularly in relation to Asia.I endorse the comments that were recently made by the Governor of the Reserve Bank, who observed:On previous occasions the cyclical widening of the current account deficit usually reflected a mixture of external influences, such as a fall in the terms  of trade, plus some significant internal imbalances or policy deficiencies.He noted on this occasion that, whilst there would be a cyclical turn in relation to the current account expected, we have none of these imbalances. It would essentially be the result of an external contraction of demand, with domestic demand running faster than trend but certainly on a sustainable basis.Over the last two decades Australia has had three current account blow-outs: in 1985-86 at 6.7 per cent, in 1989-99 at 6.8 per cent, and in 1994-95 at 6.7 per cent. We would not expect a current account blow-out of anything like that over the course of 1998-99. But, importantly, the change in the government's economic position has put us in a much stronger position in relation to those cyclical turnarounds. Whilst, during those blow-outs, Australia was suffering from high inflation, we now have one of the best inflation rates in the developed world. Whilst, in respect of at least two of those blow-outs Australia was in serious deficit, we now have the opportunity to get our budget into surplus.We go into this cyclical turnaround and external challenge in a strengthened position because this government took the key decisions to strengthen the Australian economy. We had the foresight to strengthen the Australian economy at a time when developments in Asia may not have been expected, but when it was prudent to do so - to set Australia up for opportunities which we otherwise would have missed. They are the benefits of good, sound economic policy.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Parramatta for his question. I note that 22 per cent of Australia's top 100 exporters have operations in the western Sydney region. I note also that there are some very diverse exporters there - Electric Transit, exporting electric vehicles; Huxley Homes, manufacturing steel framed housing and targeting the Japanese market; and a new Australian motorcycle company. You failed me on my visit to your electorate! I wanted to go to that motorcycle company during a very busy morning. I know you will rectify this on my next visit.I am very happy to build on the answer by the Treasurer, arising from the release of trade figures earlier today. Exports are up two per cent and imports are down 0.2 per cent. This leads to a very interesting set of figures, which I now advise the House of for the first time. In the first eight months of this financial year, compared to the first eight months of the last financial year, exports are up $8 billion, or 12.1 per cent. Eight months versus the previous eight months, our exports are staying up longer and stronger. In fact, they are up $8 billion to $76.1 billion. Yes, imports are rising by about the same level of expansion but, against all odds, our exporters deserve a gold medal as they go through these very tough trading times, especially in the Asian region, and get the job done.We are about pursuing a policy over the last two years of trade diversification - diversification of product and diversification of markets within and also beyond Asia. It is in that context that we have also been focus  ing on the country to country bilateral negotiations. It is a bit interesting to see that the frontbench of the Labor Party is split on this matter again. I have the publication the Good Weekend, the young and restless. - This is not the one Kim Beazley is launching. The book is over here, in fact. Whilst we hate to add to the policy agony which exists at the moment on the Labor Party's side, let me pose to the House a question: would our exports figures be as good as they are today if we had Stephen Smith as minister for trade? - Would they have been as good if we had had Peter Cook as minister for trade? - Would they have been as good if we had had Kim Beazley, the failed Minister for Finance, as Prime Minister? - That is the truth of the matter. Your agenda would have sabotaged our exporters. Your agenda, without any budget balance strategy and with a huge blow-out in fiscal policy, would have sabotaged our exports.We are making real progress against the odds - and full marks to our exporters - but we are up against a number of tough circumstances, not the least of which is export subsidisation by Europe and market access problems. These are matters I have discussed this morning with the Minister for Agriculture from Argentina, Mr Sola, and President Menem. Those talks will continue with the Prime Minister during the rest of this day, but that is a prelude to the Cairns Group ministerial meeting, which will take place in Sydney tomorrow and the next day, where we will finetune our agenda to take to the World Trade Organisation in May and make further real progress on behalf of our exporters, be they farmers, small business operators or from the manufacturing industry. We are proud to  stand up for our exporters. There is no white flag brigade on our side of the House.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker -  - Leave me alone. - I thank the member for Indi for his question. I know that he has a keen interest in telecommunications matters for regional and rural Australia. Indeed, the Telecommunications Performance Monitoring Bulletin released by the Australian Communications Authority does give some concern. It is clearly unacceptable. The percentage of new services connected on time to clients, particularly in country areas, and the percentage of faults cleared within one or two working days of notification has also declined.  Telstra's quality of service levels has been unacceptable for many years, particularly in regional Australia. It is true that only 64 per cent of faults nationally were cleared within one working day of notification in the December 1997 quarter. It is also true that this fault clearance has only exceeded 75 per cent in two quarters in the last four years. There is clearly room for improvement. Yesterday's announcement by my colleague the minister for communications sends, I believe, an unmistakable message to Telstra that there must be a greater effort and a greater concerted effort to meet customer obligations. It is interesting to look at what we have done since we have been in government to try to address these issues in a concerted way. There was a failure of the previous government to address the issue of digitisation of telephone exchanges. As I have said in this place before, the basic building blocks for a telecommunications system are those exchanges. If you upgrade the exchanges to digital capacity, then a range of new services that can flow to urban, regional and remote Australia have the opportunity to be delivered. That is an absolute fundamental, and we have made those commitments. High speed data capacity is also another issue that we have committed ourselves to with the rollout of ISDN, something that the Labor Party did not do. The upgrading of the definition of the standard telephone service is another area we have taken account of as we can again see the development of new technologies, which I have spoken about in this place. The opposition opposed the $250 million regional telecommunications fund. Why I do not know. They come in here with confected indignation and a series of questions about regional and remote Australia and yet they opposed the very opportunity to support a concerted, direct application of funds to address those issues. So I think they come to this argument with unclean hands. Finally, I might mention the customer service guarantee and the extension of the customer service guarantee which we outlined yesterday. In this House in 1996 when I introduced the legislation, we introduced the  customer guarantee. What we did yesterday was to extend the customer service guarantee to provide for a very significant issue - that is, the capacity for the Australian Communications Authority to address systemic problems that emerge from receiving individual complaints to the Telecommunications Ombudsman scheme. That enables the ACA to take direct action to address those matters to require remedial action of a carrier. That is a very significant change. With the capacity to deliver $10 million fines, that is a clear indication of this government's resolve to address the customer performance by Telstra to the satisfaction of urban, regional and remote Australians.I might say in finality that the concept of a customer service guarantee was something that this government put in place. You received the information and knew the need for such an apparatus - something to go into the consumer arsenal to require better performance from carriers - and you did nothing. You did nothing. What you should be doing is applauding this government for what it has done in this area as it addresses the need to see service improvement right around this country, but particularly in regional areas, for which I, the member for Indi and others are concerned. Rest assured we are addressing the issues. You did not.</DOC>

 - Perhaps the most spectacular illustration of the benefits of the government's policies in this area was demonstrated yesterday when the Westpac Banking Corporation, one of the largest banks in Australia, announced an absolutely revolutionary approach to the costing of funds lent to the small business sector. What the Westpac Bank delivered yesterday represented the great breakthrough that small business has been waiting for for years.By way of background, I might remind the parliament that, when my government came to office in March 1996, the basic lending rate for small business in Australia was 11.25 per cent. Many customers had to pay much more for their funds, but the base rate was 11.25 per cent. I am pleased to say that Westpac announced yesterday that its new base rate would be 7.2 per cent. In other words, in just over two years the base lending rate for small business has fallen from 11.25 per cent to 7.2 per cent. That is a fall of four per cent over a rate of 11.25 per cent. Even the most mean-minded and miserable of those who sit opposite would have to acknowledge that that represents a breathtaking breakthrough for the small business community of Australia. It is stunningly good news for the small business community of Australia. It is a direct result of the financial policies that my government has followed. It would not have been possible if we had not eliminated Mr Beazley's $10½ billion deficit. It would not have been possible if we had not set about putting in order the financial wreckage that we inherited from the former government when we were elected in March 1996.In case anybody thinks for a moment that 11.25 per cent was the worst of it under the former government, I might remind you that in January 1990, when Mr Hawke was Prime Minister, Mr Keating was the Treasurer and I think the Leader of the Opposition was a senior minister in the government, the small business overdraft rate leaped to 20.5 per cent. It almost beggars belief in 1998 that the small business community could have suf  fered, let alone survived, a level of interest rates reaching 20.5 per cent. Not only at 7.2 per cent are we down dramatically from the level that obtained in March 1996, but we are dramatically down from the level of 20.5 per cent that obtained in January 1990.We ask rhetorically: what does that mean for the small business sector? It means more investment. It means more jobs. It means more opportunity. It means more hope. It means more optimism for the small business sector. Many commentators have observed this morning that this could be worth conservatively between $150 million and $400 million a year in additional assets for the small business community of Australia.I want to make it clear to my colleagues - and almost the entire rural and regional Australia is represented by those members who represent the Liberal and National Party - that the cut in interest rates, this new and revolutionary low interest rate regime, for the small business sector of Australia will flow through to the farming and rural sector of Australia. For years and years the farmers of Australia have asked that they get lower interest rates, that they get a fairer deal from the banks of Australia.I renew the call that the Treasurer and I made this morning for the remaining trading banks of Australia to pass on the reduction that has been offered by the Westpac Banking Corporation. I call on the other banks to follow the lead of Westpac. I call on the other banks to join in giving to the small business sector of Australia this much needed breakthrough, this long overdue breakthrough and a breakthrough long denied to them by 13 years of Labor government and a breakthrough made possible by the sound financial policies my government has followed since its election in March 1996.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Canberra for that question. Let me make my attitude towards Mr Corrigan and the National Farmers Federation very clear. We will support to the hilt their efforts within the law to provide competition on the Australian waterfront. Within the law we will support their efforts. I applaud the attempts of anybody who is willing to bring competition to the Australian waterfront. I applaud the courage of the National Farmers Federation. I respect the courage of Mr Corrigan.Let me say that the Australian business community, the rural sector of Australia, the consumers of Australia - in fact, the entire Australian community is desperate to have a modern, efficient, competitive Australian waterfront. It has taken the election of a coalition government to change the law to make that possible. It has taken the election of a coalition government to break the unfair monopoly on the recruitment and supply of waterfront labour by the Maritime Union of Australia. Only the election of a coalition government has made this possible. Only the election of a coalition government has encouraged people to embark upon the provision of a more productive and a more competitive Australian waterfront.Let me repeat: we will support to the hilt anybody who is prepared to provide a better deal on the Australian waterfront. We will support them to the hilt, provided they act within the law. We are in the business of providing a more competitive Australian waterfront. We will not be diverted from the support that we have given to those who are willing to do it. They deserve the support of the Australian community and I believe overwhelmingly they will receive it.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for McEwen for her question. There are a lot of interesting individuals who do share the view that the Australian taxation system is sclerotic. I have actually seen reported recently comments to the effect that one of the problems of the Australian taxation system is the narrowness of the current indirect tax base. I have also seen recent comments that there are advantages of taxing consumption over income to make sure that high income earners pay their fair share of tax. In fact, claims along that line are made in an important new work by the member for Werriwa, which is entitled Civilising Global Capital . - The honourable member for Banks is upset that the member for Werriwa is getting in front of him in the long line of Labor hopefuls. It goes: Beazley, Evans, Crean, Kernot, Latham, Tanner, Banks. - There is no need to get so upset, because we had rather noticed that there was a new sense of intellectual vigour on the Labor front bench this morning. With the return of the member for Werriwa, the IQ of the Labor front bench has doubled today. He is apparently the thinker of the modern Labor Party. We are actually thinking of declaring thinkers in the Labor Party an endangered species. In this book Civilising Global Capital , the leader of the Labor Party says:The canvas Latham paints upon is very broad indeed. May all his readers be able to appreciate it in its full breadth as I have. Civilising Global Capital  might just as well be subtitled Generation X meets Jurassic Park . Here we have the generation X who are desperate for leadership. When they come out and call for tax reform, they hear the dinosaurs of Jurassic Park - the Labor Party leadership, with Tyrannosaurus Kim over there - saying, `Whatever you do, don't talk about the tax system.' When they come out and talk about how frightfully immoral it would be to go into economic nostalgia, they hear old Simon say, `Don't talk about industry policy.' The member for Hotham was described as `frightfully immoral'. From now on, he will be known as `the member for Hotham FI' in this parliament. He was bagged by his own frontbencher in this marvellous work.But the important thing is this: we will not try to discourage thinking in the Labor Party. It is something there is an awful lack of in the modern leadership. The member for Werriwa - and he has done it well - has stood up and tried to assert some leadership, and we congratulate him for doing it. We know why he would want to assert some leadership in the Labor Party.You get asked a lot of questions in this parliament that you can answer pretty easily, but one question I could never answer is if somebody from the opposition got up and asked me: What does Kim Beazley actually stand for? Would there be anyone in the parliament capable of answering a question like that? What policy issue is Kim Beazley actually prepared to take on? What issue of leadership could he possibly show to the Australian Labor Party?When the member for Werriwa says that the tax system is sclerotic, he is right. When he says that we should tax consumption, he is right. When he talks about the services base, he is right. When he fingers the lack of leadership in the Labor leadership, he is right. When he talks about the member for Hotham being frightfully immoral, he is right. All we can say is, `Keep the thinking coming, old son. We appreciate it, even if your party does not.' </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Fisher for his  question. There are reports today in the press that the PCS business is considering its possibilities and options of setting up business in Brisbane. I am delighted to advise the House that the Premier of Queensland, Mr Borbidge, has invited the PCS representatives to go to Queensland for discussions, and those discussions are going to be held this week.There is no doubt that Brisbane port operations would be much more efficient from a stevedoring perspective if they could get some real competition into that port. The facts speak for themselves when it comes to efficiency levels in the port of Brisbane. I have here the crane rates from the port of Brisbane for the September quarter 1997, and those crane rates are 16.1. That is actually less than the five-port national average for Australia, which is 18.3, and Australia's average is well below an international comparative figure, which would at a reasonable level be about  25 crane lifts an hour. So the levels of inefficiency in Brisbane, unfortunately, are chronic. The numbers go back many years, and there is no question that it would be a big advantage to exporters in Queensland if they could get a more efficient system.There was an international survey out not so long ago which compared 18 ports, including Australian and international ports on a comparative basis. When you look at Brisbane's results, on reliability it was 14 out of 18; on turnaround speed, it was 13 out of 18; and on a value for money criteria, it was 14 out of 18. Of course, the ports which were worse than Brisbane were other ports in Australia - Melbourne, Sydney and the like.So if a great state like Queensland, which has a vibrant export industry, could have an efficient port operation in respect of stevedoring, a lot of jobs would be created in Queensland. That would generally be for the benefit of Queensland workers and it would boost export income for the country as a whole. If we can boost Australia's export income, then we can start to fix the debt which we were left with by the Labor Party, who are now opposing the very things that we have done that have actually made this a possibility.The last thing I would say is that there is very widespread support for these reforms, not just from the initiative of the Queensland government. I thought the Business Council of Australia put it very well when they said last week:In the view of the Council, comprehensive waterfront reform remained a major area of `unfinished business' on the national micro-economic reform agenda and, if tackled fundamentally, would flow on substantial benefits to the national economy and the community.Those words are absolutely right and particularly important for Brisbane.</DOC>

 - I believe in a number of things in relation to this. The most important is that I believe in a decent, competitive Australian waterfront. The end game is to help Australian jobs and to help Australian investments. That is the end game. -  - It is very interesting that the member for Canberra talks about things done in 1994. Who was in government in 1994? The Labor Party was. You also talk about Mr Corrigan. It is well known around this building that the best friend Mr Corrigan ever had in politics was Paul Keating. It is very, very well known. Mr Corrigan is a businessman. - It is very, very well known. Mr Corrigan is involved in an activity which is designed to give the Australian waterfront a chance and is designed to give Australian exporters a chance. The statements that have been made by my colleague the minister for workplace relations in relation to redundancies on the Australian waterfront, I stand by fully. I might remind those who sit opposite that in 1989 the Hawke government gave certain guarantees and entered into certain arrangements under the WIRA process which involved the provision of very, very large amounts of money. - I am not aware of anybody who has been sacked, so the proposition that he is putting to me is entirely hypothetical; therefore, the appropriate response for me to give is to state the policy. Let me start again. The main aim of the policy is to generate jobs and to generate exports and to generate investment, and you do that by having a more competitive waterfront. You lot were prepared to spend $420 million of the money of the taxpayers of Australia and you got absolutely nothing in return.We, by contrast, have been willing to change the law; we have had the courage to change the law. And, as a result of that, the National Farmers Federation and Mr Corrigan's company have had the courage to give new hope and new opportunity to people who use the Australian waterfront. I say again: they will have our support to the hilt, provided they act in accordance with the law. I am not aware of any law that they have broken. While ever they observe the law they will have our support, and I believe they will have the support and encouragement of the overwhelming bulk of the Australian people.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Griffith for his question. It is quite clear that the policy vacuum on the other side of the House is causing intense frustration on the front bench. The member for Werriwa is now fed up with waiting for some leadership and direction from the Leader of the Opposition. He is lashing out in this new book, trying to come up with some new ideas.I have to say to the member for Griffith that there are very few new ideas in the portfolio area of the member for Werriwa. He has never been much interested in education or training. You could go through this book and  you would be hard put to come up with a decent idea. But he has been very busy thinking hard in the portfolio areas of other members of the front bench, particularly in the portfolio areas of the member for Hotham, the member for Holt and the member for Batman. One thing the member for Werriwa knows - and this book has been coming for a long time - is that there is a fundamental structural problem with policy in the Labor Party: they do not know what their policy is until it has been posted to them by the ACTU. As he said in 1990 in revising Labor's agenda: `This decade the ALP will be forced to confront the fading relevance of its trade union affiliates.' It is eight years down the track, the decade is almost finished and the member for Hotham, ex-President of the ACTU, and the member for Batman, ex-President of the ACTU, are still there on the front bench, and they do not look like fading away. The member for Werriwa is setting out to blast them out of their positions.The party is coming apart at the seams. The only way in which the Leader of the Opposition knows that he is going to fill that policy vacuum is to wait down there at the letterbox day after day - waiting, waiting, waiting for the letter from the ACTU; the unions have got to come to his rescue. Every day he anxiously opens up the letterbox and peers inside and all there is is a policy vacuum; that is all he has got. He takes that back, and that is all he is able to put on the table. You have to admire the member for Werriwa. He has tried to address this structural problem but he has failed. Maybe he could think up some policies in his own area, because that would be a good start.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, I am pleased to -  - In response to the member for Dobell, who asked me a question relating to the dental program, can I take the opportunity, first of all, of referring to the question that he asked me yesterday. - I am actually; I might even sign it in front of you. I have had the opportunity of checking the records in relation to this. Can I remind the honourable member for Dobell that, contrary to what is implied in his letter, the reference that I made to a `miserable, dishonest claim' was not a reference to allegations made by the Council for the Ageing, which I regard as a very reputable body, but rather to your attempt to suggest that the abolition of the program breached an undertaking.The truth is that your party, the Labor Party, fully intended to scrap the program, had it remained in government. The program was due to cease, the contracts were expiring, and all we did was bring forward cessation by six months. You made no -  - It was not an entitlement. It was a program that you would have got rid of if you had been re-elected. That is the bottom line. You would have got rid of it if you had been re-elected. Your attempt to pretend otherwise is as duplicitous as the attempt of the Leader of the Opposition to have it both ways when it comes to the waiting period for migrants. It is typical of the Labor Party that what it will do -  - Mr Speaker, the reality is that I was asked a question about the dental program. You would have scrapped it. You did not make any reference to it in your 1996 election campaign and, like your duplicity on the migrant waiting period, you say one thing to one group and another thing to another group. So far as the submission is concerned, I have not seen it. I will have a look at it and, if there is anything I have to add, I will do so.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Boothby for his question. There were some very serious allegations made last week about a survey run through Australian Doctor  magazine, a professional magazine, where 450 general practitioners responded to a survey. Half of them made the assertion that people had suffered death or disability due to the health care system.Dr Lindsay Gazal, who is a New South Wales GP and the convener of the General Practitioner Conference and Exhibition conference which was running last weekend, appeared in print and on radio last week. In print the following comments are reported:Dr Lindsay Gazal said . . . he knew of several cases where patients did not receive optimum treatment and had died because of problems in the health system.`People are dying out there,' he said.On Canberra radio 2CN he repeated his assertion:People are dying out there in the system.On Adelaide radio 5AA, the compere said:. . . the health care system itself . . . has been the cause of a death or a disability.Now, we're talking about causation here.Dr Gazal replied:Yes, that's it.These are extremely serious allegations. Because of these allegations I have decided to set up a high level committee of inquiry. It will comprise three of Australasia's most  respected medical practitioners. It will be chaired by Dr Bryce Phillips, a former National President of the Australian Medical Association, the Deputy President of the Victorian Medical Board and a commissioner with the Health Insurance Commission. He will be supported by Professor Brendan Kearney, currently the CEO of the Royal Adelaide Hospital, a past Chairman of the South Australian Health Commission and a past President of the Royal Australian College of Medical Administrators. The third person will be Mr Colin McCrae, the current President of the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons, an Auckland urologist.I will ask the committee of inquiry to make all possible attempts to contact each and every one of the 225 general practitioners who have claimed to have had a person suffer death or disability because of the health care system. I want to know who died, when they died and under what circumstances they died. We will attempt to identify the doctors. We will give them anonymity. We will ask that the committee reports back within six weeks. This inquiry will be conducted in privacy. It will be conducted with fairness. It will be conducted with rigour. I will report back to the House on the results of it.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Dunkley for his question, because it does enable me to clarify some matters in relation to the two-year waiting period. - I was right yesterday. I was very right yesterday. -  - And I will deal with that as well. - The fact is that there is already a safety net in place for migrants. I made it clear yesterday that the way in which the provisions are intended to operate was to cover refugees and humanitarian entrants. They are intended to cover people who, under the independent entry and family reunion arrangements, had changed circumstances after arrival. The fact is that there are 351 migrants who have been provided with special benefits in this category. That clearly indicates that the safety net is working as we intended.In the comments that I made yesterday - and I assume that this is what the Leader of the Opposition is referring to - I spoke about the way in which he addressed this question when he spoke to FECCA. I heard an interjection, when I said to him that I thought he was walking both sides of the street, that he asserts that when he spoke to FECCA he had made abundantly clear what was intended. I will read the quote - because I have gone back to find one - that he suggests makes this issue abundantly clear:When Labor next gains office at the federal level, we will face - as I intimated earlier - a substantially different budget situation from when we left office.  We will face a situation where, because of the pressures created by the coalition's worth of more than $3 billion unfunded policy reversals last year, a budget cut of nearly $400 million like this one will be largely irretrievable for us.I have never heard a more opaque way of suggesting to a group of people, who he knows are largely of non-English speaking backgrounds, that this was a clear and unambiguous statement that he was intending to repeal -  - We know the Leader of the Opposition has a way with words, but to use opaque language of that type and to expect that the argument I put yesterday, that they were walking both sides of the street, has no validity defies any semblance of reasonable comment. What is more important is that assertion that he was making that the Labor Party in office will face a substantially different budget situation. They will not face the budget situation that we faced - a $10.5 billion deficit, which will be addressed and we will be in surplus -  - I certainly will. I do not have much to add but I do wish to observe that, in relation to this matter, I received a great deal of encouragement from the Leader of the Opposition himself to go well beyond the specific question. But, in the context of the $10.5 billion deficit that we found, if they were to reach office they would be facing a surplus. We have a charter of budget honesty  that is in place now, and that will put it in a very different situation again. - Mr Speaker, I simply make the point in relation to the issue of the two-year waiting period that we have a situation in which the Leader of the Opposition, as I said yesterday, is wanting to walk down both sides of the street. He wants to put to ethnic communities an argument in relation to the two-year waiting period and he wants to try to demonstrate some semblance of budget reality when he comes into a forum like this.</DOC>

 - I am happy to take the details of a specific case and examine them. There have been a lot of claims from the  opposition that our policies are driving women out of the work force. The fact is that there is no substantial evidence that women are leaving the work force due to our policies. In fact, labour force participation amongst women with children under the age of 15 has remained quite steady at 59 per cent. There is no evidence; that is the truth of the matter. This government inherited from Labor an unplanned, unchecked, out of control child-care system. - When we brought down the planning system for child care their own shadow minister for child care gave support to it, and it was universally supported around this country. Under a Labor government for 13 years, there was no planning system in place. One must ask: were they planning to do it in year 14? Were they planning perhaps in year 15 to get their unplanned, out of control child-care sector under control? There are a couple of other facts that people need to understand about our changes to child care. - Real outlays in child care are due to increase by three per cent under our government. - Outlays under our government in child care will rise by three per cent in real terms. We will increase the number of child-care places over four years by 83,000 places targeted to areas of real  need. We will be spending $4.9 billion on child-care subsidies to parents from low and middle income families. This government has had the will to tackle the problem of child care in this country to ensure that child-care services are able to be delivered to all Australian families. We are a government which has a real commitment to and policies for child care and we have taken action to make sure that our services go to all Australian families and not just to some.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Cowper for his -  - In answering the question, I might comment on the point of order. The point of order is that a question has been asked of me about the waterfront. I have not counted the number of questions we have had from the opposition on the waterfront. It might be three or four, but it shows you how embarrassed they are because they are now complaining that we are asking questions about the waterfront. We know you are embarrassed by this issue, but to actually suggest that the government should not ensure that this issue is aired in the public debate shows how you people are bound hand and foot to the MUA. The only time these people asked a question about the waterfront dispute - the couple of times - was when the MUA had been on the radio in the morning and then been on the phone to you guys telling you what to do in the questions you have to ask. Nothing has changed. They are weak in opposition on this issue and they were weak when they were in government.I was cleaning out a drawer in my office last Friday and I found a waterfront file which had a reference to the Shipowners Mutual Strike Insurance Association. In this paper, it recorded the fact that the level of claims against the strike insurance fund in 1987-88 was 14.7 per cent from Australia and that we were the second most strike-prone place that they had to deal with as an international insurance organisation in respect of maritime industrial action.In 1989 through to 1991-92, the Labor Party sat down with the unions and asked them how much they would like and, at the end of it, we have a worse record on industrial action than we had before it. Back in 1987-88, we were the second worst. But in  1996, we did not have a claim rate of 14.7; the claim rate had risen to 23 per cent, the highest in the Western world. We have only two per cent of the world's shipping trade, yet we had a claim rate of 23 per cent - the highest level of any country - as a result of those official figures.When you look at Labor's record, I also came across a statement by Captain Richard Setchell, who runs the stevedoring operation for P&amp;O. This is a statement made by him back in November 1995 referring to Labor's program from 1989 through to 1991. In reference to the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority program, it was reported:We thought we had it made, Setchell recalls wistfully, but here we are today with a work force earning more money than they have ever dreamed about, rosters guaranteeing more time off than ever and productivity levels in many areas as low as they have ever been. We failed to see soon enough how tough an election the ALP, needing waterfront reform as a showpiece, would face in 1993.You see, the reality is that from 1989 through to 1991-92 saw a lot of money paid out, including $160 million of taxpayers' money, to a whole lot of wharfies who retired, but in the end we got no fundamental change.The reason for that is that Labor in office was never prepared to tackle this issue, in the same way that Labor in opposition is complaining that we are even asking ourselves questions about the waterfront. It tells you what would happen if Labor was ever back in office because, with the changes to the law that we have made which have allowed the farmers to start up some real competition - changes to the Trade Practices Act, the establishment of the Office of the Employment Advocate, and the other reforms - Labor is now committed to repealing those provisions. We have made a lot of advances in setting in place the structural change for real reform and we are committed to it.Lastly, the MUA got a card from their brethren in London, the ITF, the other day. Many of us, when we have been ill or at Christmas time, enjoy receiving a card. It usually says, `Hope you're feeling better, get well,' or `Looking forward to the New Year, have a great a New Year.' This is the mentality of the ITF, your international brethren - the  ACTU's and the ALP's mates - and this is what they say: `To MUA and all wharfies, the ITF wishes MUA and all wharfies a successful strike action.' That is how they think, that is how the Labor Party thinks, and it is no wonder they are embarrassed not to ask questions about it.</DOC>

 - I know there are many members on my side of the House who are interested in benefits for the ordinary Australian people. I take the opportunity at this question time, as I will at future question times, of reminding the Australian public of the many things that we have done. For example, take a family with one breadwinner earning $40,000 a year and with two children, one of whom is under the age of five. The following facts in relation to the member's question are relevant. That particular family is eligible for the government's family tax initiative which reduces the tax by $200 a child and by a further $500 a child if that child is under the age of five years. Through that alone, the annual benefit is $900. That measure was promised by the coalition in the last election campaign and it was delivered on time, in full and without qualification by the Treasurer with effect from the beginning of 1997.If the family has private health and ancillary insurance, they would be eligible for the maximum private health insurance rebate of $450 a year, a rebate incidentally that the member for Dobell would abolish the day he becomes health minister in any future Labor government.From 1998-99, the working partner may receive the savings rebate. Once it takes full effect, this rebate will be worth a maximum of $450. The working partner might also receive the rebate for spouse superannuation contributions up to a maximum of $540. Moreover, if the family, like many Australian families, has a mortgage of $100,000, the reductions in interest rates which the government has brought about translate into an  annual interest saving of no less than $3,800 a year.If you add all of those together, you would get a grand total of $6,140. They are but some of the examples of the benefits that have been brought to Australian families by my government and the continuation of the policies that we have followed will guarantee that there are further benefits for wider sections of the Australian community under my administration.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, I do regard this matter as being trivial, but given the amount of time and energy that the honourable member for Hotham and others in the Labor Party, with varying degrees of intensity and confected outrage, have put into it, let me take the honourable gentleman through the circumstances. The first and most important point to make is that at no stage did I have any personal pecuniary interest in this company. The second point I ought to make is that I held the position by virtue of the fact that I was leader of the federal parliamentary Liberal Party - hardly a closely held secret. This is a great revelation: the Labor Party have discovered I have a closet association with the Liberal Party of Australia! It is extraordinary. It is an amazing thing. Shock, horror! I am undone; I am exposed! I am the leader of the federal parliamentary Liberal Party. Even more importantly, a lot of reference has been made to the fact that this is a public company. - The Leader of the Opposition and Mr Oakes on his program last night and in his Bulletin  comment this morning, and others, have made great play upon the fact that this is a public company. Let me point out to the House that the words in the ministerial code - and this is the basis of my rejection of any claim that there is a conflict with the code -  - The words `public company' are not defined in the code as carrying the meaning given to that expression under the Corporations Act. Indeed, Mr Speaker, if you go to  The Australian Concise Oxford Dictionary , you find that a public company - and I repeat this for the benefit of all of those who have sought to claim that I was in conflict with the code - is defined in the Oxford dictionary as a company that sells shares to all buyers on the open market. Let me repeat that: sells shares to all buyers on the open market. The reality in relation to the Menzies Research Centre is that it has no shareholders. If it doesn't have any shareholders it is a bit hard to sell any shares, isn't it? - Mr Speaker, let me quote from the letter written to me by the Federal Director of the Liberal Party - and I would be very happy to table it - dated 31 March 1998.  It spoke of the Menzies Research Centre - and it is called the Menzies Research Centre, not the name given to it by the honourable member for Hotham. Freehill Hollingdale and Page had this to say:A company limited by guarantee has no shareholders. Such companies are limited companies because a member's liability to contribute to the company is limited to the amount of the guarantee. In the case of the MRC, the amount is $10 -  - The quotation continues:Such a company has no issued shares, but has administrative advantages such as simplifying procedures for admission to membership.It goes on to say:While technically a public company, for the reasons described above, a company limited by guarantee can be distinguished from a public company which consists of shareholders whose shares are traded on the stock exchange and which has as its primary function a commercial and trading purpose.It goes on to say this:At the time of the MRC's creation, a number of individuals closely associated with the Liberal Party of Australia became directors - and I have to confess that I was one of them, because I was closely associated with the Liberal Party - Some of these became directors pursuant to their positions within the party. For example, Tony Staley as federal president became a director -  - The quotation continues:John Howard became a director as leader of the Federal Parliamentary Liberal Party. - Freehills go on to say:We understand that this is one of the many responsibilities which the leader of the Federal Parliamentary Liberal Party takes on as part of his  official role within the wider party organisation. Other responsibilities of the leader include being a member of the federal executive of the Liberal Party - and so on. Let me go on to say that article 4.3(a) of the articles of association of the centre provide that directors must not be paid fees for acting in their capacity as directors. Article 4.3(b) provides that directors are entitled to be paid all travelling and other out-of-pocket expenses. But, because I didn't undertake any on behalf of the centre, I have to say the I did not claim anything. It goes on to say:The MRC is a non-profit organisation formed for public policy purposes and operates on a not-for-profit basis. At the time of its establishment, we understood the MRC to be an offshoot of the Liberal Party of Australia, established to advance the liberal philosophy supported by the party. Given its nature, the MRC may be distinguished from that of a popularly understood conception of a public company run for profit motives. This is because there are no shares to be traded, it is not involved in activities for profit, and its members and directors do not gain any financial benefit from their role with the company.I not only reject the honourable member's question, but also reject the claim that I am in any way in conflict with the code of conduct. - I table the document.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Eden-Monaro for his question. You may be aware that retail trade figures for February released this morning show that retail trade has been growing at a trend rate of about 0.3 per cent a month since November, and has risen by a very healthy 4.3 per cent over the year to February. Seasonally adjusted figures in February, whilst showing  a one per cent fall, taken together with a 1.9 per cent increase in January show a total growth of 0.9 per cent over the two months. Trend data continues to point to a healthy but not excessive growth in private consumption.I indicated yesterday in the House that, in relation to the current account deficit, where Australia faces adverse external challenges in relation to exports, one of the advantages we have in relation to the cyclical position on the current account is that demand in the domestic economy is sustainable. A healthy consumption growth, while not too excessive, taken together with good inflation and a budget moving into surplus, means that Australia has a sustainable position in relation to its current account as well.I think most people will acknowledge the fact that good retail figures have been driven by the low interest rate policy of this government, including benefits now starting to flow to business lenders, with margins coming down in relation  to business overdrafts. As far as the government is concerned, the issues that are of concern to the Australian public are still the issues of concern to this government.We are interested in families and delivering benefits to families. You won't get much interest from the Labor Party about that. We are interested in the tax system and in a decent debate about tax and how we can improve the Australian taxation system. You won't get much talk out of the Labor Party over that. We are interested in bringing down Australia's debt and making our waterfront more productive, but you won't get question from the Labor Party over that. We are interested in low home rates for Australian mortgage payers, but you don't get much interest from the Australian Labor Party in that.Here you have a campaign by the Australian Labor Party trawling through the trash cans, doing everything they can to keep the debate off issues of national importance. As far as the government is concerned, we will get on with good government. We will get on with delivering benefits to Australian families and we will get on with helping home buyers.</DOC>

 - I completely reject the motive imputed to me by the Leader of the Opposition. It is completely phoney. It is false, it is inaccurate and it bears no relationship to the fact. This is an absolutely insubstantial claim. It lacks any merit. You are wasting your own time and you are wasting the time of the Australian people. You are utterly determined on a course to ignore the true interests of the Australian people. There is no substance in this claim and you can ask me all the questions you like. There is no merit and no substance in this claim whatever.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Page for his question. I am aware of claims about university funding. In fact these claims are coming from the member for Werriwa, who  seems to have taken a couple of hours off from promoting his book to shoot out a press release. I can only assume that he was stung by comments in caucus yesterday. This article in the Sydney Morning Herald  is entitled `Hard line Latham unnerves Labor'. A number of members of parliament expressed their concerns about the risks involved and about his performance in the education portfolio. When you read the press release, those concerns are well justified. This press release put out by the member for Werriwa is replete with inaccuracies and false statements. The press release says that universities this year are facing the biggest funding cuts, the greatest cut in student places and the introduction of up-front fees.Let us see what the facts of the situation are. There are no cuts to university funding this year. In fact, Commonwealth funding for universities is up $40 million over last year. This is an increase, but to the member for Werriwa it looks like a cut. It makes you wonder about some of those footnotes in the book. Total university revenue over the last two years, government and non-government - of course, our policies are designed to give the universities the ability to raise funds from alternative sources as well -  - Mr Speaker, you will be particularly interested to know that total revenue for the universities is $550 million higher this year than it was in the last year of  the Labor government. Commonwealth-funded student places, far from falling, are increasing. There are 10,000 more Commonwealth-funded student places in universities this year than there were in Labor's last year. In fact the total number of undergraduates is up by 19,000. But the member for Werriwa is going around telling people that places have been cut. In fact, funding per fully-funded student place from the Commonwealth is now the highest for eight years. When it comes to compulsory up-front fees, the champions of compulsory up-front fees are the Labor party, because they have been insisting on compulsory up-front fees for student unionism for many, many years. Those compulsory up-front fees are to fund their union mates. We may well ask the member for Werriwa whether they are included in the up-front fees he intends to abolish. The fact is that, when it comes to his own portfolio, the member for Werriwa is just as weak in standing up to the union pressures on the Labor Party as every other member of the front bench, including the dinosaurs he is trying to get rid of. It is very revealing that, as he said in his speech at the ALP Hobart conference early this year:I look forward to working closely with the leadership of the two unions, the AEU and the NTEU - the National Tertiary Education Union - to turn the contents of this platform chapter into the programs and policies of a Beazley Labor government.There will not be a Beazley Labor government and the reason there will not is that, when it comes to any portfolio policy, the only policy they have is the one handed out to them by the unions. That is why he is out there today talking to his union mates who are organising this day of action. This day of action is totally unjustified. It is an example of the Labor Party/union strike ethic eroding the culture of learning and rational debate in the universities. There is only one group in this parliament committed to pursuing the interests of students in this country, and that is the coalition.</DOC>

 - Part of the union campaign against Patrick is to attempt to discredit the training operation which PCS is running at Webb Dock. They are doing that really as a blind and as a disguise to the inefficiencies on the Australian waterfront. A typical example  of this sort of campaign by the MUA was the radio interview of Dave Cushin, a member of the MUA, just a few days ago. He said:When our trainees - we've had some trainees last year who came on. They took three months to be fully operational, fully operationally trained; in safety, every safety aspect in getting up and running, being trained properly and everything.Safety is an important issue. Unfortunately, when you look at the record of the stevedoring industry, it is a very poor record indeed. The evidence for that is available in a report prepared by Michael Easson, a former executive of the ACTU, who demonstrated the fact that this industry had one of the worst safety records of any industry in Australia - in fact, worse than the coal industry where a lot of effort has been made to improve safety, but which has had, unfortunately, a poor record for a long time.There have been a number of people trained now to run this heavy equipment on the Australian wharf. I think their personal stories are interesting to give people a more balanced appreciation of what it is like. For example, in the paper today there is a story of a young woman who is 22. She is a science graduate who was raised on a Victorian dairy farm. She says that, for her, training has been a ball. Security people and fellow trainees have been very friendly and safety has been a high priority.She began at Webb Dock in early March and she reckons it is a pretty good deal. She is working a 35-hour week for $900. There are a lot of Australians who would be prepared to put in a decent day's work for an annual salary which she is able to obtain. She has now completed three weeks of training and, as she says, she has now been sufficiently trained for her to go on and be able to train others, subject to having a supervisory position in place.Carmel Egan is another young woman. In one sense she is the face of the future on the Australian waterfront because she has also been working on the waterfront. She is an independent person, a journalist, who went down to see what it was like. She said in the paper: The wharfies claim they deserve their pay and conditions because their work is dangerous, difficult and highly-skilled.Yesterday I gained 100 per cent in the theory assessment for my national certificate of competency to operate a portainer crane.It was neither difficult nor easy.Lastly, there was a very interesting article in the Daily Commercial News  a couple of days ago by the bloke who is the president and managing director of the company - I think, it is a Norwegian company - which actually makes portainer cranes. So he is sort of one of the world's experts in what it takes to run one of these machines. The article states:While stressing complete neutrality in Australia's waterfront problems - he wants to keep out of those - Mr Gustavson said today's portainer cranes are basically operated by two joysticks and it would take an average person a fortnight to learn to operate the machine.If someone has not mastered the skills involved in that time, he or she should not be there, he said.There is a dispute going on in Brisbane today. Industrial action is being taken by the MUA and supported by a weak leader unable to -  - I am, Mr Speaker, because I have been four minutes and five minutes is enough. The point I make -  - The point I make in conclusion is that the MUA -  - In conclusion, today in Brisbane we have industrial action being run by the MUA against Patrick because they have taken a commercial decision to sublet their property. It is time for some real competition. The people who will benefit from real competition are the farmers, the exporters and the business community in Brisbane and Queensland that for far too long have waited for a more efficient waterfront.</DOC>

 - I could say a few things about Senator Richardson. Naturally, in accordance with my longstanding and prudent practice, I will check the words attributed to me by the honourable member for Hotham before acting in total reliance. The honourable member comes to the decision that was taken on 1 October 1996 by the government to grant $100,000 to the Menzies Foundation and also to grant $100,000 to the Evatt Foundation. - Hang on, it gets better. We also granted tax deductible status to the Menzies Research Centre. Let me say a couple of things about that and then I will come to the issue of declaration which has been asked by the member for Hotham. The first thing I would report to you is that, on the  day that cabinet met, I happened to ring the Leader of the Opposition. I rang the Leader of the Opposition and I said, `Kim, we have it in mind to give $100,000 to the Menzies centre. In the interests of political balance, we will give $100,000 to the Evatt Foundation and grant tax deductibility to the Menzies Research Centre because Evatt has already got it.' I might add in parenthesis that I was the Treasurer who, in 1981, granted tax deductibility to the Evatt Foundation. - I apologise to my colleagues for the decision that I took. - No, they have never forgiven me for that. - I relayed that to the Leader of the Opposition and I said, `That's what we have in mind. We were wondering if you might be able to support the decision.' He said, `That sounds terrific. I'll take it.' - That was the response of the Leader of the Opposition. I have said before that I do not report what is discussed in cabinet, but I would make the statement that I had no personal private interest to declare.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for North Sydney for his question particularly in relation to the importance of maintaining skill levels in the migration program and the impact that any significant further increase might have upon the skill levels that now pertain. I say first of all that the government has been working very hard to regain public confidence in the migration program and the way in which it is conducted. As part of restoring that public confidence, we have been putting in place a proper balance between skilled migration and the family migration stream. - When we came to office, family migration was 70 per cent of the program. Skilled migration was a mere 30 per cent. - We now have a situation where the skilled proportion of the program is 50 per cent. We have raised the overall skill level of migrants, and I think it is important to understand that. When we came to office there was a queue or a pipeline of some 60,000 people seeking to access places where  10,000 were available, so it was a queue for about six years. The overall skill level was not as high simply because the pass mark which was required to be met was at a very low level. We raised the pass mark to what is now a historic high level. We have prescribed a wider range of occupations that require English for them to be able to be recognised in Australia. We have also reassessed the range of occupations that can be accepted. Australia now receives a younger, more highly skilled migrant stream who are providing a net benefit to the Australian economy and who are clearly a group of people who, in the main, are not welfare dependent. It ought to be recognised that, even under the lower skill levels that pertained when Labor was in office under the longitudinal survey that was being conducted, the participation rate for skilled migrants was high and the unemployment rates, even 18 months after arrival, were relatively low. I think they were, in most of the categories, well below the Australian average and about the same in the independent category. It is interesting that there are some people who want to talk about population policy. Those who talk about population policy are speaking in code, the code being either they want a significantly larger population and thus arguing for it or they want a significantly reduced population and arguing for that. The natural consequence of that would be either a significantly larger migration program or a smaller program. It is important that those who want to talk about population questions are prepared to tell us what they have in mind. Mr Kennett is prepared to tell us what he has in mind. He argues that we ought to increase the skilled migration program by 50,000.While we obviously welcome support for a larger skilled program, it ought to be understood that, if you are going to obtain the sorts of numbers that he was speaking of, you would have to significantly degrade the overall skill level. That would mean that you would be getting migrants who were either significantly older, would have a lower level of recognised and professional skills, and probably would not have English language  capacity, which is the major factor that will determine their success in the Australian labour market. - Well, there is. - The longitudinal survey shows that people without English language skills, for instance -  - I am producing it for you. The longitudinal survey shows -  - Mr Speaker, let me make it clear, through you, that the longitudinal survey shows that people who come without English language skills have unemployment rates of the order of 50 per cent. That is one of the reasons that where you can use English language for selection, and you can in the skilled areas, it produces a far more beneficial outcome. - Let me make it clear that if the states view were to be accepted it would require them to adopt views in relation to recognition of skills. It would require them to look at a different approach to regional migration, particularly on the part of Victoria. - I will, Mr Speaker. I have one final point to make. One of the points I would make in relation to Victoria is that, while it has being arguing for a 50 per cent increase in skilled migrants to Australia,  when it was given the opportunity to fill a mere 200 places within a designated regional migration program where all they would have to do is make the appropriate designations they could not fill one place. I have to say that if you cannot fill 200 places -  - I don't know how you can argue to fill 50,000 places.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hinkler for his question. Indeed, there has been an announcement by my colleague the Minister for Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts about additional grants under the regional telecommunications infrastructure fund - that $250 million fund - to address the improvements of telecommunication services in regional Australia. Indeed, in your electorate and in the electorate of the member for Wide Bay there are two specific programs. I should draw attention to those.The Wide Bay electorate will receive $680,000-odd for the implementation of the 2020 growth management project, information access. The project will establish a digital network covering some 10 local shires in the Wide Bay and Hinkler electorates providing local call Internet access to all residents. Local councils will be encouraged to use the network to provide public access to the Internet within their localities. Information training and awareness will be a feature of this project. It will take the importance of the Internet right around those two electorates.Also in the shire in your electorate there will be another $392,000 for the provision of five public access and training centres across a region of 15,000 square kilometres. What needs to be understood is that the distances in this nation need to be combated. We can do that only by successfully improving the communication services. These two projects specifically target in on that particular area and help that immensely.Honourable members should be aware there are some 93 projects that have already been approved. The amount of $50 million has been expended to address these types of  projects. I might draw attention to other projects that have been announced by my colleague today. The amount of $3.2 million in the Northern Territory for an electronic outback project which will involve a roll-out of satellite infrastructure. I cannot over emphasise the importance of satellite infrastructure to the development of linking regional and remote Australia to the rest of the world. It is exceptionally important. Fourteen remote communities will benefit from this project.Another interesting one is $1.3 million for the women's justice network in south-west Queensland - 16 locations for a three-year pilot to assist women needing independent legal advice through video conference sites, training for community workers and connections to the legal aid information database, taking legal aid in a practical way, utilising new technologies, to people who need it in remote Australia. There is also a project in Queensland where some $2.65 million will be expended to establish Internet service provider points. That will cover an area of 28 per cent of Queensland. It covers the electorate of my colleague the Minister for Veterans' Affairs from Roma to Charleville right down to the South Australian border.Finally, one project that I am particularly pleased to see has been released is a telehealth Tasmanian network - $5.5 million to assist with a network of 50 telehealth facilities to improve health access to health services for regional and remote Tasmania. It takes in the two Bass Strait islands, Flinders and King Island, in the most decentralised state in this nation.These are the sorts of projects that you people opposed. You opposed these projects to enhance the opportunities for regional and remote dwellers in this nation to connect with the rest of the nation. These are decisions that are about connecting all of Australia to the future. You opposed it. You should be ashamed of it.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Corangamite for his question. I have said repeatedly that in the maritime industry generally there is a significant problem of overmanning, and the more obvious symptoms of that are the fact that there are a lot of rorts and inefficiencies, a lot of idle time and very poor productivity levels. For example, in the blue water segment of the industry there is no question that there is overmanning. I discussed that with the MUA, the representative union, before Christmas and they acknowledged that there is overmanning, and there have been ongoing discussions about how that issue needs to be dealt with. For example, the government has taken a step to withdraw the Australian Maritime Safety Authority from the management of the pool.Similarly, in the stevedoring industry there is no doubt that there is significant overmanning. That is not, of course, acknowledged publicly by the union. But there is no doubt, again from the evidence of the restrictive work practices and the like, that something needs to be done to improve the efficiency of the industry.I think it is fair to say that the industry generally is unique in respect of the stevedoring aspect. That was really recognised by the previous Labor administration when they set up the Waterfront Industry Reform Authori  ty - the WIRA process. In that process a lot of taxpayers' funds were expended - something like $160 million -  -  - And the end result, as we have demonstrated in this House day after day, is that we did not get the significant reform that we obviously need on the Australian waterfront. - If it is two minutes, I have two to go. Thank you very much. To have you marking time sitting there, Simon, is about all you are good for, I would have to say. - Thank you, Mr Speaker. Triviality is his specialty. - The Labor Party oversaw the spending of something like $430 million and basically got nothing for it. The last thing I would say is that in this circumstance, obviously, where there is an overmanning situation -  -  - and where the companies take action to address that problem, where there are people leaving the industry, then their entitlement should be fully paid out. I have said that repeatedly - last month, the previous month and all the way back to December. The two differences between our approach, I suppose, and the Labor Party's approach are that our view is that, where there is a cost, that cost should be borne by the industry. -  - As to the mechanism for that, that is a secondary matter, but a cost associated should be met by the industry. - And, secondly, we look to the industry for genuine reform and genuine restructuring so that we can finally see for Australia a far more efficient waterfront.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Lowe for his question. Just by way of correction, there was not an apology the other day. - I am not aware of the report that the honourable member refers to, but the honourable member raises the point about air  traffic movements around Sydney. I do not know where he gets his 300 per cent from, but obviously the government's targets as far as the long-term operating plan is concerned are still in sight at 55 per cent of movements to the south over water, 17 per cent to the north, 15 per cent to the west and 13 per cent to the east. With regard to the environmental conditions that surround major airports such as Sydney and in the Sydney basin -  - I was just about to make a comment with regard to the environmental impacts around airports, such as in the Sydney basin where there is a lot of conjecture and different attitudes and levels of misinformation about the level of pollution. The important thing that members should note, particularly the member for Lowe, is that my understanding is that about two to three per cent of the pollution in the Sydney basin is from aircraft, about 70 per cent from motor cars and the balance from industry. It is not emanating from use of airports. I think the member for Lowe should recognise that in his further questions.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. Indeed, in response to the interjection from the member for Prospect, I point out that it is nice to know that there is a member in this House who is interested in serious policy issues - being, in this case, the member for Aston - because the fact is there is not one on that side of the House apparently.The Australian government does regard the relationship with Indonesia as one of our most fundamental relationships. We do not go out of our way to assist Indonesia simply because we want to help other people from the goodness of our hearts, although we do have good hearts. We also do it because we wish to promote our national interest, and it is in our national interest that Indonesia is both a prosperous country and a stable country. We have, therefore, been very concerned about the economic crisis that has beset Indonesia and we are doing everything we possibly can within the limits of our resources to assist that country maintain stability and rebuild its prosperity.In that context, in response to the member for Aston's question, I visited Washington a couple of weeks ago and had discussions with the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and senior United States officials about this situation. There were really three main focuses of my discussion - the IMF program, the private debt situation in Indonesia and the food security issue.I can say that in my discussions with Mr Camdessus, the managing director of the IMF, the views of the Australian government were very well received. It is pleasing to see that there are positive signals now emerging that Indonesia and the International Monetary Fund are working constructively together and we would expect an announcement soon.I also, as I mentioned, did take the opportunity to discuss the private debt situation in Indonesia because, clearly, until a way can be found through the restructuring of private sector debt, the economy is going to find it difficult to stabilise. It was an opportunity to discuss those issues with senior United States officials and also subsequently, when I was in Japan, to talk to the Japanese about that issue.  Again, on the issue of private sector debt, we are optimistic that a statement will be made in the near future which should take the whole of that issue further forward.Finally, let me say that, while I was in Washington, I had the opportunity to meet with Mr Jim Wolfensohn, the President of the World Bank, and I discussed with him a proposal that had been put forward by the Prime Minister to Mr Wolfensohn that the World Bank should coordinate a meeting of international aid donors in order to provide direct emergency assistance to the people of Indonesia - in particular, the poor people of Indonesia, who are suffering the most at this very difficult time. We on our part believe that we do have a humanitarian as well as a national interest responsibility to help the ordinary people of Indonesia as best we can at this time.Mr Wolfensohn, I am very pleased to say, agreed that he would coordinate a meeting of donors in Washington on 1 April - that is today - so that meeting will be taking place today. Australia will be represented by Trevor Kanaley, the Director-General of AusAID, and a number of other governments will be represented at senior levels. Mr Wolfensohn himself will be there.So over and above the assistance we have given with trade credits and the assistance we have given through the IMF package, the Australian government has given very significant diplomatic support to try to help with the resolution of the very difficult problems that Indonesia faces. It is important that members understand that it is in the national interest that we do that. We are not just doing it out of the goodness of our hearts; it is in the national interests we do that. - I know the opposition does not wish to hear any of this. They are no longer interested in serious policy issues; they are only interested in childish tactics.</DOC>

 - My recollection is that I said there were a number of differences and one of them, which the honourable member did not refer to, was the fact that 2HD was a commercial operation. - Oh! - He says there is no difference. I think most Australians know the difference between a non-profit organisation and Coles Myer, and that is what is involved in this. You are once again wasting time on trivial issues. It is now one minute to three and there has not been one question from the Australian Labor Party on any issue of any relevance.  - No policy, no interest, no concern.

 - I thank the member for Sturt for his question. He is regarded as one who has a passionate interest in this particular issue and who has prosecuted the case on behalf of young Australians getting realistic pricings for CDs for some time, to the extent that he appeared on the Midday Show , quite successfully. I am quite envious of that. - You did a very good job. Recent evidence provided to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee clearly dispelled the myth advocated by multinational record companies that Australians will not get cheaper CDs under the government's proposed legislation to introduce parallel importation of sound recordings. Indeed, several witnesses to the committee, including representatives of the ACCC and the Australian Consumers Association, believed that prices would actually come down and that there would be a greater range and choice of CDs as a result of breaking down the exclusive arrangements and distribution arrangements controlled by the current suppliers. Woolworths, a major operator in this country and one of the nation's largest retailers of CDs, told the committee that, if the government's plans were put in place, a 25 per cent to 30 per cent reduction in the retail price of CDs would flow. Indeed, that flows from the analysis done by the  ACCC and the Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics.Of great concern was the prediction by the Australian Consumers Association, which said there was considerable risk that CD prices would go up by another $2 if these amendments were not passed. Indeed, there have been surveys where 83 per cent of consumers believed that CD prices are in fact too high in this country. They are artificially high because of the current Copyright Act, which gives the big five foreign record companies an effective monopoly on imports and distribution of CDs. Those same companies exported payments of about $166 million in royalties in 1994-95, the bulk of that going to the United States and the United Kingdom.I think it is fair to say that the arrangement at the present provides large profits to foreign companies and that those profits are a direct result of the current importation restrictions which allow those firms to set their own prices and to restrict the range of music available to Australian retailers. That is the nub of the problem. That is why we want to have a system of parallel importation - to break down the monopoly arrangements that currently exist. The opposition to parallel importation by the two lobby groups ARIA and AMRA is basically shoring up their interests at the expense of consumers. That is why this issue is passionately advocated on both sides - the government admits that - but we believe that our responsibility is to develop legislation to protect and further the interests of the consumers, the purchasers of CDs. Allowing parallel importing is the only way this can be achieved. Smaller retailers will be able to import a much wider range of CDs, and therefore the pricing points as they are reflected at the retail point of sale will provide a much better deal particularly for the young people of Australia.It is interesting that the Democrats, along with the Labor Party, have indicated that they are going to oppose the government's legislation. We think that is particularly regrettable. We think that is interesting from the Democrats' point of view. The senator responsible for this area has been promoting herself as the protector of young people's  interests and now, of course, has gone along and endorsed a position which will see prices go up. It will certainly see a situation where prices will not come down. That is why I think the Democrats' position on this matter is particularly regrettable. - I will, Mr Speaker. That flies in the face of what another member of the Democrats, Senator Murray, has said. He said he believed that, if the outcome was an increase in prices, that would be something that is regrettable. I do not believe the Democrats are united. I think it is a shame for Australia, particularly the young people and purchasers of CDs, that this matter has not been able to proceed.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Deakin for his question. I acknowledge his great interest in helping young people in the electorate of Deakin to move successfully from school into employment. The Labor Party turned their back on the 70 per cent of young people who are not going from school to university. The apprenticeship system essentially dried up. The number of young people in apprenticeships and traineeships as a proportion of the work force was the lowest for three decades during Labor's last year and youth unemployment, as we know, hit a record 34 per cent.The job pathway program has been one of the government's most successful initiatives for young people. It involves extra funding for schools so that schools can take a proactive role in helping their school leavers get jobs. At the present time, more than 1,000 high schools across Australia are involved in job pathway and more than 20,000 school leavers will be helped by job pathway this year.One of the most successful projects in the job pathway program is the consortium of 29 schools in the Mooroondah area in the electorate of the member for Deakin. In fact, this project, this consortium of 29 schools, also extends into parts of the electorates of Casey, Menzies, McEwen, Aston and La Trobe. Already, this project has had a 100 per cent success rate with school leavers at the end of last year. It contracted to place some 240 young school leavers in jobs and it has placed 240 in jobs in the retail, hospitality and construction industries.One of the really interesting and important aspects of this success has been that 80 per cent of these placements have been in the government's new apprenticeships. These schools have provided counselling and individual support to 1,200 students at risk of leaving school early and have had very considerable success in encouraging these young people to stay on at school. These are practical initiatives to make a difference to the lives of thousands of young Australians. The government is not stopping there. At the  end of January, the Prime Minister announced that the job pathway program would be further expanded with $13½ million of additional funding over the next two years. - You should be listening. It is very interesting that only one state government prohibited its government schools from participating in that program -  - And that was New South Wales. That was the Carr Labor government. That shows how little commitment the Labor party has to helping these young school leavers actually get jobs. If the Leader of the Opposition had any spine and backbone at all, he would go and tell his colleague the Premier of New South Wales, for the Labor party, to allow school leavers in that state to benefit from the job pathway program.</DOC>

 - The question from the opposition is absolutely amazing. The $1 billion figure that the member for Jagajaga was referring to has no relation to reality at all. What took place today was the first time in Australia's governmental history that a government has targeted a program to assist elderly Australians to stay in their homes. It has not been done before.Let me refer honourable members to sheet No. 5 that we issued this morning entitled `Assistance for ageing carers'. Do you know that there are about 3,500 age carers, parents who have mature children who have a disability, who have been looking after their children for 30 years and not one government has ever done anything about a targeted program for them. What absolute hypocrisy to come in here and say that this is a program that ought not to be supported. Do you want to look at the figures? - Where your $1 billion comes from is an absolute nonsense. What about the money? In 1995-96, $2.4 billion was spent on recurrent aged care. The next year - listen to the increase; this is why your figures are wrong - in 1996-97, $2.618 billion was spent. In 1997-98, $2.76 billion will be spent, a nominal increase of 5.7 per cent. What are you talking about? It is an absolute outrage. You are trying to perpetuate a myth. You had the opportunity to address these issues and you never did, and the first question that you ask today ignores the fundamental good that has been done here to date.It is interesting to have a look at the member for Werriwa's book. He talks about the need to develop social capital, to recognise volunteers and networking in the community, to bind a good community. We have recognised that there are 540,000 principal carers in this nation, and today, for the first time, a government has taken steps to support these people. You talk about social capital. We are doing it.</DOC>

 - I would like to take the opportunity, in replying to the honourable member for Macquarie, to endorse everything that the Minister for Family Services has said about the figures being flung around erroneously by the member for Jagajaga. The reality is that the package I announced this morning to the annual meeting of the Carers Association was an Australian first in terms of encouraging and supporting older Australians to remain in their own homes.All of my colleagues know, and I think all members of parliament know, that the heart  felt desire of older Australians is to stay in their own homes. That is what they want to do. Whilst governments have responsibilities in relation to residential care, they also have a very strong human responsibility to provide resources to enable as many Australians as possible in their older years to remain in their own homes.That is why we have decided to put an additional $92 million over a period of four years into community aged care packages. The effect of this, along with the growth of the existing programs, will be to more than double to 22,000 the number of elderly Australians who will be cared for in their own home environment. Community aged care packages are about providing services in the home to enable Australians to stay in their homes. There is nothing more important to elderly Australians than the opportunity to remain in their own home, and it is overwhelmingly the preference of older Australians that they remain in their home rather than go into residential care.I am also very proud that the announcement I made this morning to the Carers Association broke new ground in recognising the contribution to our community of those who care for people with frailties and disabilities. They are, without any doubt, the unsung heroes of any civilised and compassionate society. They have for a long time deserved more recognition, and it is a real privilege to be at the head of a government that will provide an additional $92 million over a four-year period from 1 July 1999, which will bring about the merging of the domiciliary care benefit and the child disability allowance.As a result, there will be an additional 14,000 carers in the Australian community who will receive the benefit of the new carer allowance. This will include many thousands who are caring for elderly Australians with dementia. It will also include people who are looking after their relatives and friends with profound intellectual impairment. It is by any measure a compassionate new policy. It is by any measure a recognition that for too long this dedicated band of Australians has been ignored. One of the special features of this new package is that we are recognising the particular concerns of elderly Australians who have often been caring for 20, 30 or 40 years for a disabled or impaired adult child. Their greatest worry is what will happen to their son or daughter when they themselves are too old to look after them. This policy will provide additional resources to address that particular group - some 8,000 very old Australians with a particular need. That particular measure is at the heart of the compassion which underlines this policy.I thank the Minister for Family Services and I thank the Minister for Social Security. I believe this is an excellent policy. It is the sort of policy which exemplifies a caring, compassionate and civilised society. It is a policy that the coalition is proud to present to the Australian community.</DOC>

 - I just say again to the member for Dobell that you know as well as I know and everybody in this House knows that, if you had won the last election, you would have got rid of that program. You also know that, historically, this has been a program which has been the responsibility of the states. You made no reference in the 1996 election campaign to a continuation of the program. You did not. You made no commitment to continue it over the four-year period, and you are being quite duplicitous and very hypocritical in continuing to ask these questions.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for her question. As one of the very few nurses in this chamber, she understands the need for quality care for older Australians and has been an advocate for the need for us to come up with policies that give a continuum of care. -  - We have focused on getting right the residential aged care arrangements in this country to address the neglect which the Labor Party left us with. Today, we have taken a step to focus on the need to provide additional care arrangements for those people who choose to stay in their home.One fact that people should be aware of is this: 93 per cent of older Australians are ageing in their home and that is their prefer  ence. That is where they would rather stay. What we are doing here today is taking for the first time a concerted, considered approach to providing assistance to those people who want to make that choice. That is the key word: it is choice. We want people to have a choice. We want there to be flexibility in the range of opportunities there are to deal with those issues that I have been talking about in this place for so long - that is, the increasing number of Australians who are moving into the aged category. They are the ones who are deserving of a good mix of public policy, an ongoing, rolling commitment of resources from the broad taxpayer. Where they have the capacity to contribute to the cost of their care, we are asking them do that and that policy is now in place. I know that the member for Makin has been a dedicated supporter of these policies and, as it is her birthday today -  - Yes, why not recognise that fact, because this is a package that should be celebrated. Let me just make mention of some public comments for the benefit of the opposition. The Council on the Ageing in Australia put out a press release this morning strongly endorsing the statements made by the Prime Minister this morning. They said:Altogether, we see the package as a significant advance in the Governments' relationship with those older, frail Australians who wish to continue living in the community.We had from the Carers Association of Australia some 600 people gathered in Canberra to hear the Prime Minister deliver this package. There was total and complete acclamation for what has been achieved here today. Let us have a look at some of my critics. We had Norah McGuire, someone I well remember from when I appeared on a television show and she kicked the tripe out of me. What did she say today? She said:After what happened about aged care restructuring, you know, the Minister, we knew, it is logical that he has to do this because aged care restructuring, it is good to hear something that is positive now.We are addressing these issues because we know there has to be a sustainable aged policy in this country. There has to be a mix  of policy to provide choice and real support for aged Australians in a meaningful way, whether they choose to go into residential care or whether they choose to stay in their home. This is a policy package that deserves the support of every thinking Australian.I have to say that I am absolutely amazed - and, Mr Speaker, I will conclude on this - to see that there is an MPI today. The only person in this country who is against this package is the member for Jagajaga. I will be very interested to hear at the end of question time why this ridiculous MPI has been put forward by the Labor Party. - Why are you against older Australians? How are you going to pay for it? Where was your policy prescriptions at your convention? Not a word! Not a word! There has not been a constructive contribution to this debate from the member for Jagajaga or the Leader of the Opposition from the day this debate started.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Bradfield for his question. I think he will be interested to know that this morning the Australian Bureau of Statistics released job vacancy figures showing that in February 1998 trend estimates of vacancies were 71,600 in the public and private sectors.  For the quarter of February, job vacancies rose by 4.1 per cent, and over the course of the year job vacancies rose by 14.6 per cent. I think all members of the House will welcome the fact that job prospects are growing in Australia. I think everybody on both sides of the House would welcome the fact that job opportunities are growing. I am sure - certainly on this side of the House - that there is wide acclaim of a 14.6 per cent increase in job opportunities. Isn't that good news for Australians? - I can understand the interest of the Australian Labor Party in a trip to Malaysia and Korea, but we on this side of the House are interested about jobs in Australia and the fact that job vacancies in Australia have gone up 14.6 per cent.Also released today were the Drake International employment forecasts, which show that there is an improving labour market despite the downturn in Asian economies. The Drake survey concluded that employers continue to sidestep any significant jobs fallout from the Asian currency crisis with just five per cent of firms nationwide suffering reduced business opportunities as a result of the Asian financial crisis. The ABS job vacancy figures which were released today show that private sector job vacancies are at their highest level since June 1979, the highest level since we have been taking these statistics.What is the picture that is emerging of the economy? A low inflation economy with low interest rates and increasing job opportunities: the lowest inflation rate since 1963 - that's great news - the lowest interest rates since 1969 - that's great news - and the best job vacancies since we started recording in 1979. These are the results of policies. You do not produce outcomes like these without policy. The government's economic approach to getting the budget back into control, to reducing debt, to getting interest rates down and to getting job opportunities going is real policies. It is regrettable that we find an opposition which has been absolutely incapable of coming to grips with policy prescriptions. There can be no greater indictment of the failure of the Leader of the Opposition than that one of his frontbenchers has to write the ALP policy in a book. There can be no greater indictment of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition than his failure to ask a question on economics for the whole course of the parliamentary sitting. - Mr Speaker, I was talking about job vacancies and increased employment opportunities for Australians. I was speaking about the lowest inflation rate since 1963 - since the Beatles sang Twist and Shout ; the lowest interest rate since 1969 - since Neil Armstrong said, `One small step for man'; the lowest unemployment rate since 1990 - since Paul Keating said, `This was the recession we had to have' - all creating job opportunities for Australia.What do you find from the opposition? No questions about the economy these last two weeks, no interest in inflation or interest rates - just the muckraking of the member for Hotham. We saw the Deputy Leader of the Opposition at it this morning, making one of the most disgraceful statements you will ever  hear. He came in this morning and spoke about the Prime Minister and said, `This bloke seems to be never so happy as when he's bashing black fellas.' That is what you said this morning. Disgusting statement about the Prime Minister! - Show some leadership! - If that is the best economic statement you can get out of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the so-called economic spokesman, disgusting racial slurs which he is throwing around this place, he ought to be condemned and the leader should make him withdraw.</DOC>

 - Don't we love it when he asks a question about the economy? Don't we absolutely love it when he shows his  ignorance in this House about all things economic? The strongest private sector vacancies, the highest level ever in the history of the series since the June quarter of 1979. Isn't that great news? Don't people welcome the highest private sector vacancy since the series began in the June quarter of 1979. Read the document. It is there, you poor old thing.Then he says, `Oh, yeah but there were good vacancies coming back into 1994.' Why? Because we were coming off the worst recession in 60 years. He goes back and he says that Labor ought to be congratulated for taking unemployment up to 11.3 per cent and then he says, `Why don't you congratulate us for getting it down to the nines again?' This is the lowest unemployment rate since who put Australia into recession? Since you put Australia into recession. Who was the employment minister when unemployment hit 11.3 per cent? The Leader of the Opposition. Who was the finance minister when Australia went $25 billion into deficit?  - Mr Speaker, I direct my answer through you. I love getting questions on unemployment from the Leader of the Opposition who, as employment minister, presided over an unemployment rate of 11.3 per cent. Let us have a guess at who was the employment minister during Australia's worst post-war period of unemployment? He knows all about it. He produced the best unemployment rate Australia has ever had and we do not congratulate you for it.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Cook for his question. What has happened is that the wharfies union have taken their campaign from Sydney and now they are going to Brisbane to wreak as much havoc as they possibly can against the Patricks company which gives them the jobs which they enjoy. So in Brisbane we are already starting to see the damage being done by the MUA, by the wharfies union - 450 tonnes of export steel are being held up, 26 containers of cotton going to north Asia are held up by this vandal action of the MUA, and all along the Labor Party are basically publicly supporting them.It is interesting that when you look at the key elements of this dispute the fact of the matter is that you can see the beneficial effects of the government's Workplace Relations Act in operation. For example, we are told now that as they have decided to wreak havoc in Brisbane the wharfies have decided go back to work in Sydney. Part of their complaint about Sydney was that they were not going to be paid whilst they were taking industrial action; namely, whilst they were running an overtime ban. It is very interesting. This is a reflection on section 187AA of the Workplace Relations Act.The Labor Party complained about that when it was revealed about 10 days ago, but they suddenly went quiet when they realised  the New South Wales Labor Party had the same law in state industrial relations law. But further what is particularly interesting is that as the wharfies are going back to work in Sydney they have decided to lift the overtime ban. I tell you why they have lifted the overtime ban. That is because of the operation of our Workplace Relations Act.Last week or the week before the latest industrial disputes figures came out. Remember that before the last election the Labor Party said there would be mayhem and there would be economic chaos if we were elected and basically it would be World War III. But when the official dispute figures came out, did we have industrial mayhem? No, we had the lowest level of industrial disputes since before World War I and the actual number of disputes was the lowest since 1940 at the start of World War II. What this shows is that we have implemented policies which really work and which really are, in the area of workplace relations, getting down the level of disputes.What is Labor's policy? Labor's policy is basically dictated to them by the ACTU, part of which is to repeal the Trade Practices Act, which is the one law which keeps a leash on the industrial thuggery in the trade union movement, supported by the Labor Party. On the balance of their policies, what are their policies? Actually, they do not have any policies other than that which is directed to them by the ACTU.So, as you watch the doorstops in the morning, as the questions go the Labor Party, `What are your policies?', what do we get? All we get is the muckraking that we have had from the Labor Party, which reached an all-time low with the sleazy, slimy, racist slur from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. This just shows the low depths to which you people will go, and the Leader of the Opposition, on the industrial dispute on the Australian waterfront -  - This is a demonstration - when you look at the waterfront dispute - that  when there is a national interest to condemn the industrial action of these industrial thugs, the Leader of the Opposition fails to publicly condemn their actions and cannot even bring his own frontbencher to meet reasonable standards of reasonable behaviour.</DOC>

 - I do thank the honourable member for her question because it does give me the opportunity to say a little about the way in which the asylum system - of which we are very proud here in Australia - is, by larger numbers of people than I think desirable, being the subject of very considerable abuse.This last year we have received something of the order of 11,000 asylum claims in Australia. Those numbers are very much larger than we have experienced in recent years. I think back in the early 1980s it was something of the order of 500 such claims that were received. Many of them come from countries where one does not ordinarily expect asylum claims to arise and the difficulty is that you have to assess each claim case by case; you have to make provision for people to be able to have their circumstances reviewed. There seems to be a desire on the part of some to perpetuate an arrangement where access to the courts is also provided, and we had something of the order of 900 cases where people are expecting to get judicial review on top of all of the other access that is provided.This system is in place to ensure that we do not refoule to any country a person who has a well-founded fear of persecution. But when we get manifestly unfounded claims, they damage irreparably our opportunities to deal  quickly with the circumstances of people who may have been tortured and traumatised and are in need of assistance. When people who are seeking to do that often want to disguise their identity, to dispose of documentation that might help us in a proper investigation of their claims and sometimes to be able to put a story that would be inconsistent with whatever documentation they may be carrying, it does make our task very much more difficult.But I want to ensure the member that the approach that we take is one that deals with these matters with integrity. We do seek to ensure that the system is not abused, but that any genuine refugee does receive protection in Australia. We use every avenue available to ensure that, in respect of people who have been known to authorities in other countries, those matters are properly checked, that the character issues are addressed in the process and that we use the appropriate means for ensuring that they are properly addressed.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Dunkley for his question on this matter because it does enable me to tell him what is happening in relation to the area of adult migrant education and to brief other members who have spoken on these matters in both grievance debates and in the 90-second statements - and, I might add, for the benefit of the honourable member for Werriwa, who has expressed some interest in these matters and notes very much the importance of English language competency in  ensuring that people are able to settle effectively here in Australia. He looks puzzled. - I found a reference on page 250. - I will tell the honourable member himself if he is interested in that matter. - Mr Speaker, let me just say that I want to take the opportunity of addressing this question in a factual way because it is important that we deal with the facts rather than the myths that are often created. The first point that ought to be made is that there have been no reductions at all in the way in which the teaching of English language to new arrivals is resourced. Provision is made by law for us to fund appropriate tuition of 510 hours to all new arrivals in Australia.On top of that, because that is a requirement by law, we provided this year an additional $17 million over four years to provide assistance for those who are refugees and humanitarian entrants to address their English language needs. We also need to ensure that there is the provision of money so that we can provide the most flexible service with regard to time, location and type of tuition received by those new arrivals. We are endeavouring to ensure that the best service is provided, along with value for money, and we have put the system out for tender.What we have found is that, in those states where the bodies that deal with these matters evidence a deal of desire to adjust their manner of conducting the contractual arrangements, enter into partnerships with other organisations to put in place more flexible arrangements - in other words, are imaginative in the way in which they deal with these matters - they have been able to win the tenders. In most states, that has happened. In one area, perhaps because of the activities of the New South Wales Teachers Federation,  where the organisation itself has proven to be more inflexible, they were not able to win three of the tenders that were offered in five regions in New South Wales.The honourable member for Prospect, in some comments that she made, said in relation to the tenderer, the Australian Centre for Languages, that they had no experience in providing English as a second language courses for poorly educated migrants or humanitarian refugees. I have to tell the honourable member that that is untrue. The organisation has had considerable experience in relation to those matters. It held a number of contracts for teaching to those very groups of people, through the programs that were funded previously by DEETYA and also through programs that have been funded in New South Wales.They also brought into their consortium partners with very considerable experience - Mission Australia, the University of Wollongong, the Macquarie University College and the St George and Sutherland Community College. In other words, they have as partners people who have a wide range and wealth of experience in English language teaching. Those services are related very much to teaching amongst those migrants who have a poor level of literacy in their own language, particularly those who have come through the refugee stream.I want to make it very clear that the government is committed to maintaining high quality education for English language migrants here in Australia. - Thank you, Mr Speaker. It is important to talk about these matters in a factual way. We do not need myths. Another area in which there are myths has been Labor's protestation that it does not want a race election. One of the comments that worried me greatly this morning was the comment by the honourable member for Banks, who had the audacity to say that there is only one thing missing from this debate, and that is the white sheets and burning crosses. It does the honourable member no  service, and it brings the whole question of debate into disrepute.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Lindsay for her question. I know she and many other members of the House would appreciate the efforts that are made by my department internationally to put Australia's best foot forward and to ensure that our country is understood for what it really is, which is a culturally diverse, very tolerant and very decent country. The Images  of Australia unit has been a very great success in promoting those images of Australia. I think they are values in this country which we have great pride in. It is a great thing for us to be able to go around the world and say that in Australia people from 130 different countries of the world have come together and that, on the whole, they live very harmoniously together. It is a great thing to be able to say that we are one of the world's oldest continuously operating democracies. But our democracy works on the basis of some unwritten rules - unwritten rules of public debate and unwritten rules of decency.Most Australians uphold those unwritten laws of public debate. But, Mr Speaker, there are the occasional exceptions. There are the exceptions who undermine the image and reputation of this country. We saw a very good example of it this morning. We saw an example of it this morning when somebody in the senior position of Deputy Leader of the Opposition - one of the significant people in the political spectrum of this country - made a statement saying of the Prime Minister, `This bloke seems to be never so happy as when he's bashing black fellas.'For the Deputy Leader of the Opposition - the alternative Deputy Prime Minister of this country - to be reducing public debate in this country to that level is not only shameful but it does indeed damage the image of decency and tolerance in this country. Coming from a man who was once the foreign minister, I say: I regard that as particularly surprising.It would serve the House well if the Deputy Leader of the Opposition did the honourable and decent thing and apologised to the Prime Minister and apologised to this House for what he has done, because if he did that he would uphold at last the standards of decency and tolerance which this country promotes internationally so strongly. But to leave a statement like that on the record without apology is damaging to this country and, of course, very damaging to the opposition. - Mr Speaker, at the end of the day, behaviour in this parliament is relevant to the Images of Australia. It is relevant to the way the world sees Australia. This parliament is shown on Australian television into many countries of South-East Asia and even North Asia. Some of the things that are said in this parliament and some of the things that are said in public debate -  - And, Mr Speaker, indeed I will because this is about the image of the country. It is about what is transmitted to our region through news services, through Australian television. It's about what is read and understand about this country. One of the things that is understood about this country today is that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition accuses our Prime Minister of being somebody who is happy when he is bashing black fellas. He should withdraw that statement. - He should apologise and, Mr Speaker, if he doesn't apologise, the Leader of the Opposition should make him do so for the integrity of the Labor Party, the integrity of the parliament and the integrity of public debate in this country.</DOC>

 - Could I say in reply to the honourable member that, as expressed by the Special Minister for State yesterday, the  government welcomes the decision of the High Court of Australia in the Hindmarsh bridge case. It brings, I hope, to an end a very sorry chapter in which there was an enormous amount of money expended. I think there was ill will generated in the community between Australians of different backgrounds. But in the course of commenting upon the government's reaction to the decision of the High Court, I want to draw attention to some remarks that were made in the press this morning, and in particular some remarks that were made at the doorstop this morning by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. - I will put them in context. - I will certainly put them in context, and the first context that I should put them in is, as the Deputy Leader of the Opposition well knows, I made no reference at all in the parliament yesterday to the Hindmarsh Bridge case. Absolutely no reference. - The jig to which the Deputy Leader of the Opposition refers, as a perusal of both the video of question time yesterday and also the transcript of Hansard  will record, which is this, was a reference I made to the Treasurer when he interjected, `Why did you give tax deductibility to the Evatt Foundation?' - That is what it was about. It had absolutely nothing whatever to do with the Hindmarsh bridge. What is appalling about the behaviour of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is that, unlike the -  - As I was saying, the truth of the matter is that I made no reference yesterday to the Hindmarsh bridge decision. The photograph to which the honourable member refers, the jigging one as he calls it -  - That one. That was in the course of an answer I was giving to a question asked of me by the member for Hotham. Any kind of decent person would have perused that. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition has no excuse. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition, unlike the leader writer of the Melbourne Age , was present when the incident took place. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition knew that I did not mention Hindmarsh. The Deputy Leader of the Oppo  sition knew he was being deceitful at the doorstop.That is only the half of it. What we have seen here is very much of a kind with the remarks that were made by the member for Banks, the remarks to which the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs drew attention, some remarks that were made some months ago that likened the attitude of members of my party on the native title issue to the behaviour and the attitudes of the Ku Klux Klan. That was something that the Leader of the Opposition had neither the power nor the intestinal fortitude to do anything about. The Leader of the Opposition failed to discipline the member for Banks. Once again, the Leader of the Opposition has failed to discipline the Deputy Leader of the Opposition because what the Deputy Leader of the Opposition said at the doorstop this morning -  - Let me for the benefit of the House - and I want the House to listen very carefully to this, particularly members of the public in the gallery - repeat what the Deputy Leader of the Opposition said: `This bloke seems to be never so happy as when he is bashing black fellas.' Let me say that again: `This bloke never seems to be so happy  as when he is bashing black fellas.' You should apologise. -  - You talk about relevance. If you are to have any relevance to decency in politics you should apologise. You should at least have the courage to apologise, because both you and your leader are deliberately inflaming the temperature of this debate. - I have to say that I find myself in agreement with Father Brennan when he said a few weeks ago that there are people in the Labor Party who are hell-bent on having an election of this particular issue. You are the people who want an election on Wik. By the Leader of the Opposition's failure to restrain the deputy leader, he is giving evidence of that. - Not only were the motives imputed to me by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition in relation to my alleged response to the Hindmarsh bridge decision absolutely baseless, wrong in fact and completely without foundation but the manner in which they were made, the particular language used, was deliberately calculated to inflame the temperature of this whole debate.You in the Labor Party run around in your self-righteous fashion, you say, `Those terrible people over there on the government side,' you want to have a race election yet you dare to use words like `This bloke seems to be never so happy as when he is bashing black fellas.' I not only find that offensive to indigenous people but also find it personally very offensive. I find it highly offensive to the motives of millions of people in Australia who happen to agree that we have taken a principled stand not only on the Hindmarsh Island Bridge issue but also on the native title issue.When the judgment is made on this issue by the Australian people, the person who will have failed the test of leadership will be the Leader of the Opposition. It is the Leader of the Opposition who has failed to discipline the member for Banks. It is the Leader of the Opposition who has failed to discipline the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. It is the Leader of the Opposition who has allowed others in his party to run the agenda on the native title issue. It is the Leader of the Opposition who is now allowing members of his own party to run amuck and to make inflammatory comments to turn up the temperature of this debate -  - Bogus points of order will not relieve the Leader of the Opposition from his responsibility to lead on this issue. Bogus points of order will not absolve the responsibility that he carries, along with the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and the member for Banks, for tainting the character of this debate. It is a difficult issue. It is a sensitive issue.When the final chapter is written on this debate, three remarks will stand like stone and they will condemn the people out of whose mouths they were uttered. The first of those was the reference to racist scum by Noel Pearson. The second was the reference to the Ku Klux Klan by the member for Banks. The third was the remark made this morning by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. If he had any sense of decency and courage he would apologise and withdraw. Obviously, he is not going to do so, so I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, it is very nice to see the member for Werriwa getting up and asking a question on education. There have not been too many of them. I was very interested to see Brian Toohey's comments in the Sun-Herald  yesterday. - As Brian Toohey wrote in yesterday's Sun Herald  -  - This goes to the issue of education that I was asked about. Brian Toohey said yesterday:Beazley's supporters argue that Latham would be in a better position to criticise - that is, his own side - if he had not been such a disappointment since being appointed Shadow Education Minister last year. - Mr Speaker, let me put the facts very clearly on the record because it is quite clear that the member for Werriwa has not done sufficient research to actually determine what the situation is in universities. This year, there are an extra 4,000 fully funded Commonwealth places in universities. There are some 10,000 more fully funded Commonwealth undergraduate places in universities this year than there were in Labor's last year. - Overall, there are some 19,000 more undergraduate students in universities in 1998 than there were in 1996. - The Commonwealth government's objective is to expand the number of student places available to school leavers in Australia and to expand the resources available to universities, and we are doing that by shifting the balance between government-funded places and private funding of places in universities. This year, Australian universities will have more students in them than ever before and will be better funded than ever before. In fact, between 1995 and 1998 the total revenue of Australian universities is some $550 million higher this year than it was in your last full year of office. So don't come into this House and try, with your constant deceit, to tell the people of Australia that this government is restricting places in Australian universities or restricting funding. This government is all about expanding opportunities for young Australians and, if you had done a bit more work on your portfolio, you would know that that is the fact and you would stop trying to mislead the Australian people.</DOC>

 - May I say in reply to the honourable member for Murray that, on Friday, we had a further piece of quite dramatic evidence of the success of my government's economic policies on the business sector of Australia. On Friday, another major Australian bank, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, dramatically lowered its business interest rates. The benefit of this dramatic reduction will flow through not only to large businesses in Australia but also to small businesses and throughout the Australian community.The Commonwealth Bank has effectively matched Westpac's move to lower business overdraft interest rates to 7.2 per cent. Let me say that again: to a level of 7.2 per cent. Let  me remind the parliament that in 1989 when the Labor Party was in office business interest rates in Australia reached 20.5 per cent; in other words, a full 13 per cent - let me say it again: a full 13 per cent - above what they are now as a result of the announcements made by Westpac and by the Commonwealth Bank.Just to illustrate the degree of difference, can I tell you that the interest payment on a $100,000 business loan with rates at 20.5 per cent works out at $1,708 a month but the interest payment on a $100,000 business loan with interest rates at 7.2 per cent works out at $600 a month. In other words, there is a difference of $1,108 month. So the peak under Labor was $1,108 a month above what it is as a result of the announcements made by Westpac and by the Commonwealth Bank.In commenting on Westpac's move to lower business rates - a move now matched by the Commonwealth Bank - some financial market commentators suggested that the reduction could in aggregate save businesses across Australia somewhere between $150 million and $400 million. The fact that businesses are now benefiting from low interest rates is a direct result of the remedial measures my government took two years ago to eliminate Mr Beazley's $10.5 billion deficit. The action that we have taken to bring inflation in Australia to the lowest level in the OECD area, to give to the Australian people and to the men and women in business throughout the Australian community the lowest business rates since the 1960s - all of it is underpinning growing confidence and a very positive attitude within the Australian business community.The actions taken by my colleague the Treasurer to implement the recommendations of the Wallis committee report have all added to the competitive nature of the Australian financial system. What we are doing by building this confidence is not only providing cheaper finance for home buyers and for businesspeople but we are also building the reputation of Australia as a secure, reliable, dependable and attractive place in which to invest.The way in which we have been able to fireproof the Australian economy against the  ravages of the economic turmoil in the Asia-Pacific region is a direct result of the policies that my government has followed over the last two years. We see a growing confidence in the business community. We see an increasingly competitive financial sector. We see record low interest rates. In a sentence, while Labor Party frontbenchers have been muckraking, we have been busily cutting interest rates for home buyers and businesspeople.</DOC>

 - The member for Werriwa is smarting over the criticism that he is getting from his own side of politics for his complete lack of interest in the education portfolio. Indeed, there was a very interesting article about this in the Australian  over the weekend -  -  - The member for Werriwa is smarting over the criticism he is getting from his own backbench on precisely this issue of education and your interest in it. An article in the Weekend Australian  by Richard McGregor makes a point that when the Australian  visited the shadow minister in his office in Parliament House last week Latham was stewing over an anonymous quote from an ALP colleague -  - I am leading precisely to the point that the member for Werriwa is asking a question of this kind -  - Because he is in fact trying to demonstrate to his backbench, who do not believe it, that he has some knowledge of the shadow portfolio. Let me put before the House the facts of the situation, as every Australian is interested in knowing them. The facts of the situation are these: in 1998 there  are record numbers of enrolments in universities. - Well, let us just go right through the picture so that we do not end up with a distorted impression of what the facts are. There are record numbers of enrolments projected in universities for this year; 19,000 more than in 1996. It is projected further that total enrolments will continue to grow. Including fee payers and overenrolments, there are 28,000 projected more by the year 2000 than over the year 1996. - In relation to Commonwealth subsidised undergraduate places -  - I said undergraduate, and I say undergraduate again. - There are 10,000 more undergraduate places this year than in 1996, and there are an extra 4,000 Commonwealth fully-funded undergraduate places in universities this year. The facts of the situation are quite clear: total numbers of students are growing. - And accurately, Mr Speaker. There are an extra 4,000 fully-funded Commonwealth undergraduate places in universities this year over last year, making a total of 14,000 more such places than in 1996 - your last year of office. The facts are absolutely clear. In terms of fully-funded undergraduate places, in terms of total numbers of students and in terms of total funding and revenue for universities, this government has expanded access to Australian universities.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Groom for his question. I know that he is one of many members of this House who feel very passionately about Australia maintaining its well-earned reputation for being a racially and religiously tolerant country. In my role, I find that that is a response that one gets from the international community to Australia, but it is worth mentioning that on 30 March - just a few days ago - the Special Rapporteur of the United Nations Commission on Religious Intolerance, Mr Amor, reported to the 54th Session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, after a visit that he made to Australia. He stated:It can be said that Australia constitutes an original example of integrated multiculturalism and of religious tolerance.He went on to say:Regarding Aboriginals, a policy of reconciliation and of support is being developed. Legislation protecting certain lands and sacred sites, as well as religious property, is being implemented. Work continues on the restitution of the religious and cultural heritage of the Aboriginal people.This was the view expressed a few days ago by the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Religious Intolerance. This view does remind all of us in this House that we should be temperate in our use of language on some of the difficult issues that are currently being debated. There is, of course, no better example than the debate currently being conducted in Australia on the Wik legislation.It is perfectly legitimate for people to have different views on this legislation, but it is another thing for people to use intemperate language which simply inflames the debate. There is no better example of that than the example we saw last week - just three days after the United Nations report was handed down - when the Deputy Leader of the Opposition made the remarks he made about the Prime Minister which could only be described as utterly reprehensible. As Dennis Shanahan of the Australian pointed out: the race debate was out of the bottle and Gareth Evans had pulled the cork. We hoped that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition's statement to the House today would put an end to the matter. We hoped he would come in here and apologise instead of standing up and making a lot of disingenuous excuses. But the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has today compounded the problem; he has compounded his problem and he has compounded the Labor Party's problem. He went to the trouble of informing the government that he was going to make a statement to the House, and we came to hear a statement of apology and to put the matter behind us. We ended up with lame excuses, but we ended up without an apology.Therefore, the words that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition used last week remain on the record, the preposterous slur against the Prime Minister of this country remains on the record, and this continues to create an impression that there is a public debate in this country which is based on intolerance. If the Leader of the Opposition had any political  courage, he would instruct his frontbenchers to desist from using this sort of racially charged language, but he won't. Apparently, the Leader of the Opposition does not mind people going around using this sort of racially charged language. - I note the interjection of the Leader of the Opposition that I have somehow put this matter back on the agenda. It is not I who made the remarks; it was not I who came into the House today and made excuses but did not give an apology. An apology would have put an end to the matter; excuses do not.</DOC>

 - It is interesting to see that the tactics committee is still prepared to allow the member for Batman to actually get up and ask a question. Just for the information of the member for Batman, in case he has missed the government's announcement on this point, the CES ceases to exist from 1 May. If he is interested in the charging policies of the CES I can inform him that the previous Labor government introduced a policy called CES plus. CES plus gave the CES the opportunity to charge fees to employers. This was an improvement on the CES that did not charge fees.The CES, from 1 May, will be superseded by Employment National. Employment National will be the government's providers in the job network. The job network will be providing greatly improved services to unemployed people. Unemployed people will have  a much better chance of getting a job than they have ever had before because the one thing that the member for Batman and all the dinosaurs on the front bench refuse to admit is that the old system simply did not work well enough for unemployed people. The government has an obligation to unemployed people and we have made the most significant social reform for many decades to help unemployed people in this country get more opportunities.The charging policies that will be followed for employers by Employment National have already been announced. I have announced those policies in the House and the Prime Minister has tabled the relevant press release from Employment National. I suggest that the member for Batman gets himself up to date.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Deakin for his question. I can assure him and the members of his electorate that, today, job vacancies released by the ANZ showed another rise in the month of March - a .2 per cent rise in the month of March on top of a 5.1 per cent increase in February. Last week the Australian Bureau of Statistics released job vacancy figures showing them to be at the highest level on record. - The highest level on record, yes. Members might be surprised that the economic dinosaur Leader of the Opposition jumped up in parliament and said, `Is it not a fact that these are the best job vacancy figures only since February 1996?' That was the claim that was made. - He was right, was he? That was right? Isn't that funny, because the actual document itself reads as follows:Total job vacancies in February 1998 were 71,600. This is the highest recorded level of vacancies.There it was, right on the front of the bulletin. Yet the economic dinosaur got up on Thursday claiming that what the front page of the ABS statistics said was somehow wrong. He would know, wouldn't he? He would know; you can always trust his figures. You can always trust the figures of the Australian Labor Party.Here we have the ABS job vacancies at the highest recorded level, a 5.1 per cent increase last month on the ANZ job vacancies being confirmed and increasing today, employment growth averaging 17,000 per month in 1997-98 so far this year - isn't that great? Full-time employment has contributed most of that growth. The unemployment rate in February of 1998 at 8.1 per cent was the lowest since 1990 - the lowest since Paul Keating and the Labor Party said this was the recession we had to have. We can remember who had the highest unemployment rate while he was the employment minister: the king of the unemployment rate himself, the Leader of the Opposition - 11.3 per cent.I was wondering where you would go if you were looking for a policy from the Labor Party. We know where you would go if you were looking for a smear from the Labor Party - you would go right down this end of the front bench. But where would you go if you were looking for a policy from the Australian Labor Party on employment? Well, the only person in the Australian Labor Party who has tried to put out a policy, because he is so embarrassed about the leadership, is the member for Werriwa. You might be interested to know what the Labor Party policy on unemployment is. It is on page 104 of the Australian Labor Party's document Civilising Global Capital. It say this:The quest for full employment has actually been achieved, but only in a particular type of labour market in certain parts of the country. These are regions with a strong set of upstairs skills and the  consequent generation of a large number of downstairs jobs. To be certain - and here is the Labor Party policy - high unemployment is not a problem across the macro economy. - The Labor Party apparently agrees with us that the employment results are very good. That is from the thinker of the Australian Labor Party. The economic dinosaurs down here may have words but we prefer to look at their actions. Their actions caused 11.3 per cent unemployment - the Australian post-war record - and that was from the current Leader of the Opposition, whom they made the leader of the Labor Party after his great failure.We do not totally endorse the member for Werriwa's position. We think we can still do better, and we should still try to do better in Australia. But we welcome it when the Australian Labor Party recognises the great strides that have been done: the ANZ job vacancies, the ABS job vacancies, the lowest unemployment since Paul Keating gave us the recession - and I think people in Australia will think that is a good outcome. - I will, Mr Speaker, after the tirade finishes. It is called `ABS Job vacancies and overtime - 6354.0. Total job vacancies in February 1998: 71,600. This is the highest recorded level of vacancies'.</DOC>

 - I am sure that many inaccurate statements are made by particular people; they are mainly made on the other side of the chamber, I may say. But I prefer to rely on the nationally stated policies and the contracts which my department has with Centrelink. The fact of the matter is that Centrelink will be providing free access - universal free access - to all job seekers to access the free vacancy base -  - The terminal, the job vacancies. This is a minor thing: that people have access to a greatly expanded job vacancy database? That is the first thing they get free access to. The second thing is that they get free access to the other facilities which Centrelink provides - free computers to do their job resumes; free photocopiers to copy  their resumes; free telephones to phone the employers, so that they can make contact with any employer who has a job on the Centrelink database.The next thing, of course, that they can do is to access any of the agencies that have got on that database job vacancies which are not clearly restricted to longer term people on benefits. Of course, there may well be cases where employers and job agencies are negotiating with each other to place longer term unemployed people, and they may wish to indicate that on the job vacancy database. But, apart from those particular cases, anyone looking for a job, whether they are in a job, even if they are not on unemployment benefit, will be able to access these free services through Centrelink.The major job agencies have already made it clear that they will be offering their services to anyone who comes to them, because their undertaking to employers - and, indeed, their own self-interest as agencies - will be to say to employers that they can place with that employer the best person to fill that vacancy. The Job Network will be offering greatly improved services to unemployed people. - It will have a much larger job vacancy database than has existed in the past. And the government is taking further steps to ensure that the size of that job vacancy database is expanded. The Job Network will provide many more points of access for unemployed people. The current CES has some 296 offices around Australia available for basic job matching services; the Job network will have over 1,400 - 1,400 such points of access. Above all else, members of the Job Network, unlike anything that has gone before, will be competing with each other to get unemployed people into jobs. They will be paid for those basic job matching services when they get an unemployed person into a job.How different this is to the system supported by the member for Hotham and the member for Batman when they were in office - a system into which was poured hundreds of  millions of hard earned taxpayers' dollars into a system which had in relation to its major program a four per cent success rate and cost $143,000 a job; a system that almost bankrupted Australia. We are putting in place a system which will provide unemployed people with the best job service searching that they have ever had.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. After two years of ridiculing the private health insurance incentive scheme, it was very nice to see the Leader of the Opposition do a backflip on Friday on the ABC news saying, `We won't abolish the private health insurance rebate.' This is very welcome, even if it only lasted 48 hours because on Sunday he decided to call a doorstop interview that was billed to the media as the life raft for private health insurance, and this was how he was going to fix things.I am delighted that the Leader of the Opposition is thinking about health. However, this life raft turns out to have a fair sort of hole in it. At the doorstop interview the Leader of the Opposition said the following:The way to fix the system is real money to the state hospitals, some of the money coming from the health rebate which has been underspent and insisting that the states maintain their effort to the solution is the problem right now.There are two major problems with this. The first is that, as a former Minister for Finance, the Leader of the Opposition would know that any underspends are automatically updated in parameter reviews in the mid-year economic  review and in the budget. Should there actually be any underspend, it is deemed as fortuitous and it is rolled into the budget bottom line.The only consequence of this could be that we have to add this to the list of unfunded promises in health that the Labor Party has made, which so far is to abolish the therapeutic group premiums, $500 million over four years; to restore savings from forward estimates agreed by premiers, $800 million; to restore the funding from the Commonwealth dental program, $400 million; to support the states' demand for an extra $1.1 billion in base funding under the five-year agreement at a cost of $4.4 billion; and full indexation of the MBS standard consultation for fees for GPs at $162.5 billion, which comes to $6.265 billion to which we can now add another unfunded $1.2 billion over four years.The other problem with this is that it shows that the Leader of the Opposition does not understand the problem with hospitals, because it is not simply a matter of more money. The then Minister for Finance was lamenting during the 1996 election that the more money the Commonwealth put in, the more money the states pulled out. That is absolutely correct. That is a direct result of the Medicare agreement you signed in 1993. The solution to the problem with hospitals is much more complex than just more money. If you take the one Labor state, New South Wales, and have a look at the cost of operations on a casemix basis in that state and then compare it to Queensland, where hospitals are running quite well, if Andrew Refshauge ran his hospitals as efficiently as Mike Horan does in Queensland, New South Wales would have an extra $689 million every year to spend on their hospitals.Secondly, one of the legacies we had of 13 years of Labor in office was to have one of the highest utilisations of hospitals anywhere in the world. We use hospitals very highly by international standards, and the only way to fix that is having substitution for in hospital treatment by community care, which has never happened until now in this country, and looking at step down facilities and other facilities like that, both of which are instru  mental in the agreements that we are signing with the states.Finally, the solution to hospitals is looking at prevention as much as looking at treatment, as is being done with the recent initiative to immunise older Australians against influenza, in our measles initiative, in our ongoing campaign on smoking to try to continue the decline in smoking prevalence which had completely halted under Labor. The simple statements show that the Labor Party has no understanding of the complexities of the health portfolio. While I welcome them wanting to make private health more affordable for Australians, clearly they have a long way to go in their thinking.</DOC>

 - Home Alone has really done it this time! What I have constantly said, and I take the opportunity of repeating, is that irrespective of the attitude taken by the premiers at the recent Premiers Conference we will honour in full without deduction to the very last dollar the offer that was put on the table at the Premiers Conference. I say to the Australian public that that offer was a fair offer, it was a reasonable offer, it is an offer that involves a three per cent increase for five years, giving a cumulative rise of 15 per cent  over five years. That is what I have said constantly, and that is what the honourable member for Dobell's question gives me the opportunity of saying yet again.I also take the opportunity of informing the House of a few of the basic facts. These are facts that would be very much in the recollection of the member for Fremantle. In 1995 when the member for Fremantle was the minister for health she claimed rather bitterly that, as fast as the Commonwealth put more money into hospitals for the states, the states took it away. That is the complete opposite of what the member for Dobell is now saying. I remind the House that during the five years of Labor's 1993 Medicare agreements the Commonwealth spent over $3¼ billion more on hospitals than if it had maintained funding at the 1992-93 levels. The states spent only $355 million more than if they had maintained their 1992-93 funding level. State spending actually declined in the first and second years of the agreements by $500 million in 1993-94 and by $331 million in -  - Mr Speaker, this is the very issue he asked me about. - I repeat: state spending actually declined in the first and second years of the agreements, by $500 million in 1993-94 and by $331 million in 1994-95. I inform the House that the following states and territories are still spending less on hospitals in 1997-98 than they were in 1992-93: Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia, Tasmania and the Northern Territory. These are the facts. These are the unemotional, plain, straightforward facts. They demonstrate  the fairness of the position that has been taken by the Commonwealth. I would be very happy to make available to the member for Dobell all of the graphs and all of the charts that verify the figures that I have used.During the five years of Labor's 1993 agreement, the Commonwealth spent $25,000 million on hospitals. The Department of Finance and Administration's forward estimates, based on the Labor Party's 1993 agreement, projected an expenditure of $27.3 billion over the following five years, but, under the coalition's offer, the Commonwealth will spend $30.3 billion over the five-year period of the new agreement. This represents an increase over Labor's forward estimates. So much for these claims that we have cut payments to the states in relation to hospital spending.What we are proposing to do is to spend an additional $2.9 billion over and above the Labor Party's forward estimates. That will provide for real growth of 6.9 per cent in 1998-98 and a 15.4 per cent increase over a period of five years. All of this is occurring in a climate of zero inflation and all of this is occurring at a time when the federal government is offering almost a five per cent increase in real terms in the general revenue payments that are flowing to the states under the taxation arrangement between the Commonwealth and the states.I understand and I sympathise with the responsibilities of the states in relation to public hospitals, but by no fair measure can it be said that the Commonwealth has neglected its responsibilities. The Commonwealth has made a fair offer, a decent offer, a generous offer. I say to the patients of Australia: we will honour that in full, we will not take away one single dollar, we will give you every dollar, every last cent, of the offer that I put on the table, which represents a massive further injection of federal government money. I thank the member for Dobell for his question.</DOC>

Over the weekend it was announced by the MUA that they will be taking further industrial action, this time going back to Sydney for another seven days of industrial action. This is on top of a series of strikes that the MUA has run in Sydney. It will take to well over 40 the number of days lost due to industrial action by the MUA against Patrick - all for the reason that Patrick decided, for commercial reasons, to sublet part of their property in Melbourne. This action by the MUA is condemned by this government.We point out the futility of this ongoing industrial action by the MUA. This is action taken by them because they oppose the concept of genuine competition. Elsewhere in the Australian economy, if someone set up business down the road, most people running a business would say, `We have got a bit of competition. What we have got to do is lift our game.' But, for the MUA, when there is a bit of competition, their response is, `We will take any action, legal or illegal, to close down our competitors. We will take any action whatsoever available to us to wreak havoc against those who support competition.'In the end, not only is this action by the MUA leadership futile but it undermines the security of the very people that it claims to represent - namely, the rank and file wharfies who work for Patrick. It is no wonder that the MUA has failed to gather any public support for its position. I think most Australians reckon that wharfies on $90,000 a year, on average $74,000 a year, with some earning more than $100,000 are on a very good wicket, which, I have to say, most people would not mind if they thought there was a decent day's work being done and if Australia's waterfront was as competitive as those with whom we compete. But, sadly, it is not. Not only does the government have strong support from the Australian public for waterfront reform but we have strong support  right across the business community including, importantly, those importers and exporters who rely on an efficient waterfront.What else is interesting about this dispute - and what I think the MUA should take heed of - is the fact that they have very little support generally within the trade union movement. It was only last September that Bill Kelty, the Secretary of the ACTU, was saying that, if there was non-union labour introduced on the Australian waterfront, `you will have the biggest picket that has ever been assembled in this country'. The reason that the response has been limited from the ACTU is that in the Trade Practices Act we now have effective prohibitions against secondary and primary boycotts. Those strong new laws against sympathy strikes were put through the Senate by the government with the support of the Democrats and, in particular, Labor's star recruit, Cheryl Kernot. It is a continuing embarrassment to the Labor Party that their policy is to repeal the very provisions which have prevented the ACTU from running a wider campaign.If you go back over this dispute since it arose at the end of January, you will see that the one person we have not heard from is Bill Kelty. The reason is that this government has strong laws in place to deal with the industrial thuggery. The other notable feature of this dispute is the embarrassed silence from the weakness of the Leader of the Opposition, who, when confronted with industrial thuggery, is unable to come out and declare the national interest, in the same way that his gutter-like deputy was unable to come into this House today and give a full apology. - The Leader of the Opposition again demonstrates that when it comes to the national interest he is unable to stand and speak on behalf of the mainstream of the Australian community. - These two events are not unrelated. We have a weak Leader of the Opposition unable to enforce proper standards on his deputy, unable to deal with industrial thuggery on the Australian waterfront and whose only response is noise and abuse in this House. You can have as much noise and abuse as you like; your weakness is here, displayed for all to see.</DOC>

 - As I was saying in answer to the first question from the member for Dobell, the Commonwealth's offer, which involves an extra $2.9 billion over a period of five years, includes $369 million extra for hospital patient and outpatient services; it includes $479 million for mental health and palliative care; it includes $682 million to be passed on to providers to enhance the quality of patient services; it involves $750 million transfer to the Commonwealth of the cost of treating entitled veterans in hospitals.Even the New South Wales health minister, who turned up at the Premiers Conference utterly ignorant of the arrangement that had been offered by the Commonwealth, was forced to admit in the course of the Premiers Conference that the Commonwealth was effectively making double provision for the veterans. We not only are agreeing to pur  chase health services for veterans but also are agreeing to include in the base for the calculation of the five-year agreement the veterans. In other words, there was a double provision in the arrangement that was offered by the Commonwealth in relation to veterans. Mr Refshauge is very busy trying to pass the buck. Whenever there is criticism of his administration of public hospitals in New South Wales, you have this sort of yapping mantra from the New South Wales health minister, Mr Refshauge; if there is ever any criticism of the New South Wales hospital system, he always says, `It is the fault of the federal government.'I repeat that the Commonwealth's offer involves real growth of 6.9 per cent in 1998-99, and 15.4 per cent over a period of five years. This graph so tellingly illustrates the growth in spending under the earlier Medicare agreement and then it shows the continued further growth under the five-year agreement that has been offered by the federal government.I would also inform the House that the offer that we have made to the states is an offer that will be fully honoured by the federal government. We will honour in full - without deduction - the offer that we have put on the table for the Australian people. We owe our obligation direct to the Australian people. We do not owe the obligation through the state governments. If we make a commitment to the Australian people - I made that commitment when the Treasurer and I took the offer to the Premiers Conference - we will honour that commitment in full.For the first time under this arrangement the Commonwealth is sharing with the states a number of risks. In addition to the extra $2.9 billion - that is $2.9 more than was in the forward estimates prepared by the former Labor government - the Commonwealth is taking on some of the financial risks that had previously been shouldered entirely by the states. For every percentage point private health insurance membership falls below 32 per cent, the Commonwealth will indemnify the states by a further $83 million per annum. For every percentage point hospital output  costs exceed 0.5 per cent, the Commonwealth will pay an extra $44 million per annum.As I pointed out yesterday in Melbourne, the states are claiming $1.9 billion per annum on top of all extra funds offered by the Commonwealth. This would pay for an extra 300,000 people to go into hospital every year. However, there are only 120,000 people on waiting lists at any given time. The states, in other words, are making a claim that is very much in the ambit area. The offer we have made is a fair one. It is a decent offer. It is a reasonable offer. In the name of the interests of the Australian people, it ought to be accepted by the state governments, and they ought to abandon their campaign of political point scoring.</DOC>

 - It is always a pleasure to be able to have the opportunity in this House and outside to recognise an achievement by one of my constituents. I believe the honourable member for Forrest is, on this occasion, referring to media reports that have emanated from a publication by the honourable member for Werriwa. That publication is entitled Civilising Global Capital . I have noted in respect of a chapter entitled `A Role for Government' that there is a clear difference highlighted in the different approaches taken by those opposite on the use of proceeds of assets sales. The member for Werriwa highlights what they did in government and he highlights what he says should happen. Under a subheading in that chapter `Ownership Neutrality', the member for Werriwa says:The liberalisation of capital markets has allowed governments to shift their fixed capital investments from markets featuring competitive private capital to the enhancement of human capital.It is difficult to know first up just what that means but I believe that what the member for Werriwa was saying -  -  - Let me put it into simple English: there are better ways for government to spend their scare public capital - for example, on welfare, education and health - rather than spending that public capital on running businesses. Businesses are run by what the member for Werriwa calls competitive private capital which we on this side of the House are happy to say means `run by the private sector'. The member for Werriwa also goes on to say:I do not see a lasting role for the state public sector in the ownership of large slabs of industrial capital.He further says:It is possible for the public sector to vacate its ownership role without a loss of economic efficiency or social equity.They are very sound principles. We on this side of the House agree with those statements by the member for Werriwa. But the member for Werriwa goes on to concede that these were not the principles which drove the former government. When Labor were in government, they did not abide by these principles when they dealt with privatisation  policies. Labor in government were driven by what the member for Werriwa says were `the exigencies of the budget bottom line'. The government agrees with the member for Werriwa: Labor privatised for all the wrong reasons. They were not interested in retiring debt; they were interested in funding recurrent expenditure. The member for Werriwa goes on to say `that questions of ownership should not be determined through fixed ideological preferences for either private or public sector activity. -  - The relevance is that the member for Werriwa is relevant and the rest of the frontbench are not relevant when it comes to policy. On the very question of whether or not questions of ownership should be determined through fixed ideological preferences, it is clear that the bulk of the members on the front bench of the Labor Party believe in ideological preferences. All I can say is that the government welcomes the contribution by the honourable member for Werriwa. We agree with most of what he says. Clearly, the rest of his colleagues are backward thinking; their role model is Arthur Calwell. </DOC>

 - I am very pleased to have the chance to respond to the honourable member for Dunkley, who has a great concern to expand opportunities for young people in his electorate. When this coalition took office in March 1996 we made a pledge to young Australians that we would create tens of thousands of new apprenticeship opportunities. Labor, as we know, had handed the apprenticeship system and the industry training system over to the trade union movement, and they had discouraged employers from giving young people these quality training opportunities. That is why they had to pour hundreds of millions of dollars into their short-term training schemes; they could not provide quality training opportunities.The coalition government is delivering on its pledge to young Australians. I am pleased to inform the House that there are now more young Australians in new apprenticeships than at any time in this country's history. The figures just released show that in the most recent quarter for which figures are available, September 1997, there were 177,209 young  people in apprenticeships and traineeships, 41,000 more than in Labor's last year. That is a tremendous increase, because we have put in place industry training arrangements which actually appeal to business, including small businesses in the service sector.This year for the first time a young person can actually be paid for an apprenticeship while they are combining employment with their school studies and completing their senior certificate at the same time. This year alone we are now heading for over 100,000 people actually starting new apprenticeships. Labor's silence on this success has been deafening. - The member for Hotham says `rubbish'. In the two years or so since the last election some 3,000 questions have been asked in this House. I asked myself: how many of these questions had come from the Labor Party on apprenticeship and quality training opportunities for young people? - Perhaps 10 per cent. Would it be 300, 100, 50, 20, 10 or two? - One! One question was asked. That was from the member for Batman. The member for Werriwa, who had a temporary interest in TAFE last year, did not ask one question. - He is out doing further research, however divisive that will be on the Labor frontbench. It is quite clear that the member for Werriwa has not even had sufficient interest in apprenticeships to include in his 391-page volume a single reference to apprenticeships in the index to that book. Maybe his critics in the Labor Party are not so wrong when they say that he has not been attending to his portfolio, as the Australian  discovered when they called in at his office on the weekend. In an article written by Richard McGregor, it says that the member for Werriwa was stewing over comments by an ALP colleague reported in the morning newspaper. The member for Werriwa is  quoted as saying something, but I will not, out of respect for the House, use the word that he used. Some fool according to the paper said his views made Genghis Khan look like a social worker. Barely smiling, he said that Genghis Khan was not into training and education. Referring to his colleagues on the frontbench, he said that some of these dills ought to actually read the book. Which of the dinosaurs is the dill? He is out hunting; he is loading up the dinosaur gun outside the House at the moment, and he will be back shortly.One thing stands out: there has been absolutely no interest on that side of the House in opening up quality opportunities for young Australians.</DOC>

 - I am not aware of the particular case. - Did I hear the member for Holt say something? Did I hear a word from the member for Holt? - I do not think the honourable member for Dobell is a joke; I think that member is a joke. - The answer is that I do not know the circumstance of the particular case. If the member wishes to send them to me, I will analyse what he has had to say. I am aware of a couple of things. I am aware of some statements that were made by the member for Fremantle when she was the minister for health. I am aware of the fact that she made the dental program, which the former government introduced, a four-year time specific. I am aware of the fact that public dental health is a state and territory responsibility.I wonder whether the member for Dobell in his confected outrage has bothered to raise  any of these matters with Dr Andrew Refshauge, the minister with prime responsibility for such matters.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Petrie for her question. As the member for Petrie and other members of the House will know, the government has been concerned for some months to play a very active and supportive role in the recovery of the Indonesian economy. Amongst other things, I and my colleagues the Treasurer, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Trade have been very active in endeavouring to encourage the IMF and the United States government to adopt a realistic approach to the problems of the Indonesian economy.My understanding, and this is based in part on the conversation that I had with President Suharto on Saturday afternoon, is that the IMF program currently being negotiated in Jakarta is expected to be agreed some time this week. I welcome that and I welcome the more positive attitude that has been taken by the Indonesian government in recent weeks to meet the program laid down by the IMF. Whatever the conditions that are involved in the agreement, it is important that the central thrust of that agreement be honoured in full by the Indonesian government. In all of the discussions that I and my colleagues have had with the Indonesian government, we have stressed the central importance of the Indonesian government meeting the main elements of the IMF package.I indicated to President Suharto during that discussion - and I am pleased to inform the House of this - that, in response to a request from the IMF, Australia will be prepared to activate up to $US300 million out of the loan equivalent to $US1 billion which Australia pledged to support the IMF program for Indonesia in October 1997. We are prepared to bring that amount forward on the condition, of course, that the IMF program is fully  accepted by Indonesia and that the agreement between Indonesia and the IMF is effectively negotiated. This commitment is in addition to the commitment that was announced by the minister for industry at the weekend, when he said that EFIC can offer export insurance cover on the national interest account for up to $380 million worth of cotton exports to Indonesia. We have also increased to $500 million the level of wheat exports which EFIC can cover.I stress in relation to both of these actions that what the Australian government has done will generate jobs in Australia, will protect existing jobs and will boost Australia's export income. At every stage of the action that Australia has taken in relation to Indonesia, Korea, Thailand and the other nations of the Asia-Pacific region, we have had in mind the legitimate self-interest of this country. We have had in mind the desire of the Australian people to see the jobs of Australians and the exports of Australian industries fully protected. We will continue to take whatever action is necessary to protect our farmers and to protect our other exporters who have such a very strong interest in the revitalisation and the recovery of the economies of the Asia-Pacific region.Our actions demonstrate the leadership that the government has shown in promoting an effective international response and encouraging a realistic and effective IMF and World Bank statement. That activity has involved not only personal discussions on my part with the President of Indonesia on several occasions but also a lengthy discussion on Friday evening with the Premier of China, Zhu Rongji, discussions with the Prime Minister of Japan some time ago and regular discussions with the Prime Minister of Singapore. The foreign minister has visited both Washington and Tokyo to very effectively put the government's point of view. The Treasurer has been in very regular contact with his counterparts as well as in regular discussion with the managing director of the international fund, Mr Camdessus.Strong international support is vital; but ultimately the Indonesian recovery depends on implementing the reform measures agreed  with the International Monetary Fund. The credibility of Indonesia's commitment is crucial to regaining the confidence of international markets. That was a point that I emphasised in my discussion with President Suharto on Saturday afternoon. Indonesia, the world's fourth largest country, is not only a valuable economic partner of Australia but also a very valuable political and social partner of Australia, and is of immense strategic importance to Australia's future.The stability and the prosperity of Indonesia are matters of direct relevance to the national interest of Australia. That is why from the very beginning of her difficulties the Australian government has taken pains to ensure that there is an adequate, on the ground, practical, far-sighted understanding of the problems facing Indonesia. I believe that we have been very successful in getting that point of view across not only to the United States and the nations of Europe but also to the International Monetary Fund. As a consequence, the response of the United States, other countries and the International Monetary Fund has been more appropriate to the particular circumstances of Indonesia. Our understanding of that country has been very relevant to their reaching that point of view.</DOC>

 - As we have always said, our government believes in reforming the tax system. Our government will announce plans to reform the tax system when it is ready to do so. We urge you to have a think about your own policy. The thing that amazes us is that, of all the people in Australia who know the problems of the Australian taxation system, there is only one group of people that want to retain it; there is only one group of people that believe in the current Australian taxation system. - The member for Denison says that we do not lead debate. This is from the economic dinosaurs of the Australian Labor Party who have not produced a policy in two years. We know why it is that they go around with the smear and the slur: because in two years they have been unable to produce one single policy: no policy on budgetary matters, no policy on interest rates, no policy on tax - no policy on anything. They have specialised in the smear and the slur. - We know what the Leader of the Opposition is hiding: he is  hiding his deputy. His rather ample frame tries to cover him up in every question time. - We read from Malcolm Farr that he has now been banned from doing doorstops in the morning. - The answer is a very simple one: when is the Deputy Leader of the Opposition going to apologise? That is the question here. - And when are you going to make him? - Oh, saved him again. Oh, oh, oh! Exaggerated laughter! The people of Australia want to know this: when are you going to show some leadership? When? - I will tell you what this government is going to do: this government  is going to rescue the Australian taxation system, this government is going to give a go to ordinary wage and salary earners, this government is going to take Australia into the new century and this government is going to deliver the kinds of benefits for home owners that they deserve and were denied by the Labor Party. - </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and the opportunity to speak about the government's response to international economic developments. In 1997 the Japanese economy slowed to 0.9 per cent growth, with a negative growth in the last quarter of 1997. For 1998 Consensus Economics forecasts are predicting 0.1 per cent growth, with a possible negative growth in the first part of the year. Net export growth is expected to remain positive but to weaken as the year progresses.Attention has focused in the last couple of days on a business expectations survey released on 2 April showing a sharp decline in sentiment and on an announcement last Friday by the international ratings agency Moody's that it was putting a negative watch, downgrading from stable to negative, on Japanese sovereign debt.As a consequence of these measures, attention has focused on the Japanese economy over the last couple of days. From the government's point of view, we welcome moves by the Japanese authority to stimulate the Japanese economy. The government has announced five packages since October last  year, including a number of fiscal measures designed to boost domestic activity and restore consumer and business confidence. Key elements of the packages include stimulating domestic demand, five trillion yen; one per cent of GDP worth of fiscal tax measures; and the recently announced additional package of 16 trillion yen, or three per cent of GDP, largely bringing forward planned public works expenditure to the first half of the year with the possibility of further personal income tax cuts.Over the weekend there have been reports from the ASEM summit in London and indeed from G7 summit meetings that the G7 has encouraged the Japanese government to engage in fiscal measures to boost the Japanese economy. The Australian government shares the concerns which were raised by the G7 at its late February meeting and most recently at the ASEM summit about the delay in economic recovery in Japan.We are, however, encouraged by the fact that the government has recognised the importance of stimulatory action, and we are encouraged by the fact that the government seems determined to stimulate domestic demand and take further measures, which will of course improve the outlook for the economy. The government also welcomes measures which would speed up structural reform in Japan, which would open its markets, which would give it the opportunity for increased productivity and particularly structural reform for the financial sector, which are obviously very important.From Australia's point of view, it is in the interests of Australia for a strong Japan. Japan is certainly our most important trading nation. It has a large effect on the Australian economy. It has been flat for a very long period, and those measures which can be done and should be undertaken we would encourage the government to do to stimulate domestic demand.</DOC>

 - We regard these sorts of questions as the silly little debating tricks that they are designed to be - it is the most obvious trick in the world - silly little debating tricks such as, `Will you say that it is going to rain tomorrow?' and when you do not say anything it is proof that it is going to rain, and when asked whether the sun will come out tomorrow you say that you will wait until tomorrow to see it, the sun is not going to come out. It would be entirely different if, in two years, you had produced one single policy, but the only policy thinking that has gone on amongst the economic dinosaurs of the Labor Party -  -  - We have seen these debating tricks before and we are very famili  ar with them. Mr Speaker, let me tell you when these debating tricks reached their zenith. Debating tricks like these reach their zenith from political outfits which have no policy and no thinking. I do not think I have ever seen a leader humiliated by a frontbencher before in the way you have been. - The reason why these debating tricks reach their height is that, in two years, can anybody think of any policy development from the Australian Labor Party? Have they produced a policy on the economy? Have they produced a policy on interest rates? - Have they produced a policy on anything? Never in my life have I seen the necessity for a frontbencher of an opposition to write a book recommending policy. - One of the reasons why we welcome the policy thinking in the Australian Labor Party is this -  - Entirely in order - thank you. - They do not want to hear it. The one policy that we have from the Australian Labor Party in the book from the frontbencher - the member for Werriwa - said what on tax? He said we ought to tax consumption. That is what he said. No amount of yelling and no amount of babble -  -  - The people at home cannot see this, but you have a Leader of the Opposition who sits here and yells at the top of his voice incessantly. The reason he does it is that he thinks it is a substitute for policy. He has no policy, and the only person in the Australian Labor Party who thought for a moment said that you were wrong and we were right.</DOC>

 - It is a pleasure to answer the question from the member for McEwen, and to do so in the presence of the South African Minister for Agriculture. South Africa is the newest member of the Cairns Group of Nations and made a very worthwhile contribution to the deliberations in Sydney last week. In the case of Foreign Affairs and Trade, it has to be said that words are bullets. -  - I hear the interjection from the member for Holt. Thank you very much, Deputy Leader of the Opposition. If you had remembered this last week, you would not have made that huge gaff for which you should have apologised at 12.30 today. I think I should also tell the House that the member for Holt made a further comment on 3GI radio at Sale this morning. The journalist said:Just a final comment, Mr Evans. No matter how much we try to avoid it, there will always be gaffs in public life. Your comment re Mr Howard hasn't gone over that well.The reply by the member for Holt, who interjected on my answer, was:I think it should be seen in the particular context which was my reaction to what I thought was a very tacky and insensitive response by John Howard.The member for Holt was literally jigging around in the parliament, grinning broadly and slapping his thighs when someone brought in a note. You should be at the box and apologising completely for that kind of language. You should be apologising completely. None of this partial apology that we had recorded by AAP; you should be apologising completely. - Mr Speaker, I was irritated by this former Minister for Foreign Affairs. He is the only guy who has ever gone to the Middle East and managed to get the Arabs and the Israelis offside during the one trip. - Not only was it a very constructive meeting, it also led to a unanimous communique and vision statement by the Cairns Group. It prepared the way for the World Trade Organisation negotiations on agriculture, due in 1999, and the second ministerial of the WTO, to take place in Geneva next month. The three fundamental issues highlighted by the Cairns group were: firstly, there is no justification in maintaining destructive and market distorting export subsidies which undermine agricultural produces and exporters; secondly, market access for agricultural products should be on the same conditions as those applying to other goods; and, thirdly, overall levels of domestic support for agriculture are far in excess of subsidies available to other industries - indeed, they totalled over $US280 billion last year.When a farmer arrived from Coventry in Britain to attend a Nuffield conference, I said, `How did you travel?' He said, `British Airways, first class.' I said to him, `You must be having a good season on your 3,000 acres.' He said, `No. Just before I made my British Airways booking for a first-class air ticket from London to Brisbane, my EU subsidy cheque arrived in the mail.' I said, `Would you mind telling me how much that cheque was?' He said £300,000 - $500,000 - on an annualised basis.' That is why the Cairns Group is making a strong stand against export subsidisation, against the subsidies of the common agricultural policy.In conclusion, the Cairns Group also, in the course of a busy 2½ days, had the privilege of briefly breaking off to visit the Botanical Gardens and the Royal Agricultural Society at the new Homebush site, a magnificent site.  We travelled not by motor car but by a form of public transport. The other thing we did -  -  - By ferry. I wanted to go by train. The Cairns Group also met with Dan Glickman, the US Secretary for Agriculture, during the course of the meeting in Sydney. We were able to obtain from him two things. Firstly, the US remains 100 per cent committed to the elimination of export subsidies - a very timely renewal of that commitment. Secondly, the US congress, in his belief, will not approve any EU-US transatlantic trade proposal currently under discussion in the corridors of Brussels and Washington without the inclusion of agriculture. If the member for Hotham just remembered from the days when he was minister for primary industry, he would remember that half the battle is to get agriculture onto the main negotiating table of the World Trade Organisation. We are following through in a very systematic way. The Cairns group was a particularly successful meeting in building further progress in this regard.</DOC>

 - As I said yesterday, and I say it again, these are trick questions. We know what the game is. It is the game that is played before every budget. It is the game in which they ask, `Will you rule this in? Will you rule that out?' If you take the position which we do that we will announce our budget on budget night, we will announce our plans when we are ready to do so. We do not play these little tricky games, and we do not intend to. I said that yesterday.I do want to say something about being held accountable in the parliament. I do want to say something about the kind of people who put racial slurs on Prime Ministers and want to come into this parliament -  - We do want to take up the second part of the question about being accountable to the parliament. We think it is important that you are accountable to the  parliament. We think it is important that if you go and smear people and inflame racial tensions, you come in here and apologise. - Of course I will, Mr Speaker. We on this side of the parliament want it to be known to the Australian people that we believe in tax reform. We support tax reform. There is only one political party that wants to preserve the current unfair tax system, and it is Labor. You had 13 years to try to reform the tax system. You squibbed it and you want to be elected so you can squib it again, and we will not let you do it.</DOC>

 - In reply to the member for Leichhardt, I am very pleased to say that, since being elected to government, my government has not only preserved the social security safety net but added to it in a number of areas. It has gone beyond the commitments that it made during the election campaign. The most recent example of that was our decision to link the level of the war widows' pension to average male ordinary time earnings. So in every respect it can be said that my government has fulfilled the promises that it made about the social security safety net. Any decent, compassionate society needs a strong, effective social security safety net.I think any decent society also needs a social security system that is not vulnerable to fraud and is not vulnerable to rorting. I notice that in 1994, when the member for Sydney was the Minister for Social Security,  he made the rather self-satisfied declaration that after an independent review of the system over which he presided as minister, he found the compliance problem had been effectively solved. He said that his government had been at the cutting edge in combating fraud and compliance problems.I take the opportunity of praising the job that Senator Newman has done as Minister for Social Security. She has been able to combine a compassionate concern for the less privileged people in the Australian community with a very sensible commitment to ensure that the hard-working people of Australia get value for money and that those who are not entitled to social security payments do not receive them.I wish to inform the House of a report on social security compliance which will cover the first six months of the current financial year. The report will tell us that more than 1½ million compliance reviews were carried out between July and December last year, over 171,000 people had their payments cancelled or reduced, 25 per cent more than in the same period the previous year. That means that we are saving $13 million a week on payments we do not have to make for the rest of this financial year. A total of 1,319 people were convicted in the courts for welfare fraud, and recovery of outstanding debts increased by over 31 per cent to $230 million during the first six months of 1997-98.In the 18 months to December 1997, the government has recovered more than $600 million in debts owed by people who have received more than their entitlement. That is about $1.1 million a day, a 76 per cent increase over the recovery rate during Labor's last 18 months. So much for their commitment to having solved the problem; so much for their proud boast that their compliance record was at the cutting edge of practice in that area.The Australian community strongly supports our efforts on two fronts. They want a decent safety net and they want the deserving of this community to be protected and looked after. But they have no stomach for fraud, they will not tolerate fraud, and they will support the  efforts of my government to rule out fraud in the social security system and elsewhere.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. The Treasurer, in his answer to the House a moment ago, pointed out that the government will not rule in or out anything that is in a tax reform package. Every person in local government and every part of the community has had an opportunity to consult with the tax reform task force on tax reform in this country, and nothing is being ruled in or being ruled out by the government.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Cowper not only for his question but for his diagnosis of the member for Banks. A lot of us have thought about that for quite some time. We cannot understand why the ALP would want ordinary wage and salary earners to be paying $1 in $2 in income tax. We cannot understand why the Australian Labor Party would want to have effective marginal tax rates of 80 per cent and 90 per cent where people who go into the work force and earn extra money lose tax and benefits. We cannot understand why, after 13 years of failure, the do-nothing Beazley opposition would want to preserve the Australian taxation system. They have finally found a cause worth fighting for: the preservation of the current Australian taxation system. That is the cause that the Australian Labor Party want to fight for.I was rather taken aback by an interview by the reformist Leader of the Opposition this morning on the breakfast show with Phillip Clarke. He was asked why Labor is against tax reform. That is a very good question: why is Labor against tax reform? - Well, we don't really know, but this is the answer he came up with. This is why Labor is opposed to tax reform. He said this:As we go into a period with the Asian crisis which will eventually show up in our figures by the end of this year and which there is very great doubt over some of our major trading partners, to be actually throwing into the middle of that a tax bomb to detonate on all those areas a sense of confidence and security, that is not tax reform, it's stupidity.So the most recent answer to why the Labor Party is against tax reform is the Asian crisis - 13 years of an Asian boom and that was a reason not to have tax reform; two years of an Asian crisis and that is another reason not to have tax reform. Thirteen years was the economy's booming. It cannot do it in the good times and it cannot do it in the bad times either. Wouldn't rationality say to you that, at a time when Australia has historic opportunities in the Asian area, where we have become the strong man of the region, where we have been part of the three financial packages, where we will have a budget going back and back and where we will be retiring debt, that would be the time to steal a march on the competition and reform the taxation system?But what does Labor say? Labor says, as this Leader of the Opposition always says, `Now is not the time. The Asian crisis is an excuse for doing nothing. The Asian boom was an excuse for doing nothing. This is the Beazley approach to life and government - an excuse for doing nothing. When the budget is in deficit, we shouldn't do anything. When debt is mounting up, we shouldn't do anything.' He is not a leader. He does not want to fix anything. He never thinks that the time is right. It was not the right time to balance the budget. It was not the right time to get unemployment down when he was employment minister. It is not the right time to engage in tax reform. It is not the right time to make the Australian economy the strong power of Asia. It is not the right time to do anything. This is a Leader of the Opposition who cannot lead. The truth of the matter is that he is a Leader of the Opposition who cannot lead.There is only one shadow minister on the Labor frontbench capable of leading, and it is the member for Werriwa. He knows it. All he has to do is make sure he gets in front of the  queue; that he gets in between Simon and Cheryl, leaps over Cheryl and gets into a leadership position. What did he say about taxation? I say to the members of the Labor Party backbench, `Listen to your leader.' He said we should be taxing consumption. The Leader of the Opposition is going to go down to the Press Club tomorrow and launch the Labor Party manifesto written by the member for Werriwa - a manifesto that talks about how we have no unemployment problem, that talks about the economic dinosaurs not showing leadership, that talks about reforming the taxation system. The one thing I do not want the Leader of the Opposition to do tomorrow is to take the Ros Kelly endorsement: `I read the cover and not the book.' Before you go down to the Press Club tomorrow, you read the whole book and you support it, old son.</DOC>

 - I have already answered that question. We know the tricks; we have seen them all. We used to play them ourselves before budgets. Let me ask the Australian Labor Party this: will the Australian Labor Party rule out a 22 per cent tax on children's toys? Will it? Does the Australian Labor Party think that a 22 per cent tax on children's toys is fair when there is no tax on caviar? I do not think that is fair. Do you? - Will the Australian Labor Party rule out a 22 per cent tax on wheelbarrows when there is no tax on antiques? That is a fair point. - They are always trick questions from you. You are such a tricky fellow. We have to watch him carefully, he is so tricky. Why does the Australian Labor Party support a 22 per cent tax on razors but the Australian Labor Party does not support any tax on antique muffin dishes? I wonder whether there is a big demand for antique muffin dishes in the electorate of Holt. I will have to read my copy of The Gareth  very carefully next week just to see. The fact of the matter is -  - You have to remember one thing in the tax reform debate: this is a government of reform, this is one of the great reform governments of Australian history, and the Labor Party is a party of reaction.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker -  -  - I thank the honourable member for his question. No government in Australian history inherited a bigger debt burden than our government did when it was elected in March 1996. Mr Speaker, just to give you some facts on this, the Fraser  government inherited - and I think it is important that the gallery understands this - a Commonwealth government debt from Whitlam of $1 billion or one per cent. In 1983, the Hawke Labor government inherited a Commonwealth government debt of $9 billion or six per cent of GDP. That is very high, isn't it? It was very high.In March 1996 - and I ask you to bear in mind that figure of $9 billion or six per cent of GDP - after 13 years of Labor government, our government came to office inheriting a Commonwealth government debt of $96 billion or 20 per cent of GDP. The two years in which the Commonwealth government was at its profligate worst, it built up $23 billion. We have to bear in mind that the total debt when the Hawke government came to power was $9 billion. So, from Federation to 1983, the Commonwealth government had racked up $9 billion of debt. In the last two years of Keating government, the Labor Party racked up $23 billion. Who was the finance minister?The government has put Australia on this path. We have put Australia on a path, from our election in 1996 to the year 2001, to get Australia's general government debt down from $96 billion to $63 billion. If Mr Beazley had continued on his budget path, in the year 2001 it would have been $115 billion - $50 billion more. With the privatisation of Telstra, this government has the opportunity to repay down another $40 billion of debt and to return Australia's debt position to where it was before the Hawke-Keating Labor government came to office. We have this one-off opportunity by selling Telstra and paying down another $40 billion of debt to undo the damage of the Beazley Labor years. Wouldn't that be a great thing for future Australians? Future Australians would know that their taxes would go on their bridges and roads and hospitals and schools rather than servicing the debts of the Beazley-Keating Labor failure years. It would give future Australians the opportunity to break free from the shackles of debt, to get government debt down to $25 billion, back to five per cent of GDP - a historic opportunity.The only thing we would say about this, Mr Speaker, is as follows: if you were part of the problem, you would want to be part of the solution, wouldn't you? If you had been part of shackling Australia with that debt, where we have the one great means possible of bringing it back you would want to be supporting the government in bringing that debt down. It would be, I would think, thoroughly irrational to actually create the problem and then try to prevent the mechanism from curing it. That would be utterly irresponsible and utterly irrational. We say to the Leader of the Opposition this: it is not too late to join the government in this great historic cause. Why don't you get on board, and why don't you support a future for young Australians?</DOC>

 - As I have constantly mentioned, we are going to announce our package of tax reform measures -  - I will tell you this: we will release it long before you ever release a policy. - `Oooh!' says Simon. He is rather worried by that. One of my colleagues has sent me a note saying we will reveal details on tax reform well before the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ever apologises. Not true!We believe in reforming the Australian taxation system. What it is going to involve is this: it is going to involve in relation to indirect taxes a broad base and low rates; and,  in relation to income taxes, opportunities for home buyers and wage and salary earners. For business it is going to mean an opportunity to make Australia internationally competitive.When tax reform is debated at the election there will be one party in favour of reform and one against it; there will be one party that believes in creating opportunities for young Australians and one against it; there will be one party that wants to make a better tax system and one party committed to preserving the current unfair, unjust tax system - and that is the party of reaction: the Australian Labor Party.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Fadden for his question. The government is improving free employment services for all job seekers. From 1 May the Job Network will come into existence, offering greatly improved chances to unemployed people to get a real job. That simply confirms that this government is one of the great reforming governments that this country has had and there is not a single constructive policy idea on the other side of the House.After question time yesterday the member for Batman rushed out of the House to issue a media release which shows that the member for Batman is reliable on two counts: he always gets it wrong, and he is increasingly embarrassing to his own side of politics. First of all, what he claimed in this press release was there would not be free employment services available to unemployed people. In fact, there will be improved free employment services available for unemployed people. Secondly, he released a commercial-in-confidence document from the CES indicating that the CES would be charging fees to employers for certain extra services. He said that this  was a terrible thing and that this was happening showed how shocking the government was.Once again, the member for Batman failed to do his research, he failed to check the facts. Members of this House may be asking themselves when this terrible policy was introduced. It was introduced in 1989 by the previous Labor government. It was the very policy that was in force when the Leader of the Opposition was the employment minister. It was the very policy in force when Simon Crean was the employment minister.The member for Batman has done it again. It is another shiny plaque up there on the wall. It is another policy unveiled by Labor that he does not like. What he is showing is that Labor is not even satisfied with the policies it took to the election in 1996; it wants to go back, right back into the past. That is not surprising because the member for Batman is an ex-leader of the ACTU. There is a very good quote that I read the other day that applies to this very problem and explains why it occurs. This is worth listening to; it is a very thoughtful quote:Whereas in its origins unionism was a force for economic change and progress, it has now fallen into the habit of opposing change in its contribution to most issues. - It is a very accurate statement. It goes on:In Australia there is little evidence to suggest that the leadership of the union movement - that would be the member for Batman and the member for Hotham - has adapted successfully to the demands of the new economy. - Who said this? It was Mark Latham, the member for Werriwa. He went on to say that `this narrow base of unionism, which the Labor Party relies on, is threatening the relevance of the Labor Party and its very survival. And he is right again. He is out to get the policy dinosaurs up here, the Creanosaurus and the Ferguraptor. They are all here; they are prowling around. He has got his gun out to get these policy dinosaurs.  Who is launching this wonderful book tomorrow? It is the Leader of the Opposition. And who is he going to support? Is he going to be supporting the member for Werriwa or is he going to be supporting the member for Batman? It is a difficult choice to make - and he will not make a choice because he is weak, because he cannot, because his party is coming to pieces behind him on his front bench and he cannot take a single action to bring that party together. - He is leading the party into irrelevance. - Yes.</DOC>

 - The abolition of that bounty was a budget cabinet decision. It is one of the decisions which contributed to making Australia now the economic strongman of the Asia-Pacific region. I appreciate the fact that the member for Hotham has asked me about the 1996 budget because the 1996 budget was the first budget with which we addressed Mr Beazley's $10.5 billion deficit. - They are not up in arms about the fact that once more this country is heading back into the black; the Australian people are not up in arms about the fact that we have a government that is prepared to reduce debt; the Australian people are not up in arms about the fact that, in the two years that my government has been in power, we have delivered the lowest housing interest rates for more than 30 years; the small businessmen and women of Gilmore are not up in arms about the fact that, as a result of my government's policies, small business overdraft rates are now heading to their lowest levels for over 30 years; they are not up in arms about the fact that in 1990 overdraft rates for small business went to 20½ per cent under the Beazley-Keating government - they are now heading to levels of 7.2 per cent;  they are not up in arms about the capital gains tax rollover relief that we provided. - The reality is that the decisions that were taken by my government in the 1996 budget have laid the foundation for this country having the strongest economic fundamentals for more than a quarter of a century. Those decisions have meant that my government has been able to give Australia the economic leadership to withstand the economic turmoil of the Asia-Pacific region. My government's policies have meant that, far from Australia being in a mendicant, pleading position in the Asia-Pacific region, Australia - along with Japan - has been one of only two countries that has been strong enough and committed enough to participate in the three IMF bailouts of Korea, Thailand and Indonesia.I am proud of the economic decisions that my government has taken. I am proud of the 1996 budget because that 1996 budget laid the foundations for that great economic strength that is now working to the benefit of the men and women of Australia. Those opposite can cavil. Those opposite created the horrendous debt problem that we inherited. They not only created the problem but did their level best to my government curing the problem. I am glad to say that my government has had the courage to tackle the problem, and I have little doubt that all the muckraking and carping of the opposition will not disguise the fact that the Australian people are grateful that they now have a government that has been prepared to address the economic foundations of Australia and to give us the strongest economic fundamentals for more than 25 years. I welcome questions about the 1996 budget from the member for Hotham.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Dunkley for giving me an opportunity to speak about some aspects of the skilled migration program. I think it is very important to recognise that each year we have a large number of departures from Australia - something of the order of 30,000 people - and 66 per cent of those in the work force who leave Australia were highly skilled. If you look at the skills transfer out of Australia, particularly well-trained young Australians  able to work in the global economy, it is obviously a significant deficit.We endeavour to make up for that in a number of ways, particularly through the training programs that we have in place and which my colleague the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs frequently speaks about in this place. But we also know that there are lags in relation to that, and research has shown that skilled migrants do have a very positive impact upon the economy, the budget and government finances. We know that independent migrants achieve unemployment rates close to the Australian average around about 18 months after arrival in Australia. Of course, these are the very reasons we have moved to shift the balance in the program so that skilled migration is 50 per cent, and that has led to a reduction in the family reunion program, where primarily unskilled entrants are entering Australia. It is also the reason that we raised the skill, age and English language requirements for such migrants. These are the attributes that ensure the employability of independent migrants.The honourable member asks me about comments on these matters. Let me say that there have been a number of comments over time in relation to the importance of skilled migration. I note particularly the comments of three Labor ministers for immigration. Senator Ray had this to say:These economic migrants, through skills, capital and expertise they bring, actually create more jobs than they take and make a very positive contribution to the economic development . . . Gerry Hand, when he was minister, said:The points test is designed to enable us to choose young, highly skilled migrants capable of making immediate contributions to Australia's economy after arrival.Senator Bolkus said:A greater focus on independent migrants would contribute to Australia's skill and resource base.I would like to contrast that with the comments we hear from scaremongers like the honourable member for Batman, who happens to say that skilled workers coming from overseas take jobs that ought to be filled by Australians. Of course, he is the one who  wants to cut back skilled migration so that we can bring in unskilled migrants with high welfare dependency and little chance of getting a job. I think it also ought to be contrasted with the comments of the honourable member for Werriwa, the young and the restless. - You might like to hear them. The honourable member for Werriwa has this to say, and I think it is very pertinent to be able to focus on those comments:The primary test for migration entry needs to be cast around the knowledge based skills of prospective residents. Australia's recent experience, particularly through the large family reunion program of the 1980s, has shown that poorly skilled migrants are unlikely to avoid the problems of economic exclusion and welfare dependency.I could not have said it better myself. He went on to say:Migration policies such as these, which perversely enough in the public arena are often cast in the name of social justice, simply add to the extent of the underclass neighbourhoods in Australia's major cities. In the new labour market there are virtually no jobs available for unskilled migrants.He went on to say:The ALP needs to fundamentally alter its thinking on immigration.I have to say, in relation to those comments from the honourable member for Werriwa, amen.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Page for his question. The origins of this waterfront dispute lie in the inefficiencies, the lack of productivity and the lack of reliability on the Australian waterfront. They lie in the  consistent refusal of the MUA to acknowledge the need for competition and the right of other businesses to establish businesses on the waterfront and provide a more efficient service. They also lie in the view of the MUA that they are entitled to a monopoly on the Australian waterfront, to featherbed and protect their own members at the expense of the rest of the Australian community.As an example of this, in the management of most Australian businesses - in fact, I would say, virtually any Australian business - the proprietors would be entitled to contract out some aspects of their business. For example, in the parliament here, cleaning services can be contracted out. In many businesses, if you need an information technology expert, you might contract information type technology skills into the business.On the Australian waterfront, the managers of those business have been barred by the MUA from bringing in contractors so that they can make more efficient their operations. For example, the Patrick company at its Webb Dock facility has been forced by the union to use MUA labour for the maintenance of their equipment at Webb Dock. Of course, since the farmers have taken over, they have been able to exercise the right that any other company would have, that is, to be able to contract out maintenance of their equipment at Webb Dock.It is very interesting to see the difference in the costs between Patrick's operation for maintenance run by the MUA, which was up to $3 million a year, and the same work contracted out, which the farmers have been able to achieve for $400,000 a year - a saving in the order of $2½ million a year. And who is paying for that? It is the average consumer. We are losing jobs in Australia because of the inefficiency of that particular operation. It is  these sorts of practices on the Australian waterfront - being run by the MUA just to prop up its monopoly - which is really what this dispute is all about.I conclude by saying that I was very interested in some remarks this morning about the prospects of change on the Australian waterfront. On radio this morning, the Leader of the Opposition said, `Peter Reith is going to come out with some magnificent figures when we have reformed the waterfront.' I hope that his prediction is right - that, when we have significant reform, we will see a very big jump in productivity numbers.I was also very taken by the remarks of the Leader of the Opposition because normally what the opposition say is that, if they had won the 1996 election, in their 14th year they would have fixed it up. That is their normal line. But today we have a variation on this. The variation on this is that in October last year the opposition was on the cusp of fixing the waterfront. The Leader of the Opposition made this incredible statement on radio this morning. He said:Look you know, our spokesman on Transport, Lindsay Tanner, came to me last October and said, `Look, we've been sitting down and talking to the Maritime Union. We think that they are going to arrive at agreements which gives the container rates that everyone has been demanding of them through the enterprise arrangements over the course of the next six months.They did nothing for years; in fact, if you back to the WIRA process, they spent $430 million and got nothing for it in terms of productivity. And now he is making the ridiculous claim that they nearly fixed it from opposition only last October. This Leader of the Opposition is the most pathetic, the most weak and the most absurd Leader of the Opposition that we have had postwar. He deserves his fate. He is bound hand and foot to the MUA.</DOC>

 - I did table that graph, and I might just show my colleagues how it keeps going up, and the important thing is that it keeps going up again. From 1996-97 and 1997-98, it actually goes up quite sharply. The reality is that my government has made a funding offer to the states.The member for Dobell asked me a question about the respective performances of the Labor Commonwealth government, of which he was a member, and my government. I am very pleased that the member for Dobell was able to ask me that because, under the Beazley forward estimates in relation to hospitals, in the five-year agreement that we have offered the states the Commonwealth would have spent $27.3 billion. What we are proposing to spend is $30.3 billion. In other words, the government that is being accused of cutting money is in fact the government that is proposing to spend $2.9 billion more than what the opposition on its own figures would have spent if it had continued in government. If the Labor Party had been returned, in its now quite famous 14th year it would have proposed a hospital arrangement that was far less generous than the one that has been proposed by my government.The truth of the matter is that, under my government, the hospital agreement offered to the states is a fair one. It is a generous one. It is a reasonable one. It is $2.9 billion more than the Labor Party would have offered. It represents a three per cent real increase every year for a period of five years. It is an offer that remains on the table. We will meet it in  full, without deduction, on time, to the full and last dollar, and I think it is an offer that the states should accept.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Stirling for his question. Indeed, I have seen reports about relevant funding levels for aged care and disability services and, as I stated in a statement on 2 April, they are absolutely incorrect. I might start by responding to the member for Stirling about the issue of disability funding, because he, along with several other members representing Western Australia - and indeed members from both sides of the House - have approached me in relation to the disability issue, particularly with regard to the Commonwealth-state disability agreement and the offer that I made to the states recently on behalf of the government.The first thing that should be understood is that the cost of providing disability services across the nation is shared between the states and the Commonwealth - 80 per cent by the states and 20 per cent by the Commonwealth. The offer that I made on behalf of the government was a substantial one, and it saw a five per cent increase, on average, across each year of the proposed five-year agreement. I am pleased to say that Western Australia, which was a vociferous critic of the earlier proposals, signed the agreement yesterday, and other states and territories look as though they will sign; indeed, one other has already signed and the others will sign.The reason that they are signing is that they recognise that the establishment of a new maintenance level to address the issue of disability services is absolutely vital in this country. Comparing the level of outlays under Labor as against the new agreement, the  outlays in accommodation and employment services have actually gone up, as I detailed in that 2 April press release. The amount in 1995-96 under the Labor government was $507 million; what is proposed in the 1997-98 period is $556 million, an increase of 9.7 per cent. Graphically, it looks like this. This graph shows you what we have done, and we are talking about actual outlays. We are not trying to play games with forward estimates, as the shadow spokesman for the Labor Party is trying to do. We are talking about actual outlays; we are talking about a consistent effort in the very key area of disability services.As I said in the House late last week, the additional support provided in the ground-breaking staying at home package sees an additional $15 million focused upon the needs of elderly Australians who are caring for mature-aged children with disabilities. That has also been recognised by the states as being essential and, in totality with the earlier offer that I made, has led to the view that the states and the territories will sign. I am also hopeful that New South Wales will participate in a constructive way in making sure that the whole nation addresses needs for disability services in a purposeful manner over the next five years.I might also mention the other point that the honourable member made about aged care and the actual levels of outlays in this particular program. It should be understood that the level of outlays for residential care for the 137,000-odd Australians who are in nursing homes and hostels is about $2.7 billion in the 1997-98 period. That is an increase of 14.4 per cent on what the Labor Party provided in 1995-96.The next area of effort from the Commonwealth is the home and community care program, which has been in place for some considerable time and is also a shared program with the states. Just short of $1 billion under the five-year agreement between the states and the Commonwealth is provided for home and community care. The outlay that we are making in 1997-98 is $476 million, which is an increase of 12.5 per cent on what Labor outlaid in 1995-96. That does not take  into account the third level of effort that we are making in a direct payment, and that is the staying at home package, which is a $270 million effort over four years to address the fundamental needs of older Australians.When you look at those figures, this is what it looks like in graph form. This is our effort. - These press releases coming from the Labor Party are playing games with figures, they are playing games with people's lives, they are politically inspired and they are not addressing need. We are addressing need. I know you don't want to hear - you were the finance minister! That was your effort. - That is what the Labor Party did. You took it backwards! You have done nothing, you don't care, and you are just politically inspired.</DOC>

 - The Leader of the Opposition asked me how much I am going to spend on it. Perhaps I can answer that by saying Bill Hunter. Everybody around this building will know exactly what I mean when I say Bill Hunter. For the Leader of the Opposition to have the nerve to ask me about legitimate expenditure of government money on explaining a new program after he ran Bill Hunter like crazy before the last election - you have to be joking! - </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Groom for his question and his continuing interest in foreign affairs matters broadly and the very difficult and fraught issue of conflict on Bougainville. I think this government could go so far as saying that it is justifiably proud of the role that it has played in trying to bring peace to Bougainville. If it had not been for the extensive and enthusiastic work done by the Australian government, I do not think we would be as far down the track towards peace on Bougainville as we are. Of course, it would not be appropriate to indulge in too much triumphalism about this because there is a long way to go yet. I know that the negotiations are going to continue to be difficult. It is really a matter that is going to require a great deal of patience and careful consideration.The honourable member for Groom might be interested to know that yesterday I had the opportunity, as did my colleague the Minister for Defence, to meet with the Papua New Guinea foreign minister, Mr Roy Yaki. Our discussions were wide ranging, but in particular it was an opportunity to talk about the situation in Bougainville.Mr Yaki made a personal visit to Australia in order to convey an invitation from Prime Minister Bill Skate to our own Prime Minister inviting Australia to participate in what is to be called the peace monitoring group for Bougainville. It is going to replace the truce monitoring group after the cease-fire signing at the end of this month. While some of the details of the peace monitoring group have yet to be worked out, let me say that the Australian government in principle would be very happy to participate in the peace monitoring group.Mr Yaki and I both agreed during our discussions yesterday that tremendous progress had been achieved so far on Bougainville since the first tentative steps began in Honiara in June of last year. The cease-fire arrangement is almost certainly going to be signed in Arawa on Bougainville towards the end of this month. The final date is yet to be determined, but it certainly will be before the end of this month. I very much hope to be present for the signing, given the role that Australia has played in helping to facilitate this whole process.I know the member for Groom will also be interested to know that the Australian government is very much of the view that the people of Bougainville must receive a peace dividend out of these peace negotiations. If they receive a peace dividend, they will understand only too well the clear benefits of peace over the conflict that has besieged the island over the last 10 years.We as a government have made a commitment of $130 million to the reconstruction and rehabilitation of Bougainville. This peace dividend is being delivered through the Bougainville rehabilitation project, and it is helping to return life to normal through the construction of schools, health posts, roads and bridges. Australia is also planning to  assist with the restoration of civil authority on Bougainville, particularly through the establishment of an auxiliary police force and strengthening of a village court system. That is a very important step in the peace process.I know all members of the House will welcome the role that the Australian government has been playing in this. As I said at the beginning, it is going to be a difficult path ahead. We have no illusions about that. We have no illusions about the risks involved in this peace process. We have an obligation to give facilitation of peace on Bougainville a very high priority, and I am glad that we are doing it.</DOC>

 - It is very nice to get a question from the shadow minister for health. It is obviously Tuesday; it is his day to ask a question. -  - I will answer them when I am given them, but the only way I can get a question in this place is to get my own side to ask me one. I have here a copy of my press release of the time, which, in fact, does not say at all that the flu vaccine would be free. It says that the flu vaccine is subsidised by the government. I am happy to table that. I was asked by a Victorian media outlet what the situation was for the purposes of Victoria, and in Victoria it was free, so I answered correctly. What you are doing is being a little pedant. For a person who confused a cholesterol lowering drug with a sugar pill, I would not be too proud of yourself.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Mallee for his question. I particularly acknowledge his untiring efforts on behalf of citrus growers and other producers in his own electorate who have been concerned for some time about Brazilian concentrate being converted into citrus juice in Australia and then being labelled `Made in Australia'.The good news for the honourable member for Mallee - indeed, for the whole parliament - is that tomorrow I will be introducing legislation into this place to institute honesty and a genuine level of understanding of what is meant by `country of origin labelling claims' in this country. I think all Australians - all consumers, all manufacturers, all producers - will be grateful to have this matter once and for all resolved.Under the arrangements that will be introduced in the legislation tomorrow, the description `Made in Australia' will be restricted to items that are substantially transformed in this country; they are made into a significantly different product here, and the majority of their cost of production is incurred in this country. The description `product of Australia' will be reserved for items that are 100 per cent Australian, or as near to it as possible. These two descriptions, these amendments to the Trade Practices Act, will sweep away the confusion that has been built up by misleading practices, by a range of confusing court decisions that have left manufacturers uncertain as to what descriptions they can use, and consumers not confident that when they buy something claiming to be Australian it is indeed Australian. - I take the interjection from the member for Brisbane, because one of the other major benefits from this legislation will be to reinvigorate the `Australian made' logo. The green and gold  kangaroos `Australian made' logo will again have the protection that it will need. That logo will be revitalised so that industry will be able to use it with the knowledge that it will not be subject to legal challenge and goods they claim to be `Australian made' are indeed products of this country.We have waited a long time. The opposition have been very noisy about this; they have given plenty of advice from the sidelines. Now they will have their opportunity to support this legislation which, once and for all, will sweep away the nonsense of Brazilian concentrate being called Australian citrus juice, or Canadian pork being called Australian ham. It will allow Holden cars to be called Australian; it will allow Australian peanut butter and Australian fruit from the honourable member's electorate to be called Australian. But it will not allow the cheating and the practices that have been going on for years to continue.</DOC>

 - It is hard to believe that they are still prepared to put him up here; after the literary comet strike from the member for Werriwa the other day, some of the dinosaurs are still prowling around.The question that the member for Batman asked was, in fact, comprehensively answered some months ago now by the Prime Minister when he tabled the press release from Employment National. If the member for Batman was as keen in doing research as is the member for Werriwa, he would undoubtedly have realised that this information is already public information. Employment National has said that it will pursue a non-discriminatory charging policy. It is a commercial operation; it is entitled to pursue commercial policies. It will charge employers on a non-discriminatory basis, whether or not that person is on unemployment benefits.Let me make it absolutely clear that the contracts which the government has written with all the members of the Job Network prohibit members of the Job Network from charging fees to any eligible job seeker; that the only fees that are available to be charged are fees to employers. That was, of course, the policy established by the previous government for the CES. It was the policy pursued by the Leader of the Opposition. It was the policy pursued by the member for Hotham. It is the policy -  - What! You introduced it and you dropped it? -  - The member for Hotham has just admitted that their policy for the CES was a total failure. They are going from bad to worse. A journalist came into my office today and said, about the member for Batman, `Look, which side is he on; which side of the parliament is he on?' Every time he asks something, he is a crashing embarrassment to the Labor Party - and the member for Hotham, out of sheer loyalty, has just joined him in being an embarrassment to the Labor Party -   - by now denouncing the policy of the Labor Party. Mr Speaker, they are very sensitive on this point. - Yes, Mr Speaker. This government is one of the great reforming governments that this country has had. We are determined to improve services to unemployed people. Our obligation is to help all the people who were abandoned by the Labor Party when they were in government.It was the Labor Party that pushed unemployment up to over a million. It is this government that has got unemployment down to its lowest level for seven years. We now have fewer teenagers looking for full-time work than at any time in the last eight years. You would think every person in this House would be delighted to hear that news. It is only those grim, unsmiling faces on the other side of the House that tell you that the Labor Party -  - has run out of ideas. - All that is left is the Creanasauras, the Ferguraptor and the author of the literary comet strike of the century, who is determined to get rid of them once and for all.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I know that it is of  real concern not just to the member for Eden Monaro - anyone who has been in this area recently will know just how terrible the country looks - but also to people right across southern and eastern Australia as very real drought appears to be descending yet again. Many farmers could and would be excused for feeling pretty demoralised at the moment. We have a real impact on many commodity prices arising out of what is happening in Asia and now, unfortunately, it looks as though a very real drought situation is appearing again.Unfortunately, it also has to be said that a somewhat less than accurate article in today's Daily Telegraph would leave farmers even more demoralised because it implies that they are left without aid. That is the intent of the headline. I want to say that the article is quite simply wrong so far as the Commonwealth government is concerned. The fact of the matter is that for exceptional circumstances the government not only maintains substantial business and income support but also has ensured that under revised guidelines more people receive more assistance than were ever able to under guidelines that applied before we came into government. In fact, since we came to power, something now approaching $300 million over and above what was on the forward estimates two years ago has been provided -  - for business and family income support under the drought exceptional circumstances arrangements. - It is an interesting indication of how much concern is felt for rural people by those opposite, is it not? -  - The member for Hunter purports to be interested in the fortunes of rural people. His area is drought affected and he does not want to hear the answer. He does not want the record set straight so that far  mers know what they are entitled to. There is the mark of your concern for rural people. May it be well recorded in the seat of Hunter that you do not give a damn about them.The fact of the matter is that we have doubled the recovery period for people in drought exceptional circumstances. Not only that; it is fair to point out that there are many now receiving drought exceptional circumstances. In fact, on the very page of the Telegraph that featured this article there was a farmer from the region of the member who asked the question who is in an area now where farmers can access assistance, the very lie given to the headlines in the paper.Over and above drought exceptional circumstances we have provided a range of assistance measures under the Agriculture Advancing Australia program - for example, recognising that tragically some farming families have been so badly damaged by drought in recent years that they need ongoing help, and they can have it under the farm family restart program. This has never been made available before - a very substantial package. There are already about 500 to 600 farmers on it. It has only been going for a couple of months.Regrettably, a spokesman for the New South Wales Farmers Association in the article is quoted as referring to a 1992 agreement and indicates that the Commonwealth has not delivered. We have delivered. We have delivered in spadefuls on all of the things that they said they wanted: tax changes in the farm management deposits, exceptional circumstances arrangements. We have doubled landcare. We have added Agriculture Advancing Australia. Here is the opposition spokesman. Why does he not go out there and reassure farmers that he is committed to waterfront reform - something every farmer I have met wants, and you will not confirm your support for it. That is just one instance of your lack of concern.It is important to note that we have delivered and that the remarks of the New South Wales farmers spokesman, unfortunately, appear to allow the Carr government off the hook. It implies that it was legitimate for them to withdraw support for farmers. We do  not disagree with the policy thrust of what they did, but for the New South Wales Government to pull the pin on the modest drought support that it has been delivering in the face of a very severe drought again confirms farmers' decisions about that state government. The bottom line is that Mr Amery, the New South Wales minister, ought to go back to the New South Wales Premier and tell him to reverse his decision. Because what they have done shows, firstly, how much the New South Wales government does not care about farmers and, secondly, contrasts in a very real way with a very substantial policy approach that we have adopted. - Let me close by saying that it is my sincere hope that the Telegraph  tomorrow -  - I hope the Telegraph  tomorrow will seek to publish an accurate story on what this government has delivered for farmers in and out of drought. It will make a much longer story than the one we got today.</DOC>

 - My government will behave within the law, as always, on any matter. Let me say that these events on the waterfront are a defining moment in Australia's industrial relations history. These events on the Australian waterfront will send a very clear message to the people of Australia that, at long last, we have a government that is prepared to stand up for the interests of Australian jobs, prepared to stand up for the interests of Australian exporters, prepared to say to those men and women in business in Australia -  -  - The Leader of the Opposition will resume his place. The Prime Minister is being entirely relevant in his answer. - There are going to be a lot of home truths on this issue before you have heard the end of it. - The honourable member for Hotham will withdraw that remark - fraud. - The honourable member will withdraw that remark. - The member for Prospect has already been warned.</DOC>

 - I say in reply to the honourable member that waterfront reform will boost jobs, will boost investment and will boost exports for all Australians. The current inefficiency on the Australian waterfront has damaged Australia's reputation in the world. Australia could move 25 containers an hour like New Zealand but we are stuck at a rate of 18 versus a rate of 30 an hour in the nations of the Asia-Pacific region.We are not dealing here with the battlers of the Australian work force. We are dealing here with a group of people who, by any measure, are extremely well paid. They are a group of people who are the industrial relations elite and the circumstances in which they now find themselves are a direct result of their own irresponsible conduct because for years and years people have tried and governments have tried to deliver a more competitive and a more productive waterfront. The Labor Party, bound to the MUA, have stood in the way of that. Instead of the Leader of the Opposition and the Labor Party saying to the members of the Maritime Union of Australia, `Why don't you behave responsibly? Why don't you get rid of your stupid, anti-productive, anti-competitive work practices,' you have actually encouraged them along a path of conduct that has not only been against the interests of the Australian community but has also been against their own interests.You are dealing here with people who earn, on average, $74,000 a year and as high as $110,000 and $120,000 a year. I am very proud to say that the actions that have been taken to fix the waterfront are a direct result of the changes to the law made by my government. I am very proud of the changes and I want to take this opportunity of congratulating the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business on the absolutely outstanding job he has done to reform Australia's old-fashioned, out-of-date, arthritic industrial relations system.The Maritime Union of Australia is the most special of special interest groups. It is a special interest group to which the Leader of the Opposition has again pledged his total, undying support. The Leader of the Opposition and John Coombs are the inseparable twins of the trade union movement in Australia. Whenever the Leader of the Opposition asks me a question the Australian people will know that he is the dummy of John Coombs of the Maritime Union of Australia. Kim Beazley is the mouthpiece of John Coombs. -  - Honourable members will remain silent - on both sides. - You talk about taxpayers' money. The former government, of which the Leader of the Opposition was a senior member, spent over $170 million of taxpayers' money out of $430 million that was spent under the WIRA arrangements. Wharfies' rorts are legend in this country. Today represents a fight back by the people of Australia. Today represents a defining moment in Australia's industrial relations history. Today is the time when the ordinary exporters, the ordinary job seekers and the ordinary investors of Australia have at long last, as a result of the action of my government, the courage of the National Farmers Federation and the courage of Patricks, been given a fair go and an opportunity for a more productive and a more competitive future.</DOC>

It is a wonderful law and it is a law -  -  - We have changed the law. The changes we have made are beneficial to the Australian community. I have always  supported the right of Australian companies to take action in accordance with the law and if you have a problem about the law then you try to change it when you are next in government.</DOC>

 - The government's response to such threats is the law which was passed with the support of the Senate - and with the support of Cheryl Kernot, a leading member of the Labor Party. We support the Trade Practices Act and the full implementation of it. But for the Trade Practices Act a lot of these union leaders who have been making threats in the past would have actually carried out those threats. Whose policy is it to repeal the Trade Practices Act and give a free rein to industrial thuggery? It is none other than the Labor Party weakly doing as they are told by the ACTU.The AWU made their threats last week and the response from the union movement was very telling indeed. Within 24 hours of the threat of national industrial action by the AWU even the ACTU itself was counselling the AWU not to take national industrial action. Why was that? It was because we, with your opposition, passed the very strong secondary boycott and primary boycott prohibitions in the Trade Practices Act. It is true that a few building workers have walked off the site today but, quite frankly, they walk off the site most weeks. -  - Also revealing were the first comments from the ACTU as reported on the electronic media this morning. They came from Mr Combet, the Assistant Secretary in  charge of this issue for the ACTU. His first comment was that the dispute will not spread. The second comment came from Jennie George this morning, also on radio, and she assured the Australian public that consumers would not be affected by industrial action. The reason for that, again, is that we have the Trade Practices Act provisions which were passed into federal law - opposed by the Labor Party; to be repealed by the Labor Party if they are ever re-elected. Those laws are strong and effective. There is no basis for anybody to be taking further industrial action. There is no justification for further industrial action. As the Supreme Court judge said very early in this dispute, the damage that occurred at the hands of the MUA was alarming and unjustified. And so it is. Further action would be unjustified.From the government's perspective we have legal teams in place. We are determined to see significant reform on the Australian waterfront. We are determined to see this matter through.</DOC>

 - I've sacked them? - For the benefit of the member who asked me this question, let us patiently take him through it. The law was changed to make it possible in Australia at long last, after years of frustration and years of failure by the former government, after years of weakness and stupidity from the  former government and after years of wasting the taxpayers' money, for non-union labour to be used on the Australian waterfront. If there is a group of people who are responsible for the situation in which the unionists now find themselves today it is they themselves who are to blame. It is they themselves who rejected, year after year, reasonable overtures. It is they themselves who have brought this situation upon themselves. - The members of the MUA have been running a systematic campaign to break Patrick, and you know it. They have been running it for weeks and months. The difference is that whereas in the past when you were in government - when Bob Hawke was the Prime Minister of Australia, when Paul Keating was the Prime Minister of Australia, when Kim Beazley was a senior minister in the government of Australia -  - I do not think I have mentioned pilots but, don't worry, I will. I'll mention pilots and I'll mention how your leader boasted about using foreigners to break the pilots strike. -  - I will remind you about how your leader and his then deputy leader boasted about using the armed forces of  Australia to break the pilots of Australia. We will get to that in due course. - Let me say again, for the benefit of all members of the House, that the members of the MUA are in the situation they are in today because of their own conduct. If they had behaved reasonably, they would not be where they are today. -  - If they had not set out with your help, with your encouragement, with your exhortations -  -  - to try and break Patrick, if they had decided to abandon their restrictive work practices, if years ago they had recognised that no group in the Australian community can possibly be entitled to this sort of privileged treatment, unhindered and unharmed, for years into the future, if they had not set out to destroy Patrick, they would not be in the predicament they are in today. - They are responsible for their own predicament. - They are to blame because if they had behaved sensibly and if they had recognised that no group in the community is entitled to immunity in this competitive era, if they had accepted the responsibility and if they had accepted the business circumstances of other businessmen and business women in the Australian community, they would not be where they are now. The Leader of the Opposition and others can ask as many questions as they choose. - Very good! Nothing will alter the fact that the members of the MUA have created their own predicament. That has not been generated by anybody else. Their own conduct is the reason why they are in the situation that they are at present. I can only say again that I am very proud to lead a government which has changed the law to give Australia the hope, years and years afterwards, of a competitive and productive waterfront that will generate thousands of jobs and will promote the export interests of the entire Australian nation.</DOC>

 - Certainly, Mr Speaker, and just to inform you and also the member, as Treasurer I am responsible for the competition provisions of the Trade Practices Act, including the secondary boycott provisions, and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, responsible for enforcing secondary boycott provisions. The secondary boycott provisions were first introduced into the Trade Practices Act in 1974 by the then Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs, the Hon. John Howard. That was some 25 years ago when the then Fraser government was leading in the area of competition, and it was not until the late 1980s and 1990s, during the dark years of the Hawke government, that the provisions were actually taken out of the Trade Practices Act. One of the great achievements of this government was to put back into the act the provisions preventing secondary boycotts, and I want to pay credit to the minister for industrial relations, Mr Reith, who presided over the amendments that brought back those important reforms -  - That brought back the Howard law of all those years ago. He couldn't do it on his own, could he? He would be the first to acknowledge that he was assisted in that task by Mrs Cheryl Kernot, of the Labor Party, in bringing back those secondary boycott provisions. We would like to thank Mrs Cheryl Kernot for the services that she has provided in bringing those secondary boycott provisions back.A secondary boycott provision provides that no person can extend a dispute between the primary employer and employee into other industries. The Trade Practices Act is monitored by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, for which the Treasurer is responsible, and it has a watching brief over the waterfront industrial situation at the moment, including any activities which could be taken to extend this dispute into other industries.The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission warned the Australian Workers Union last week, in response to threats to shut down Australia's oil industry in support of the maritime union, that it would be taking action if the AWU breached the act. Fines for breaching the secondary boycott provisions of the act are $750,000, and in addition a person in breach of the act can also be responsible for damages.In 1995 the Industry Commission, in its report The growth and revenue implications of Hilmer and related reforms, estimated that benchmarking Australian ports to Australian best practice would generate an increase in GDP of about $1 billion. That report was in fact welcomed by some of the thinkers in the parliament. When the Industry Commission report came down assessing the benefits of competition policy and saying, inter alia, that it would add $1 billion to GDP in Australia, it was warmly welcomed by none other than the member for Werriwa. The member for Werriwa, the thinker of the Labor Party, got up in the adjournment debate on that very report and said this:I am the strongest possible advocate of the introduction of competition policies throughout the Australian economy. You can therefore imagine my pleasure this morning to read in the Australian  the  findings of the draft Industry Commission report on the benefits of the introduction of Hilmer reforms.So the thinker of the Labor Party endorsed the benefits of competition which will come about as a result of getting improved performance on the waterfront. The Centre for International Economics in 1995 estimated that a 10 per cent increase in productivity of the sea transport services sector would increase real GDP by about $1 billion. Wouldn't that be a great thing for the country?One of the great things about reforming the ports and wharves in this country, about increasing competition, will be adding to national wealth, adding to job creation, adding to exports, adding to the opportunity to get foreign debt under control and adding to the improvements in the Australian economy. The government congratulates those who have taken steps to achieve best practice on the waterfront. Back in 1991 the then minister for - I do not know what he was minister for - Mr Beazley was boasting about the need for waterfront reform. - The current Leader of the Opposition, I think then the employment minister, said this:If we can change industrial relations on the waterfront, it ain't too hard for you to get rid of feral pigs. Back to the feral pigs, old son - the waterfront has been fixed.That is what he said in 1992. In 1992 the waterfront had not been fixed. The waterfront will be fixed as a result of this government's action, and that will be in Australia's interests.</DOC>

 - The member who has just asked the question knows as well as I do that the members of the MUA have embarked upon a systematic campaign to send the company Patricks into bankruptcy and insolvency. They have embarked upon a systematic campaign, and anybody with eyes to see or ears to listen or a mind to comprehend will have seen a pattern of disruptive, negative, destructive conduct over the past few months. I have to say to the rank and file of the MUA that you have been badly let down by your union leadership. The union bosses of Australia have once again sold out the interest of the rank and file members of the trade union movement. But even worse than that is that the conspiracy along that destructive path between the leadership of the trade union movement and the Australian Labor Party has also sold out the interests of working men and women. Once again the men and women, the ordinary trade unionists of Australia -  - There has been a clear pattern of conduct by the members of the MUA, orchestrated by the leadership of the union, inspired and encouraged at a political level by a Labor Party that cannot break itself free from the shackles of its trade union past. I have to say to those opposite that we are now living in the 1990s. We are living in an  era in which the men and women of this country want decent, competitive, productive conditions. We are living in an era when our exporters want the opportunity to compete effectively against the rest of the world. We are living in an era when we want thousands more jobs created by having lively, competitive, productive industries. What is now occurring, this historic change which is now occurring on the Australian waterfront, is good news for future jobs in this country, it is good news for exports and it is good news for the international economic reputation of Australia. The only people for whom it is bad news are the union bosses who failed their members and the members of the Labor Party who are chained hand and foot to the union bosses of Australia.</DOC>

 - The government will not put up with thuggery by industrial trade union leaders making threats from London against Australia. We will not put up with the threats of industrial thuggery from union leaders outside this country attempting to dictate to the duly elected government of the day. We have a legal team in place, the legal team has been in place in London now for some time, and we are in a position to see legal action taken both in Australia and internationally to counteract any attempt by the ITF to crystallise the threats that they have been making.I do understand the concerns of shipping companies in respect of the threats by the ITF. For that reason, I have had discussions with a number of shipping companies this  morning on this issue. We have offered to those companies the legal advice that we have available to us and we put them in contact with the government's legal advisers. We have also made it very clear to those companies that, in conjunction with those companies, or separately or otherwise, we are prepared to take legal action if there is any crystallisation of those threats by the ITF against companies which are carrying on their lawful business in trading with Australia. I am pleased to say that a number of those companies that I have spoken to have contracts with Patrick, and I have been told this morning by shipping companies that they intend to continue their commercial relationship with Patrick, and they should know and understand that this government is absolutely determined to take this opportunity for reform. We will stick by those shipping companies to ensure that the reform opportunity for this country is grasped.It is also worth noting that, whilst the ITF make threats about companies using both MUA and non-MUA labour in Australia, elsewhere around the world this is commonplace. People are so used to the monopoly of the MUA here that many do not appreciate that the idea of having MUA or non-MUA labour in Australia is what happens in virtually every other country around the world. That is why I think that, whilst we hear many threats coming from the ITF, ultimately it is unsustainable for them to pick out Australia and say that companies should not trade with Australia when those very same companies are going to ports in New Zealand and many other countries within the OECD where there is union or non-MUA labour. Lastly, I make this point: the shadow minister for transport asks, `What about some of the other ports; for example, Newcastle?' Newcastle is so bad that Patrick recently lost a contract. - Just some facts. Newcastle is so bad that Patrick recently lost a contract to load 300,000 tonnes of aluminium for a Norwegian shipowner after the shipowner repeated complaints about the conduct of Patrick's workers over a two-year period. The fact is that standards in Australian ports are abysmally low, reliability is at appallingly low levels, and it is one reason why Australia has a shocking international reputation when it comes to the efficiency of our ports. This country has been made a laughing stock by these people running the MUA, supported by the ALP, who like the idea of having a few union bosses able to hold this country to ransom whenever it suits their political ends. I can assure the Leader of the Opposition those days are over.</DOC>

 - Isn't that interesting? We had four questions from them on the waterfront and now they are off onto an unrelated matter. This is the embarrassment that the Labor Party has had through this whole dispute. So embarrassed have you been, unable to publicly get out there and -  - I will do so with real pleasure, because section 187AA of the Workplace Relations Act, which the shadow minister refers to in his question, is one of the very many good things in the Workplace Relations Act. What that section says is that you will not be rewarded for taking industrial action. When this issue arose a couple of weeks ago in Sydney, the Labor Party condemned the provisions of the act, but when I put out a press release noting the fact that it was the same law in New South Wales which had been supported by the Labor Party in New South Wales all of a sudden they went quiet. When it comes to the level of industrial disputes, one of the reasons we have on the Australian waterfront nine times the national average is that, under Labor, if you took industrial action, you could be rewarded for taking that action, and we have placed a ban on people being rewarded for taking industrial action. What happened in Sydney is also very revealing - it shows you the strength of these provisions - because when this matter first came to a head the wharfies said, `Oh well, we'll take' -  - Yes, I will. The proposition being put to me is that there is a threat of industrial action because of section 187AA. - I do not know if I have the letter or not. I have not read it. - Yes, you can send it around to me, thanks very much. As a postie, you might do better.The point I am making is that, when the wharfies went back to work after their first seven-day strike, did they continue with their overtime ban? No, they did not. And why didn't they? Because they wanted to be paid. They wanted to be paid - and section 187AA was very effective indeed. - To conclude my answer, the point I am making - which is a difficult point for the Labor Party to understand - is that there are a lot of unions that will make threats of industrial action. But what you need to have in place is effective laws. And 187AA has shown to be a very effective discouragement for those unions wanting to take industrial action - very effective in dealing with the wharfies, and just as effective in dealing with anybody else who wants to take industrial action. Under our laws, they will not be rewarded for doing so.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hinkler for his question. -  - We have a pathetic noisy opposition here today. Where were the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition last night when they should have been at the dispatch box, answering for their own good? Where were you? We know where you were at lunchtime today; you were launching a book of some kind or another. -  - Mr Speaker -  - As a matter of fact, I did not write this particular dorothy dixer, but I am very happy to answer it. -  - We know what annoys you. What really annoys you is that several hundred thousand workers voted for the coalition at the last election, many of them trade unionists. Indeed, they will do it again - and we will give them good and proper reason to do it again. We even have a trade unionist sitting in the coalition ranks: the member for Capricornia, a shop steward and proud of it - and on the coalition side. We have a task to do here. -  - Mr Speaker, I accept your guidance. I think we should look at some comparative costings with regard to the movement of containers. Let us look at the loading of timber logs, as one particular example. In Australia it costs $5.60 a tonne, with a nine-day ship turnaround. Compare that with New Zealand at $2.20 a tonne, with a four-day ship turnaround. So, if you just take that one example with regard to the timber industry, the Australian cost structure is more than twice that of New Zealand.But take the crane rates. I welcome the South African delegation in the gallery. I know that they are trying to open up the Maputo Corridor and the Mozambique outlets. I congratulate them on that because, in fact, the Port of Mozambique is performing at a better crane rate - 25 containers an hour - than the average of the ports of Australia.We have a huge task ahead to get it right on the waterfront. That we seek to do that is in the interests of the workers of Australia, the standard of living of the workers of Australia and the export performance of Australia. Professor Blainey wrote many years ago that Australia suffers from a tyranny of distance. Our exporters are particularly challenged by the fact that they are deep in the Southern Hemisphere and a lot of our competitors are in the Northern Hemisphere. The very least we can provide for them is best international practice, with regard to micro-economic reform and the waterfront.So let us give our job creating exporters a fair go. Let us give our export containers efficient cost-reduced passage through our ports - and the sooner, the better, for the sake of all Australians.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. The measures which were announced in the 1997 budget relating to dividend streaming were designed to ensure that a party would not be entitled to take the benefit of imputation credits unless they bore some of the risk. One of the measures that was put in place to ensure that you bore some of the risk was a requirement that you hold for 45 days or, alternatively to that, part 4A was amended to apply to such transactions.Part 4A in its application to the rules in relation to dividend streaming says that it can be struck down by part 4A in the event that one of its purposes was to get the advantage and that was other than an incidental purpose. The test is an objective test which would require the courts to look at all of the conduct.Those people who were holding the shares as part of either a strategy of increasing the capital value of the share as part of hedging or who had a normative purpose - including the millions of mothers and fathers in Australia who had bought them - would not I expect be caught by that test in any sense at all, because they would only be caught if it could be shown that they had come in to take advantage of dividend streaming and were not interested in a proper investment either for  other purposes such as capital increase, or for other purposes such as hedging.In those circumstances I believe that there is no real risk under the amendments to part 4A to those millions of Australians who have invested in the Telstra shares. Certainly, it is not the objective of the changes to part 4A to bring them into that net. I can give them and the member for Curtin an assurance that the application of the law will not affect the holding of what I consider to be a very good investment.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Fisher for his question and recognise his concern for Australia being successful in the so-called globalised economy. Globalisation is a theme of the member for Werriwa's well-known book which was launched today by the Leader of the Opposition.There is no doubt that Australia's notorious reputation for an inefficient waterfront is internationally known and understood, and is an international embarrassment for Australia. Quite frankly, our waterfront performance is a standing joke in countries such as New Zealand and China. If anybody ever wanted any evidence for this proposition, they only have to look at the Far Eastern Economic Review editorial of 19 February 1998. - It may be well worth the opposition listening to this, because this is a reference to the opposition as well as it is to Australia as a whole. The editorial states:In the past few years Australian officials have been fond of talking of Australia joining Asia.That proposition by the Far Eastern Economic Review  is indeed very true. But the editorial went on to say:It is becoming more clear that this might first depend on having their dock workers become part of the 20th century. The article went on to say:Certainly the MUA appears to come from a different era.Mr Speaker, if you ever wanted to know what the world thinks of Australia's waterfront, then that illustration from the Far Eastern Economic Review  is a very good one.The House would be well aware that the comparisons between Australian ports and ports around our region and the world are most unflattering. A recent international comparison showed that the port of Laem Chabang in Thailand turns around about 30 containers an hour; Hong Kong, 25 to 30; Singapore, 25 to 30; Auckland, 25; and by comparison Sydney can only manage 18 containers an hour and Melbourne 18½ containers an hour. I would have thought that any self-respecting member of this parliament would be very concerned about that, would want to see that productivity improve and not try to defend the status quo.In a recent survey of 18 international ports Sydney was ranked last, that is 18th, in reliability, 18th in turnaround speed and 17th out of 18 in terms of value for money. I am sorry to have to concede the point that my own home town's Port of Adelaide was rated 18th out of 18 in terms of worst value for money.There may be some people in the Labor Party who regard that as acceptable. They spent 13 years in government. They talked about waterfront reform, but they did not do it. Our record is still a bad record and it is embarrassing to our international reputation.I will come back to what is admittedly one of the smaller incidents of the day, the launch of the member for Werriwa's book. How nice of him to turn up just as I mentioned his book. Having finished answering questions at the press club, he now turns up to the parliament. I think it is probably what Laurie Oakes meant when he talked about you being absent without leave.The member for Werriwa talks in his book about globalisation. What he says about globalisation is absolutely right. It is all about trying to bring the Labor Party into the latter part of the 20th century. One of the points he  makes in his book which is worth reflecting on is this:This is not the time or place for the preservation of sacred cows.He may be alone on that side of the House in holding that view, but at least he understands the point about globalisation, international efficiency and modernising Australia, even if the dinosaurs here have no understanding at all.</DOC>

 - The member for Isaacs is one of the great intellectuals of the Labor Party. We would like to encourage more interjections from him. I have already indicated what the government's view is on these little trick questions. We will announce our tax policy at a time that suits us, and we will not be announcing it in question time on a Wednesday afternoon, thank you very much. I am rather amazed that the Australian Labor Party stands so squarely against tax reform and modernised tax -  - Oh, no; they are in favour of tax reform, they are just against every proposal which would accomplish it. That is their position: `We're in favour of tax reform, we just oppose any changes to the current system.' What a fraudulent position that is. - I did not say `fraud', - I did not use the word `fraud', Mr Speaker. - I did not use the word `fraud'. Let me talk about a modern taxation system. - I said it was a fraudulent position to say you are in favour of tax reform and to oppose all measures which would change the current system. - And properly within the standing orders. - The Australian Labor Party opposes broad based indirect tax. That is the one thing we know about. It opposes broad based indirect tax, and it supports the wholesale sales tax. Which countries have a wholesale sales tax? - I was asked a question about broad based indirect tax, and I am going to make this point. The following countries seem to be able to manage it: Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Indonesia, Ireland, Israel. - The following countries in the world seem to be able to manage broad based indirect tax in its application: Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Mexico, the Netherlands,  New Zealand, Philippines, Russia, Singapore, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand and the United Kingdom. The following countries support the Labor Party's wholesale sales tax: Botswana, Ghana, Jordan, Pakistan, the Solomon Islands and Swaziland.</DOC>

 - I would say that, in all the matters that are brought to my attention that require investigation, I am punctilious in carrying out that investigation. I would take your advice, Mr Speaker, and ask that the question be placed on notice. I would be pleased to come back with a fulsome answer. I note that, in all the years that they were in government - 13 years - there was absolutely nothing done about the End of War List at all. We have had the good grace to fulfil our promise and announce that list. I simply will not tolerate the sort of nonsense that comes out of the opposition in trying to pretend that they are now concerned when they obviously were not for 13 years.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I must say at the outset that it is interesting that with all those champions of the bush over there who run around saying that they are the answer to all the problems of the bush, they have not asked a question in relation to waterfront reform and its importance to the rural sector. Where are the member for Burke and the member for Hunter, let alone the cockies' friend, the member for Hotham?There are about 120,000 farmers in Australia and about 20,000 of them could provide enough food and fibre to look after all Australians' needs. The other 100,000 rely upon exports for their livelihoods and so do hundreds of thousands of people in the processing sectors, the value adding sectors that spring from agriculture. They are amongst the world's most efficient, by anybody's standards - and we are all very proud of them. But those first-world performers in those industries are outrageously held back by third-world performance on the waterfront. That is what happens. Farmers face international competition and, to win, they would like a waterfront sector that helps them win, not hinders them.We recently had a National Farmers Federation study which showed that a 25 per cent fall in the cost of shifting goods - and it needs to be remembered that we have about double the costs of our competitors - across the Australian waterfront would improve the prices of rural produce in Australia by one per  cent. That, in turn, would improve farm business profit by 27 per cent.Our multibillion dollar meat exports, for example, are containerised. Millions could be saved and put back into the pockets of farmers if we could get decent waterfront reform. Our dairy industry alone provides 100,000 jobs. We know about these champions of the workers over there. With these hundreds of thousands of jobs built on exports - we have 36 per cent of Asia's dairy market - we are involved in a fight to the death with our competitors from countries like New Zealand and America where they are reforming and continuing to cut costs on their waterfronts.You have heard the Deputy Prime Minister talk about the fact that it costs vastly more to move timber across our ports than it does in America's ports. I have been asked by citrus importers in Indonesia why it is - and this is very interesting - that it takes nine days for them to import citrus from America and 16 days to import citrus from Australia. And that is in an industry we would like to see succeed on export markets. Apparently, you do not and neither do your mates in the MUA.What is the attitude of our waterfront mates in relation to this? A few modest reforms from these highly privileged elitists could improve farmers' incomes dramatically. How do they respond? I will tell you, Mr Speaker, how they respond: they claim that they are better than they used to be. They refer to history in this country. But that is utterly irrelevant for a trading nation like Australia. Historical comparisons about where they were five, six, seven or eight years ago are utterly irrelevant. What matters is how we stack up against our competitors. We are an exporting country. That is where our jobs and our prosperity lie and where our future must be secured. We are about securing those jobs, those living standards and that future; you and your mates plainly are about exporting them.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Corangamite for his question. The President of the ACTU has made some remarks this morning. What I think is interesting is that we have yet to hear from the Secretary of the ACTU, Mr Kelty. Mr Kelty is basically the one who runs the ACTU. These others are just the fronts for the ACTU but the remarks by the President of the ACTU this morning portrayed their concern about breaching the Trade Practices Act - and they are right to be concerned about the penalties which people can be subject to for breaches of the Trade Practices Act. What she said is, `We will have a response, but it will be muted; it will be united; and our first priority must be the workers, their families and their children.'The redundancy program which the government announced this morning will ensure that those workers who are made redundant will receive their full entitlements, including superannuation, which can be up to $270,000. Those are very generous redundancy arrangements by any community standard. I heard John Coombs saying this morning that these were miserable payments - over a quarter of a million dollars. Only the head of the wharfies' union could make such a claim.We will ensure that these redundancy entitlements are paid. I make the point that this is an industry wide scheme and these funds will be available for any workers made redundant, whether it be in the associated labour hire companies, those labour hire companies which have had contracts with Patrick's or any employees in any other stevedoring organisations.One of the significant aspects of the developments that we have is the commitment by P&amp;O to the benchmark performance targets set by the government. We expect those objectives to be achieved within a 12- to 18-month time frame. The figures are interesting.  I understand that, roughly, the labour force available to Patrick until now has comprised around 1,400 people. But the number of people who will be working under contracts to provide the same services will be in the order of 400 or 500 - a very significant reduction, which shows you the extent of overmanning in the industry. With efficient operations, this industry can be run not only more productively and more reliably but also generally at a lower cost for the users of stevedore services.</DOC>

 - I of course reject the basis of the question that has been asked by the Leader of the Opposition. But, because he has raised the subject of general political attitudes in Australia, it gives me an opportunity to say a few things. The first remark I make is that they left the waterfront by 2.35 this afternoon. They walked off. The waterfront gave themselves a rostered day off at 2.35 this afternoon. I remember reading some of the columns before the parliament resumed. We had all of these columns about how they could not wait to get us back to ask us about Dubai. Were they going to ask us difficult questions about Dubai. Were they really going to put my colleague the minister for workplace relations in the dock on Dubai.Of course, the reality is that they are petrified to pursue the issue of reform on the waterfront. The reason they are petrified to pursue it is that the ordinary men and women of Australia back us on the waterfront. The ordinary men and women of Australia know that the waterfront has been rorted for years. The ordinary men and women of Australia are fed up with the abusive tactics of the trade union bosses. The ordinary men and women of Australia know that the Leader of the Opposition is bound hand and foot to John Coombs on this issue.As for the Leader of the Opposition talking about division and standards, the Leader of the Opposition does not have the courage to pursue somebody himself. He gets his muck-raker in the Senate, Robert Ray, to trawl through the sewers. He does not have the guts to discipline the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. He has been prepared to allow the  Deputy Leader of the Opposition to invoke and incite racial hatred in this community. He has been unwilling to control that motormouth, the apology for a Deputy Leader of the Opposition, who sits behind him. I think the Australian community see the Leader of the Opposition as a weak, wimpish, lap-dog of the trade union movement.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Moreton for his question. The government will be putting in place a scheme where the cost will be borne by industry. This is an interesting contrast to the program introduced by the Labor Party in 1989-92, where a big slice of the funds last time were shelled out by the Labor Party shelling out taxpayers' funds. To add insult to injury, they never got the change in performance, the improved productivity, which was the whole purpose of the exercise in the first place. This scheme being put in place by the government will be at no cost to the taxpayer. Furthermore, the cost of this exercise will be absorbed by the stevedoring companies themselves. - I am happy to conclude my answer, because I wanted to make this final point: today has been very revealing. During question time, have there been nine or 10 questions from the opposition on this issue? No, there has not. Why hasn't there? Because they do not have the guts to stand up for the national interest. These people have never had a policy on this issue other than to do what they have been told by the MUA leadership and the ACTU.</DOC>

 - I am not aware that specific representations were made -  - on my behalf. The foreign minister will speak for himself in relation to the  Department of Foreign Affairs and the foreign affairs portfolio of the government. -  - But you ask specifically in relation to me; I am giving you the answer.But let me take the opportunity of endorsing the remarks that were made this morning on the AM program. And it passes strange, after the pathetic response of your foreign minister when you were in government about French nuclear tests, that you should have the audacity to ask me questions about the Indian nuclear tests. It took you ages to respond to tests after they had actually taken place, let alone pre-emptive warnings. It was only as a  result of comments that had been made by others on our side of politics that Gareth Evans was finally chased out to say something about French nuclear tests. So I would not start chasing that up.The foreign minister has already made the position absolutely clear on our behalf, and no doubt the remarks that have been made by the foreign minister on AM this morning will be further amplified by the foreign minister during the course of the day. I understand that he has already spoken to the Indian High Commissioner to state the views of the Australian government.</DOC>

 - The reality is that the Australian economy is infinitely better placed to withstand the impact of the Asian turmoil than if the Labor Party had remained in office after March 1996. Moreover, let me remind the Leader of the Opposition - who, of course, has not only now been exposed as having deceived the Australian people before the last election, but he has now been exposed as having deceived the Australian people after the election - we are indebted on this side of the House, as we so often are, for the Deputy Leader of the Opposition.The Deputy Leader of the Opposition is really a class act when it comes to helping the government. That Channel 7 program on Sunday was a real tour de force by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. He was asked about the deficit of $10½ billion that his government had left behind, that is, the Keating/Beazley inheritance; the inheritance that the Leader of the Opposition did not tell us about, refused to tell us about, before the last election. What the Deputy Leader of the Opposition did was to expose not only the deceit of the Leader of the Opposition before the March 1996 election but also the deceit of the Leader of the Opposition since.The reality is that we did inherit a deficit of $10½ billion. We inherited an accumulated  net federal government debt of between $95 billion and $100 billion. Not only did we inherit that, but we have had over the last two and a quarter years to struggle with all the obstruction in the world from the Labor Party and the Australian Democrats in relation to the attempts that we have undertaken to get the economic accounts of this nation in order.I am very proud to say on behalf of the government that the full measure of the success that we have achieved over the last two and a quarter years will be revealed tonight when the Treasurer brings down his budget. I am very proud to say that the economy of Australia is the strongest it has been for a quarter of a century. We have the lowest interest rates for more than 30 years; we have the lowest small business rates for 33 years; we have the lowest unemployment rate for the last eight years; and we have, in fact, the lowest unemployment rate since the recession that the former Prime Minister said was the recession we had to have. We have, in fact, one the of highest business investment levels in Australia's history. It is forecast that the Australian economy will grow faster than the economies of the G7 or G8 nations.In other words, Mr Speaker, I think my government has done a remarkable job in turning around the Australian economy. We have had no help from the Australian Labor Party. We have had obstruction, obfuscation, delay, sabotage and guerilla tactics towards the attempts of my government to turn it around. I think the Australian people understand two things: they understand the mess that Labor left and they understand the magnificently applied job that we have brought to cleaning up that mess.</DOC>

 - I have had a lot of legal advice, but I have some real advice for you for a change. My advice to you is that we are going to fix up the waterfront in a way that you never could. -  - It passes strange that the Leader of the Opposition should raise a point of relevance, because there is no party more irrelevant than the Labor Party when it comes to fixing up the Australian waterfront. The question provides me with the opportunity to say that, not only has this government given us the lowest interest rates for small business, for which I also have responsibility -  - Mr Speaker, I am very happy to answer any questions they have. My only disappointment is that they did not start with Dubai. We will have to await your better questions as we go through question time. As to the legal advice that I have had, that is between me and the Attorney-General. When I am ready to tell you about it, I will be happy to do so. But I will tell you this: as far as all of these court cases are concerned, they are as they always said they would be; they are legal wrangles at an interlocutory stage, and at no stage have there been any findings in respect to the Commonwealth. For all the hoo-ha we have had from the other side, in respect of the Commonwealth position there have been no findings whatsoever on anything - absolutely nothing.The claims about the arguable case are claims about Patrick. As Mr Justice North  said in his first decision - which is the decision on the substance of the issue - he had heard the evidence and in due course, when he has heard all of the evidence from both sides of the case, then he may well have a different view. Mr Speaker, I think the opposition ought to be taking some legal advice about its own approach to this issue and the approach it took when it was in office. - I conclude by saying this: maybe the member for Hotham ought to write to the Attorney-General to see if there is an indemnity available to him for being down at East Swanson Dock and publicly advocating that people breach a Supreme court injunction.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Lindsay for her question. At long last the Labor Party have pleaded guilty to leaving the Australian public with a $10½  billion deficit. At long last the truth has emerged. Last Sunday we all listened with great interest to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition on the Sunday  program. I am sure that all who have read the report of that particular interview in Monday's Age  newspaper will have indelibly impressed upon their minds the headline that emerged, and that headline said, `Labor left nation in debt: Evans'.At long last, as I have said, the truth is out. Of course, that follows some 2½ years of the sham perpetrated by the Leader of the Opposition, a sham which was to deny that there was any deficit left by Labor. That self-denial that went on for 2½ years has been exposed with a degree of truth by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. That was always a fact: the first budget of the coalition government revealed that there was a deficit of $10½ billion. Another fact is: that first budget revealed that, in their last five years of government, Labor, through their debt and deficit policies, ratcheted up some $70 billion worth of debt.  The Deputy Leader of the Opposition tried on Sunday to say, `We could have corrected the problem. Yes, there was $10½ billion worth of deficit left for the Australian people when we finished in office but we could have corrected the problem.'In recent months we have seen various spokespeople for the opposition running round the countryside. We have had the spokesman on business talking about reintroducing R&amp;D spending. We have had the Deputy Leader of the Opposition talking about introducing additional funding for EMDG and DIFF. We have had Ms Kernot, of course, looking after the baby boomers. And we have had the Leader of the Opposition saying, `Take no notice of all of that; the only thing that we are committed to are what shadow cabinet approves.' And the only thing that the shadow cabinet has approved is some support for nursing homes.Here they go: they had all of those years and in their last five years they ran up $70 billion worth of debt. Now they say, `We could have fixed it.' Promises are being made to any audience they come in front of. They are trying to appease them with promises and  at the same time we are hearing this line, `Don't take any notice of these promises because unless shadow cabinet approves them they do not mean anything.' Who would believe the Labor Party on fiscal responsibility? How could any Australian believe the Australian Labor Party?In stark contrast to what Labor did, particularly in their last five years, the first 2¼ years of a coalition government have seen one sound fundamental principle endorsed in the first two budgets. That sound fundamental principle was that we would not live beyond our means. We would not spend what we did not have. We accepted the debt that we inherited and we worked to get rid of the deficit. Through those sound fiscal policies we have achieved much - we have seen some four per cent reduction in home mortgage rates, low inflation locked in and some 280,000 additional jobs created in this country. This is contrasted with an opposition that will say anything to the audience that is in front of it. We have seen an opposition that was profligate in its spending and that simply lived off the debt and deficit drip. In stark contrast we have a government that has acted fiscally responsibly. And tonight we get the third instalment, the third budget, and this budget brings Australia back into the black. It sets up the base for future sustainable economic growth in this country - something Labor could never achieve.</DOC>

 - I am glad that we have finally got a question that is remotely connected to Dubai. Mr Speaker, let me start off by saying that what I said in the parliament last year in relation to that issue stands, and it stands completely. Let me also say that the proposition that in some way it is wrong for people to be trained overseas is something that totally escapes me. If a group of Australians want to train somebody overseas, so what? Our position has been all along - and let me repeat it - that we are in favour of waterfront reform. We are determined to achieve waterfront reform. Unlike the Leader of the Opposition -  - In contrast to the Labor Party, which has stuck up for the MUA and nobody else throughout this whole dispute, the Leader of the Opposition -  - Whether the Leader of the Opposition likes it or not, this issue is all about waterfront reform and nothing else. That is what this issue is all about. You may not like that. You may find that uncomfortable. You may regret the fact that you bound and gagged yourself to the MUA from the beginning of this dispute. You may regret the fact that when it came to making a choice between the sectional interest and the national interest -  - The Prime Minister is backing two things: the Prime Minister is backing a more efficient Australian waterfront and the Prime Minister is backing voluntary unionism on the Australian waterfront. The Leader of the Opposition is opposing both of those things. The Leader of the Opposition is against a reformed waterfront and in favour of union thuggery. - You really crystallise this down to a very simple proposition: those on this side of the House want a reformed water  front. Those on this side of the House want voluntary unionism on the Australian waterfront. Those on this side of the House want a fair day's work for a fair day's pay on the Australian waterfront.Most of those who sit opposite - I will exempt my colleagues in the National Party and I will exempt the honourable member for Curtin, and I think on this I might even exempt the honourable member for Kalgoorlie and the honourable member for Moore - but the rest of you here are against a reformed Australian waterfront. You are totally opposed to voluntary unionism. Your leader had the opportunity on the PM program last week to declare himself in favour of something that 75 per cent of the Australian population want, that is, a mixture of union and non-union employment on the Australian waterfront. But so weak, so pathetic -  - When this dispute is long behind us and long behind the recollection of most of the Australian population, there will be one thing that they will remember about the Leader of the Opposition - that he was a weak, pathetic mouthpiece of the Maritime Union of Australia.</DOC>

 - In respect of the second part -  -  - I thank the honourable member for the Northern Territory for his question.  I advise the House that, in respect of the second part of the question, we will, amongst other things, be pursuing the virus in the world trading arrangements whereby there is a hefty amount of export subsidisation, most notably in the Northern Hemisphere, which is adding to the burden of citrus producers, pork producers, beef producers and the manufacturing sector. We are going to do all we can to turn that issue around by a series of approaches which flow with the World Trade Organisation.With respect to the first part of the question, it is a fact that the Asian part-meltdown is impacting to a degree on Australia's export activity. Its effect has, to some extent, been considerably ameliorated by the strategy this government has pursued with regard to trade: firstly, diversification beyond Asia and, secondly, putting real effort into the bilaterals. As a consequence, for the first nine months of this financial year, our overall export performance is up more than $8 billion - more than 10 per cent - compared to the nine months of the previous financial year. That is an outstanding effort by our exporters.In respect of East Asia, I would highlight to the House that exports are up $2.9 billion or nine per cent; coal up 19 per cent, mainly to Japan; metal ores and scrap up 24 per cent, mainly to Japan and China; and non-ferrous metals up 20 per cent, mainly to Japan. In fact, in the figures for March, there was a welcome upward flip: Korea exports up 30 per cent; Malaysia and the Philippines up 40 per cent; and Singapore jumped up 45 per cent in February and 26 per cent in March.Against the odds, but because of and helped by the strategy pursued by this government,  we are helping our exporters to make real gains. In that regard, I highlight that the diversification means that we do not have an Asia first and Asia last export policy; we have a policy to export to the world. And that has been clearly laid down by the Prime Minister and carried out by the Minister for Trade, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and others. On the bilaterals -  -  - You neglected the bilaterals, and no less than former Minister Button has said so. - Your former great hero, Minister Button, said, `Under Labor everyone's down there at DFAT concentrating on the multilaterals; no-one is doing anything on the bilaterals.' We have turned that around. -  - You do not like it. If Gareth was here he would remind us that two Sundays ago he said that he was happy to put a $50 tax on every export container - an additional $100 million burden on our exporters. - I want to say very clearly that we are making many breakthroughs with our bilaterals. Try Mexico. Canola is now able to be exported from Australia to Mexico - reduced tariff. Coal - steaming coal and coking coal - has been exported for the first time ever to Mexico. All aspects of Australian wool, including semi-processed wool, has a zero tariff into Mexico and, from 1 August, a zero tariff from Mexico into the United States of America. We are doing the hard yards. This is a somewhat colourful pre-budget question time. I just make the point that, in the budget tonight, you will see Treasurer Costello provide a hard-yard surplus which will be a further  boost to our economic performance and help our exporters.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Calare for his question. As the member for Calare is aware, Maunsell undertook a feasibility study of the proposal by the IMC. The government is currently having that assessed by Mr David Asimus, a respected agricultural economist. I understand that that report is almost completed and I should have the draft shortly. Upon completion, we will make the findings of that report public. But I will identify and ask the member for Calare to note that, in most part, our government is already well down the path to achieving what the IMC is proposing to do, with the implementation of a lot of the recommendations coming out from the Supermarket to Asia Council, particularly with regard to transport logistics and also cleaning up that freight chain between here and those Asian marketplaces. That is what the IMC is about. We have been working through and getting established sea freight export councils and air freight export councils in each state in Australia. These are the sorts of things that are going to achieve the outcomes that the IMC is trying to achieve. We are well down the path to achieving that. When I have the report  from David Asimus and have reviewed that, I will make it public.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for La Trobe. -  - They say `release it'. They have been released, you mugs! You ought to read them. If you read them maybe you would understand there is a problem - a problem that we are going to fix, that you created and which you encouraged. One of the amazing things -  -  - I tell you, Graeme, they are no better since you were here. They are the worst opposition since Arthur Calwell. -  - Okay, worse than Arthur. At least he had integrity. At least he was old-style Labor. He was the sort of bloke who would nod to you in the street instead of sitting in the back of a Roller. - There have been two Productivity Commission reports, one which was on international benchmarking of the Australian waterfront. This is the first of two reports. The second report was on work arrangements in container stevedoring. These two reports together make the most convincing, irrefutable, absolutely complete case setting out the need for reform of the Australian waterfront. You could not get a more convincing, more independent, more clearly articulated case as to why Australia needs to fix up the waterfront.These people have not even read it, by their own interjections. They probably read that  MUA report which said, `There's nothing to worry about. We're nearly as good as the rest of the world.' It was based on the Drury report. They got some academic in Canberra to extrapolate the work done by a reputable crowd in London. He did it for his own purposes and released it out here. Why did they release it here? They knew the Productivity Commission report was coming so they thought they had better get their own case out onto the public record.In fact, there was a very interesting piece in Lloyd's List a couple of days later which actually had some quotes by the research people at Drury's. They said about the Hamilton report, `Well, the basis of it might be valid. Then again it might not be.' There is only one valid independent study on the public record, and that is the Productivity Commission report. What I like about this report too is that there is no hyperbole, there is no rhetoric - it just gives the straight, hard facts. -  - You can read this, because this is out of the executive summary. It would not take you long, Simon. It says:Container stevedoring in Australia is characterised by a system of complex, inflexible and prescriptive work arrangements which constrain workplace performance.It went on to give a very good example of the cost of unreliability of shipping schedules. It says:The cost of poor waterfront reliability on shipping schedules is illustrated by the experience of one container ship operator in the study.This is a group which has got seven ships going back and forward between Australia and the west coast of the US. They said that, because of the lack of reliability in the Australian ports, they have to have another ship on the service so that they can maintain a reasonable schedule. So, instead of having six ships, they have got seven. Of course, who pays for it? It is all those thousands of Australian businesses that rely on having a service to the west coast to make their businesses tick and to provide jobs. They say that just for this one shipping line alone the cost for them on an annual basis is $7 million a  year. They say in respect of that whole Australia-US west coast trade that they estimate that the extra cost in shipping alone because of the lack of reliability is $US20 million every year, which we are paying for and which the Labor Party is not prepared to lift a finger to do anything about.The other thing is that they talk about the work practices and the `double header'. I have done a lot of radio recently, but I must say that one of the more entertaining moments on Melbourne radio the other day was when a wharfie rang up and said, `I'm sick of you talking about a crane driver earning $90,000 a year for sitting on a crane 14 hours a week. I'm sick of you, Mr Reith, talking about rorts.' His name was Barry and he was from Sunshine. Barry from Sunshine, wherever you are, never again hesitate to ring because it was great to talk to you. I said to Barry, `Well, Barry, you're sick of hearing about the rorts. Tell me this, Barry: have you ever heard of such a thing as a double header?' He said, `Yeah, double headers. We have double headers.' I said, `What rate of pay do you get on a double header on the second shift, Barry?' He said, `Oh, we get paid double time and a half.' I said, `Gee, that's not bad, Barry. Barry, when you've finished the job on the second shift, do you get to go home and still get paid for the whole shift?' He said, `Yeah, that's right.' I said, `Barry, have you ever heard of such a thing called `nick off'?' He said, `Listen, don't you talk about rorts. It's been like this since 1960.'That is what Barry said. He is your mate. You are looking after the Barrys of this world. Mr Speaker, do you know what the Productivity Commission said? -  - Mate, he could afford two penthouses. What the Productivity Commission shows you is that these guys, these blokes - most of them - are on an average income of $62,000 to $101,000 a year. As the Productivity Commission report shows, they are paid that money for a paid working week of 45 hours, on average, and get from $62,000 to $101,000. But, as the Productivity Commission report also says, of that 45 hours  a lot of it is idle time, so many of them are doing less than 40 hours for $62,000 to $101,000 a year. It is the ultimate rort, supported by the Labor Party at the expense of the rest of the Australian community. That is why we are going to fix it up.</DOC>

 - I have a couple of comments to make in response to the honourable  member for Melbourne. The first is, that if I were seeking a legal opinion on the behaviour of others I would not seek his opinion. That is the first comment I would make. The second comment I would make is to reiterate the attitude that I take to this issue and the attitude that my government takes to this issue. The attitude we take is that we are for a reformed Australian waterfront. We believe in a reformed Australian waterfront because it is in the interests of the Australian people. We set out at the beginning of this to achieve one goal and one goal alone; that is, to serve the national interest by reforming the Australian waterfront. That has been our single irrevocable aim throughout the whole of this issue. At no stage did we set out to damage the MUA, at not stage did we set out to achieve other than a reformed Australian waterfront. Our promise was to reform the Australian waterfront. Can I take the opportunity of saying to the members of the Maritime Union of Australia -  -  - and all the noise under the sun from the Australian Labor Party will not block out this unassailable fact: if the Maritime Union of Australia months ago, indeed years ago, had adopted a reasonable approach, the events of the last few months would not have occurred. What the Australian public need to be reminded of is that in 1995 - this goes to the very heart of this issue - an agreement was made between the Maritime Union of Australia and the Patrick company. For three years the company negotiated with the maritime union to try to get the union to adhere to the agreement that their national secretary had signed. But at no stage would the maritime union show any willingness to do that.Our goal has been to reform the Australian waterfront. Our goal has been to get rid of the rorts. Our goal has been to end compulsory unionism on the Australian waterfront. Our goal has been to deliver a measure of fairness and justice to the farmers of Australia, who have suffered more than any other section of the Australian community due to the disrup  tive behaviour of the Maritime Union of Australia over the last not three years but probably the last 20 years. When I saw that great assembly of farmers in Sydney a couple of weeks ago they sent the message to the men and women of Australia that they were the people of Australia who were the real victims of the chicanery on the waterfront. These are men and women whose incomes are often only $15,000 or $20,000 a year. These are men and women who have fought the seasons, they have fought the adversity of perverse world markets. They are the victims of the thuggery of the Maritime Union of Australia and I am very proud of the attempts that my government has taken to reform the Australian waterfront.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Makin for her question. I thank her for the excellent function that I attended in her electorate the other day. She is another one of the great marginal seat holders on our side that is going to come roaring back at the next election. One of the reasons is that people in Makin want the waterfront fixed up. That is why! I compliment the member on her strong personal stance in support of dinky-di waterfront reform.I tell you another thing that people in Makin support, and that is the right of Australians to make  a simple choice. That is the choice to be in a union or not to be in a union. That is the mainstream view in this country. In fact, there was a poll out the other day that showed 74 per cent of Australians believe that on the Australian waterfront individual employees should have the same choice as to whether to join a union or not as do Australian employees in any other workplace.What is so damning of the opposition's position on this issue is that, when it comes to the waterfront, they have a special policy position especially for the MUA. One of the more pathetic performances of the Leader of the Opposition the other day was on the ABC on PM. - I will not be distracted. This was at 6.20 p.m. on Monday, 4 May. He was asked - not just once - to reply to the question:Do you object to the idea of non-union labour working on the wharves?He said:I object to the idea of people being sacked because they're unionists and replaced by non-union labour.So question No. 1: do you object to non-union labour? He failed to answer the question. Question No. 2:But what about non-union labour working there? Do you object to that?Again, he failed to answer the question. Question No. 3 - talk about skewered good and proper! - was:I ask you again, do you object to the idea of non-union labour working on the waterfront?`Separate the two out,' he says, and avoids the question again. And question No. 4:Does that include supporting non-union labour working there?This is when he said:No, it doesn't include that, Matt. It doesn't include that at all. That is an irrelevancy.I have news for you: in the Australian public, we actually think it is relevant. We do think  people have a civil right; it is a civil right in this country to make a decision. -  - There are claims coming from the opposition about a conspiracy. I will tell you what I believe about conspiracies: the one conspiracy on this issue is a conspiracy between the Labor Party, the MUA and the ACTU. That conspiracy is to maintain compulsory unionism on the Australian waterfront.Why do you want to do that? Because you like to have the shock troops in the MUA for the benefit of the ACTU's political agenda. What is the second element of that? This is what I call the `Cheryl clauses'. These are the bans on secondary boycotts. What is the Labor Party's public policy on the `Cheryl clauses'? They are to be repealed.What would be the practical effect of that? The practical effect of that is to enhance the monopoly position of the MUA and then allow these people to hold this country to ransom so as to maintain and prop up the rorts, the inefficiencies and the overmanning. That is the real conspiracy on this policy issue. It is the same old conspiracy between the Labor Party, a weak leader of the Labor Party, the MUA and the ACTU. You will be damned for that because the Australian public will not accept a proposition that requires and allows the MUA to keep a stranglehold on this country anymore.</DOC>

 - Let me say to the member for Canberra that the government's goals have always been to achieve waterfront reforms. During the course of achieving those goals, as you would expect, there were discussions between relevant ministers and the people involved. The goal was to achieve waterfront reform, and let me make it very clear that at all times the government, I believe, acted immaculately in accordance with the law.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Macquarie. I take the opportunity of thanking him for the time I spent in his electorate. That was a memorable occasion.The MUA has had a lot of coverage but the people who have actually been running some of these operations in the last three or four weeks have had, in my view, not enough coverage. They are Australians. They have taken on a new task to get Australia an efficient waterfront. It is about time these people were given some public recognition for being prepared to take on a new job and to do a job of which all Australians could be proud.Whatever side of politics you come from and whatever you think of this dispute, the fact is these people have done a first-class job under very difficult circumstances. It is not an easy thing to have hoodlums, basically, outside the gate hurling abuse at you, smashing buses, threatening family members - all sorts of abuse that we have seen in recent times.I was caught, therefore, by an article which appeared in the Sunday Telegraph in the last couple of days. This relates the circumstances of a new wharf labourer, a female. She was the first woman to drive the enormous portainer cranes at Port Botany. She had some very interesting things to say about her experience. Her name was Chris. According to this report, Chris's team moved up to 23 containers an hour. According to this report, the MUA's previous rate was about 14 an hour. - Absolute rubbish, is it? Yes, sure. Good on you, Kim. You have got the last lot of statistics given to you by John Coombs. You probably got his last lot of research to tell you what to say as well, Kim. -  - This hurts. The report goes on to say:Her team unloaded containers one and a half shifts ahead of schedule. Some ships booked in all day were free to leave by mid-morning. `My team the was a first team to break 100 containers in one day, and we did that within a week.'They set a record in Port Botany in their first week. Then she goes on to say -  -  - Why don't you attack this woman? Wouldn't you attack her? Just typical. She has done the right thing and you are out there attacking her personally. It is typical of your behaviour. If you are not a member of the MUA, you are not worth knowing. -  - That is your attitude. Typical! - Mr Speaker, this particular person was a crane operator, fully trained. She was working on $53,000 a year and she thought that was a pretty fair deal. It is reported that on her first day at Port Botany she said she saw two pool tables, three ping-pong tables, a TV, video, spa, weight room, exercycle and step machine. `We started calling it Club Med Port Botany,' she said.This is not the first of these stories. When the first ship to leave Fremantle left having been stevedored by persons other than the MUA, in the last two hours that ship was stevedored at the rate of 22 to 23 cranes per hour, which is better than the national five-port average which had been the product of years and years of MUA rorts and inefficiencies. What this demonstrates is that if people  are prepared to put in a decent day's work for a decent day's pay it is good for them, it is good for the exporters and it is good for this country, and that is why we want reform.</DOC>

 - What I will guarantee the member is that we are opposed to monopoly control by your mates in the MUA. That is what we are opposed to. I tell you what we are in favour of: we are in favour of an efficient waterfront. Had we had discussions? We have had loads of discussions. We have had discussions with Patrick; we have had discussions with P&amp;O. There was a report out in the last couple of days about the number of job losses because of the overmanning in P&amp;O -  - We have had a lot of discussions with a lot of people. I tell you why:  because when we were elected we were elected on a promise to fix up the waterfront. Why was that necessary? Because you spent $420 million and, instead of fixing up the waterfront, Australia has become under Labor's 13 years an international laughing stock. That is why.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Groom for his question about this sorry event. The government unreservedly condemns India's action of detonating three nuclear tests, and we have taken immediate and decisive action to make our views clear to the Indian government. India has flagrantly defied the international community's strong support for nuclear non-proliferation and opposition to nuclear testing. India's action does have serious implications for global and, of course, regional security. The Australian government urges India's neighbours to exercise restraint in the face of this provocation. I have called in the Indian High Commissioner today and I have conveyed the Australian government's condemnation in the strongest possible terms. I also made it clear to the Indian High Commissioner that we would expect India to desist from any further tests of any kind and that we would wish to see India immediately move to sign the comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty. This same message has been conveyed by our High Commissioner in New Delhi to the Indian authorities.I am also recalling the Australian High Commissioner from New Delhi to Australia for consultations and I expect him back here in the next 48 hours or so. He will leave New Delhi as soon as it is practicable. Further steps will be decided on in the light of those consultations and, of course, also in the light of consultations with our regional friends and neighbours as well as countries such as the  United States which share the great concerns that we have about what India has just done.I would like to make one other comment as well about representations we have made to India not over just the last few months but over a large number of years about the issue of nuclear testing and the development of a nuclear capability. We have of course throughout our term in government - and I think to be fair the previous government probably did throughout its whole term in government as well - made it perfectly clear to the Indian government or succession of Indian governments that we wanted India to join with the world and sign the nuclear non-proliferation treaty.There are now 186 countries which have signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and there are only five that have not - and India is one of those five. I urge the Indian government to do the responsible thing and to sign that treaty. Our views - and, to be fair, the views of the previous Australian government - have always been made clear to the Indian government on that matter. We also have made it perfectly clear to the Indian government on many occasions that we wish them to sign the comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty and have expressed our grave concern that they have not signed that treaty.Most recently, following a long succession of representations to successive Indian governments on this broader issue of nuclear questions, our High Commissioner in New Delhi on 22 April conveyed Australia's strong opposition to nuclear testing to India's Defence Minister Fernandes and the following day to the Indian Prime Minister's principal secretary.So let me say in conclusion in relation to the Indian testing program that we want India to understand three things: first, to understand the strength of Australia's feelings about this issue; secondly, to make sure that India does not persist with this policy of detonating nuclear devices; and, thirdly and importantly, to send a strong message to other countries which might be considering entering the nuclear weapons age. Let me say in that context that not only have we, through my department, spoken to the Pakistani High  Commissioner but our High Commissioner in Islamabad will also be speaking with the Pakistani government, explaining to them that it would not be to their advantage, to the advantage of the international community or to the advantage of the security of our region as a whole if Pakistan were to respond to India's decision to conduct nuclear tests by doing the same thing. Pakistan should set an example in the cause of nuclear non-proliferation by not going down the path that India has very mistakenly followed.</DOC>

 - What the opposition perhaps does not appreciate is that the redundancy policy position of the government is right across the board in respect of both shipping and stevedoring and we have had discussions with all the relevant parties right across the board. In the shipping area, for example -  -  - Shipping, shipping, shipping - got it? -  - I just find with you people that if I repeat it you eventually get it - that is all. In respect of shipping, for example -  - Finally Gareth worked out the $10½ billion and announced it on Sunday television: `We left you a legacy of $10½ billion.' Thank you, Gareth. It will make a great ad in the next campaign, Prime Minister.I do not think that there has ever been any discussion about who is in the union or who is not in the union - with the shipping companies, I do not think ever. In respect of the administrators, I think the Labor Party and the MUA are placed in an exquisitely difficult position. I say that for this reason: normally in these protracted disputes what happens is the union keeps hammering away at the employer until eventually the employer sort of succumbs under the financial pressure, but in this particular situation in fact it is completely the other way around because what you actually have in place is labour hire contracts for the provision of labour for the stevedoring operations based on a commercial assessment of the needs of the stevedoring operations company. As I understand it, from what Mr Corrigan has said on the public record -  - Let me finish and you might at least understand the position. What he has said is that he required these companies to meet certain performance benchmarks and the more industrial action they took the less able they were to meet the performance benchmarks which were required of them under the contract. So what he was doing was topping up those companies to keep them afloat, but eventually the harder the unions hit the stevedoring operations company the more he had to put in by way of subsidy to keep them going, until eventually he said, `Well, given the inefficiencies in your operation, we are no longer prepared to subsidise the inefficiencies in those operations.'What the administrators find is that, once the matter got before the Federal Court, the union said, `We appreciate the insolvency of those companies so - to a layman - basically we are prepared to work for nothing to keep them afloat.' In legal terms, they gave an indemnity against the personal liability of the administrators just to keep the companies afloat.The administrators have these labour hire companies with these contracts. They are looking under the Corporations Law, as required by the High Court, to keep the companies going into the future. In layman's terms, it is basically their obligation, as they have explained it to me, to get these companies up on a sound financial basis. They are looking at how they can be rearranged to meet that simple commercial goal.As they look at those labour supply contracts and how they could configure the work force to meet those contracts, they are asking themselves, `What do we need to keep these companies on a financial basis?' They have said to us that, to get them on to a financial basis, there will obviously be redundancies. They were also looking at the fact that other people were coming to them and saying, `We can provide exactly the same service for 30 per cent less than those labour contracts currently provide by way of a revenue stream.'The requirement on the labour hire companies and their administrators is to look at the means by which they can set these companies up on a commercial basis. The difficulty for the MUA is that their public position is that there is no way known that they can provide labour in those labour hire companies which will allow those companies to operate efficiently in the future. The MUA is saying, `Oh, no. We cannot possibly do it on that existing cost basis.' The reason for that is the inefficiencies, the rorts and the overmanning. It is a neat comparison to make between the national need for an improved waterfront and the micro-need for those companies to put themselves on a financial basis.The administrators have said to me that, on the current basis, the companies are not in funds and therefore they would go into liquidation, the 1,400 would lose their jobs and they would not get a cent. There would be no funds available to them. That is one possibility. The second possibility is - recognising that there are redundancies - that they need Commonwealth funds to be able to meet their obligations. Our funds have always been available on the basis of genuine restructuring, and that is simply what we have said  to them. It is a matter for them how they organise the labour to meet the contractual obligations required under those contracts. We said to them, `We would only expect of you what we would expect of anybody else, and that is that you observe the law, that people have -  - I am responding absolutely relevantly, and in detail, so you might understand, and I am informing the House what I have been told by the administrators. I am giving the House a proper explanation of the Commonwealth's position in this matter, which is actually spelt out in the letter which we made public yesterday. What that does is allow these labour hire companies to enter into arrangements so that they can satisfy the requirements of the labour supply contracts. We have said, therefore, that whether people are members of a union or not is ultimately a matter for them. It is true that we say - not in the letter, but it is clear from our public position - that we are opposed to anybody using their position to enforce, on an ongoing basis, a monopoly and requiring people to be members of the MUA. Of  course that is our position. That is always our position. That is the great political divide.If you were the government, you would be saying to the administrators, `Set these companies up however you like but only on the basis that they are members of the MUA' - a clear breach of the Workplace Relations Act. The perversity of this whole thing is that the people who are opposed to and in breach of the spirit of the Workplace Relations Act are none other than the Labor Party and the MUA because they are publicly in favour of com  pulsory unionism on the Australian waterfront.This is a very interesting position. It is a requirement on the administrators to act in accordance with the Corporations Law. In a nutshell, the position facing the administrators is that they either liquidate or they reform. If they reform, everybody is fully paid out their entitlements - 100c in the dollar - you get an efficient waterfront, people can be proud of the work they do as wharfies and, of course, it is good for the country. The real test now for you guys is: are you prepared now to publicly support the right of the administrators put in place, given the authority of Mr Justice North and the imprimatur of the High Court, to put these companies back on to a sound footing? That is the challenge for you, and I say that you will fail it because you are in the grip of the MUA, as usual.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dawson for her question. A top priority of this government is expanding job opportunities for all Australians. Unemployment is now at 7.9 per cent, the lowest level since October 1990. We have had  183,000 jobs created in the last nine months, of which 137,000 have been full time. This compares with the total full-time job creation in the last six years of the Labor government of 20,000 full-time jobs. - As the Prime Minister points out, the record of this government is seven times better. We are also concerned to make sure that all unemployed people have equal opportunity to get those jobs as they come through. On 1 May, the Job Network replaced the CES. It was clear to employers and it was clear to unemployed people that the old system simply did not work to get them jobs. They had only 20 per cent of the job vacan  cies, they had 296 sites and they were not paid according to performance. They shuffled unemployed people through these short-term training schemes that did not lead on to jobs.Overnight on 1 May unemployed people in this country were better off. From the first day unemployed people were able to go to over 1,400 different sites around Australia - not twice as many sites as the CES provided, not three times as many sites but four times as many sites as the CES provided. Over the first week of the operation of the Job Network, thousands of new vacancies were added to the job vacancy database. Thousands of long-term unemployed people who did not have access to case management under the old system are now getting intensive assistance under the new arrangements. - What sort of comment can we expect from the member for Batman, who right through the lead-up to the establishment of the Job Network attacked individual providers in a vicious, untruthful way? What has been his big criticism of the Job Network? He has decided to attack one of the major providers, the Salvation Army. He has decided to accuse the Salvation Army of colluding with other Job Network providers. Colluding to do what? Colluding to provide unemployed people, non-allowees, with free access to job services. The only people in this country attacking the Salvation Army are the Labor Party. What a big political ploy on behalf of the member for Batman! What judgment he shows! He is an embarrassment to the Labor Party, and he is an embarrassment to the Leader of the Opposition.Did he tell you that he was going to write to the ACCC? The Labor Party has shown its true colours. It is not interested in providing unemployed people with a better deal. It is not interested in a performance based system. All it is interested in is its narrow, shabby, mean politics. It is willing to drag any organisation down into the gutter along with the member for Batman. You should apologise to the Salvation Army, and you should apologise to all those thousands of men and women  who are working hard to provide unemployed people in this country with a better go.</DOC>

 - What is John Coombs's telephone number? What is Jennie George's telephone number? -  - I should not be stimulated by my colleagues at the back. There is no doubt that there is a conflict between Mr Corrigan and Patrick and Messrs Wells and Kilfoyle. There is no doubt whatsoever there is a conflict between them. There are threats of legal action and all sorts of claims being made. It is worth putting it in context. It seems what has happened is that the claims being pursued by Messrs Wells and Kilfoyle had been passed over to a colleague of theirs, Mr Andrew Harris. Mr Harris went public at the end of April or 1 May, and he claimed to have documents that were available for sale which would reveal all on Dubai. We have heard about these documents for some time  because John Coombs told us back in March, if not earlier, that they were for sale for $5.6 million. They were documents definitely worth having!Then, when Mr Harris was brought in to pursue the claim, he announced that they were for sale for $1 million. He was asked specifically whether or not these documents in any way implicated the government. This is what he said:I have got nothing in the documentation whatsoever, however, that suggests that.That was in response to the question:Did the documents show that anybody working for the government at any stage had any advanced knowledge of what was happening in Dubai?He said:I have got nothing in the documentation whatsoever, however, that suggests that. There is nothing to suggest that Wells told anyone in government that they knew anything about Dubai at all.He also said on 1 May to Neil Mitchell:So you still haven't on what you've got. You've got nothing that suggests the government was lying.`Absolutely not. I said that yesterday,' says Harris.So the first thing we know is that documents are for sale for colossal amounts of money, absolutely, completely unrelated to the government on the representation publicly made by the person who had the documents for sale. The next thing we know is that there is a claim in which the government is implicated, and the claim is that there were three points of contact.At the same time, if not before, Dr Webster - who was then not on my staff but doing a consultancy for the government on waterfront, for which I was jointly responsible - had already made it quite clear that he had had a contact once before with Mr Wells. He was quite open about it, and why shouldn't he be? For heaven's sake, there is nothing wrong with doing so. That was a contact in respect of a completely separate, unrelated matter which is independently verifiable.Furthermore, I have it on independent advice from Pratt Industries, for which this job was done, that at the time Dr Webster,  who had worked for them for many years - 14 years or thereabouts - was asked by them to do a particular job for him, which he did. In the advice that I have from Vizy Industries, the matter was sort of settled, but there was some ongoing debate about whether the person who got a job as a driver would be part time or full time. That is a full and complete explanation for who had telephone numbers or who did not. - The advice that I have is that the driver finally accepted the offer of a full-time position with Vizy, which is part of the Pratt group, on 1 October. - So you go and check it. Lastly, as to the balance of the claims, Dr Webster put out a statement which was publicly released on 8 May in which he completely explained the position. - I stood by it then, and of course I stand by it.</DOC>

 - First, let me thank the member for Parramatta for his question and say that he is one of the members on this side of the House who has advocated a youth ambassadors program for a long time. I hope the member for Parramatta will make sure that the people of Parramatta are made aware of his enthusiastic support and advocacy for this program. What is more, the people of Parramatta understand that you ask relevant to the point questions and not grubby irrelevancies that come from the vacuous opposition.The Prime Minister did indeed announce the youth ambassadors program on 5 May. This is a visionary program designed to encourage young Australians to get to know the Asia-Pacific region better and to encourage people in the Asia-Pacific region to meet with, deal with, and themselves understand better, young people in this country. This is about engagement with our region at the people to people level. This is about bringing young people into the region from this country, helping them to understand it, helping them to build links and helping to create a pathway for Australia's future.Formally, this will be announced in the budget. But as the member has pointed out, the Prime Minister made an announcement on 5 May about the youth ambassadors program. It includes funding of $10 million over two years, and that will provide places for 500 young Australians. These young people, under the age of 30, will have the opportunity to take up placements in areas such as government, business, and educational and community organisations around the region. Young nurses, engineers, plumbers, farmers, environmentalists, and so on, will be able to represent Australia abroad - and I know that  they will do so proudly and in a truly constructive way.I regard this initiative as a particularly visionary initiative by this government. It is about doing things for this country's future - not about the sort of grubby politicking that we are getting from the other side; not about the sort of irrelevancy of phone calls made from one person to another, and this sort of trivia. This is about doing things for the country's future. This is about us taking Australia forward in the Asia-Pacific region.Whatever the Labor Party may say - which on this topic, of course, is precisely zero - institutions like Monash University are getting involved and supporting this project. I would like to congratulate Monash University as the first institutional partner which has agreed to allow scholarship holders under its Monash abroad scholarship program to attach youth ambassadorships to their Monash funded overseas study visits.So the Prime Minister was right. This is a visionary and constructive program all about Australia's future.</DOC>

 - Of course I will not be calling an independent inquiry, because I am proud of the fact that my government has tried to reform the Australian waterfront. I am very proud of the fact that I lead a government that is prepared to stand up for the Australian interests and not the sectional interests. I am very proud of the fact that I have a minister who is prepared in the Australian national interest to fight for the long-term future of the farmers of Australia and the long-term interests of the business community of Australia, and is not bound hand and foot to the Maritime Union of Australia.Let me say to the Leader of the Opposition that the great take-out for the Australian public as far as you are concerned is that when the MUA dog barked you came running. That is the great take-off as far as you are concerned. You were prepared to go down to the Fremantle dock and put your hands up for the Maritime Union of Australia, but at no stage were you prepared to put your hand up -  -  - The Leader of the Opposition was a member of a government that was prepared to ruthlessly import foreign pilots into Australia in order to destroy the jobs of Australian pilots. You were a member of a government that was prepared to use the armed forces of Australia to destroy a trade union. You were prepared to work hand in glove with Bill Kelty of the ACTU. In other words when it suits you, you will set out to destroy a union, but when it suits your sectional interests you will always stand up for the trade union sectional interests.On this occasion we have stood up for the Australian national interest. I am proud of that  fact and I am proud of the role played by my minister.Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper.</DOC>

 - I want every member of the House and every person present in the gallery to mark an absolute first in Australian political history: this is the first question time after the delivery of a budget that the Leader of the Opposition has not asked his first question on the budget. It is a measure of the quality of the budget. Before I come further to the Leader of the Opposition, let me congratulate the Treasurer on the outstanding result that he achieved in bringing down this remarkable budget - a budget that has brought about the most historic fiscal turnaround in this country since World War II.A measure of the impact of the budget is not only this extraordinary non-question from the Leader of the Opposition, but also the fact that the Deputy Leader and the Leader of the Opposition could not even work out their line of attack on the budget in the media this morning. In the one breath, you had the Deputy Leader of the Opposition running around saying, `It's all been built on pain,' and then in another breath you had the Leader of the Opposition running around saying, `Oh no, they've been lucky.' He said, `It's been through no particular effort of their own.' You cannot have it both ways - you cannot be lucky while building it on pain. The reality is that this budget recovery has been built on honest to goodness hard work. This budget recovery has been built upon a plan that was laid down by my government when it came into office. Through the efforts of an able Treasurer, a dedicated finance minister and a disciplined group of people who have been determined to put the interests of the Australian community first, we have turned the infamous Beazley black hole of $10½ billion into a surplus of $2.7 billion. - The honourable member wants me to say something about tax. Let me remind you that for the third year in a row there was no increase in income tax; for the third year in a row there was no increase in wholesale sales tax. What was that budget - 1993? - with the l-a-w law? Remember that? You were the finance minister, if I remember correctly, who connived at telling the Australian public in 1993 that you would not put up taxation - and, as soon as you got back, you ripped it up on every front. You put up the sales tax, you put up the excise, you put up the income tax. We have kept the Australian  people's taxation burden down. The improvement in our fiscal position, this heroic turnaround in Australia's finances, has been achieved in the only honest, enduring, decent way - and that is by reducing Commonwealth outlays. We have brought Commonwealth outlays down to those great levels that existed in the 1960s and early 1970s, before Gough Whitlam was allowed to run amok and wreck the finances of the Australian Commonwealth.I am proud of this budget. I believe that the Australian people have given it a very, very positive response. It is a fair budget, it is a budget that builds for the future and it is a budget that allows the Australian community to climb this enormous mountain of debt that we were left by the former Labor government. It gives to the next generation of the Australian community, the third millennium of the Australian community, the opportunity to start their existence in that millennium on a debt-free basis - and that is due entirely to the efforts of the coalition government and despite the spoiling tactics of that miserable crowd opposite.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Lilley for her question. Last night's budget, brought down for 1998-99, for the first time in eight years put Australia back in the black. What that means is that, in this year, the Commonwealth will not be borrowing and will not be adding to its debt. If the Commonwealth is not borrowing and the Commonwealth is not adding to its debt, if the Commonwealth is out of the market, that means that the Commonwealth is not pushing up interest rates against home buyers and against small business. Those who are living in the electorate of Lilley, as a result of two  years of good government economic management, are now paying interest rates four per cent lower than they were when the Labor Party was in office. For the people of Lilley with an average mortgage, that means they are saving nearly $4,000 a year on their home mortgage. That is $4,000 a year to look after their children, and to pay for clothing, for food, and for improvements. That is $4,000 a year for the electors of Lilley that is not going in servicing the high interest rates of the Labor Party.For small business in Lilley, overdraft interest rates now of 7.7 per cent are the lowest in 33 years. If you want to compare the interest rates for small business in Lilley now with the interest rates for small business in Lilley when Labor was in power, they peaked at 20.5 per cent under Labor economic management.You do not produce surpluses out of thin air. Going back to 1991-92, for the last five years of the Keating-Beazley Labor administration - I want the House to listen to this - these were the outcomes: in 1991-92 the deficit was $11.5 billion; in 1992-93, $17 billion; 1993-94, $17.1 billion; in 1994-95 - Beazley finance minister - deficit, $13.1 billion; and in 1995-96 - Beazley finance minister and in control of the finances of Australia - deficit, $10,300 million for the year.A lot of Australians are going to ask themselves, `If the Commonwealth is now in the black, what do you do with the surplus?' The truth of the matter is that if you add up those deficits run by Keating-Beazley Labor they total $80 billion of debt. That $80 billion of debt does not go away. That $80 billion of debt has to be serviced by every Australian until the coalition can break the back of it and retire Labor's debt. The second leg of the journey, having got Australia into the black - meaning that we are not increasing the amount on the mortgage this year - is to start paying back the Keating-Beazley Labor mortgage to set up opportunities for Australians which they could never have had under the Labor Party.</DOC>

 - The reason you can say the Australian government is back in the black is that we are producing a $2.7 billion surplus. What a surplus means is black; what a deficit means is red. - The Labor Party did not produce a surplus for eight years, so for the benefit of explanation a surplus actually means $2.7 billion in the black. It means that we are not borrowing this year. But it does not mean that we have got rid of the $80,000 million you accrued. It does not mean that the $80,000 million that Keating-Beazley Labor put together magically disappeared. You ought to give yourselves credit for one thing: your legacy of debt will live for a decade. Give yourselves credit for that. We have got the government back in the black in 1998-99 and now we set out on the second leg of the journey to start getting rid of the Keating-Beazley Labor debt. For the people of Australia, the Keating-Beazley Labor debt of $80,000 million means this: we have to raise billions of dollars of taxes each year just to pay for their debt. - I want to make this point so that people understand it. What that means is that the Commonwealth this year will not be borrowing but will be repaying Keating-Beazley Labor debt. The Commonwealth government, which is led by good economic management, will actually be retiring debt in the forthcoming year.</DOC>

 - I did hear somebody on the radio this morning saying that he was just a victim of bad luck and I did hear him say that we were just the victim of good luck - and it was the failed finance minister of the Keating Labor government, the current Leader of the Opposition, Mr Beazley. I was a bit surprised that he is now taking the line that it all revolves around luck because, Mr Speaker, don't you remember he was the one that said there was no deficit. He was the one that said on 1 February 1996, `We're operating in surplus and our projections are for surpluses in the future.' That is what he said. After the election he said the same thing: `This notion of an $8 billion hole is largely a fraud.' That is what he said on 17 April 1996. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition does not say that it did not exist. He went on Seven's Face to Face  on 10 May 1998 and this exchange took place:Yes, but you also left us with a $10 billion deficit as a result.Evans: `Yeah, but it was a deficit that could and would have been corrected . . . ' - The Leader of the Opposition said it did not exist; the deputy leader said it not only existed, it could have been corrected. Then we got to the question of who was responsible. Of course, that $10 billion deficit had nothing to do with the government! The Deputy Leader of the Opposition said on Lateline  last night:You've got to have a reliable Treasury, and it was the Treasury forecast that let us down.So, first of all, it did not exist, then it did exist, then it was nothing to do with the government; it was the fault of the Treasury. But you will never guess who, according to the Leader of the Opposition, actually fixed it up. The people that fixed it up were the same people that mucked it up - the Treasury - because he said:`It's been a lucky government, through no particular effort of its own. The breaks, if you like, in Treasury estimates have fallen their way.There was no deficit, then there was a deficit. It was produced by the Treasury; it was fixed by the Treasury. - Evans and Beazley - more twists than Chubby Checker, these two! And the one thing we say to the Labor Party - the Labor Party that said there was no deficit, then there was a deficit, then it was created by the Treasury and then it was fixed by the Treasury - is this: if you are going to make up stories, you have got to have a very good memory.</DOC>

 - Those forecasts are continuing with job growth which is already in the pipeline and will continue. -  - I have never seen people so unhappy when unemployment falls below eight per cent. The Labor Party were walking around saying, `Isn't this a terrible thing - unemployment has fallen in this country. Isn't that a terrible thing?' It is the lowest unemployment since 1990, since the Labor Party said, `That was the recession we had to have.' The Labor Party put Australia into recession. Your leader, your hero, said that was a recession we had to have. And loyally serving at his side was the man rising to his feet. - As I said, Mr Speaker, we have falling unemployment and jobs growth in the system and an unemployment rate now the lowest since the Labor Party engineered a recession - engineered by your hero, Paul Keating, who said this was the recession we had to have. And serving at his side as the employment minister, with an unemployment record of 11.3 per cent, was the man rising to his feet again.</DOC>

 - Can I say to the honourable member for Cowan that last night's budget was indeed a budget of very good news for all older Australians - not only in the electorate of Cowan but also in all the other electorates. I notice that my colleague the member for Lindsay and also my colleague the member for Herbert have both drawn my attention to very accurate and I think very perceptive reports in their local media regarding the benefits of last night's budget to older Australians.By far the most important but certainly not the only benefit was the decision of the government to extend the Commonwealth seniors health card to almost 250,000 self-funded retirees throughout Australia. This will provide the same pharmaceutical benefits that are now available to people on the pension to couples earning up to $67,000 a year of  combined income or the single rate income of $40,000 a year. This card provides retirees with pharmaceuticals at the same concessional rate as pensioners, that is, $3.20 a script. I think the many thousands of self-funded retirees who may in fact be watching this broadcast today will recognise the benefit of that particular measure to them and to their families.	There are other items of great benefit to older Australians. For example, there is $24 million for 30 new rural multipurpose services which will provide additional aged care places for older Australians living in regional and rural Australia. There is a free influenza vaccination for all people over the age of 65 years, and an increase in the Medicare rebate for non-bulk-billed GP visits as a result of the 100 per cent Medicare indexation in 1998-99.The budget also builds on other recently announced measures to assist older Australians, such as the staying at home package worth $280 million, $164 million for extending to war widows our guarantee to link the age pension to 25 per cent of earnings and $10 million for 200 more Medicare easy claim facilities in pharmacies not only in regional Australia but also in the fast growing outer metropolitan areas of Australia. That is a very popular measure. What that particular measure has done is for the first time ever to put Medicare claim facilities within the reach of people living in rural and regional parts of Australia. There are many country towns which for the first time, as a result of this measure, have access to a Medicare claim facility. It is indeed a very welcome measure.This comes on top of the decision I made the Monday after Anzac Day to extend the Gold Card benefit to an additional 50,000 veterans aged over 70 years who served in the Australian armed services in World War II and faced danger from hostile forces. The extension of that particular Gold Card honours the commitment we made to World War II diggers during the last election campaign. It is once again the delivery in full, and indeed ahead of time, of another commitment that I made on behalf of the coalition during the last election campaign.This has been a magnificent budget for self-funded retirees. It has been a magnificent budget for older Australians. It has been a magnificent budget for the future of Australia, and I know that the elderly of Australia will appreciate the real practical help and the real practical assistance rendered by my government through this very effective budget.</DOC>

 - One of the great things to encourage private saving - thank you for giving us the opportunity to talk about it - is that on 1 July this year the tax on private saving is going to be cut 7½ per cent. Thanks, Gareth. What that means is that, if you happen to be on the 20 per cent tax rate, from 1 July this year the tax rate in relation to the interest you earn or in relation to debentures you might have or in relation to any of your earnings on savings will come down to 12½ per cent; and from 1 July 1999, under this government's tax reduction program, it will come down 15 per cent. So, if you happen to have some money in the bank and you earn, say, interest of $1,000, instead of paying 20 per cent tax on that, by 1 July 1999 you will be paying five per cent - one-quarter of the 20 per cent tax rate. That is just one of the things that the government is doing to improve the climate for private saving, and I thank the Deputy Leader of the Opposition for drawing attention to it.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. Last night's budget was a great budget for health, and it follows on the themes that we have been running over the past two years to underpin public policy with a strong scientific basis, to look at population health issues and preventive health issues and at the same time to try to address some chronic long-term problems in health that have been intractable in our system. On the first one, on science, the most exciting is that we have put the National Health and Medical Research Council's budget on a long-term footing. Unlike the previous government that in 1993 and 1994 offered greater funding for medical research, when we got into government we found that they had been quite dishonestly portrayed to the scientific community; it was time limited funding that dropped off. This would have meant that, had we stuck to Labor's forward estimates, the National Health and Medical Research Council would have been able to give no new scientific grants next financial year whatsoever.We have changed that and we have now got a $165 million research base indexed into the future, which in real terms is the highest the National Health and Medical Research Council has ever had. We have also made magnetic resonance imaging available through a Medicare rebate, but we have done it - unlike  the introduction of CT scanning, which led to wild and out of control use of that modality - on a selected and limited basis, backed up by science and by the Australian Health Technology Advisory Council, in a way that will be of great benefit to the Australian public.In the area of prevention and population health we have the single biggest increase in public health funding the country has ever seen and it underpins our commitment to prevent illness and not just to treat illness once it happens. There is a variety of initiatives here on environmental health that will, particularly, look at water quality and water borne diseases such as hepatitis A and cryptosporidium; injury prevention; cancer control; the continuation of very successful anti-smoking initiatives; men's health initiatives; and a special vaccination program so that all Australians over 65 can receive free immunisation against influenza which we expect will save 1,000 lives a year. Many of these initiatives are not superficially popular. We have undertaken them because they are necessary, because they are correct, and because they will give a boost to prevention in a way this country has never seen before.We have addressed some chronic problems in health. We have substantially boosted Aboriginal health funding. We are making pneumococcal vaccine available to kids in Aboriginal communities where they are particularly at risk. We are funding azithromycin for treatment of trachoma, as the Prime Minister has previously announced. We are rebuilding some of the Aboriginal health infrastructure and we still have above that additional funds to help Aboriginal medical services over and above what was originally contemplated.Finally, in rural health, we are building on our successes of the past. We are building on the success of the four per cent increase last year of doctors in rural areas. We are going to expand 30 multipurpose centres around Australia - a very popular initiative that helps the survival of small country hospitals. We are increasing funding for rural work force agencies by 25 per cent to help to get more doctors into the bush. We are taking up the challenge put to us by overseas trained doc  tors who said they would want to practise in rural areas if they could get registration, and allowing 100 doctors to go back to medical school on the condition that they go to rural areas when they finish. If all these 100 doctors go into rural areas in one go, it will fix 20 per cent of our problem with the work force in rural Australia.The honourable member asked how this will benefit families in the long term. It will benefit them simply by making a health system that is sustainable, that is fair, and that is built on a strong intellectual framework that values prevention as much as treatment.

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I am aware of the concerns of the member for Lowe and a number of other members of the House with regard to the operations of Kingsford Smith airport in Sydney. One of our commitments at the 1996 election was to more fairly and equitably distribute aircraft noise around KSA, and it is being done. We are delivering on that commitment. It is something that the Labor Party was never able to do with Sydney airport with the indecision over the years on the operations of the airport. Our targets remain in place as far as the long-term operating plan is concerned. We aim to achieve those targets by the end of this year. We are about halfway through the implementation process. - Mr Speaker, we are talking about the operations of Kingsford Smith airport in Sydney and all of its effects on the community. The government is well aware of that. We have taken action to change the operating mode of the airport to fairly distribute the aircraft noise and the impacts on the community in all the suburbs around the airport in Sydney. We are going to continue down this path. We believe that we are achieving the goals that we set out to achieve in terms of the targets, and the most important one of those targets is to get 55 per cent of movements moving over water - over Botany Bay - and we are well on the path to achieving that. - The government has implemented a policy that we laid out at the last election. We are going to continue to pursue that outcome until we achieve it.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and note, as I am sure he has, that this budget has been extremely well received in rural and regional Australia. There is a fundamental reason for that. -  - It is well known in rural Australia that an absolute prerequisite for recovery in rural Australia is a set of national accounts that are in order. Everyone in the bush understands that and it is very widely welcomed. The fact of the matter is that our rural industries, whether farmers, whether miners or whether small businesses, were devastated by the sort of regime that was run for 13 years before we came to office. Very high interest rates, very high rates of inflation and a speculator driven currency did enormous damage to the fabric of rural Australia. That is now being turned around. The fact of the matter is that that is very widely understood, and our action is  very widely respected and welcomed right across rural Australia. It lays the foundation for sustainable recovery, particularly for farmers who are price takers on global markets and who need, if they are to have any chance of surviving in the future, the permanent breaking of farm and general inflation.To come to some specific highlights, Agriculture - Advancing Australia, which is a $517 million package, will see this year an estimated $77 million for implementation of various initiatives, including $15 million for the new farm business improvement program, Farmbis, and $41 million for the farm family restart scheme. There are already hundreds of Australian farm families benefiting from that scheme. It was never previously available. In addition, there is $11.8 million for the rural communities program, with $5.1 million, for example, for the waiver of debts incurred under the old and very unsatisfactory Labor farm household support scheme.The introduction of a new, commercially operated farm management deposit scheme replaces the income equalisation deposit scheme at an estimated cost of $20 million. There is $148 million for rural research and development, including $126 million to match industry R&amp;D levies, $11 million for land and water resources and $11 million for the Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation. There is $112 million for the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service.This is a very good budget for rural Australia, but let me come to another one of very great significance and that is the Natural Heritage Trust. It will see, this year, an unprecedented $216 million for natural resource management and sustainable agriculture under the NHT and related programs, including a record $92 million for landcare, $38 million for the Murray-Darling Basin - never matched before - $18 million for river care, $10 million for the farm forestry program and $7 million for the national land and water resources audit.It is interesting to notice that those opposite are a bit sensitive about the NHT because they raised a bit of a smear campaign recently, claiming that it was not being run properly. In fact, the Leader of the Opposition wrote  to the Auditor-General specifically asking that he compare the coalition government's running of the trust with, can you believe it, Labor's abysmal efforts with the sports rorts. He wanted them compared. The Auditor-General found that the decision making process was fundamentally sound in providing transparency and rigour, and that there was no evidence of systematic bias in the allocation of funds for projects. It completely clears the Minister for the Environment and me. What is more - and this is the interesting bit - the Auditor-General said that these findings contrasted with the findings, for example, of audit report No. 9 of 1993-94 on the community cultural recreation and sports facilities program. - It is entirely relevant because this is a valuable budgeting program for rural Australia which you have opposed. When you could not stop it happening you tried to imply that it was being used in a corrupt way, and that is not what happened. The bottom line out of this is that, if he has any shred of decency about him, the Leader of the Opposition must now apologise to the regional and state assessment panels for the Natural Heritage Trust, whose reputations you have dragged through the mud. You ought to apologise to Landcare and other community groups around Australia for diverting government resources away from -  - I simply conclude by saying that he ought to also apologise to the member for Dunkley and he ought to provide a written apology to the Baillieu family.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Stirling for his question. This is an outstanding budget for the next generation of young  Australians. The government is delivering on more opportunities in education, training and employment for young people in this country. By getting the budget back into surplus, we are now moving to lift the burden of debt on the next generation of young Australians imposed by the Keating-Beazley government. The government is delivering on its promise to deliver more education and training opportunities.Let me be specific about the benefits in this budget for young people: this year, there will be more fully-funded Commonwealth places for undergraduate students in universities than ever before - 362,000 fully-funded government places, 10,000 more than in the last year of the Labor government; this year, the coalition is providing $296 million for 120,000 new apprenticeships - real jobs, not the mickey mouse training schemes of the Labor government; and this year there will be an extra 44,000 places in TAFE over last year. The total expenditure on vocational education and training will be some $1.4 billion - up $46 million over last year and up $190 million over the last year of the Labor government.These initiatives have been necessary because of the appalling failure of the previous Labor government to create opportunities for young people. In this morning's Australian, members of the House would have seen the report of the speech last week by the member for Sydney, Mr Peter Baldwin, headlined `Baldwin regrets Labor's past follies'. Of course, the Labor Party has tried to conceal the truth on this matter; they tried to gag Peter Baldwin last year, but he has said it again. Let me just quote what was said:A lack of coherent policy in the whole area of education and training, including the structural overhaul of the late 1980s - the Dawkins reforms - gave little thought to the implications for the vocational sector, Mr Baldwin said. - Mr Baldwin, the member for Sydney, went on to say -  - This is the Australian , Mr Speaker. I quote:'For a period there we managed to get the message out, - says the member for Sydney - particularly to young school-leavers, that the only thing worth doing by way of further education and training was to go to university. . . 'That was a very unfortunate perception . . . It is quite clear that the Labor Party abandoned the battlers in this country; they abandoned the 70 per cent of young people not going from school to university. This government in this budget has confirmed its commitment to these young people. More than that, the budget gives young people the right incentives to take charge of their future. The youth allowance funded in this budget encourages young people to stay in education and training instead of dropping out of school early and going on the dole. Some 70,000 students will be able to get rent assistance. Work for the dole has been a huge success and will be expanded in this budget. There will be some 100,000 places over the next four years.Let the Australian people note this fact: if the Labor Party were ever to return to power, they would abolish work for the dole. They have no commitment to this program, which has the support of communities around Australia, which has attracted the enthusiasm of thousands of young Australians and which is  being remarkably successful in getting these young people jobs because employers are impressed by young people who are prepared to take charge of their own futures and make a commitment to this community. This is a budget based on fundamental values which the Australian people believe in. This budget implements these values as never before.</DOC>

 - He is going to oppose the measure, is he? The Leader of the Opposition has no credibility on this matter. I want to know whether the Leader of the Opposition is going to support it or oppose it. - Nothing will enable the Leader of the Opposition to escape the responsibility of saying right now to the self-funded retirees of Australia whether or not he is going to support the measure. Are you for it or are you against it? - The Leader of the Opposition has now had almost three minutes to tell the self-funded retirees of Australia whether or not he is going to support this measure. Let me simply say to those 220,000 self-funded retirees who are listening, listen very carefully. We in the coalition are in favour of giving you an additional benefit. Might I also say to the pensioners of Australia that I lead the first government in Australia that by legislation fixed the pension rate to 25 per cent of average male weekly earnings. I lead the government of Australia that extended that benefit to war widows. I lead the government of Australia that has also given other benefits to the pensioners of Australia. - It is a funny kind of ignoring a group of people in the Australian community when you are the first Prime Minister in Australian history to pass legislation that links the age pension to 25 per cent of average male weekly earnings. You had 13 years in government to do that, and you did not do it. - The answer in the words of the spokesman for the pensioners of Australia is that at a time of zero inflation they were very pleasantly surprised to get an increase of $5.80 a fortnight in the old age pension. That is the answer and it is an answer that the pensioners of Australia understand only too well. You lasted a half a question, you weakie. - The only thing I have to add is that the amount by which the pension  was put up every fortnight was not $5.80 but $6.80. I sold the government short. I have nothing to add.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Corangamite for his question. In last night's budget, delivered by the Treasurer, we not only delivered on an election commitment but went beyond it. Last night we abolished a tax. I am pleased to announce that the Howard-Fischer government will be abolishing the Airservices Australia component of the unfair avgas tax. This means significant savings for farmers, small charter operators and other GA users in our regions. This means increased opportunities in regional Australia. - Just the same as you stand there and read your questions for half an hour. General aviation users currently pay $17 million in these unfair taxes for services they do not necessarily use. A classic example is the agricultural operator who pays about $7,000 a year in these charges. By abolishing this tax, we are assisting operators in regional Australia. The government recognises that this tax is not fair and we have taken action, unlike Labor. What did Labor attempt to do?  Labor attempted to increase this tax just prior to the last election - before Labor got voted out. Labor tried to increase this tax. We stopped them at the last election. They were beaten at the last election. Today we are abolishing this tax. In November 1995, Labor tried to increase this unfair tax by 1.5c a litre. If Labor had had their way, operators would have been paying $20 million a year in this tax. We stopped them. In government, we cut it, and now we have abolished it. - In conclusion, this goes to prove that the coalition government stands for abolishing taxes, for lower taxes, for lower interest rates, for lower inflation and for more employment. The Labor Party stand for higher taxes, protecting the current taxation system, high interest rates, high inflation and higher unemployment.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, I did not hear the Treasurer on Radio National this morning - not that I would not normally want to listen to the Treasurer on Radio National, but I was talking on a rival program at the time it was going on. But, knowing the Treasurer as I do, I cannot believe that he would mislead the listeners of Radio National. I do not believe he would. - As the member for Dobell has asked me a question about public hospitals - and I thank the member for Dobell for asking me a question about public hospitals - it gives me an opportunity to remind the House of the fairness, the equity and the generosity of the health care funding offer made by the Commonwealth to the states at the last Premiers Conference. It also enables me to congratulate the Premier of Queensland on recognising that the interests of Queenslanders were served by signing the Medicare agreement.What the Premier of Queensland has recognised - which I regret to say at the moment some of the other premiers have not recognised - is that, by refusing to sign the Medicare agreement, they are lengthening the waiting lists for public hospital treatment in  the other states. Rob Borbidge realised that by signing up he accelerated the waiting lists in the state of Queensland. As a result of the deal that has now been signed between the federal Minister for Health and Family Services and Mr Mike Horan, the Queensland Minister for Health, progress is being made on waiting lists in Queensland which is not being made in New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia.The Minister for Health in New South Wales, Dr Refshauge, is particularly ignorant of the way the Medicare agreement operates. When he came to the Premiers Conference he did not even understand the way in which veterans were being treated under the new arrangements under the health care agreement. When it was pointed out to him, he said, `Oh, I haven't settled. Thank you very much. I had no idea you'd put another $750 million in for veterans.' What I say to Andrew Refshauge, what I say to the health minister in Victoria and what I say to those other health ministers is: take a leaf out of the book of Borbidge and Horan. Look after the interests of people on the public hospital waiting lists. You look after their interests. You worry about the people of New South Wales. -  - Ah, we're a little sensitive to this, aren't we? - There have been no cuts. What the Treasurer has said is right. What the member for Dobell is referring to is anti-cost shifting measures that were quite properly introduced by the Commonwealth government. Our offer to the states involves a real increase of 15 per cent over five years. I would say to the health ministers of the states that have not signed: take a leaf out of the Horan-Borbidge book. They acted in the interests of the people of Queensland and you  ought to act in the interests of the people of your respective states.</DOC>

 - Eighty years ago in this nation the repatriation system was established. It was put in place to support the men and women returning from active service to this country. Last night's budget was a very good budget for all Australians and it is a particularly good budget for our veteran community. Last night this government took the landmark decision to extend the gold card eligibility to Australian Second World War veterans and mariners aged 70 and over with qualifying service from the Second World War. An estimated 50,000 Second World War veterans will benefit from this landmark decision. It is a very tangible way of a nation demonstrating its gratitude for the service that they have given to this great nation of ours.The member also asked how many veterans in his electorate of Richmond will benefit from this initiative. On the basis of the information that we have within our repatriation system, it is estimated that something like 840 veterans in the electorate of Richmond will benefit from this initiative. But there could well be a lot more veterans in all members' electorates than we have on our records. That is why it is important that all members get behind this very important initiative. All members will receive several of these application forms. I would urge members to get them out into their ex-service communities and to their veterans. If members care about veterans, they will make sure that, on 1 January, all eligible veterans actually benefit from this great initiative of the federal government. What does this deliver to those veterans? The veterans gold card eligibility will bring private patient hospital care, a choice of doctor,  optical care, physiotherapy, dental care, podiatry care products and also chiropractic services. - You are just so ignorant. This landmark decision of the coalition government is really a very tangible way of a grateful nation saying, `Thank you,' to those Second World War veterans. I might add their average age is 76.5 years of age. They need the support of a grateful nation in this the greatest hour of their need.</DOC>

 - This question is a continuation of the activities of the shadow minister to raise issues that do not address the fundamentals of delivering quality residential care to aged Australians. There are 132,000 elderly Australians in the nursing homes and hostels of Australia, and there are about 3,000 of them. We have put in place policies that will stream capital into those homes so that we can improve the quality and address the problems. The Labor Party failed to address these issues when they had the opportunity to do so in government by decreasing the amount of capital. -  - As the member for Jagajaga well knows - as does Aged Care Australia - the streaming of the accommodation charge, and the other announcements that have been made in the budget and prior to the budget, will result in some $40 million being utilised to front-end load and try to  bring some of those homes up to standard as rapidly as possible.	 We are concerned about delivering to the aged of this community quality aged care where they choose to go into residences. You neglected this issue and you know it. To now raise the matter in the way you have in this question is absolutely deplorable.With regard to the issue of a GST, this seems to me to be just an attempt by you to tag and scare elderly Australians. We will not be doing anything to the elderly but ensuring that they get quality care and support from the taxpayers of Australia - something that you neglected to do. All your huffing and puffing and scare tactics will be seen for what they are.</DOC>

 - I am sure the member for Dawson was watching last night. - Thank you, Mr Speaker, for your sensible guidance to the Leader of the Opposition, who is obviously in  need of some help. Can I say to the member for Dawson and to all members of the House that the decisions taken last night in the budget go towards trying to put in place a framework for the long-term needs of the elderly in this country. We want to develop a continuum of care. It is not just about delivering funds to residential care, which we have done, and I will show the House in a moment how that has been increased. That is $2.9 billion that we will spend in this budget period.	 What we did just before the budget and what the Treasurer announced in detail last night concerned the issue of the staying at home package. It is $280 million giving the opportunity for elderly Australians to stay in their homes and I have advertised some 500 new community aged care packages on behalf of the government already so that we can take care into the home, look after elderly people in their homes and let that be a choice.We have also extended the carers allowance and recognised that there are some 500,000-odd carers in this nation who are deserving of our support. They are the epitome of the volunteer spirit in this country in the way that they look after their elderly relatives and loved ones. We are going to give them support.We are doing things that have not been done before in this country, such as giving continence assistance. We are doing things that have not been done before, such as supporting elderly parents who are looking after disabled children. They are issues in the staying at home package.Last night we went further. We have continued with the home and community care approach. There has been a $24 million or five per cent increase in the allocations for home and community care. That will be $500 million for home and community care. If the states combine with us, that will be a $1 billion program caring for elderly Australians in their home. -  - How can you interject on an issue such as that? These are important matters. In addition, we have addressed the issue of the gold card, as mentioned by my colleague the Minister for  Veterans' Affairs for those people who have served their country. We have looked after self-funded retirees and helped them with their pharmaceutical costs, which is the classic approach for the seniors card that is being announced by the Prime Minister. All of those issues taken together signal to the elderly of this country that we do in fact care and we have addressed the issue. We have addressed the issue of residential nursing homes. -  - You are the ones who are interjecting all the time. It is $2.9 billion. This is the graph and that is what the figures do; that is where it goes. Those dollars go up and that is the extent of our commitment. As I have shown the House before, this is what you did to support the aged of this community. You are a disgrace. You do not care about the elderly. We do.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Cook for his question. I am delighted to say that the small business community is absolutely thrilled with the budget. I can say to the Treasurer, on behalf of the small business community for whom I have responsibility, that the small business community applauds the efforts of the budget that you brought down. -  - From the far-flung parts of Dubbo all the way to Dubai, the small business community is saying, `What a great budget.' They compliment the Treasurer. If you like that, from Oman to Omeo they say, `What a fantastic budget. It is great for small business.' Why are they saying that? Because we dropped the provisional tax uplift factor. That is dollars in the pockets of the small business community.The avgas decision was a great decision for the small business aviators in Australia. There was money for the business entry point. It is great for small business to start reducing the costs of administration for small business. Making a serious attack on the problems of red tape is good for small business. The very innovative proposals that you have for raising awareness of this millennium bug problem is  a good, sensible measure which will be to the benefit of the small business community. This is practical government in the interests of prosperous small business.Lastly, to mention another one, there was an additional $50 million in funding for tourist promotion. There are literally tens of thousands, if not more, small businesses in the tourism business that will enjoy the benefits of this particular measure of the budget. Whether it is the Australian Food Council, the Australian Business Chamber, the Australian Hotels Association or the Australian Small Business Association Ltd, they are all saying, `Good on you, Treasurer. It is a good budget. It is good for small business and it is good for Australia.'</DOC>

 - In the preparation of the taxation package, the government has already had some very extensive and some very constructive discussions with a number of the organisations that were mentioned in the Leader of the Opposition's question. Indeed, only two nights ago I personally had a discussion with the president of ACOSS, Mr Raper, and I found that discussion constructive. I found him willing to understand the need for taxation reform.Let me take the opportunity of saying to the Leader of the Opposition that, when the tax package comes out, the battlers of Australia will be well pleased. When the taxation package comes out the battlers of Australia  will see it as a fair and decent and honest attempt to make the Australian taxation system fairer. Let me also take the opportunity of saying that I have, for a long time in my career in public life, pursued the cause of fundamental taxation reform. I intend to preside over a reform of the Australian taxation system that not only takes the economy of Australia into the 21st century in a positive way but also is fair and equitable to the low-income earners of Australia.It is those who sit opposite who betrayed the interests of low-income earners. It is those who sit opposite who gave the battlers of Australia home mortgage rates of 17 and 18 per cent and who gave to the small businesses of Australia interest rates of 20½ per cent. It is my government which has given this country and the battlers of Australia the lowest housing interest rates in more than 30 years and it will be my government that will deliver taxation justice to the battlers of Australia.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Fisher for his question. Can I say, on behalf of the government, that the government faced a choice when it was putting this budget together of making sure that we met the social and economic priorities of Australia while we were, at the same time, strengthening our economy against the turbulence in the Asian region and while we were dealing with the failures of the Keating-Beazley Labor years. - It would have been easier for Australia if the Keating-Beazley Labor government had not racked up $80,000 million of debt in its last five years in government. The $80,000 million debt did not just disappear when we were elected - we wish  that it had. It meant that this government had to engage in sustained good economic policy, first to get the budget back into the black - to get it back on track - and then to go forward and start reducing the $80,000 million from the Keating-Beazley Labor government.In relation to the budget, there has been a very strong reception to it. The Business Council of Australia said:This is a budget that is absolutely right for the times.The Australian Retailers Association welcomed it, saying:The economy is on course for moderate but reasonable growth.I think on this side of the House one of the things that we were most proud to be able to do in the budget was to look after the self-funded retirees in a way that they had never been looked after before. Maureen Kingston, from the Association of Independent Retirees said this:The Association of Independent Retirees is delighted that the government has listened to the voice of the independent retirees.We were delighted to listen to it and to be able to deliver to another 220,000 Australian retirees the opportunity to take a health care card so that they can buy their pharmaceuticals at $3.20 and, after 52 pharmaceuticals, have them free. The Master Builders Association, Australia's leading building and construction industry association, has also welcomed the budget.In addition to all of those groups, the state Chamber of Commerce in New South Wales, after being addressed by the Minister for Finance and Administration the morning after the budget, actually did a survey of reactions to the budget, giving it a score of eight out of 10 after the address of the minister, who did an exceptionally good job at that meeting. They said this:. . . 75.8 per cent of respondents felt that the Howard government would deliver its forecast surplus and 75.4 per cent felt that the business community was ahead after three Costello budgets.Good economic policy does not come by chance. It is not a matter of luck, as the Leader of the Opposition seems to think it is;  it is a matter of hard, disciplined work. It is a matter of overcoming the sabotage of the previous administration and all of the efforts that Labor undertook to defeat good policy. Australia is lucky that Labor did not defeat good policy. Australia is lucky that it is back in the black and back on track.</DOC>

 - I have never before heard a political party try to question the exchange rate of Australia. I have never before seen a group of people -  -  - who would try in relation to matters like that to score cheap political points. -  - The thing I would say to markets, which I hardly need to say to them, is that there is no more reason to take notice of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition on this issue any more than they would take notice of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition on any other issue. - Since the Deputy Leader of the Opposition seems to be interested in the steps that are being put in place in Australia in relation to the Australian economy, let me give him the facts: the lowest inflation rate since 1962; the lowest mortgage interest rates since 1969; and the lowest small business interest rates, at 7.7 per cent, in 33 years. In 1998-99 we will not be running up debt at the rate of $13,000 million a year as the Labor finance minister did, but repaying the Keating-Beazley Labor debt with a plan to reduce it by half by 2001 in proportion to GDP and - something that the Labor Party did not do - get the budget back into surplus. These are the fundamentals of the Australian economy.Let me ask the opposition this question: where would Australia be today in relation to the Asian turbulence if Labor had had its way and kept the budget in deficit? Where would we be if we were still racking up $13 billion, $14 billion and $15 billion deficits? Where would we be if Australia had had another three years of wasted Labor incompetence? We would have been dangerously exposed - this is a point worth making - by a party which, when Asian growth was running at 10 per cent, had Australia in recession. In 1990, Labor had Australia in recession when East Asia was running a 10 per cent growth rate. Where would we have been if the opposition had been running a recession on a 10 per cent growth rate when East Asian growth turned down?These were the steps taken and they were fought all the way. If those steps were wrong, why is it that the Labor Party now adopts our policy? Why is it that the Labor Party now says it commits itself to three years of surplus budget? If that policy is not right, why has the opposition now adopted it? Because this is the level of the opportunism, the complete opportunism, of the Labor Party, which says, `We will fight you all the way for your  achievements and then we will try to steal them.'

 - As I said earlier, one of the things that the government was pleased to be able to do in the budget was to look after older Australians and to say to the older Australians, those who have saved for their own retirement, that they would be recognised; that, like pensioners who are getting subsidised pharmaceuticals, those who have saved should similarly have access to subsided pharmaceuticals. On budget night, for 220,000 self-funded retirees, the government was able to deliver. But it is not only in relation to health care and the Commonwealth seniors health care card. Also funded out of Tuesday night's budget for those veterans who served Australia against hostile forces in the Second World War the government was able to deliver on the gold card; a gold card which says to those veterans who have served their country against hostile forces that they will be entitled to treatment as private patients, that they will be entitled to podiatry, chiropractic, physiotherapy -  - . He apparently does not approve of it, Mr Speaker. But we do. We think that Australia's veterans do deserve free podiatry, free dental, free physio and free chiropractic. We think that it was an important measure to give the gold card to those  World War II veterans and, in addition to the gold card, they will pay no Medicare levy. Their treatment will be entirely free. That is a great thing for Australia's veterans. In addition to that, the government's staying at home package for older Australians provides community age packages and provides more eligibility for domiciliary nursing care benefits. Isn't that good news, Mr Speaker? - Again the Labor Party interjects. They cannot stand good news for older Australians -  - but the domiciliary nursing care benefit is one of those great advantages. The other thing that the Labor Party interjects about is of course those who are on pensions. - `That's right,' they say. - That's right, they say. The first government in Australian history to legislate the aged pension to 25 per cent of average weekly earnings is this government. - Labor didn't do it in year one. Labor didn't do it in year two. Labor didn't do it in year three. Labor didn't do it in year four. Labor didn't do it in year five or six, or seven or eight, or nine or 10. Labor didn't do it in year 11. Labor didn't do it in year 12. Labor didn't do it in year 13. If only they had had a 14th year! If only they had had one more year they might have done it. - You always know when they are stung. You always know when he is stung: when he moves from that chair to that dispatch box and starts yelling in the way that he did. - It wasn't in year one or two or five or eight or 13. Labor had 13 years to do it, but couldn't. He asked what there was in this budget, funded from this budget, although the consumer price index did not rise, for aged pensioners. The age pension went up $6.80 and it went up $6.80 because this government legislated it. That is an achievement of a coalition government which the Labor Party could never have matched.</DOC>

 - I think all members of the House remain concerned about the level of unemployment and about the level of the  long-term unemployed. That is no secret, and there is no monopoly of concern about that. But let me take the opportunity of saying to the honourable member for Batman that since we came to office we have created 280,000 new jobs. It would do the honourable member for Batman well, and it would do his colleagues well, to understand that since August of last year this government has created almost 140,000 new jobs. I ask - rhetorically, of course - how many new jobs were created in the last six years of the Labor government? Twenty thousand - 20,000 new jobs. In other words, in two years we have created seven times more full-time jobs than Labor was able to create in the last six years it held power.Of course, the Labor Party is now led by a man who has the inglorious distinction of having presided over, as employment minister, the largest level of unemployment in Australia seen since the years of the Great Depression. - That was the Leader of the Opposition. In the early 1990s he presided over an unemployment rate of 11.2 per cent, which is the highest unemployment rate that Australia has suffered since the years of the Great Depression.So, Beazley: employment minister - highest unemployment rate since the Great Depression. Last six years of Labor: 20,000 full-time jobs created. First two years of government: 140,000 full-time jobs created - 280,000 new jobs created since my government came to office. Of course the nation has a long way to go with unemployment. Of course 7.9 per cent is still too high. But we are making progress, and what is also important is that we are doing a lot better than you were doing.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Wakefield for his question. He is, indeed, a very fine Chief Government Whip, and as a South Australian I can tell the House that he is a very fine member for the electors of Wakefield as well. - Well, there is a thought. I'll tell you who won't be getting one. Nor will the Deputy Leader of the Opposition either, just in case he is wondering - Gary. The Australian government has made it very clear that we utterly deplore and condemn India's action in conducting a series of nuclear tests on 11 and 13 May. India's actions have deservedly attracted near universal condemnation and are the act of a government which has put itself beyond the pale of accepted international norms of behaviour. It is clear that India is completely out of step with what the international community has been trying to achieve, and particularly a country like Australia has been trying to achieve, for a very long time in the area of nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament.The international community cannot let India's actions pass without a substantive response. We have used regional international forums to register our opposition to India's nuclear testing and made direct and very strong representations here in Australia and in New Delhi to the Indian government. I have recalled Australia's High Commissioner from New Delhi to Canberra and I have also spoken at some length with the Indian High Commissioner here about Australia's concerns.In the light of India's indefensible behaviour, the government believes that further action is required, both to register our concern to the Indian government and to send a strong message to other nations that might be considering going down the same nuclear path. In that regard, the government has decided to implement a number of actions: first, the suspension of our bilateral defence relationship with India, including the withdrawal of  Australia's defence adviser in New Delhi; and the cancellation of ship and aircraft visits, officer exchanges and other defence related visits. Australian Defence Force personnel who are training in India will be withdrawn and we will request the immediate departure of three Indian exchange officers currently at Defence colleges in Australia.The government has also decided to suspend all non-humanitarian aid to India. Those programs which are specifically humanitarian will continue, as will student programs. High level aid consultations scheduled for later this year have also been cancelled. The government will also suspend ministerial and senior official visits. In addition, the government will continue to pursue a strategy of concerted action in international fora, including the United Nations in New York and, importantly, the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva, to register our strong views. These actions will leave the Indian government in no doubt of Australia's views - not just the Australian government's views, but I believe the people of Australia's views. We are deeply disappointed that India has chosen a course of action which has cast such a major shadow over what was otherwise a positive bilateral relationship.Let me also say that we have and will continue to urge India's neighbours, particularly Pakistan, to exercise restraint in the face of this unacceptable provocation. Yesterday I called in the Pakistani High Commissioner, following a similar calling in of the High Commissioner by my department on the previous day. Today, during lunchtime, I telephoned the Pakistani Foreign Minister and I explained to the Foreign Minister not only our condemnation of the action that the Indian government had taken in detonating five nuclear devices, our sympathy for the change in the security environment of South Asia that these detonations had caused, of course in particular for Pakistan, but also our very strongly held view that Pakistan should not go down the same path as India and simply contribute to the undermining of what has been up until now such a successful nuclear non-proliferation regime.The government considers that India's actions could have most damaging consequences for the security of South Asia and, indeed, globally. Australia noted the announcement by the Indian government that it had concluded the planned series of test and we strongly urged that India conduct no further tests. But this does not excuse India's actions. India must immediately sign the comprehensive test ban treaty and the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, thereby legally forswearing the development and use of nuclear weapons forever.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Mallee for his question. -  - I do acknowledge the member's interest because he does have a lot  of primary producers in his electorate, a lot of citrus growers and others, and they rely on having an efficient wharf. It is very important for the competitive position of all of those businesses that they can get their produce across the Australian wharves, which have something like $62 billion worth of goods going across them on an annual basis. If we can have an efficient waterfront, that is dollars in the pockets of those exporters and those businesses. -  - What we now have is the spectacle -  - We have the spectacle of the MUA, in cahoots with the Leader of the Opposition, doing all that they can to pressure the lawful and due conduct and process of an administrators meeting, which is the creditors meeting due at the end of next week. It says a lot about the MUA. They will do anything and say anything. As the MUA once said, no-one should ever forget that John Coombs said in February of this year -  - that if necessary he would take legal action and if necessary he would take illegal action to defend the stranglehold monopoly of the MUA. Who is publicly supporting the taking of illegal industrial -  -  - This union has said quite clearly and publicly that they will act legally or illegally to maintain their monopoly. That is on the public record. It has never been denied. The Leader of the Opposition is publicly shoulder to shoulder with John Coombs in the making of that statement. We have seen the arrogance of this union in the last few days come to light. - A week or so ago the claim they were making for damages was a claim of $300 million to $400 million. A few days later they revved up their claim to a claim of $700 million for damages. Yesterday, Greg Combet, on behalf of the ACTU and the MUA, announced that their latest claim was for a million dollars a wharfie. He wants every wharfie to be on the BRW  rich list. They are already the world's greatest rorters and now you are publicly supporting -  - these people with these absurd and ridiculous claims, which demonstrate the arrogance of this union and the paucity of leadership on the Labor side as they have the gall to stand and defend the indefensible. - I am invited to talk about conflict of interest. - The point I make is that the Labor Party has aligned themselves with the MUA. They have aligned themselves with the tactics of the MUA. They have aligned themselves with the violence, the intimidation, and the breach of secondary boycott laws in this country, and they have done so to maintain the monopoly and the stranglehold that this union has had over this country for as long as anybody can remember. A classic example is the Columbus  ship, now off the US coast, which has been the subject of boycott action. - Yes. `Hear, hear!', they say. That is a classic. There you have in the national parliament a statement straight out of the Labor Party where they are publicly supporting the boycott of a ship with Australian goods bound for an export market. That is a classic statement. I challenge the Leader of the Opposition to publicly stand up now and to repudiate his own back bench on this issue. I tell you, you won't have the guts to do so because you are supporting illegal action by the MUA against Australian businesses and Australian exporters. You have proof positive here in the chamber today, Mr Speaker -  - Mr Speaker, you would be interested to know that that cargo on the Colombus Canada  has been stranded off Los Angeles since Saturday. It has been the subject of an ITF campaign. John Coombs is on the public record saying he would run an international boycott campaign against Australian produce. He said that on Melbourne radio. You have now got support from the Labor back bench. There are 46 containers of refrigerated cargo such as Australian beef on that ship. There is another 107 dry cargo containers, including car parts, wine and others. The value of that cargo runs into millions of dollars. Today in this parliament we have had a classic demonstration from the Labor Party that they are supporting the boycott of Australian goods as they go to export markets. - Well, if it's rubbish, your opportunity now is to stand up and to publicly condemn this boycott being run by your mates in the MUA. -  - Members of the government and of the opposition! Members of the opposition and the government will be silent.</DOC>

 - I actually have read about such a proposal. As I recall, the proposal came from the member for O'Connor. - I am corrected; it came from Price Waterhouse, I assume on the recommendation of the member for O'Connor. I always take suggestions from the member for O'Connor with utmost seriousness and consider them carefully. I am not entirely sure of the arithmetic, but it is true that it would be worthwhile reform to simplify taxation returns.

 - I thank the member for O'Connor very much for his question. He is one of the members of the House who pays the most attention to his electorate, especially in terms of small and medium sized business. I am very pleased to hear that he has been spoken to and reminded of the great qualities of the federal budget and the tremendous work that has been done by the federal government in terms of bringing government spending under control, which has brought about lower interest rates, a lower inflation rate and greater confidence within the business community of Australia.Because of that, I have received an enormous number of comments from all sorts of business people in Australia - large, small and medium - who have commended the government very much for the effort they have made in three budgets to bring government spending under control. In particular, they congratulate the Treasurer on the hard work that goes towards all these matters. When I look through the list of people who sent in messages, there is the Business Council of Australia, the Australian Chamber of Manufactures, the Institute of Chartered Accountants, the Australian Retailers Association and the Master Builders Association. It goes on and on. Then I found a press statement from  the member for Hotham. He just sort of dropped in. I do not want to press the point too much, but I have not heard from the member for Hotham since the government announced its industry statement in September last year. I have not heard one word. - For six months the member for Hotham has not asked one question on industry in this House. I assumed that he had given up on industry and become a plumber. He is down there digging around with all the dirt and slinging it around. He has not got time for industry policy. He is not the spokesman for industry policy now; he is just the House's plumber. We should not worry about him too much.To show how out of form he is, most of the assertions he makes in the statement are wrong. The member for Hotham was a former minister, so he should know the answer to the question:Not one cent has been set aside for the textile, clothing and footwear industry assistance package.You were not a bad spender as a minister. You knew how to spend a few bob. So you would have known where to look things up in the budget. In the budget statement Budget Measures on page 173 there is a little chart which you can follow, and there is the money. It is all in there.Now we press to the second point. The second point he came up with was a continued decline in the support for manufacture. In fact, it has gone up. What did go down in the last Labor budget in the spending for manufacture in this sector was $200-odd million, just $300 million less than the current government is going on with. That is how far out you are, and you were not a bad spender, as I said before. A third assertion made here which was completely wrong relates to R&amp;D spending. You used to know quite a bit about R&amp;D spending. Do you remember syndicates? They were not too bad. They are the ones that you used to fix up in the back seat of the Roller. In here you assert that they are going down. It goes to show how little you understand of industry at all because, once again, they are going up. You have no understanding  of what goes on. While the nation applauds the government on the budget, the spokesman on industry turned plumber makes a statement full of colour, short on fact and misses the mark completely.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. There has been a great response to the health initiatives in the budget, including responses from people who do not normally give us good responses.The Australian Medical Association has welcomed the Medicare GP rebate increases, the additional money for public health and medical research and for Aboriginal health. The Public Health Association of Australia has described the budget as being `a shot in the arm for public health', which it certainly will be. The Alcohol and Other Drugs Council of Australia has said that this is the first time in over 10 years that a Commonwealth government has significantly increased support for drug treatments, prevention and education programs - a direct result of the Prime Minister's intervention and the Prime Minister's interest in this area. The National Rural Health Alliance has welcomed the fact that expenditure on indigenous health is the fastest growing area in the entire health portfolio.With research, one of our major initiatives, the Public Health Association has said that the government's commitment to maintaining NHMRC funding is good news. We have had strong support from the Australian Medical Research Institutes Association, from the Australian Medical Scientists Association and from the Western Australian Institute for Child Health Research.In aged care, the Council on the Ageing says that health is the most important public policy issue for older people - as it is - and our focus in this area is welcome. Volunteering Australia has been very strongly supportive of the program for volunteer management. Finally, the AMA, which is not known for giving compliments to me, has said that it is better than a poke in the eye with a blunt stick - which is about the nicest thing they have said to me for a long time, and I welcome it.I am also told by my friend and colleague next door, the Minister for Finance and Administration, that the response in his electorate has been the same as mine; he has the Southern Highlands Garden Club here in the gallery. I have to say that, with the response to my electorate office, the single biggest thing that has been welcomed by constituents has been extending the seniors card. This is essentially about security. It does not require a large amount of money per  person, but it means that older Australians can have the security of knowing that, if they get ill, they can afford pharmaceuticals, without any worry whatsoever. It is a great initiative, and the begrudging acceptance by the Leader of the Opposition shows where his thoughts on this really lie.</DOC>

 - I am certainly not blaming anyone at all. What I was trying to do was explain a formula driven process - and one journalist out of the 15 there seemed not to understand my explanation. I am happy to plead guilty to that. If that is the worst crime I commit, it will be a pretty good week. You get good articles and bad articles; I am happy to take the odd bad one with the odd good one.The simple thing about the savings on the changing to GP registrars is that it is a formula driven approach that has been used by the Department of Finance and Administration for a long time. In fact, I asked my department just before question time how long we had used this formula with the Department of  Finance and Administration. They said, `At least five years.' Who was the Minister for Finance five years ago? Kim; it was your formula. So, if there are any problems with the formula, talk to him.</DOC>

 - Thank you, Prime Minister. As the Prime Minister has just commented, this government is committed to raising the quality of education for all Australian school children. That is evidenced by the fact that we now have agreement on Australia's first national literacy standards. It is evidenced by the fact that we are now putting more and more money into schools to help vocational education and training courses get under way for the 70 per cent of students who are not going straight on to university.This budget reflects the coalition's commitment to increasing the quality of education for all Australian school children in government and non-government schools. The simple fact is that the coalition government has increased funding for schools, has put more money into schools, and is putting more money into government schools.The only people who do not seem to realise this are the Australian Education Union and their ventriloquist doll here in the House, the member for Werriwa, who has issued at their behest one of his very rare press releases on education. We rarely hear from the member for Werriwa on education and this is a matter of concern to those sitting beside him, but because the Australian Education Union has provided him with a few figures he has decided to put out a press release on funding for government schools.He claims in this press release that funding for government schools diminishes in real terms by some $89 million in this budget.  This is absolutely wrong. He has reached this extraordinary conclusion because he has tried all sorts of statistical manipulations and used figures which are not correct. Let me correct them. He quotes a figure for the enrolment benchmark adjustment of $270 million. The correct estimate is $70 million; he was only $200 million out. - You can imagine how their spending and taxing policies are going to look after the member for Werriwa has applied his great mind to them. In this press release he also applies a discount for price increases derived from the price increase between two years, 1994-95 and 1995-96, to the difference between this year's school funding and last year's school funding. Absolutely incorrect. Let me put the actual figures on the record for members of the House. In comparison to the last year of the Labor Party in government this government is spending $147 million more on government schools than in 1996. In New South Wales government schools are getting $47 million more than they did in the last year of the Labor government. In Victoria and Queensland government schools are getting $32 million more. And so it goes on across all the states and territories. Western Australia is getting $17 million more for its government schools and South Australia is getting $9 million more. The member for Werriwa has completely overlooked the funding in the joint schools programs. He has completely overlooked the money coming from the Australian National Training Authority for vocational education and school to work programs in schools. He has completely overlooked the funding coming to schools through the financial assistance grants as well as the specific purpose grants. This government is committing more money for government schools.Let me comment on what is perhaps the saddest element of the claims being made by the member for Werriwa and the Australian Education Union. They are going out there telling parents in this country that government schools are being run down. They are prepared to sacrifice the interests of government  schools on the alter of their short-term political interests with these totally misleading, viciously untrue statements being made by the member for Werriwa. We will continue to put on the record the fact that this government is committing more resources to government schools, not less, and government schools and government school students are better off than they have ever been before as a result of this budget.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable gentleman for his question. What is clear to those in the tourism industry is that this is the best budget the tourism industry has ever seen. This is the best government the tourism industry has ever known. I do not make those assertions lightly. Indeed, among the remarks made after the budget there was one made by a man called John Brown. - What is clear is that this year's budget has seen an increase  in the promotions budget of 13 per cent. Over four years that is $359 million to the Australian Tourism Commission. This is the highest appropriation ever made to the Tourism Commission by any government in the history of this nation.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Leichhardt for his question. I know that he is very interested in issues relating to tourism and also to the important protection and integrity of Australia's borders. In that context, I think honourable members ought to be aware that one of the growth industries in the world recently has been the business of smuggling people into what are often seen as soft targets. This government is keen to assist with the development of tourism from emerging markets but it wants to do so in such a way that we do not allow criminals and other non-bona fide travellers to enter Australia. - Yes, it will have a significant role in that issue. I am surprised that the honourable member does not have a real interest in this matter. What we are seeking to do here is to balance the legitimate interest of Australia's tourist industry in expanding opportunities in what are seen as emerging markets. They are markets which are essentially very vulnerable to exploitation by people who want to enter Australia for other purposes and other reasons.The fact is that we have seen a growing number of people seeking to enter Australia for non-bona fide reasons and frequently  using fraudulent documentation. The fact is that every non-bona fide traveller who enters Australia and pursues every legal avenue to remain can cost the Australian taxpayer up to $60,000 in application processing, litigation and removal charges. It is important that the tourist industry is aware of the potential and large costs to the Australian community as a whole if we do not manage these sorts of issues very effectively.The fact is that with the emerging markets of China and India, where there are significant middle-class populations but also very large numbers of people who seek to move, clandestinely and for immigration purposes, the only way in which that growth is going to be managed is if you have, effectively, a better and more effective visa processing system in place in such offshore places. The $50 charge that will apply to tourists from countries where the electronic travel authority is not available is a charge that will be used to manage extra resources that will be required to properly ensure that the inherent risk in those emerging markets is not seen.The fact is that 70 per cent of tourists seeking permission to come to Australia at the moment are issued with the electronic travel authority. They will not pay a $50 charge. In the majority of markets, such as Japan, the overwhelming majority of tourists apply for, and receive, an ETA and do not pay any government charge at all. The ETA has been a very successful operation in a very short period of time. It provides certainty and it avoids the down side for countries which have implemented visa-free arrangements, where there are delays at airports, particularly for unprocessed but incoming passengers.The charge will contribute to an efficient visa processing system and a more robust border monitoring capacity, while ensuring that the streamlined capacity for bona fide travellers is in place. It will ensure that we undertake more rigorous assessment in those countries which have a high overstay risk, but where emerging markets are seen. It will ensure that we able to post more Australian based staff, employ more locally engaged staff in countries where there is a known risk of fraud -  - No, I am not. It will also ensure that we have more effective immigration staff at Australia's international airports. We will have an upgrading of our movement alert system and, if I might say for the honourable member for Leichhardt, we will also be placing extra staff in the Torres Strait to deal with the problems that have been identified there. The fact is that these arrangements can only benefit the tourism industry. They will play a very important part in ensuring that the great majority of tourists are able to access Australia fee free but, in those countries where there are high risks - and they have been clearly identified - there will be charges that are comparable to the charges made by other countries that operate similar systems in high risk locations. It is important to understand that it is not the Australian taxpayer who is going to have to suffer a significant cost as a result of abuse of the visa entry system, it is those who come from countries where there are high risks involved who will be playing a part in meeting the costs of ensuring that we are able to properly assess those who want to enter Australia.</DOC>

 - I think the very first point that must be made in response to that question is that the budget papers under this government take a comprehensive look at all matters which are at risk and very much up-front indicate what those risks are. That of course comes under the charter of budget honesty, and the transparency of this government's budget, is in stark contrast to the way in which we saw cover-ups and other issues hidden constantly when Labor was in government.What the honourable member did suggest is correct: a number of aspects relating to litigation are considered by the government. That is a process which Finance looks at, which Finance seeks advice on and which then ultimately is placed, particularly where it relates to litigation, in some of those areas of compensation relating to, for example, the Voyager decision and some of those other matters in the defence services.In respect of those matters which are at risk, there is a  comprehensive look at it; it is done sensibly; it is done objectively. It is done in the same way as it was undoubtedly done by Finance when the Leader of the Opposition was the Minister for Finance. The way in which it is presented, of course, is much more transparent these days.On the question of indemnity, let me also say that is a matter in which the rules have not altered, and I make no further comment in respect of the matter.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Longman for his question. Indeed, Treasurer, with your budget this week there has been an outbreak of laudatory comment. Among the great chorus of those heaping praise on the budget is the tourism industry. The streets and avenues of this continent are ringing with praise. In Darwin, for example, Mr George Dunn, CEO of the Northern Territory Tourism Commission, has welcomed the federal budget's allocation of extra funds to tourism. Mr Bruce Baird, the Chief Executive Officer of the Tourism Council of Australia and another great Australian, has welcomed a record increase in funding for tourism's budget. But more than that, others have joined the chorus. A Mr John Brown, who may be known to some of those on the other side -  - Yes, the John Brown, a former Labor minister for tourism, is reported as follows:Chairman John Brown congratulated the Federal Government and Tourism Minister Andrew Thomson for the significantly increased allocation for tourism in the Budget handed down tonight. Mr Brown was fulsome in his praise for Mr Thomson's efforts.Modesty forbids me from going further. - Are you sure you want to hear it? Mr Brown says:The minister deserves the applause of the industry and its one million workers for the Budget results.What is clear is that this has been a great budget for tourism and a very bad budget for Labor.</DOC>

 - I wonder whether this question was run past Wayne Swan because, at a meeting of the federal parliamentary shadow cabinet, they had a discussion recently on the native title legislation. To put it bluntly, the instruction from the Leader of the Opposition was that perhaps, when you are talking to certain groups in Australia, you should drip with compassion but, when you go to Queensland, be careful of what you say. When you go to Queensland, you run your remarks past Wayne Swan before you utter anything about native title. - Perhaps he ought to call in the plumber from Hotham. Or perhaps he was responsible for the report in the newspaper. This is also the man who authorised Ross Free, the Labor candidate in the Lindsay by-election, to do a sleazy preference deal with Australians Against Further Immigration. You are the last man in Australia who has got any credibility to ask me a question like that.</DOC>

 - I am happy to answer that question from the member for Eden-Monaro. I thank him for an excellent function last night. But I must say that he has really asked me the wrong question. I am a bit disappointed by the question, because I have been sitting here the whole question time waiting for my Dubai special and it never came. Why don't we spend the rest of the afternoon and give them a chance to give us a belting? The leaking plumber there announces the tactics and the tactics committee dismiss him and we do not get our Dubai questions. I am in Dubai withdrawal here. Dubai is a wonderful place to go to and I highly recommend that people go to Dubai. It is a great place for training, a great place for a holiday. It is about time this weak, pathetic opposition asked us a few questions. - You know what you had to do when you stood then? You had to repudiate the member for Charlton. That is what you had to do. - You ought to stand up for Australian exporters for a change, instead of standing shoulder to shoulder with the MUA and your leaking plumber mate. - On behalf of all those small business people who have got cargo on the Columbus Canada , we say that it is about time that you for once stood up against the thuggery of the MUA.I want to put aside my disappointment about the failure of the opposition to mount any sort of attack today and say, however, as this is the last question for the week and therefore the last answer, that I was in Eden-Monaro last night. I tell you what people in small business were saying. They were saying, `Treasurer, you did a damn good job with your budget.' That is what they are saying. They compliment this government on giving priority to small business, because it is the engine room of this economy. This government is proudly pro small business. One of those practical measures in the budget was about the millennium bug. I confess I do not know how to use the VCR, let alone understand the millennium bug, but I do understand that it is a problem. This government understands the problems of small business, and that is why we are doing things about it.As we saw in the budget, we provided some tax concessions for dealing with this problem. It allows for initial diagnosis of the problem, modification of computer software to make it compliant, modification or complete replacement of a computer chip to make the com  puter compliant with the Y2K problem and acquisition of new software, including upgrades or the substantial rebuilding of current software which is predominantly aimed at ensuring Y2K compliance. Prime Minister, this is just another example of where your government stands for small business and does the right thing. This is the best tax concession, I am told, pretty well anywhere in the OECD for small business. It demonstrates again in a practical way that helps small business that this government is for small business and small business is going to grow and prosper as a result.</DOC>

 - I suppose I could always put it in l-a-w, law, couldn't I? I might remind those opposite that the Australian record for dishonouring commitments on taxation is held by the Australian Labor Party. - The Australian Labor Party went to the 1993 election denouncing the plans of the coalition to reform Australia's taxation system. They said, `Vote against the Liberals so your indirect tax does not go up.' And what did they do? In the August budget of 1993 they increased taxation on every conceivable indirect taxation item. It even provoked a violent reaction from the leaders of the trade union movement in the then Prime Minister's home state of New South Wales, when people like Michael Easson and Peter Sams - lions of the trade union movement and the Australian Labor Party in New South Wales - denounced it.Let me say one thing to the Leader of the Opposition: I can guarantee to him and to the Australian people that the taxation plan we unveil before the election will further add to the stability, the safety and the security which my government has brought to the conduct of the affairs of the Australian nation since we were entrusted with office in March 1996. - You were thrown out of office because people did not believe you. And you will continue to be seen, particularly on issues such as taxation, as utterly and completely untrustworthy.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, I am aware. I saw on the television last night and I read in the papers this morning that the Leader of the Opposition is going to sometime announce the details of what he calls `a tax credit proposal for working families'. I have got a very simple message for the working families of Australia: if you make Kim Beazley Prime Minister, any tax cut he might offer you will be more than eaten up in the higher interest rate that his government will bring.Of all of the areas of economic achievement of which I am particularly proud in the time that I have been Prime Minister and the coalition has been in government, we have presided over the largest falls in housing interest rates since the end of World War II. We have given to the Australian people - we have given to the working men and women of Australia - falls in their mortgage interest rates which are the equivalent of a pay rise of $100 a week. We have produced interest rate falls which represent a reduction on the average loan paid by an Australian home buyer of $330 a month. And you contrast that, Mr Speaker, with the record of the Leader of the Opposition when, for the 13 years that he was the senior minister in former Labor governments, we saw housing interest rates in 1990 go to 17½ per cent - they are now about seven per cent - and we saw small business interest rates go to 20½ per cent. And the thing that would be most at risk under a Labor government would be the low interest rates my government has brought to home buyers and small businesses.So I say to anybody who may have a transitory attraction to any sort of policy offered by the Leader of the Opposition, `Just think of how it would be gobbled up almost overnight in the higher rates that would be a product of a Labor government led by the Leader of the Opposition.'My government, in so many areas, has brought safety, security and stability to the  Australian community. Our budget has protected the Australian economy against the turbulence of what is going on in our part of the world. And I would say to the working men and women of Australia, `You have had lower interest rates. You have had security. You have had stability. Don't risk it with this mob opposite. They had 13 years and they gave you the highest interest rates you have ever experienced in your lifetime, not only for small business but for home buyers. They gave you the highest level of unemployment since the years of the Great Depression and they gave you an immense sense of economic insecurity. And that, of course, is why you threw them out, neck and crop, in March 1996.'</DOC>

 - I am fascinated that the Leader of the Opposition has discovered an interest in the taxation system that he believes operates unfairly towards low wage and salary earners. I remind the Leader of the Opposition that it is Labor's taxation system about which we are now expressing concern. Let me move to the question of fairness and unfairness in the Australian taxation system. I simply say to the Leader of the Opposition and to all of those who are interested in the issue of taxation reform that my government intends to reform the Australian taxation system, because the current system which you defend is unfair. That is why we want to change the tax system.What you are inviting the Australian people to believe is that the current taxation system is fair, and you have to do that because it is your taxation system. You are the party that for 13 years made the wholesale taxation system increasingly unfair. You are the government which, in 1993, despite the solemn promises you made to the Australian people -  - The most relevant thing about the taxation debate in Australia today is fairness. The most objectionable thing about Labor's taxation system - the system they want to preserve, protect and defend - is that it is manifestly unfair. We want to change the system to make it fairer. We want to change the system to take out the unfairness. We want to address the unfairness that you did not have the courage to address when  you were in government, and we intend to do it.</DOC>

 - I did see reports that the honourable member for Griffith alluded to in the weekend papers on some tax benefits to be delivered at some future time by a Labor government. Here we go again. We have heard it all before. Who will forget - the Australian people certainly won't - that  before the 1993 election there was the promise of tax cuts, the l-a-w tax cuts promised by a Labor government? The 1993 Labor budget delivered exactly the opposite because, instead of there being tax cuts, we saw an increase in the wholesale sales tax.Prior to the 1993 budget, the wholesale sales tax on fridges was 10 per cent. After the 1993 Labor budget, the wholesale sales tax on fridges was 12 per cent. The tax on soap and on toothpaste prior to the 1993 Labor budget was 20 per cent; after the 1993 Labor budget, 22 per cent. In the One Nation statement, Labor said, `We will permanently bring sales tax on motor vehicles, the family car, down to 15 per cent.' - Let me just repeat that under Labor the family fridges went from 10 per cent up to 12 per cent and, in the One Nation statement, they were going to permanently reduce the sales tax on cars to 15 per cent. What happened to the family car?  Up the sales tax went to 22 per cent. If you could afford the family car, we saw the excise fees go up 7c for leaded petrol and 5c for unleaded petrol.What we see is Labor again promising benefits to the family. Let us just contrast that with what this government, the coalition government, has delivered in the way of benefits to the family. The family tax initiative, commencing on 1 January last year and fully in place by 1 July last year, brought benefits to ordinary families of some $15.40 per fortnight for those families where there was a double income. So families with two incomes and with children are $400 per year better off under this government. In the case of a single-income family, they are $900 a year better off - there is a fridge at least in that - which amounts to some $34.60 per fortnight.So the stark contrast is Labor five years ago promising family benefits, just as the Leader of the Opposition did yesterday, and delivering the opposite; this coalition government acting on its promise made before the last election and delivering those benefits through family tax reductions. If you want to see the real benefit for families that have come from a coalition government - the Prime Minister mentioned it just a short time ago - it represents the reduction from about 10½ per cent on home mortgages to around 6½ per cent, and that is some $75 per week. There is a lot of fridges in any year from $75 per week delivered by this government to the average family who own their own home. This is the government that represents families; this is the government that has delivered to those families.</DOC>

 - Let me say this to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition: what I will rule in is a change to the Australian taxation system that delivers greater fairness. What I will rule in is a change to the Australian taxation system that addresses the rorts that you refused to address. What I will rule in is a change to the Australian taxation system that provides enduring benefits to Australian families and not benefits that are going to evaporate as a result of high interest rate policies. Let me say again to those who sit opposite: you can indulge all the rhetoric you like -  - What I will rule in is an approach to the national accounts and to the budget of this country that is based upon responsible levels of expenditure producing lower levels of taxation. I am very proud of the fact that we have turned that $10½ billion deficit that you finally owned up to, much to the embarrassment of your leader, into a surplus over the last two years overwhelmingly by the exercise of expenditure restraint. - Mr Speaker, let me just say again to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that you had 13 years to fix the Australian taxation system. You had 13 years to address the mixtures within the Australian taxation system. What you did was you allowed it to run further and further into disrepute. As the Minister for finance has reminded the Leader of the Opposition, you said one thing to the Australian public before the 1993 election and then you did the complete opposite. It enables me to say again to the Australian public that not only would a Labor government's high interest rate policies flowing from their high debt and high deficit policies wipe out the value of any transitory tax cuts but also just as in 1993 the Leader of the Opposition opposed the indirect tax -  - It is not a rambling rant; it is a reminder of recent economic and political history. It is a reminder to the Australian people that you said you were for lower indirect tax but you put up the sales tax on fridges from 20 per cent to 22 per cent. When you were finance minister you ran up huge deficits. If you had a go again, you would do the same thing. I will emphatically  rule in the introduction of a taxation system that restores fairness to the working men and women of Australia.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Herbert for his question. The member for Herbert is well known in his electorate and in this House as being a tireless worker for the small business community. Who could forget the previous Prime Minister telling small business that this is as good as it gets. It was typical of the arrogance and disregard for small business that typified the previous Labor government. The latest tax announcement from the Labor Party again should remind small business that, whatever the Labor Party reckon they are going to be offering, the people who will be paying in higher interest rates is of course the small business community, as they paid over and over and over again with high interest rates the whole time Labor was in office.We all know who pays for Labor's profligate spending - that is, the small business community. Who could ever forget that it was the small business community paying over 20 per cent for their interest rates just a few short years ago under the Labor Party. How could a business survive paying interest rates at 20 per cent, for some of them with risk margins at 22 per cent, 23 per cent and 24 per cent? - As the member for Bendigo says, a lot of them did not survive. They went broke. Then the former Prime Minister had the cheek to say that this was the recession we had to have after he sent a whole lot of small businesses broke.This government gives priority to small business. That means that we give priority to properly managing the national economy.  That is why we are very pleased that for the benefit of small business we have locked in lower interest rates, lower inflation and generally a much better economic climate. Small business has experienced five interest rate cuts since March 1996. That is a fall of 2½ per cent. That has given small business the best interest rates for 33 years! On a $100,000 loan that is a saving of $2,500 a year.The other good news is to be seen in the recent report from the Reserve Bank. They said, and I quote from their May bulletin:Signs of competition in small business finance have increased over the past six months.So we have not only delivered lower interest rates but also improved the competition in the banking industry. We are seeing more competition and that is good for small businesses as well.If you look at just a few headlines from recent times, on 30 March Westpac announced a cut - good for small business. We then demanded that the others follow. On 4 April the Commonwealth Bank was lowering rates and on 1 May the ANZ followed. This government delivers for small business. The prospect for small business if ever Labor were to be re-elected would be a repeat of what we had from them before - higher interest rates and the death knell for many small businesses.We have done a great job. I compliment the Treasurer and the acting Treasurer on what they have done for small business - that is, delivering for small business safety, security and stability.</DOC>

 - I had not actually seen that comment but the answer is, no, I do not  agree with it. What I do agree with is getting rid of a taxation system, which you support, which currently, for example, has the following consequence. This is a snapshot of that brilliantly fair, decent, equitable and family friendly taxation policy that the Australian Labor  Party supports. - I think the Australian public should bear this in mind when they start hearing some of the scaremongering from the Labor Party opposite. The more those opposite interject the more you know their vulnerability on this particular issue. -  - Come on, fellas; give us plenty of noise! You know all about it. This is apparently what the member for Cunningham wants. He wants a taxation system that in the kitchen does this: it taxes detergent and other cleaners at 22 per cent. - I tell you what it taxes at 12 per cent -  - flavoured milk, fruit juice -  -  - Mr Speaker -  - I better have a look to see if there is anybody else. Returning to the reason why I do not agree with the comment made by the small business operator mentioned by the member for Cunningham -  - No, I don't, Stephen. I do not. She is badly misguided. The reason she is badly misguided is that the present system is absolutely unfair, lopsided, inequitable and in need of very, very great change. I think there is something outrageously unfair and anti-family about a system that would impose a 12 per cent tax on flavoured milk, a 12 per cent tax on fruit juice, a 12 per cent tax on biscuits, a 12 per cent tax on ice-cream, on cutlery, the fridge -  - It gets even worse when you move from the kitchen into the bathroom. You know what Gareth Evans and Paul Keating and Kim Beazley imposed sales tax on at the rate of 22 per cent? Cosmetics, shampoo, soap, deodorant, toothpaste. Oh, but weren't they generous! They put a bare 12 per cent on the hand basin and the bath. Gee, they were generous! They exempted toothbrushes and medicated mouthwash.When you go into the lounge room, it makes the kitchen and the bathroom look positively benign. You go into the lounge room and you get a 32 per cent tax on the tele, the video and the stereo and a 22 per cent tax on compact discs, computers and bric-a-brac. On top of that, the Labor Party wants to maintain for young Australians the price of imported CDs at $6 or $7 more than they should be. You are more interested in helping multinational companies than you are in reducing the price of CDs for young Australians. - I had actually reached the penultimate part of my answer. The real demonstration of fairness Beazley style is that  he supports a tax system that says, that if you can afford to buy a Lear jet, you pay no sales tax; but, if you want to buy a family car, you pay sales tax at 22 per cent. That is why I want to change the present system, and you are a disgrace for trying to obstruct our efforts.</DOC>

 - As the honourable member for Groom and all honourable members know only too well, the Australian government has been very concerned about the political, humanitarian and economic crisis which has beset Indonesia over the last nine or 10 months. As a government, we clearly have wanted to do all we possibly could to help a friend and a neighbour in very real difficulties. With that in mind, we have helped in two very important ways.First of all, we have played an extremely significant role in putting together the IMF package and, indeed, encouraging the IMF to ensure that that package is one that can be implemented in a socially acceptable way in Indonesia. As a result of the IMF's own package, the IMF will altogether provide something like $A55 billion worth of external financing for the Indonesian economy. I do not think anyone would doubt that a figure of $55 billion is an enormous amount of money. It is clearly a package which is necessary at this time, but I just draw the House's attention to the fact that it is a significant amount of money.The second thing we have done is play a very important role in encouraging the World Bank to coordinate a humanitarian effort to assist Indonesia. This has come together very successfully, with donors offering around $500 million worth of assistance. We ourselves announced a $30 million assistance package three or so weeks ago and, in total, we will provide something like $50 million in humanitarian assistance to address the current  economic and food security situation largely over and above our normal aid program for Indonesia. So Australia has done a great deal to help Indonesia at this time and it is appropriate that we should do so. If further assistance is needed, then, naturally enough, we will have a look at that. Let me say that we will keep this matter under review.It does remind me to say, though, that I have noticed the Leader of the Opposition and other people in the Labor Party going around saying that what Australia should do is coordinate and support an Indonesian version of the Marshall Plan. I only make that point because we have of course been doing a great deal. We have already been helping with the $55 billion IMF package, and we have already been helping to coordinate through the World Bank the $500 million humanitarian package. I think it is important that the Labor Party recognise the tremendous amount of assistance that has already being provided for Indonesia.At this stage I do not think, over and above those very significant packages, the urgent need is so much for additional funds as per the Marshall Plan, which provided in its own time $US13 billion of assistance to Europe, which is the equivalent of about $US127 billion in today's terms. The challenge for the Indonesian economy is to get the exchange rate back up from where it currently is so as to make the operation of the economy viable again. That can only be achieved if, firstly, political stability is achieved through a constructive program of political reform and, secondly, there is a continuation of the difficult task of economic reform consistent with the IMF package.They are the things that need to be done in Indonesia and I think President Habibie and his government well recognise that. Let me also say that they are very grateful, as were their predecessors, for the support that Australia and the international community has provided for the Indonesian economy. There is tremendous support from this country for the people of Indonesia at this difficult time. There is a great deal of support from the international community as a whole. Some of the task must be left to the Indonesian  government itself to ensure that there is appropriate political and economic reform.</DOC>

 - The government will be introducing reforms to the tax system which will be fair to all Australians. We have put into place policies for education which have opened doors that were closed for decades by the Labor Party, and I welcome the opportunity to tell the House about these. - The Labor Party perpetuated inequity in education policy throughout its entire time in office. When it left power, 30 per cent of young people could not read and write properly. The 70 per cent of young people who did not go from school to university were neglected. - The government has now set in place a tax reform task force which is looking at how we can extend equity to all Australians through the tax system, and we will announce our decisions at the appropriate time. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Bowman for her question, and it is obvious that she struck a very sensitive nerve on the other side of the House. The government is committed to providing every Australian school child with a quality education. That, of course, is why this government has worked so hard to introduce national literacy standards and to introduce vocational education opportunities for the 70 per cent of students not going on to university and why we have increased funding to both government and non-government schools. - The government is also particularly committed to the rights of parents to choose the best school for their child. That is why one of our proudest achievements in education was the abolition of Labor's new schools policy when we came to office. It was an unfair, dictatorial policy which prevented low income families from effectively exercising educational choice because it refused to fund needy schools at a level appropriate to their educational need.Many battling families in this country in suburbs such as Bankstown, Rooty Hill and Prestons in Sydney and Broadmeadows, Werribee and Coburg in Melbourne have welcomed the opportunity now to establish low fee schools which give them the opportunity for choice, which they were seeking. In the past two years, since we have taken this policy decision, some 76 new low fee schools have been established, and many of them have been in these lower income suburbs. Parents who were formerly denied choice by the Labor Party have now been able to get the schools that they believe will give their children the choice that they need.What has the Labor Party had to say about this? Over the weekend, the Leader of the Opposition fronted up to the Australian Education Union conference. He has been  waiting by the mailbox for months to get the education policy for the Labor Party from the Australian Education Union. Finally they asked him along, they gave him the script and he obediently went through it. If there is one thing they do not like - they do not like a lot of things, they do not like literacy standards, they have opposed literacy standards - it is our jobs pathway program which gives school leavers jobs. They do not like that. In fact, Sharon Burrows, the secretary of that union, described that policy as obscene. But the thing they do not like most of all is school choice. They do not like school choice because they want to lock low income families into schools when they would prefer to have another choice, and you know that is the case.The Leader of the Opposition has, therefore, obliged them by saying that the Labor Party would restore Labor's new schools policy. The effect of this, of course, is to threaten the existence of each of these 76 low fee schools that have been established. I am sure the thousands of parents who have taken the opportunity opened under our policy will make their views known at the next election when they know that Labor Party members are going to be coming along and closing these schools. The Leader of the Opposition may be interested to know that three of these schools are in his own electorate - the Foundation Christian School, the `Living Waters' Lutheran Primary School and Tranby College - none of whom would have been funded had it not been for our change of policy.Will you be going along there and telling these schools you are closing them down? Will you be going along there and telling these schools there will be no more schools of this kind? You are a narrow, sectional, selfish party which pursues the interest of those supporting you at the expense of the battling families of this country. We will stand up for the low income families of this country, and you will be punished by them at the next election. - </DOC>

 - I thank the member for McPherson for his question. Can I say, Mr Speaker, at the outset that this nation is very proud of those who served in Vietnam because they served in one of the longest involvements of this nation in war in this century. We are certainly all well aware that our Deputy Prime Minister and Leader of the National Party is, indeed, a returned Vietnam veteran, as is the member for McPherson. The Vietnam veterans have long sought a very comprehensive study of the effects of war on their health and also on that of their families. -  - If the members of the opposition would remain silent: I see this as a very significant issue and I think this House should take pity on those who interject from the other side of the House.The Vietnam veterans have long sought a study of this nature and this morbidity study, which is the morbidity study of male Vietnam veterans, is the first to be released in this country. Let me say that not only did we study the health effects of war on the males who served in Vietnam but also on the 484 females who served in Vietnam, and those results are being compiled as we speak.The response we had from the Vietnam veterans who were surveyed is one of the best results a government could ever have sought to achieve. Something like 76 per cent of those who were surveyed returned those survey forms. I think that demonstrates a  commitment from the Vietnam veterans because they support the process that this government put in place.Those who were posted to Vietnam were amongst the fittest and healthiest that this nation could have serving and send to Vietnam. That is why we have said that we are concerned by the findings in this report. The government has already said that we are concerned about the health of Vietnam veterans and also the health of families of Vietnam veterans.The next stage of this process is to validate the findings in this report. That has the support of the Vietnam veterans organisations. In fact, I spent the weekend in Darwin at the annual conference of the Vietnam Veterans Association of Australia and they are part of the process and have also been supporting the processes of this government and the action that we have taken. The validation will be done by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, and that will also protect the confidentiality of those who responded initially to the survey.The issues identified in the report are already mainly covered in the compensation of our repatriation system for those veterans with those conditions. We have the best compensation for our veterans of any repatriation system in the world. I think that is widely acknowledged by many in this House and also by veterans from all conflicts.Can I also say that we are not going to leave any stone unturned as we go through the process, working with the Vietnam Veterans Association, until we validate this process. Validation is important. We are taking this issue extremely seriously. Just to add further to the answer: we recently committed $750,000 to Vietnam veterans' research including research into agent white - which might be commonly known as agent orange - particularly in relation to genetic birth defects. So we do take the issue very seriously. It is a most comprehensive report.I commend to all members of this House that, if they have veterans - particularly Vietnam veterans - or their families in their area, they make sure they avail themselves of a copy of this report and work with the  government and the processes so that we can get to the bottom of this very serious health issue.</DOC>

 - I can inform the House that the Columbus Canada  is still subject to a blockade off the West Coast of the US. - It is the case that members of the Labor Party like the member for Charlton are still supporting this illegal action against Australian exporters. I can tell the House that this blockade is being run by the International Longshoremen, which is a US union affiliated with the International Transport Federation - the ITF - and I can tell the House that John Coombs is the regional director of the ITF. He is not just the national secretary of the MUA, but he is also the spokesperson, the activist, for the ITF in Australia and has, for many years, been an executive of the ITF. He is an Australian who is organising this US union to blockade Australian exports with the support of the federal Labor Party against Australian jobs.I welcome the fact that the ACCC has taken action to seek injunctions in the Federal Court and that the ACCC, in its statement last week, particularly referred to its concerns of the boycott of the Columbus Canada. There are particular reasons why this cargo is as important, if not more important, than others. The Columbus Canada has on board a cargo of gluten, which is a wheat based product. It is  a very good export for the Australian wheat industry and it is supplying the bread making industry in the US.The company particularly concerned is the Manildra Group. The Manildra Group has spent tens of millions, if not hundreds of millions, of dollars in recent years putting in capital equipment so as to be able to build up this very important export market for Australia. That means jobs for Australians. When he was asked about this issue on Countrywide on ABC radio on 21 May, the General Manager of the Manildra Flour Mills, Peter Simpson, said,The impact of the blockade and the ban on the Columbus Canada was twofold, including the fact that it certainly cost the potential loss of a client.That is particularly important because they have been battling to get into the US market. They are against the Europeans. One of the criteria for the successful and continued entry into the US market is our capacity to be a reliable supplier.The fact is that the Labor Party's support for the MUA represents the export of Australian jobs to Europe, and it ought to be condemned. It ought to be condemned for its shameful anti-export jobs policy and support of the MUA. This dispute has shown where certain people stand on important issues. We had the member for Charlton and other Labor members supporting the MUA. We had the member for Calare supporting the Labor Party on the stevedoring levy legislation and then not bothering to turn up, but he is in fact supporting the Labor Party against jobs in his own electorate, as this company is based in that electorate.What a contrast that makes to the Liberal member for Gilmore, who also has part of the Manildra Group in her electorate. What she did, as we all did on this side, was to vote for jobs. We voted for exports. This is the party that is determined to see a reformed waterfront for the jobs it will create.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Parramatta for his point of order, which I thought was appropriate but which has been ruled out of order. -  - I was complimenting the member for Parramatta. In answer to the question from the member for Jagajaga, which she prefaced by asking whether I will follow the example of the senior minister in the Health and Family Services portfolio, and I certainly do, the Minister for Health and Family Services said:The issue will be dealt with by Cabinet and, when that matter is determined, the Government will make a decision. But, in making decisions about the future of taxation reform in this country - and this is the part you should listen to - we will make sure that all elements of the Australian community will be treated fairly and with equity.That is something you had the opportunity to do for 13 years but chose not to.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, it really is woeful, even on a serious issue like this, that the Labor Party continue with their puerile interjections. I very much hope that those who are viewing this question time recognise that constant flow of interjections, even on an issue like the Northern Ireland peace process. The Australian government, the coalition and the people of Australia warmly welcome the referenda that have taken place in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The size of the majority of both of those votes was most impressive. We regard this as one of the most historic developments in Irish politics in over 70 years. It is an enormous step towards peace, although it has to be understood that it is only the beginning of a very long march towards peace.This will require goodwill, understanding and compromise on the part of all the people of Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland to ensure that this peace process is carried through. The Australian government calls on all those who have until now remained outside the process to join the majority who have chosen a peaceful future over the divisions of the past. I have already commended the leaders and participants who have  worked tirelessly to make this achievement possible. - In the face of constant interjections and interruptions from the opposition, let me reiterate that on this side of the House we warmly congratulate Prime Minister Blair for the wonderful job he has done and indeed for building on the achievements of John Major before him. We also congratulate the Taoiseach of Ireland, Bertie Ahern, who has played such an enormously important role and those in Northern Ireland who have been party to these discussions.The honourable member for Stirling asked what role Australia had played. Let me say that not only has Australia shown great goodwill and commitment to the peace process in Northern Ireland for a very long time but, very importantly, the Australian government has over a number of years been providing funds for the International Fund for Ireland. When I was in the Republic of Ireland earlier this year, I handed over an additional cheque for $1½ million to the International Fund for Ireland.We have been delighted to provide support for that fund, and it is important that people know some of the useful things it has done. For example, we were able to bring some young unemployed people to Australia - to Brisbane and also to Bendigo - from both sides of the border in order to help those people improve their training, improve their job opportunities and to develop tolerance and understanding.On behalf of the government, on behalf of the coalition and on behalf of the Australian people, let me say that I wish the people of Northern Ireland a prosperous and peaceful future. They have done a wonderful job in supporting the peace process. It has got real momentum now, and we very much urge all of them to continue that path to peace.</DOC>

 - I congratulate the member for Batman on the question; that was largely comprehensible. But I say that the government has not abolished a free job service either to unemployed people or to employers. The question focused on the matter of charging of employers. Let me inform the House that employers can advertise their jobs free of charge through the Australian Job Network touch screen system simply by dialling the teleservice vacancy centre on 131715. Many employers are taking advantage of this free service that is offered to them.There are also a number of members of the Job Network who are offering employers the free lodgment of vacancies and the free processing of those vacancies. The Salvation Army is one of these, Mission Australia is another, and there are quite a number of other members of the Job Network offering this service. So it is a matter of choice. It is a commercial decision on the part of the Job Network member and the employer in relation to fees.As a matter of principle, the charging of fees to employers for employment services is not new. In 1989 the previous government introduced fee-for-service arrangements that allowed the CES to charge employers for recruitment services - this service was known as CES Plus - so the principle of charging employers was established by the previous government. It is a principle that we have carried on in the construction of the Job Network but, as I say, it is a matter of commercial decision for Job Network members to decide what fees they charge and, if employers do not like the service they receive for those fees, they can go to a Job Network member that does not charge fees or they can lodge their vacancy free of charge with the teleservice vacancy centre.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. If there is one thing farmers will never forget in this country, it is that under Labor interest rates for them reached well into the mid-20s and they stayed there for a very long time. At a time when we were trying to ensure their competitiveness on international markets, Labor was busily exporting the prosperity of Australia's farmers to other countries where interest rates were at more reasonable levels. While that was happening, because of the very high margins in this country over and above our competitors, speculation in the Australian dollar also impacted very savagely on Australia's farmers.Farmers indicated to us in the last election campaign that there was nothing they wanted more than economic management of the sort that would lower interest rates. And we have delivered; we have delivered in spadefuls. There have been no less than five interest rate cuts since we came to government, and they are now benefiting farmers to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars every year.Members might like to think of the difference between a rate of 25 per cent and a rate of seven or eight per cent for Australia's average farmer with a debt of $132,000 or in Queensland $174,000 - in some areas of Queensland it is double and triple that. In Western Australia, it is about $180,000 per farm. For a farmer trying to stabilise debt or a farmer trying to expand his operations or place the next generation on the land with some sort of future, low interest rates are extremely important.Exactly the same applies for value adding. That is an area which is utterly dependent upon a cheap supply of capital for us to be competitive internationally. I have always strongly supported value adding, contrary to assertions by the member for Burke. Under  the sort of regime which the opposition ran, their attempts to value add ended up in farmers receiving less for their products because we were not competitive. The fact is that we are now competitive. So where value adding contracted under their economic management, over the last 12 months the net number of jobs in agribusiness in Australia has increased by 20,000 which is the highest growth rate in jobs in any sector of the Australian economy. And it has happened under our economic equations because we have interest rates down. The next farmer I meet who wants to return to the economic management of the side opposite will be the first one.</DOC>

 - I am absolutely delighted that the member for Dobell asked me this question because he was the man who went on AM  straight after the Treasurer and deliberately misrepresented what he had said, so much so that even the ABC found it necessary to run an apology the following day. The Treasurer was not saying what you are were alleging. We made our position clear about the maintenance of Medicare at the last election. We have made our position clear about not introducing a co-payment since. - I also remind you that the only government that ever contemplated introducing a co-payment was a Labor government. It was Brian Howe who wanted to introduce a co-payment. If I remember  rightly, it caused quite a fuss, quite a ruckus in the parliamentary Labor caucus at the time.The Treasurer was deliberately verballed by you. The Treasurer was deliberately misrepresented by you, as you have been doing repeatedly on this issue. The reality is that just as your colleagues have run around scaring the elderly, you have run around Australia conducting a scare campaign on this issue. The Treasurer was not alleging what you are claiming he was. The ABC acknowledged it and any fair-minded person would understand that you are completely misrepresenting what the Treasurer had said.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for the question. I want to take the opportunity of saying that I was disappointed, but perhaps not surprised, to read of an attack that was made over the weekend by an independent member of the ACT Legislative Assembly, Mr Moore. - He is what? He is a member of the Liberal government! - I see. That disappoints me even further. If you think that somehow or other is going to alter my view of the comments he made, you are wrong. Of all the people in the Australian community who are trying to grapple with the enormous social and human cost of drug abuse, I would have thought there was no group better suited, by dint of hard experience at the coal face, to understand the real dimension of the tragedy of drug abuse than members of the Salvation Army. I think the attack which was made on Major Watters was not only a mean-minded  and insubstantial attack but also an attack born of prejudice designed to divert community attention from the fact that Brian Watters has had long experience in the Salvation Army dealing with the drug problem.I deliberately hand-picked and chose Major Watters to chair the Australian National Council on Drugs which I announced in March this year - a council, I might say, that flowed out of a statement that represented the highest level of financial support for the anti-drugs campaign in this country given by any Australian government over the last 10 years. It represents an initiative which has been widely applauded throughout the Australian community.It is no secret that Major Watters was a critic of the heroin trial in the ACT. It is no secret that Major Watters adopts the view, as do many others, including myself, that the policy of zero tolerance of drug taking in this country is a wholly credible policy and a policy that ought to be pursued more vigorously by government and by people who are concerned about the problem.I make it very clear that I do not apologise for a moment for the appointment of Major Brian Watters as Chairman of this council. I think it was an excellent appointment. I cannot think of a better man or woman in Australia to do the job, and I totally reject Mr Moore's criticisms.</DOC>

 - This is the man who says that when you are talking about Wik you narrow cast your message. This is the man  who says if you go into Queensland don't mention Wik. - This is the man who led a party whose candidate at the Lindsay by-election in October 1996 made a second preference deal with Australians Against Further Immigration.I just happen to have with me the transcript of an interview with Vince Townsend who was the candidate for Australians Against Further Immigration in the Lindsay by-election. This is what he had to say:The only ones that did approach us in regard to this how to vote card was the representative of the Labor Party.And listen to this:And an arrangement was made that we wouldn't be last on the list with Labor, and we have decided to put them in a similar position.Now who was the Leader of the Australian Labor Party when that deal was done? It was Mr Kim Beazley. -  - Kim Beazley was the Leader of the Australian Labor Party. The journalist went on to say:Well, their candidate just said that they agreed to put you above the Liberal Party on the basis that your party said you were going to give them a higher preference than in previous years.And this was the miserable, skulking reply of the Australian Labor Party candidate, Ross Free:That is a discussion that has taken place with others. I am concerned with what is happening on the ground.I will tell you what was happening on the ground. They were defecting in their thousands to Jackie Kelly - that is what was happening on the ground. You have no credibility to lecture me on this subject.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, this is not a question of opinion; it is a question of unassailable fact. My government has provided Australians with security, safety and stability, and my government has provided a level of economic management and a degree of economic management that has effectively fireproofed the Australian economy against the impact of what is happening in Asia.If you think that be the rhetoric of a political leader, let me quote from a press release from the Australian Chamber of Commerce  and Industry dated 25 May that was handed to me during question time. Mr Paterson is talking about a survey, and this is the headline - and, might I say, a very apt headline:Australian economy continues to expand in spite of crisis in Asia.On behalf of the most comprehensive business organisation in Australia, he was giving a comprehensive endorsement of the economic policies of my government. In the body of the press release he says:The most important result of this survey is that it demonstrates that business confidence remains strong even with the Asian crisis deeply affecting so many of our trading partners.Mr Speaker, that is no accident. That has happened because of the policies that we deliberately followed when we were elected more than two years ago. That has happened because we decided to tackle the Keating-Beazley debt that we inherited. That has happened because we turned the $10½ billion deficit into a $2.7 billion surplus. That has happened because we have given Australia the lowest inflation rate for 30 years. That has happened because we have given home buyers and small businessmen the lowest interest rates for 30 years. That has happened because we have been prepared to undertake industrial relations reform, including reform on the Australian waterfront - and I congratulate my colleague the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business on his efforts on that account. That reform is necessary because it is good for Australia's long-term interests.It was no surprise to me - and it will have been no surprise to those who sit behind me and to fair-minded people in the Australian community - that, according to all the surveys undertake after it, the federal budget that has just been brought down received an emphatic endorsement on the score of economic management from the Australian people.The Australian people know a good budget when they see it. The Australian people know a budget that is directed to the interests of mainstream Australia when they see it. The Australian people know a budget that grabs hold of a problem that the government bringing down the budget inherited and did some  thing about. The fact is that if we had not done what we have done over the last 2¼ years in managing the Australian economy we would now be weaker, more vulnerable, more scared and more at the mercy of the events in the Asia-Pacific region. Our economic management has delivered safety, security and stability. The Australian people know it. So, incidentally, do those who sit opposite.Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, I thank the honourable member for Murray for the question that was asked of me -  -  - And I take this opportunity, Mr Speaker, of re-affirming the commitment of my government to the reconciliation process. I also take the opportunity, because of what today is, of again saying that, although in a personal sense many Australians will feel sorrow and regret in relation to past injustices suffered by sections of the Australian community, it is the view of my government that a formal national apology of the type sought by others is not appropriate.That is a genuinely held belief. It is conscientiously held. It does not dispute the views that are held to the contrary by many other Australians. Rather, it is our view that the most appropriate way to address the disadvantage in the Australian community continuing to be suffered by the indigenous people of this country is to address in a contemporary, practical way their disadvantage in areas of health, housing and education.That is why, in 1998-99, nearly $1.9 billion will be spent on indigenous specific programs. We will have spent $700 million more in our first four years than the former government did in its previous four years. But we have targeted our efforts at areas where the disadvantage suffered by contemporary Australians in areas of health, housing, education and employment are effectively addressed.Also, on behalf of the government, Senator Herron has announced a package of measures amounting to $63 million in response to the report of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission on the generation of children that were subject to the practices which have come under such very harsh criticism. Mr Speaker, I believe that this is not an issue that should be manipulated for political purposes, and I say to those who sit opposite that the way in which it has been handled has in fact amounted, in the eyes of many Australians, to manipulation for party political purposes. It is possible for Australians of good will to hold different views on the appropriate response to the Bringing them home report and issues of native title, yet to be united in their commitment to the process of reconciliation. I think the overwhelming majority of Australians want reconciliation, the overwhelming majority of Australians support reconciliation, and the overwhelming majority of Australians want party politics removed from issues of indigenous affairs.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, when it comes to issues of interest rates, I deal in fact, and the fact is that when you were in government housing interest rates went to 17 per cent; when you were in government small business interest rates went to 20.5 per cent. Since we have been in government, housing interest rates have come down to their lowest levels in 30 years. Since we have been in government, small business interest rates have come down to their lowest levels in 30 years. Since we have been in government, we have presided over reductions in housing interest rates. - Under my government, inflation and interest rates have both come down; under your government, they both went up. Under your government, in 1990 housing interest rates reached the absolutely Himalayan levels of 17 to 18 per cent. In 1991, small business rates reached 20.5 per cent. Under my government, in contrast, we now have reductions in housing interest rates which are worth $330 a month to the average home buyer. When you go around all the electorates of Australia, you find literally thousands of Australians who are grateful - after 13 years of the crushing effects of high interest rates on small business and home buyers - that interest rates have come down under my government.Of the many choices that the Australian people will face over the months ahead, one of the starkest is between the low interest rates policies of the Howard government and the high interest rates reality of the Australian Labor Party. - Yes.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Makin for her question. I am aware of suggestions that flowed from a  decision made by the opposition at the weekend in respect of the proposals for tax credit benefits to families. That information came fairly quickly from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. On Sunday, the Leader of the Opposition was asked how he is going to pay for his proposals for tax benefits to families and he said at the time, `We will give you some more details of this at a later time.'Only 24 hours elapsed, when, at a doorstop yesterday morning, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, truth serum still running through his veins - we know only a couple of weeks ago he finally admitted to the $10.5 billion deficit - was asked by a journalist, `So you couldn't rule out new taxes and charges to fund it?' - that is, to fund the Leader of the Opposition's announcement of the day before. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition said in response, `Perhaps a little bit of rearrangement or broadening of the existing tax scales elsewhere.'The Australian people know all about this broadening, this little bit of rearrangement. Remember the broadening on a sales tax on fridges in 1993? What did that broadening translate into? An increase in taxes from 10 per cent up to 12 per cent. Remember the little bit of rearrangement on sales tax on the family car? Sales tax was supposed to go down to 15 per cent, but up it went to 22 per cent. Remember the little bit of broadening on sales tax on soap and toothpaste? It went up from 20 per cent to 22 per cent. -  - We know when the opposition talks about broadening that they talk about tax increases. And why wouldn't they? The whole history of Labor is about increasing debt, increasing deficit and increasing taxes.The Australian tax system needs reform and it will get reform. That reform will be announced by the coalition. We will not tinker with the system, nor will we increase taxes as the Deputy Leader of the Opposition indicated yesterday. We will bring in a simple, fair  system which rewards families, encourages businesses and creates jobs. It will be a system that builds Australia. We know every time Labor talks about tax that their history indicates it will mean tax increases. The Australian people cannot trust Labor. They did not trust them in 1996 and they will never trust them again. - </DOC>

 - I have not seen that particular estimate. Therefore, I am not going to confirm, deny or in any way comment on it. As the member opposite has raised the issue, I am going to say something about the present taxation system. I think the present taxation system has many maladies and many weaknesses. Therefore, I find it very strange that the Labor Party has such a loving attachment to the present taxation system. I cannot understand -  - Ah! -  - As I was saying before the Leader of the Opposition made his claimed point of order, I cannot understand why the Australian Labor Party is so captivated by the present taxation system, because the present taxation system is not only inefficient, it not only penalises Australian manufacturers and therefore destroys Australian jobs, but also it is quite unfair to many low and middle income earners in Australia. - It is barely surprising that the Labor Party should, I suppose, given its history, cling on to the existing wholesale taxation system. - The history of the Australian Labor Party, when you look at it, is one of great affection for and attachment to the existing wholesale taxation system. - Despite all the solemn, hypocritical and humbug-ridden declarations by the Labor Party in 1993 about the goods and services tax propositions of the former coalition leader, when the Labor Party was returned in 1993, it proceeded, in the now infamous Dawkins budget of 1993, to massively increase -  - As I was saying, in 1993 the Labor Party swore blind to the Australian public that they were opposed to higher levels of indirect taxation. -  - But as soon as they were returned, despite the l-a-w promises -  -  - they massively increased, to the disadvantage of many Australians, the rates under the very unfair existing wholesale taxation system. The reality is that the Australian Labor Party was not only a party of high taxation but one of high inflation and high interest rates. - Not only was Labor a party of high taxation, high inflation and Himalayan-level interest rates but, by contrast, I am very proud to say that, in the first three budgets that the coalition has brought down, on not one occasion were there any increases in the levels of general taxation. There was no increase in personal tax; there was no increase in sales tax; there was no increase in company tax. 	 By contrast, of course, immediately the Labor Party were returned in 1993, having put their hand on their collective heart and said to the Australian people, `We are against indirect tax increases,' what did the Keating-Beazley-Dawkins government do? - They immediately massively increased sales tax and excise on a whole range of items. -  - When it comes to tax, when it comes to interest rates, when it comes to inflation, there is one absolute constant about the Australian Labor Party: you can never trust them. - </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Fadden for his question. I appreciate his interest in this matter. As members of the House may know, I, on behalf of the government, cancelled Christopher Skase's passport last year. -  - We as a government are absolutely determined that Mr Skase should be returned to Australia and face the charges for which he is wanted. During the last 24 hours I looked at some of the background to the issuing of the passport which we cancelled last year. I note that the passport which was cancelled was issued to Mr Skase in July 1993. - Somebody asked the question: who was in charge? The Deputy Leader of the Opposition was then the minister in charge. This passport which was issued in July -  -  - I think you would like to hear this. This passport that was issued in July 1993 replaced an earlier passport that Mr Skase had. The passport that it replaced was due to expire in January 1999. I make the point that Mr Skase went to Spain, I understand, in 1992. To achieve Spanish citizenship and therefore, of course, to be able to live there indefinitely, you have to remain, I am advised by my department, in Spain for 10 years. So the original passport, which would have expired in 1999, was not adequate to  meet the time span, the point being that, having been issued with a new passport, it was theoretically possible that Mr Skase could have remained in Spain on that passport for long enough to qualify for Spanish citizenship.There may have been a number of other reasons why that passport was replaced, but what is interesting and, I know, will interest the House is the material relevant to the issuing of that passport in July 1993. On 8 January 1993, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade issued an alert in relation to Mr Skase's passport. That alert said that, if the embassy in Madrid or indeed any other embassy around the world were to have an application for a passport from Mr Skase, that application should be referred to Canberra, where it would be given consideration. This was an alert issued on 8 January 1993. What is particularly interesting is the file note from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. -  - Honourable members on this side of the House will remember, and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition will remember, that he was the minister responsible for passports at that time. What is interesting is that this note from the department, which is the note recording the alert that was issued, has a very interesting handwritten annotation on it by one of the officials who was then in the department. The annotation says:In relation to Mr Skase's passport, should a passport be applied for, the minister should be advised.That is interesting. We can only ask, given that the department decided that the minister should be advised if Mr Skase should apply for another passport -  -  - We can only assume that the former minister was advised. One can only assume that, because the annotation said that the department would advise you. What role does the Deputy Leader of the Opposition have in the issuing of a passport to Mr Skase that we had to cancel? That is the question the Labor Party should be answering today - not just making trivial interjections. - For the information of the House, I table the departmental document so that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition can have a look at it later and see the annotation on it - and so can the rest of his colleagues and others in Australia.Let me say in conclusion that it is up to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to explain himself in relation to this matter. I have no further information, but it is up to him to explain himself, to explain why an annotation on a departmental note said that he should be informed if Mr Skase should apply for a passport. Presumably the minister was informed or his office was informed. Perhaps,  in that environment, the famous Miles Kupa defence, which was so disgracefully put up many years ago, will be put up yet again. In conclusion, let me say that today I have instructed all our posts to request their host governments to refrain from issuing Mr Skase with any passport whatsoever -  - And to follow the example which was set by the Seychelles government in refusing an application from Mr Skase for a passport. We do not want to see Mr Skase get any passport whatsoever. We want to see him brought back to Australia.</DOC>

 - I always seem to get caught on technicalities. The issue that you have raised I answered yesterday in the context of any package the government develops with regard to a necessary change in taxation in this country will be possessed of fairness. That will apply to any of those areas for which I have ministerial responsibility - that is, disabilities, child care, nursing homes, and so on.This gives me the opportunity to answer the second part of your question with regard to child care, the allegation you make about women not being able to access affordable child care. I have addressed this issue on several occasions, but there is one fundamental point that you miss: the number of women in the work force with children under the age of 15 has remained constant at 58 per cent since 1995. -  - It is true. Here is the graph. I am fond of showing graphs. This is something that you can understand. There has been no reduction of women in the work force with regard to child care since 1995.

It is an interesting question, though, because there is no doubt that the MUA are pulling out all stops basically to prop up the inefficiencies, the rorting and the overmanning which have so characterised Australia's waterfront. It is difficult to assess, but we know they are spending something like $350,000 a week on their payments to members at $250 a week. There are very severe financial strains on this union. One of the ironies of this dispute is that they are now working in the situation where they are paying for their own efficiencies, which is quite a turning of the tables on what has been happening for a long time in this country - namely, that everybody else in Australia was subsidising their inefficiencies.The MUA certainly has a fundraising effort at work. It is interesting to know who is one of the chief co-organisers of the MUA's fundraising efforts. You might ask: are they fundraising in support of the small businesses that have lost business as a result of this dispute? No, I do not think so. Is there any concern for the businesses that have lost exports as a result of the Columbus Canada being held up off the west coast of the US? No. Who do we find is the co-organiser of the MUA's fundraising efforts? None other than the National Secretary of the Australian Labor Party.I table a letter from the National Secretariat of the Labor Party which is seeking $200,000 a week, a total of $800,000, on behalf of the Labor Party for the MUA. There is no better evidence of how you people are standing shoulder to shoulder with the MUA as it sets out to destroy Australian jobs. Why? Because you are defending a union that thinks it is fair enough for somebody to be on an average  income of $60,000 to $101,000 a year and that gives this country crane rates and productivity levels which make Australia an international laughing-stock. You are a gutless leader because you are not prepared to stand up for the national interest. - Mr Speaker, you would be very interested, I know, in this document. It is from an Institute of Public Affairs backgrounder. It shows the financial links between the Labor Party, Labor when they were in government and the trade union movement. What we have seen for years and years and years is that the Labor Party in government provide taxpayers funds to the unions and in return using those taxpayers' funds they come back into the trade union movement for political support. Back in 1993-94 - just to take one year -  - Yes, this hurts. This shows you for the conspirator you are. - It is very relevant, Mr Speaker, because the fact of the matter is that for years and years this Labor Party has been using taxpayers' funds to fund the trade union movement, and in return for that you have been giving in on key policy areas. - The question put to me was: how are they being funded? The point I make is that they are being funded by the Labor Party, as this letter demonstrates. This has been going on for years and years in this country. As an example, in 1993-94, $548,000 in one year was paid out by the Labor Party government to the Maritime Union of Australia. - Let me just conclude that aspect of my point: when Labor was in for 13 years, nearly $100 million of taxpayers' funds was channelled through to the unions. The point is -  - This hurts because this exposes you for the weak leader you are. -  - No, I have not finished. The point I want all Australians to know is that you people are hand in glove with the MUA. That is one of the problems in Australian politics. -  - The second part of the question was: how are these funds being used? The point I am making is that we now have the Labor Party funding the MUA, and in return how are these funds being used? They are being used to keep the pressure on the Leader of the Opposition so that the other day we saw him and heard him publicly advocating compulsory unionism, which is what gives this union its stranglehold on the Australian economy. It is Labor's policy today to repeal the secondary boycott provisions of the Trade Practices Act. Why are they doing that? Because they are in cahoots with the MUA against the national interest.These matters need to be revealed so that the Australian public knows that as the MUA is acting illegally, as they are in breach of the Trade Practices Act, the reality is that they are doing so with the support, as always, of the Australian Labor Party. - What we want to know is exactly how many dollars have been raised. How many dollars have you provided to the MUA? How long will you continue to be paying the MUA to maintain their campaign? Other than the secondary boycott provisions, what other promises have you made to the MUA? Lastly, Bob Carr in New South Wales signed a protocol with the MUA. We want to know what deals you have done secretly with the MUA on this issue. - </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Curtin for his question. Indeed, Australis was placed in liquidation on 18 May and it ceased broadcasting Galaxy TV services. I am advised by the minister for communications, my colleague Senator Alston, that Australis customers are currently able to receive the Austar pay TV service. Those customers who were previously receiving that service by MDS services, which you would be familiar with, are now currently without that service. But they are attempting to sell those assets.Depending on what will happen to that process - because they are under liquidation and you will appreciate that they are commercial matters rather than matters directly for the government - we are hopeful that the commercial outcome, given that there are values in the customer base that were held by Galaxy, will be that companies such as Austar, East Coast Television, Foxtel and indeed Optus will be able to come to arrangements to pick up the services that were previously offered through Australis and the Galaxy service. I will undertake, Mr Speaker, to keep the member advised of progress where it is appropriate to do so.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for McEwen for her question, and I know how dedicated she is to improving the quality of education in her electorate. The government knows that, in these uncertain times, the greatest security for young people comes from having a quality education. That is why the government has been at particular pains to ensure that literacy standards in this country are raised and that it has achieved Australia's first national literacy standard and a national literacy plan.That is why we pursued school based apprenticeships because the previous government neglected the 70 per cent of young people who were not going straight from school to university. That is why we have encouraged schools to consider acting as employment agencies for their school leavers - a hugely popular policy which now has been adopted by over half the high schools in Australia. Of course, this government strongly supports school choice for low income families.It is quite clear at the present time that all these policies are under threat. They are under threat from the Labor Party. The Labor Party is threatening these policies and these achievements because it wants to put education policy in this country in the hands of the teacher unions. The Leader of the Opposition over the weekend went along to the Australian Education Union conference in Canberra and outlined the Labor Party's policies. But the main policy was this: he was going to set  up a review of the entire Australian education system. His policy for education is a committee. It is a review. When will this review be? It will be after the election. So we will not hear any more detail about the Labor Party's education policies.Why was this so warmly applauded by the members of the Australian Education Union at the weekend conference? It was because they know who is going to be on this committee. They know who is going to be setting the policy directions for the Labor Party when it decides to formulate its education policy.Even the media could see that this was the platform for an ideologically driven sectional policy by the Labor Party. The Sydney Morning Herald was not fooled by the speech. In an editorial this morning headed `No policy', it concluded by saying:. . . it is clear that what is driving Labor's policy is a sensitivity to the demands of the various teachers' federations around Australia. What these federations want is not necessarily what education funding in Australia really requires. Mr Beazley has given his game away, in fact, with the promise of a 'ground-up review of the entire Australian education system'. This review creates a subsidised vehicle for the federations to drive their agendas forward.What are these agendas? We know that the agendas of the Australian Education Union, the agendas of the Labor Party, are to oppose higher literacy standards. They are to oppose proper reporting to parents. They are to oppose helping school leavers get jobs. They oppose the right of parents to choose their own school. They oppose an apprenticeship system which is not dominated by the trade unions. The result is a set of policies which, once again, would viciously abandon the most disadvantaged students in Australia's schools. They would abandon the policies that this government has put in place to give educational equity to disadvantaged students and help low income parents choose the schools that they believe would be appropriate for their young people.Parents of Australia should not make a mistake. The education policies that are driving quality in this country are at risk from the policies of the Australian Labor Party because it is a relentlessly sectional party. All  it has to say is what the trade unions behind it tell it to say, whether it is to undermine Australian trade, whether it is to undermine literacy standards, whether it is to do away with school choice. There is nothing offered by the party and the weak Leader of the Opposition than the set of policies which are dictated to him by the trade unions. The only security parents in this country have that their children will receive a decent education with high literacy standards, proper reporting and school choice is the policies of this government.</DOC>

 - You might as well be at APEC for all the contribution you make here. Mr Speaker, can I say in reply to the honourable member for Jagajaga that, before I talk to the mothers and fathers of Australia about my tax policy, I would like to talk to the mothers and fathers of Australia about your tax policy. I would like to remind the mothers and fathers of Australia as they together, I hope, go into the kitchen -  - I would like to remind them that, at the present time, they pay a 22 per cent wholesale sales tax on detergent and other cleaners. I would remind them that that was increased from 20 per cent by a Labor government as recently as 1993. I would remind those same mothers and fathers of Australia that, when they buy flavoured milk, when they buy fruit juice -  -  - when they buy biscuits, when they buy ice cream, when they buy cutlery and when they buy a new fridge, dishwasher, cooker or microwave, those things are all taxed at 12 per cent and that was increased from 10 per cent. -  - I would say to the -  -  - I would say to the mothers and fathers of Australia that, under Labor's tax system, there is a 22 per cent wholesale sales tax on cosmetics, shampoo -  - I would remind the mothers and fathers of Australia, as the member for Jagajaga invited me to address them, that when Labor was in office, under Labor's wholesale taxation system, the following items carried a 22 per cent - I repeat, a 22 per cent - wholesale tax rate: cosmetics, shampoo, soap, deodorant, toothpaste, toilet paper, non-medicated mouthwash and so on. That particular rate was increased from 20 per cent to 22 per cent by the Beazley-Keating Labor government. - And I would remind the mothers and fathers of Australia that, when they go into the lounge room to watch television and they turn on the video or the stereo, all of those items now, right now, in May of 1998 carry a wholesale tax rate of 32 per cent - not two per cent, not 12 per cent, not 22 per cent, but 32 per cent. - I know you don't like being reminded of these very high rates of wholesale sales tax and, what is more, you don't like being reminded that, despite the affirmations to the contrary, you increased all of these rates in your 1993 budget. You went to the Australian public in 1993, you swore blind that you were against the proposal put forward by the coalition and, as soon as you sneaked back into office, despite all the protestations about l-a-w, law, you immediately rammed up every indirect tax rate that you could lay your hands on.So the first thing that I would say to the mothers and fathers of Australia is, `Under Labor's wholesale tax system, under the taxation system the Labor Party wants to keep, you are already carrying sales tax rates of up 32 per cent on many commonly used family and household items.'The second thing that I would say to the mothers and fathers of Australia is, `Under my government, I have given to you and your children the lowest housing interest rates for 30 years.' I would say to the mothers and fathers of Australia, ` I have given you a $1 billion family taxation initiative.' I would say to the mothers and fathers of Australia that for the first time in decades we have had  three budgets in a row where there have been no increases in any of the general rates of taxation. I would say to the mothers and fathers of Australia, `We have given you the lowest rates of inflation for more than 30 years.' And I would say to the mothers and fathers of Australia, `In a sea of turmoil in the Asia-Pacific region, we have given you safety, stability and security -  -  - as far as the management of the affairs of the Australian economy are concerned. I will be very proud indeed to address the mothers and fathers of Australia on my economic record any time you like.</DOC>

 - The Trade Practices Act reforms introduced by this government have seen the introduction of effective sanctions against secondary boycotts. In my view, those new laws have been very important. They have been a significant deterrent to unreasonable industrial action by unions. In recent times we have seen the lowest level of industrial disputes per 1,000 employees in Australia since before World War I.These provisions - I call them the Cheryl clauses - have been very strongly opposed by the Australian Labor Party and by the Maritime Union of Australia. The Maritime Union of Australia has, to all intents and purposes, told the ALP that if the Labor Party is ever  returned it requires the Labor Party to abolish, to repeal, to remove those very effective sanctions against secondary boycotts. One of the reasons that the Maritime Union wants to see effective secondary boycott provisions removed is that it will allow it to continue to have a stranglehold on the Australian economy through the monopoly supply of labour on the Australian waterfront.Yesterday there was some reference to the Columbus Canada off the west coast of the United States. On that ship are Australian products destined for export markets in the US and, on the success of that shipment, relies the future prosperity of a lot of Australian businesses. I think that most Australians would be shocked to hear that a member of the federal parliament should say the following - and these are the words as I have them - in respect of that ship:I hope it sinks. I'd sink it.Those were the words of the member for Charlton, who was a former minister in a former Labor government -  - Then the member for Charlton, in the adjournment debate last night, speaking on behalf and with the support of the Leader of the Opposition, went on to say  this about those Australians who have recently worked for PCS on the Australian waterfront:I say to that worker and to others like him - namely, the PCS workers - that they will wear the foul stench of scabbing in their souls forever -  - It continues:Their children and grandchildren will smell the stench and recoil from it. - He then quoted from an American author -  - and endorsed the following remarks, which I think most Australians will find sickening. - These are the words quoted by a senior member of the Labor Party in the adjournment last night:After God had finished the rattlesnake, the toad and the vampire he had some awful substance left with which he made a SCAB. -  - Australians are entitled to exercise choice as to whether or not they are members of a union. Australians in this country are entitled to exercise a choice. That is a choice for the individual. If people choose not to be a member of the union, it is not appropriate for a member of this parliament, let alone a member of the Labor Party with the endorsement of the Leader of the Opposition, to revile and to use disgusting terms in respect of the choice of ordinary Australians. These people will do anything and say anything to support their mates in the Maritime Union of Australia. They are committed to a policy which would allow the MUA to hold this country to ransom at any particular moment. This Leader of the Opposition has yet to repudiate the disgusting remarks of the  member for Charlton. I say to the Leader of the Opposition: if you aspire to the highest office in the land, then the first thing you have to do is to require some standards of your own frontbench and backbench. I demand of you today that you repudiate the sickening remarks of this person. -  - It's a challenge to you.</DOC>

 - Such an attractive invitation, Mr Speaker. Firstly, I will say this: the government will study the KPMG report and make its deliberations known in due course. We thank KPMG for the work and effort they have put into that report which is vital for the future development of arts policy.On the issue that the member for Canberra was nearly ruled out of order on, the same answer applies as I have already responded to in the House today. When the government finalises its package, it will be possessed of fairness and equity for Australians in dealing with the need to address taxation reform - something that you had the opportunity to do and failed to do in 13 years.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Capricornia for his question. As the honourable member would be well aware, the costs of land transport, particularly road transport, have a major impact on the cost of living in regional Australia, which our government is vitally interested in. Part of that impost is the current taxation system that the Australian Labor Party wants to protect. -  - If you look at your history books, you will find that Labor created the taxation system we have at the moment with the wholesale sales tax and with the fuel excise. In 1993 the Labor Party went to the people of Australia and they promised that there would be no increases in taxes and they also promised tax cuts. Do you remember the l-a-w and the promise that there would be no increases in taxes, which turned into a l-i-e, a lie, in 1993 when you took the wholesale sales taxes from 15 per cent to 22 per cent? - That impacts on every single thing that goes on in regional Australia which includes the commodities that are carried in there to be consumed by people in regional Australia. Every single thing that is manufactured in regional Australia is also transported out by road or by rail and that is impacted upon by the wholesale sales tax system that the Labor Party wants to protect. They increased the wholesale sales taxes in 1993 and they do not want to change it.This is the ridiculous system that they want to maintain. In 1993, they increased the sales tax on trucks for the road transport industry from 15 per cent to 22 per cent. If you go and buy spare parts such as new seat belts for that truck they are exempt because it is a safety item. But if you go and buy brake parts, airbags or lights, they are taxed at 22 per cent. How ridiculous is that system that the new truck is taxed at 22 per cent, and parts that are critical to the safety of that operation are also taxed at 22 per cent. That is the system that the Australian Labor Party wants to protect. The created it. The Australian Labor Party created this system.In 1993, the Australian Labor Party said they would not increase taxes. That promise turned into an l-i-e, a lie, as the member for Charlton was allowed to get away with a  while ago. It is the Australian Labor Party that now want to protect this system. They do not want to change it; they want to continue seeing the burdens of an unfair tax system loaded onto regional Australia in the same way as they want to see the unfair burdens of a lack of competition on the Australian waterfront loaded onto regional Australians. - The member for Hotham interjects about fuel excise, Mr Speaker. - From 1983 until 1996, the Labor Party saw fuel excise go from 7c a litre to 36c a litre. That is your government. The Leader of the Opposition was the Minister for Finance through those years and they took the fuel excise straight up. That is a direct impost on regional Australia. You sit here with confected indignation and talk about what you want to do for regional Australia. There is not one person on the opposition benches that is serious about representing regional Australia. Our government wants to see a fairer taxation system for all regional Australians.</DOC>

 - Our position is that we will go to the next election with a proposal to reform the Australian taxation system. - Unlike the Labor Party that is wedded to an outdated, outmoded indirect taxation system, unlike the Australian  Labor Party that is wedded to a personal income taxation system that in this current year will mean that a taxpayer on average weekly earnings will move from a 34 per cent rate at the margin to 43 per cent at the margin. That is the system that the Leader of the Opposition proposes that Australia maintain. - He is also going to maintain an indirect taxation system that produced the increases on household items that I have referred to in earlier questions.Mr Speaker, I say to all honourable members in the House that question time over the last two days has not surprisingly been focused on the issue of taxation. Any person who takes a realistic, objective view of the Australian taxation system will know that, if we really care about the national interest, we cannot go on forever with the present taxation system. If we really care about the competitiveness of Australian industry in a hostile world economic environment, we can no longer tolerate a taxation system that penalises our manufactured exports and that says to the rest of the world, `We're going to try to fight you for the markets of the world with one hand tied behind our backs.' - You think that is good, do you? - He thinks it is good, apparently, that the Australian manufacturers be forced to compete with the rest of the world with one hand tied behind their backs. Mr Speaker, the coalition is committed to comprehensive taxation reform. Whenever the Leader of the Opposition opens his mouth on taxation, he has got form. They remember the dishonoured 1993 promises, they remember the budget deficit, they remember the fact that fuel excise rose - as my colleague the  Minister for Transport and Regional Development said - from 7c a litre to 36c a litre. I have no doubt who they will believe when judgment comes.</DOC>

 - Many members will be aware that the development of the five-year Commonwealth State Disability Agreement has been under consideration and discussion between the Commonwealth and the states for some considerable time, and I know that the member for Dunkley has taken a particularly keen interest in this agreement, representing the interests of the constituents in his seat and in Victoria.I am pleased to say that yesterday I secured the signature of the last of the states. All states have now signed a new five-year agreement, also the Northern Territory. The ACT have indicated twice in writing to me that they will be doing so, given, of course, that the ACT had an election in the interim period. The outcome is significant, as all members would know, in setting in place a five-year agreement in conjunction with the states which gives certainty to those with disabilities about the level of funding. It has been a fundamental priority of this government and it has certainly been a personal priority for myself as the minister.The funds that will flow over that period of the agreement, the four years for accommodation support, amount to about $1.46 billion. In addition, the Commonwealth, which is responsible for employment and related services, will spend $1.07 billion over that four-year period. That constitutes approximately a five per cent increase on the original agreement amount and is made up of 3.38 per cent growth and an estimated 1.5 per cent indexation, and a supplementation for superannuation costs.We have been, during the course of the negotiations, subject to a range of misinformation, and I am glad to say that has not been echoed broadly in the disability sector. They have been extremely constructive, and I know that many of the representative bodies will be delighted to know that all states have now signed this agreement. Effectively, it means that, if the states meet the same level of increase that is provided for by the Commonwealth, for the first time ever in this country we will have a very marked up-trend in the amount of money that is relayed to the benefit of those people with disabilities.In addition, the announcement in the staying at home package of $15 million for those people who are looking after elderly disabled people will be an additional benefit which will flow through these agreements. It is a very significant agreement and it is a very significant achievement for this government, and I congratulate the Prime Minister.</DOC>

 - The assumption underlying the honourable member's question, as usual, is wrong. What the government is doing is to introduce legislation to give effect to the undertaking that I gave after the Premiers rather petulantly walked out of the last Premiers Conference, that is, the offer made by the Commonwealth would be honoured in full. I say again to the people of Australia: we will deliver every last dollar that we promised that we would deliver at the Premiers Conference. The allegations you make about co-payments are wrong. Our policy of opposition to a co-payment stands. It will not be altered. The only party in this place that wanted to introduce a co-payment was the Australian Labor Party. The Australian Labor Party wanted to introduce a co-payment and the Australian Labor Party's credentials on that issue ought to come under a lot more scrutiny than the credentials of the coalition.We will honour the promises that we put on the table at the last Premiers Conference. They represent a 15 per cent increase in real terms - 15 per cent over the next five years. And what the honourable member is saying is wrong. It is wrong in relation to undermining Medicare. It is wrong in relation to the co-payment and it is wrong to the extent that it implies that we will not honour in full the undertakings that I gave at the Premiers Conference.</DOC>

 - Last Wednesday in Geneva at the second ministerial meeting of the World Trade Organisation agreement was reached on a declaration which represents a quantum leap forward both in respect of the agricultural sector and the services sector. For the hard-pressed pork and citrus producers, who are now exporting a good proportion of their efforts, it is not going to be an instant magic wand but it is a step in the right direction. - We reaffirmed the built-in agenda which was part of the Uruguay Round negotiations and which I would have thought members of the front bench would acknowledge -  - We export pork to Russia, in case you did not know. - We have done so last year and this year and those exports are off a small base but expanding. I am proud of the pork industry's efforts to start exporting. You may not be, but I am. - It goes on. Against all odds, the citrus industry is now exporting 50 per cent of its production by dollar value. - I am proud of that and so is the coalition government - proud of those having a go at exporting. It is more than you encouraged in either the pork or the citrus industry.I want to say, Mr Speaker, that we did something else. In addition to affirming the built-in agenda, we provided for the preparatory work to commence - something which had been resisted - in September 1998, this year, and ahead of what had previously been contemplated. Again, that is a step in the right direction.I want to add, Mr Speaker, that what we did was in contrast to the white flag brigade from the Labor Party when it was in government with regard to trade negotiations - bilateral, regional and multilateral. Indeed, I remind the House that Senator Button said  this about Labor's trade efforts: `Everyone is down there in Foreign Affairs and Trade doing the multilaterals; no-one is doing anything about the bilaterals.' In Geneva, I also took the opportunity to pursue country to country negotiations, bilateral negotiations, with, once again, more enhancement for Australian exporters.I want to make one other point in response to the legitimate question of the member for Mallee. Australia at this time is a fiscal economic oasis in this part of the world. We have a budget surplus; you provided a $10½ billion budget deficit. We have a budget surplus that is helping our exporters. We have a budget surplus which is helping to confer safety, security and stability, as the Prime Minister has pointed out.We are a fiscal economic oasis, but we must safeguard our trading position. It is true that there is no such thing as an international level playing field, and it is also true that, arising out of some of the more recent developments in Asia, there are efforts by nations to cheat with regard to their trade circumstance, legally or otherwise. I highlight that, and I will continue to highlight that.I want to make the point, very bluntly, Mr Speaker, that the playing field is likely to become more lopsided, but we will do all we can to sensibly safeguard the situation of our exporters. So I say again that the government is proud to have created a budget surplus which makes this economy a fiscal economic oasis. We have turned around your $10½ billion deficit. You would have been a disaster for our exporters.</DOC>

I have to belt around the world, but I have still attended more divisions on actual legislation than the member for Oxley has attended in two years.In fact, I happen to have had the figures stored away. In 1996 and 1997 - you might like to listen to this - there were 148 divisions on legislation, on actual bills on the floor of this parliament, excluding procedural votes and excluding gags. The member for Oxley missed 100 out of those 148 divisions. She was only present for 48 out of those 148 divisions. Whether you are for or against her particular agenda, her representation is worth about 32c in the dollar.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, there are many things that are wrong with the present  Australian taxation system, and I pointed out the weaknesses of the wholesale tax system which Labor embraces ferociously and wants to increase. Also, according to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, they want to engage in a bit of broadening. What he said at that doorstop yesterday, which was pointed out by the Acting Treasurer, is indeed illuminating. What he is really saying is that Labor's policy is to collect more money through the indirect taxation system. And is he going to use that to fund reductions in personal income tax? - He says, `What rubbish!' The Deputy Leader of the Opposition says that you are going to engage in a bit of base broadening. Base broadening is a euphemism for saying that you are going to increase the level of indirect taxation. You cannot broaden the base without collecting more tax, and that is exactly what you have suggested.Mr Speaker, the member for Menzies asks me about the disincentive for work effects of the existing taxation system. I remind the member for Menzies that in 1954 the average wage earner paid 17½ per cent tax on additional earnings. By 1998-99, a taxpayer on average earnings will move from the 34 per cent to the 43 per cent tax bracket. What that means is that, for every extra dollar you earn at the average wage level, you will pay 43c of that extra dollar in taxation. That is the system the Australian Labor Party wants to maintain.That means that if an Australian worker earns more than $728 a week - and there are many Australian workers who earn that - they will pay tax at a marginal rate of 43 per cent. And, what is more, if you happen to earn $950 a week, you will pay marginal rates of tax at the top rate of tax.The way the present system is going, by the year 2000 more than one-third of all Australian taxpayers will be earning more than $728 a week and will, therefore, without reform, face a marginal rate of tax which is greater than 40 per cent. So, by the year 2000, unless we reform the system, you will have one-third of all Australian taxpayers paying at the margin more than a 40 per cent rate of tax. That is yet another example of the impact on  incentives to work of the present Australian taxation system.There is little doubt - as a result of the exchanges in this parliament of the last two days - that, just as the Labor Party is chained to the Maritime Union of Australia, it is also chained to the existing taxation system; just as the Australian Labor Party is chained to a system that produces a lopsided inequitable application of indirect tax, it is also chained to a system that brutally penalises Australian exporters. By contrast, the coalition is committed to reforming the Australian taxation system, to providing Australia with a system that supports Australian exporters, providing the Australian worker with a system that provides an incentive to work and, above all, provides to all Australians a system that is based on equity and fairness which will help contribute to the security, the stability and the safety of the Australian economy.Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper.</DOC>

 - In reply to the honourable member for Lilley, yesterday the Leader of the Opposition, in asking me a question about tax reform, relied upon a statement made by Dr Neil Warren, a noted academic who does have quite a reputation in this field. As a result of the Leader of the Opposition's reference to Dr Warren, I had occasion to look back over some of the recent academic work of Dr Warren. I came across an extremely interesting paper which he presented to a conference on tax reform and a GST on 15 April 1998.What Dr Warren did in that paper was to lend support to the assertion that has frequently been made by the coalition: that before the 1993 election the Labor Party promised tax cuts without a GST but after the election the Labor Party in government gave us the exact opposite. They not only failed to deliver through their notorious repudiation of the l-a-w law commitment and failed to deliver the income tax cuts but also in fact delivered their own goods and services tax. To add insult to injury and further pain to the working men and women of Australia, they delivered it without any compensation. When you go through Dr Warren's paper, it contains one of the most damning indictments of the two-faced politics of saying one thing in a campaign and doing another once you get into office. -  - It is a warning to the entire Australian community. They did it in 1993. If you let them do so, they will do it again in 1998. At the beginning of his paper - it is a document that would repay study by all those who are interested in a proper discussion of the Australian taxation system - this is what Dr Warren had to say:To demonstrate this point most clearly, we shall focus on the equity and efficiency implications of the electorate's failure to support the Fightback indirect tax reform package in 1993 and contrast this with the indirect tax reforms introduced by the newly elected Labor government between 1993 and 1996.This paper will argue that there are a number of important lessons to be learnt, and these include:(1) 	 Labor introduced in 1993 its own form of a goods and services tax but in this case without any compensation to those adversely affected;(2) 	 That, even if Labor had compensated groups for the adverse equity impact of the indirect tax changes introduced, what their tax reform did was(a) 	 make Australia less internationally competitive by increasing input taxation; and(b) 	 make the tax system less economically efficient by increasing the tax rates on a range of selected goods but not on services.This is what Dr Warren goes on to say:Even though in practice no-one advocates the introduction of a GST without compensation, an important finding of this paper is that this was effectively what Labor did in the period 1993 to 1996.What you have from one of the most respected taxation academics in Australia is a clear indictment that, in government, what the Labor Party, having gone to the people and said, `We will cut your tax without fixing the indirect taxation system,' and having sneaked back into office on that deceptive commitment, then did in government was to repudiate the personal tax commitment, effectively embrace a goods and services tax and, to rub the electorate's nose in the dirt, they did it without any compensation to the working men and women of Australia. It represented one of the most cynical and one of the most calculated betrayals of the Australian electorate. - I would commend to all members of the House a very careful study. What Dr Warren reveals is that the cumulative effect of the changes introduced by the Labor government between 1993 and 1996 was to erode household real disposable  income by an average of 2.1 per cent. In other words, you promise the electorate income tax cuts without changing indirect taxation. You scramble back into office and you do the reverse. You snaffle the tax cuts and, to add insult to injury, you introduce a goods and services tax, you do it without compensation and you rob the poor and the battlers of disposable income to the tune of 2.1 per cent. It represents a total demolition of the credibility of the Australian Labor Party on the subject of taxation. - It is not surprising that there is gathering support within the Australian community for fundamental reform of the Australian taxation system. I want to put on record my appreciation of the willingness of sections of the Australian business community to get behind the cause of fundamental reform.We have needed a better taxation system for a long time in this country. As far back as 1975, the Asprey report to the Whitlam government recommended the need for fundamental reform of the Australian taxation system. We have got the courage and we have the openness to put the proposals to the Australian people. By contrast, the Australian Labor Party deceived the public in 1993. They promised tax cuts; they did not deliver them. They promised no GST; they delivered one of their own and, for good measure, they kicked in with no compensation. That was a total and cynical betrayal of what they told the Australian people. They ultimately deserved the fate they enjoyed in 1996.</DOC>

 - The situation with health insurance is that, if measures had been taken as recommended by Graham Richardson in 1990, there would not have been the loss of critical mass in private health insurance. If we  had not taken the measures we took after our election in 1996, the number of Australians in private health insurance would now be significantly lower than what it is. The fact is the Labor Party hates private health insurance. The Labor Party wants to drive people out of private health insurance. The Labor Party wants to disadvantage people who have private health insurance. And that is why they deliberately allowed the system to run down over a period of 13 years.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Makin for her question. I am aware of that widespread support in the community for tax reform. All members of this House would see it whenever they visit their electorate and whenever they speak to community groups, whether they be business or other ordinary Australians. That was confirmed this morning in a report, the Yellow Pages Small Business Index  report, which stated that, across all small business, 80 per cent viewed tax reform as `vitally important' or `very important'. It was further confirmed today with a speech given here in Canberra by the President of the Business Council of Australia, Mr Stan Wallis, where Mr Wallis urged a case for comprehensive tax reform. Mr Wallis said in that speech:Tax reform is essential if we want to improve prosperity and employment prospects in the community generally, and it is essential for business competitiveness.Why would Mr Wallis say that? Firstly, he heads the Business Council of Australia. Its members are the major employers in this country who are employing hundreds of thousands of Australians every single day. He and his members recognise that the system that we are currently dealing with is not  serving Australia and is not serving Australians. He went on to say:Not to put too fine a point on it, our tax system is in poor shape. There should be no mistake about this: it has come to the point where it is now on its last legs. It is broken in a number of places.We certainly know that on this side of the House. What we see from the other side of the House is that they are prepared to do a bit of readjusting and they are prepared to do a bit of broadening. Only today on radio the Leader of the Opposition stated that, yes, he was going to have a look at the wholesale sales tax area. He is quoted as saying:'. . . a bit of a look at where the wholesale sales tax is at the moment but basically in principle, yes (we will leave it as is)' . . . On Sunday the Leader of the Opposition told all Australians, `Our tax system is going to give you a new fridge.' The last time he had a chance to do something about a new fridge for all Australians, he put the price on new fridges up in the tax sense by 10 per cent. The last time he had a chance to do something for Australians on the question of the family car - something all Australians have or seek to have - what was the rate that the sales tax on cars was increased? It went from 15 per cent up to 22 per cent. He added thousands of dollars to the cost of the family car.What he is now trying to put to the Australian people after that speech last Sunday is: `We will do a little bit of tinkering to a system that we created, a system that is broken' - Mr Wallis has stated that again today - `a system that is held together with chewing gum and pieces of string. We'll do a bit of broadening. We'll do a bit of readjusting. We'll add a bit more chewing gum, some more string and maybe a bit of sticky tape. But we don't intend to give Australians the chance to progress with their lives and to progress with their jobs.' The Leader of the Opposition and all members of the opposition should take note of what Mr Wallis has said today because he is taking about benefits for all Australians. He is talking about giving an opportunity for job creation.I have no idea how members opposite can come into this house and talk about leaving the system as it is when they know that it is  destroying jobs and it is destroying small business - it is not giving them the chance to employ more Australians. I say again that, before the next election, the coalition will put before the Australian people a fair and simple system -  - a system that rewards families, a system that will encourage a system that will create jobs and a system that will benefit all Australians.</DOC>

When that taxation policy is unveiled, I can assure those who sit opposite that the one thing you will not be able to avoid is that the Australian people will see it as a fair policy, the Australian people will see it as a policy that helps Australian families. - I can assure those who sit opposite, including the member for Dobell, the policy will win very widespread support from Australian families.</DOC>

 - I am very pleased to inform the House of the success of the government's economic plans since coming to office, and I thank very much the member for Casey for giving me the opportunity to do just that. This morning the yield on 10-year bonds reached a 16-year low of 5.48 per cent. Prime Minister, I think the last time they were down at that level you may well have been the Treasurer of this country. But I can say that today we have reached a 16-year low: we are back to that position of 5.48 per cent. That is 0.09 per cent below the US rate. This contrasts with the rate in March 1996 when the yield on 10-year bonds was 8.88 per cent - some 2.16 per cent above the US. This reaffirms the success of the budget and it reaffirms the coalition's economic policies since March 1996 in delivering strong, sustainable low-inflationary growth and lasting low interest rates.Low interest rates mean that there are lower costs for investors and for home buyers. Let us just take a look at that. In terms of investors, that covers all small business. Small businessmen - today, yesterday and continually - are out there putting their money up, making an investment, creating jobs; and they do so, almost invariably, with the support of lending institutions. At the beginning of the 1990s, what was the business overdraft rate under Labor? It was 20.5 per cent. What was the rate in March 1996 when this coalition government came to power? It had come back  from 20.5 per cent - it was still in double figures - to 11 per cent. What is the rate today, 2¼ years later, as a result of the government's economic plans? It is 7.5 per cent. So we have seen the business overdraft rates - helping investors, helping small business - come down from 20.5 per cent to 7.5 per cent. - It is very obvious from that point of order, which was not a point of order, that the members of the opposition do not like the success that is flowing from the government's economic policies.I indicated that business rates have dropped. Let me just talk briefly about what it means to home buyers. Home buyers have seen interest rates drop from 10.5 per cent to 6.5 per cent. That means average rates have dropped by $320 per month after tax. Some  $3,800 per year less is being paid on the average mortgage after tax than was the case when Labor was last in office. That represents in excess of $100 per week in the form of a tax rise. That, of course, flows again from the economic plans of this government.To conclude, what we are seeing today in Australia is that sound, fiscal policies and sound, fiscal and economic management under a coalition government are delivering in bucket loads to business, to home buyers and to Australian families.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, I stand very much by what I said yesterday and previously in relation to this matter. I want to say further that people ought to think very carefully about why such issues have come to the fore. It is not necessarily the circumstances and submissions of one particular member for Oxley; it has a lot to do with 10 years of mismanagement of a multicultural issue by the Labor Party when it was in government - and you have much to answer for. -  - You have much to answer for in relation to this. - Yes, Mr Speaker.</DOC>

 - Let me say that there has been a very recent development which I want to highlight to the House - and I will come to the Leader of the Opposition as I have been challenged to in that regard - and this is one thing this particular week that the Leader of the Opposition has got absolutely correct. I quote exactly from a statement made by the Leader of the Opposition, reported by AAP at 12.56 p.m. this particular day, when he said:There is some rough equity in the wholesale sales tax system.You bet there is - really rough equity! You look at the transport industry, the 22 per cent wholesale sales tax -  - that every exporter has to pay in respect of the transport industry.  Let me remind the House of what your former leader, your much revered Bob Hawke, had to say with regard to the transport industry. He said that the transport industry pays 2½ times more tax than any other industry in Australia. - And why? Because of the rough equity in the wholesale sales tax. So I want to say that we will have a tax reform plan which will be good news for exporters in respect of pork and citrus. It is pay dirt for exporters in terms of fairness, and it will help build our trade.I want to say in more specific detail that, in the first eight months of this financial year - as the member for Burke and, indeed, the member for Riverina who pursues these issues would like to know - pork exports went to 19 different countries. And there was not one kilo of pork exports; in fact, there were 10,000 tonnes in exports to 19 different countries with a total value -  - You are dismissive of this export industry, but there has been $40 million worth of hard-earned exports by the hard-pressed Australian pork industry: to Holland, $2.4 million; to Russia, $2.7 million; to New Zealand, $4 million; to Germany, $3.3 million; to France, $3.8 million and, to Japan - and the Australian pork industry can walk tall for achieving this - $18 million worth of exports.In the near future the government will be responding to a major submission by the pork industry, and my colleague the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy will be providing a more detailed response to that, too.I also want to commend the pork industry and the fresh food people on the pork steaks program. I do not necessarily say that they get everything right - I think their purchasing has to be very carefully considered - but the fresh food people have teamed up with the Australian grown pork grouping to bring you a whole raft of new, high quality pork products which you may well again be dismissive of -  - but I am not. I think the Australian pork industry is fighting back from a very difficult situation. In that regard, we will be giving them more assistance than you ever did when you were in power.Finally, the member for Riverina asked about the citrus industry. There is good news in that regard. In fact, the Australian citrus industry now exports 50 per cent of its production, and it has achieved that notwithstanding fierce levels of imports from Brazil.In respect of both pork and citrus, I bring some good news. Imports have dropped off a great deal over the last few months. Part of that is a direct consequence of some of the legitimate policies this federal government has pursued and will continue to pursue. We stand for practical, hard-edged trade policies which generate extra markets for industries such as pork and citrus. My congratulations to the pork and citrus industries on their export breakthroughs.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, could you assist me? The member who asked that question is, I understand, the opposition spokesman on small business. Small business will do for the purposes of this question. Mr Speaker, I am absolutely delighted that the member asked me a question about the taxation system. - I make it very plain to him, as I did to the member for Dobell - and in advance can I make it very plain to any other members of the Australian Labor Party who might be minded to ask me similar hypothetical questions - that my response will be exactly the same as the response that I have so far given.As you have raised a matter than in theory could affect the operation of small business, of businesses of various sizes in Australia, it just so happens that before I came into the parliament I was handed a very interesting media release in relation to the Yellow Pages Small Business Index which came out recently. I would not be surprised if my colleague the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business, who is a fairly shy, retiring sort of fellow, might get a question on this later on during question time. What is very interesting about this survey is that it shows that 70 per cent of Australia's small business proprietors are likely to vote for the Liberal or National parties. - The first paragraph contains the interesting statement that 70 per cent of Australia's small business proprietors are likely to vote for the Liberal and National parties at the coming federal election. I do not know whether that will turn out to be right or wrong. - But it is interesting that this survey was completed across Australia from 1,200 small businesses. It was completed just before the budget was delivered and, given the very positive response to the budget, I am not surprised.One of the most interesting observations contained in it was that the economic adviser to the index, Dr John Marsden, said that 80 per cent of all small businesses -  - view tax reform as vitally or very important. Eighty per cent of people in small business want the Australian taxation system reformed. That no doubt includes a goodly representation of the industry to which the honourable member referred in his question. The truth is that there is an overwhelming case for reform of the Australian taxation system. All the obstruction, all the red herrings, and all the obfuscation coming from the Labor Party opposite are not going to deter the government. I say again that I am delighted that groups in the business community are now prepared to publicly get behind the cause of taxation reform. We do not always agree with the business community any more than we agree with any other section of the Australian community, but I am delighted on this issue - which is so important to Australia's economic future, which is so important to providing for security, stability and protection against the impact of the Asian economic  downturn - that taxation reform is the next logical step to further protect the Australian economy in a very uncertain world. Those who have the national interest at heart, like the business community of Australia and unlike the Australian Labor Party, are prepared to get behind the national interest.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Capricornia for his question and for bringing this matter to the attention of the House. He has had a long interest in the coal industry. He was a member, I think, of the CFMEU and a union delegate. He wants to see the coal industry prosper in the future, as we all do on this side of the House. We want to see it undertake significant reform which can secure a stable future for that industry. It is a very important industry for Australia. The industry is Australia's largest export industry: 10 per cent of our exports and more than one per cent of GDP are tied up in this industry.I therefore welcome the decision of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission as a significant milestone in reform of work practices in the coal industry. It is pursuant to the government's award simplification policy, which was incorporated in the Workplace Relations Act. I do take the opportunity of  acknowledging the presence in the gallery today of senior members of the MTIA and of ACM. In their industry they have taken a lead in the award simplification process, and I acknowledge the strong work that has been done by that organisation at the executive level and by the officers of the two organisations. I also take the opportunity to wish them well for their merger which will be a vehicle, I think, for even better services for their members. We appreciate the good working relationship that we have with them.On the coal industry, this decision has actually removed two provisions from the award: one relates to seniority, and the other has removed preference to union members. It reconfirms the government's strong determination that, if people want to be in a union, that is fine. If they do not want to be in a union, that is also their choice, and they should not be discriminated against because of making either of those choices.In the coal industry there has obviously been a lot of interest in the removal of the provision which required the last on to be the first off. It is an interesting provision that has been around since 1902, since Lenin was dreaming of the Russian Revolution. And the union, of course, has been opposing its removal. If Labor were ever re-elected, one of the first things the CFMEU would demand in return for funding the Labor Party is that -  - Mr Speaker, I will look more carefully in your direction. - The point I want to make is that this issue has been around for a long time. It has been a reform that is in the interests of preserving jobs in the industry but which has been resisted for many years by the trade union movement. The reason that I think it is sensible can be drawn from the words of the Productivity Commission which said recently in respect of this rule:It detracts from enterprise performance in the long term by restricting the criteria on which recruitment can be based. As a direct result, mines will be unlikely to achieve the Labor productivity and unit labour cost outcomes that would be possible with greater flexibility. In the long run, retrenchment based solely on seniority can only harm the competitiveness of an individual mine.The simple point is that this was an excellent decision from the commission. It was only made possible by the government's Workplace Relations Act. What it means for the coal industry is security of jobs, stability in the industry and a chance of further export income for this country. It is a pity that this measure has been opposed by the Labor Party against the interests of the industry, against the interests of the rank and file and ultimately, therefore, against the national interest.</DOC>

 - I understand that some work has been done in relation to the pros and cons of the debit tax. It is my understanding that it is quite unworkable. It is my understanding that it would have a completely distorting effect on financial activity in this country. It would fall unevenly. It would pay no regard to the fact that some businesses are  high turnover with low margin; other businesses are low turnover with high margin. The capacity to protect the poor and the capacity to avoid very adverse distributional effects would be quite significant. To cut a long story short, I think it is a thoroughly lousy idea. If there is any further information that I can get for the honourable member, I will do so, and I will be very happy to provide it in the spirit of wanting to make information available.It is important that we have a moderate, sensible debate on this issue. The question is whether we have as a nation the maturity to pursue a dispassionate debate in order to achieve such overdue change. In that context, my attention has been drawn to a comment that was made about taxation reform at one stage in the debate in this country. The person in question made this observation:I have no doubt, unless this climate is acted upon, tax reform will be thrown back into the too-hard basket for another 20 to 30 years at immense cost to the vast majority of Australians.When that statement was made, I agreed with it very strongly and said so publicly, as, indeed, did the current Leader of the Opposition and Deputy Leader of the Opposition because that statement was made by the former Prime Minister, Mr Keating, when he was Treasurer in a speech he made to the Melbourne Age  taxation symposium when he was correctly, in 1985 - I think with some courage - advocating the cause of taxation reform. Those words would be well heeded by the Leader of the Opposition and by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition who, they well know, were two of the only three people in the Hawke cabinet who supported taxation reform.It is a national interest issue. The more that those in the opposition seek to fan prejudice, the more that those in the opposition seek to get the screaming headline as distinct from the calm dispassionate debate, the more they are knifing the national interest.</DOC>

 - I certainly have, and I thank the member for Robertson for raising this issue. I compliment him on the fact that he has a very well-deserved reputation for being a strong supporter of the small business community. It was no surprise that the Prime Minister had seen this report because he is also a very strong supporter, as is this government, of small business. We are unashamedly pro small business and proud of it. It is one of the reasons that small business has had the attention and the priority that it has had since we came into government. - The Yellow Pages  headline today about their survey says it all. It says, `Strong small business electoral support for the coalition.' Why would anyone be surprised at that when you look within the survey at some of the responses of small business. Small business remains confident about the future. They see the economy getting stronger a year from now. Over 60 per cent see an increase in sales over the next 12 months; 58 per cent expect an increase in profitability over the next 12 months; 89 per cent believe waterfront efficiency will have a major impact on the economy; and 80 per cent view tax reform as vital or very important. They will not be impressed with your proposal which is to hang on to the rotten, hopeless, inefficient, archaic and out of date system we have today, which is Labor's system.This survey was done basically before the recent budget. If you look at what was in the budget - the third budget of this government - you will see that we delivered again. It locks in record low inflation - that is good for small business - and it locks in lower  interest rates. Specifically, there is a series of measures in the budget which are good for small business. We reduced the provisional tax uplift factor to five per cent, half what it was when Labor was in government. We provided further assistance to small business to deal with the millennium bug, the year 2000 issue.Mr Speaker, you really could not get a stronger, more stark contrast between what this government have been doing for small business and how small business was treated when Labor were in government. Their policy was to have a review. In fact, in 13 years, they had 17 reviews. When they got into opposition, we asked them what their policy was and their policy was to have another review. This is Labor's interest in small business.We gave the small business sector the best interest rates in 33 years and Labor gave them the highest interest rates. We gave them low inflation and economic growth. And what did the Labor Party give small business? The recession that we had to have. They gave them a recession and then they boasted that it was part of Labor's policy to introduce a recession. Mr Speaker, you can be absolutely sure of one thing for small business - that is, this government is pro small business. From this government, for small business, we have stability, security and safety. It is no wonder that this survey is a good result.</DOC>

 - I will have to analyse the question asked by the Leader of the Opposition to be absolutely certain that it is the same survey. I can inform the Leader of the Opposition that the survey to which my colleague the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business referred is the same survey that for years gave the Labor government a negative rating of over 50 per cent. It is the same survey that again and again demonstrated that the Labor Party was completely unacceptable to small business. It is the same survey that demonstrated a very positive response to the coalition's reductions in small business interest rates.It is the same survey that makes it very plain that there is overwhelming support in the small business sector for the policies of the coalition. It is the same survey that indicates 80 per cent support for the coalition's policies in relation to taxation reform. It is the same survey that indicates overwhelming support for the very industrial relations reform that the Labor Party so strongly opposes - that is, reform of the Australian waterfront.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. The industries that he talked about are very important export industries. They are the key to stronger current account performance in this country and they are the key to jobs, growth and prosperity, particularly in regional Australia, where 80 per cent of those merchandise exports come from.We think export industries are very important for this country. But the ALP, not happy with having slugged those export industries in government, all of which are price takers on international markets, not happy with having slugged them in government with inflation  and interest rates which were way, way above those enjoyed by our competitors, not content with obstructing all our efforts to turn around their economic mess, including the $10 billion black hole, so that industry could enjoy internationally competitive inflation and interest rates for the first time in years - in the case of interest rates, the lowest in 30 years - not content with their performance in that regard, not content with playing the wrecker in government as well as in opposition, they now want to obstruct tax reform.While they bleat about jobs and regional development, alone in Australia, they want to retain an archaic, anti-export, anti-growth and anti-jobs tax system. They want to retain a tax system that relies far too heavily on a very narrow base - and will rely increasingly heavily on that narrow base in the future unless it is reformed - of wholesale sales tax and fuel excise. They want to retain a system that sees no capacity for stopping the burden of indirect taxes on production cascading through the production chain, all the way onto export markets. Varying estimates put the cost to our competitiveness at an increase in prices of two to eight per cent by the time they find their way onto foreign markets.It is no wonder that, in this light, the President of the National Farmers Federation, Don McGauchie, said a few days ago:Our export and our import competing industries need a tax system which can put them in a position where they are not disadvantaged in relation to the people they are competing against.He went on to say:Our current system is not sustainable. It has negative effects on our international competitiveness and therefore negative effects on employment.They never stop talking about employment. They never stop pretending that they are the champions of the working classes and of job opportunities in this country, but they stand in the way of the tax reforms that people like the NFF see as vital to job creation. He went on to say:For the farming community, there are a great many taxes that fall on our business inputs and, given the highly competitive nature of our industry and the fact that we work on extremely small margins, taxes on business inputs hamper our competitiveness very seriously. We are determined to clean this up and to fix it, and the country's exporters, wealth creators and job creators support us. Because of their expertise in those areas, they ought to be listened to.Our commitment is in plain contrast to Labor's performance. Their record in this area is there for all to see. They promised l-a-w tax cuts and no new indirect tax systems. They delivered precisely the opposite, but at great cost to the nation's exporters and job creators. The fact is that we have fixed your financial mess over three budgets. We have gone from a $10½ billion deficit to a $2.7 billion surplus without increasing taxes -  - That is a total contrast to your record. - We now want to give our exporters a chance to compete to their best ability on the international stage. People ought to be asking themselves not so much what the advantages of changing the tax system would be -  - but what will happen if we do not modernise the tax system.</DOC>

 - What I will say is what the government is not going to do, that is, we are not going to follow the example set by the Labor Party. We are not going to follow the example of the Labor Party which, in its 13 years in government in this country, saw fuel excise in Australia rise from 7c a litre to 37c a litre. The Australian Labor Party did absolutely nothing about it for 13 years, yet you get to the 14th year and start promising things for that year. - The member asked a question about fuel excise, and that is exactly what I am talking about. I am talking about what was done to this country over 13 years by Labor. A series of submissions have been accepted and discussed with the taxation task force, and they will be considered in the process because we are prepared to have a serious and honest look at the taxation system in Australia that the Australian Labor Party want to protect. As I said yesterday, you formulated a lot of these taxes, you promised not to increase them, and then you turned around and increased them. Now you are making 14th year promises. After two years, we are making a commitment to do something about it, and we are going to do something about it. You will find out what that is in good time, when we have had a serious discussion with industry.In conclusion, the Australian people should be under no illusion as to what the Labor Party wants to do. The Labor Party wants to keep the system we have now. You want to keep the unfair taxation system we have now. You want to protect the taxation system we have now. We are saying we want to change it so we can have a modern taxation system to take us beyond the year 2000. We are about fixing up Australia's taxation system so  that it is a modern system that assists exporters, producers and farmers, and we will address that. We are not going to be the same as the Labor Party. All you did was ratchet up the taxes for the 13 years you were in government. You increased those fuel taxes from 7c a litre to 37c a litre, and you know it, but you did nothing about it for 13 years.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for North Sydney for his question. I know all members on this side of the House want to get Mr Skase back to Australia, and they want him to answer the charges he is required to answer. As honourable members are aware, I cancelled Mr Skase's passport in April last year. Since then the government has been making representations to the Spanish government to persuade it not to renew Mr Skase's residency permit, which expired on 13 May this year.Yesterday I had the opportunity to speak with the Spanish ambassador on this issue, and I urged him to let the government in Madrid know that the Australian government feels very strongly about this issue and that we certainly would not like to see the permit renewed. I know that this message has been transmitted back to Madrid and the government is considering not just the political but also the legal issues associated with this.As I explained yesterday, the government has also taken swift action to prevent Mr Skase from seeking a travel document from another country. I would like to place on the record that I appreciate the response of the government of the Seychelles to our representations and the fact that that government has made it clear that in no circumstances will it  issue a passport to Mr Skase. So we are doing all we can to try to stop Mr Skase getting another passport.The honourable member for North Sydney also asked me to comment on what had been happening over the last six years in relation to this matter. That reminds me of a discussion about this very matter in this House yesterday and the subsequent arguments put forward by the member for Holt, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, and Senator Bolkus that the Labor Party decided to reissue Mr Skase's passport because there was no warrant out for his arrest and so they had no alternative. One of the interesting things about the arguments the Labor Party put forward is that the Labor Party rather give the impression that, in July of 1993, when they issued a new passport to Mr Skase, nobody really had any problems with Mr Skase at that time - he was not really on the screen; we were not thinking about it too much.What is interesting is that, at the time the member for Holt issued a new passport to Mr Skase, Mr Skase had been charged and committed for trial. What is more, the government knew, and of course the member for Holt knew, that they were seeking warrants for his arrest. In July 1993 this was, of course, a very high profile public issue, and that is why the Department of Foreign Affairs placed an alert on any application made by Mr Skase.The member for Holt and Senator Bolkus seriously believe that the press gallery and the Australian community are going to believe that, under the Passports Act, they had no power to refuse to issue a passport, that they had no power to do that at all.Just listen to this. Yesterday Senator Bolkus had a doorstop interview, and he handed out the relevant sections of the Passports Act. The relevant sections cover something like four to 4½ pages, but he handed out just one page; he forgot to hand out the rest. Senator Bolkus, a man always to be trusted!	 -  - If you go through the rest of the Passports Act, you will find under  section 7D that, if a passport holder has an existing passport, the minister does not have to issue that person with another passport. -  - The fact is that Mr Skase did have an existing passport at that time, yet the member for Holt, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, issued him with another passport. Knowing only too well that the government was seeking warrants for the arrest of Mr Skase, he could have sat on the application pending the issue of the warrants. Or he could have cancelled Mr Skase's existing passport. The fact is that he chose to do none of those things, and that simply demonstrates the point that the former Minister for Foreign Affairs had the power to take action on this matter and made a deliberate decision not to do so, and he should answer to the Australian public for that. - In conclusion, yesterday I said I did not have any further evidence of the involvement of the member for Holt in this issue, yet he stood up later in the day and explained that he had discussed the matter with Mr Lavarch, the then Attorney-General. So it is clear he did have further involvement. I want to point out that one of the documents I am aware of, which is a memo from my department to his office of 10 January 1994, reminded his office that the passport was issued in July 1993 because there were no warrants for Skase's arrest. - In conclusion, let me say that at the time of that memo arriving in the office of the member for Holt, the warrants had already been issued, yet still the member for Holt did nothing about it. Mr Speaker, he has a lot to answer for.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Calare for his question. I know this is an issue in which he has a sincere interest, and I think the question he has asked is a very significant question. We are using this opportunity of significant political change in Indonesia to urge the Indonesian government's progress on the issue of East Timor. It is very important that they do use this opportunity. From our point of view as a government, there is no doubt that the military presence in East Timor should be reduced. We are also very strongly of the view that the people of East Timor should have a much greater say in the management of their own affairs.I think the honourable member for Calare would understand that it is not, of course, appropriate for us as a foreign country, a friend and a neighbour of Indonesia to try to micromanage precisely the formulation they use. I sincerely think that the best we can do is what we are doing, not just publicly but also privately behind the scenes, in urging the Indonesian government to make the sorts of changes I have just described.The honourable member also asked very specifically about the release of political prisoners. We welcome the progress that has been made so far by President Habibie in the release of political prisoners, and he is examining further measures. I understand consideration is being given to the case of Xanana Gusmao, one of the particular individuals the honourable member referred to.The Australian government's view is that if Xanana Gusmao's release would contribute towards a resolution of the  East Timor issue, the Australian government would clearly  welcome such a decision. However, I understand that Jose Ramos Horta has said that Xanana Gusmao will seek to make his release conditional on discussions with the Indonesian government on East Timor issues. I think that is an important point to take into account when considering the future of Xanana Gusmao. It is a matter that the Indonesian government is addressing, I am glad to be able to report to the House. We hope in an overall sense that this whole issue of East Timor will be taken forward and taken forward successfully in the months ahead.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Bendigo for his question. He has a lot of wheat production in his electorate and I know that he is very interested in this vital issue. I can inform the House that certain matters, on application from the ACCC, have been in the Federal Court today. I am informed that the judge hearing the matter has issued the following injunctions on an interim basis against the named parties, including the MUA, in particular an order that each of the respondents by themselves, their servants and agents, be restrained from aiding, abetting, counselling, procuring, inducing, conspiring to cause or otherwise -  -  - I welcome those interjections from them, because this is an injunction against your mates in the MUA for conspiring to cause damage to Australian exports. You people today are paying $50 a week to a union which is subject to this injunction. You are publicly funding a union against which an injunction has today been issued. You are  publicly supporting a union which, pursuant to this order of the Federal Court -  -  - The answer is very relevant because I think a lot of people would like to know what action is being taken in respect of this ship which has been subject to a blockade. - There is now a Federal Court injunction preventing -  - The only injunction outstanding on this matter is an injunction against the MUA which is being publicly funded by the Labor Party. That is the position today. You have, with the national secretary of the Labor Party, a fundraising effort under way to support a union which has been conspiring against the public interest to hold up this ship in the US. That is what is happening.That is why a further part of the order today by the Federal Court is that the first respondent, up to 4 June when the matter will be further heard, makes no call upon the ITF or any of it affiliates for assistance in the form of boycott or other action to prevent or hinder the movement or unloading of the ships Columbus Canada and Direct Kea, and further it withdraws any calls for assistance made by it, whether made expressly or by implication, if any, so far as such call would apply to boycott or other action referred to in subparagraph (a). - Today in this parliament members of the Labor Party are publicly advocating the boycott of a ship. In respect of that boycott, the member for Charlton yesterday proudly said on behalf of his colleagues in the Labor Party that he hopes that ship sinks -  -  - With great respect, Mr Speaker, it can hardly be very wide when I  am asked what is the progress of matters in respect of Columbus Canada  and I am advising the House of an injunction issued by the Federal Court against the very conduct which has seen this ship held up -  -  - The other interesting information on this matter is that what the MUA has been doing -  - The other information that is relevant to the House and to the question is that what the MUA has been doing is that they have been dealing with the Columbus Line and what they have been doing is effectively blackmailing the owners of this ship. To require this ship to come back -  - What is now happening is that the MUA is blackmailing the Columbus line. The blackmail for the Columbus line is that they bring the ship back, that they unload some of the cargo, the cargo which is not Australian - this is the blackmail, and I think all members should know the behaviour of this union.They have blackmailed the owners of the ship to require them to unload that part of the cargo which is not Australian and then return to New Zealand to have the Australian cargo unloaded in New Zealand because it was originally stevedored by non-MUA labour. They require the ship to return to New Zealand for the Australian containers to be taken off in New Zealand and placed on another Columbus ship and then to return to the US west coast.The absurdity of this is that the ship is to go to a port in New Zealand at which the stevedores are both union and non-union. So they are blackmailing this ship with Australian cargo to have it taken back to New Zealand and transhipped back to the US at a massive cost to the exporters, to the Australian small business people whose export product is contained within those containers. They are now subject to a federal court order for unlawful conduct, and the Labor Party is publicly funding the union which is responsible for this action. It is about time a spade was called a spade. These people are acting in support, publicly advocating the breach of Australian law by their mates in the MUA. - It is about time, as I conclude, that this weak Leader of the Opposition stand up to the MUA and require them to let that ship go and let Australian exports go into the US market.</DOC>

 - Is the person who asked me the question the same former Deputy Prime Minister who was part of a government that, in 1993, promised income tax cuts without a GST but, when it won the election, did exactly the opposite? Is he the same former Deputy Prime Minister who conspired with the then Prime Minister of Australia to junk the infamous l-a-w law tax cuts? Is he the same former Deputy Prime Minister who conspired with the then Treasurer and the then Prime Minister to give to the Australian community a regressive, without compensation goods and services tax which had a far more deleterious effect on the low income earners of Australia?I would remind those who sit opposite and the parliament that, in relation to statements I made about tax reform before the last election, with regard to those statements, those statements were honoured. We have not introduced any goods and services tax during the lifetime of this parliament. -  - The proposition being made by the Leader of the Opposition that, in some way, if you make a policy statement and then there is an intervening election, you cannot then implement a different policy after the election when you have taken that policy to the election is absurd. - There is absolutely nothing wrong - and I say this very deliberately - with stating a position on something, honouring that during the lifetime of the term you are then given and then, if you alter your position and you go to the public again with the altered position, having a right to implement it after that election. That is an utterly different position -  - No, I want the Leader of the Opposition to listen to this, and I want the parliament to listen to this: that is a vastly different position from going to the public and saying you are not going to do something but, after winning the election, doing the complete opposite. It was you who, in 1993, misled the Australian people. We are not misleading the Australian people. I am saying quite openly to the Australian people that I am now in favour of fundamental taxation reform. We will take that to the Australian people. If they agree with us, we will have a right to implement that policy, and we will have a right to implement that policy without any interference from the Leader of the Opposition.By contrast, you had no moral right to introduce your GST in 1993 because you had promised the Australian people before the 1993 election that you would not introduce your GST. There is a vast difference between  my position now and the Leader of the Opposition's position in 1993. I have had the honesty to confront the Australian public. - I have had the honesty to say to the Australian public that I am in favour of taxation reform. I will go to the Australian public in favour of that tax reform. If the public wants it, they will vote for it. If they do not want it, they will vote against it. If we win the election, we will have a mandate to introduce it and you will have no moral or political authority in opposition in the Senate to oppose it.Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper.</DOC>

 - I made a statement yesterday on Perth radio, and I stand by that statement. These matters, of course, will be resolved by the Australian people, as they should be, through the ballot box. They will decide whether they believe me or they believe the opposition. In making that decision, they will be greatly instructed and guided by the knowledge that in 1993 the current Leader of the Opposition -  - And the former Prime Minister, Mr Keating, went to the Australian people knowing full well that if they were re-elected they would introduce their own version of a goods and services tax, and refused to tell the Australian public that. They will also know that when the Leader of the Opposition went to the election in 1996 he absolutely concealed the true state of the budget deficit. So, in making an assessment of whether they believe the Leader of the Opposition or whether they believe me, the Australian public will be guided by the behaviour and the track record of the Leader of the Opposition.In 1993 he promised income tax cuts and no GST. And when he won the election on the strength of that promise, he gave the Australian public the exact reverse, as Dr Warren has pointed out. Not only did we have the infamous repudiation of the l-a-w, law, tax cuts, but we also had the Labor Party's version of a goods and services tax after 1993 - and for good measure and for added insult to the battlers of Australia, there was no compensation.</DOC>

 - It is my melancholy duty to inform the House that the Columbus Canada  has in fact now sailed from the  west coast of the United States of America as part of a very costly transhipment of containers, which is going to put in jeopardy the jobs of exporters here in Australia - large and small. The member for Charlton and the frontbench of the Labor Party might rejoice in this, but I want to refer to the Daily Telegraph  editorial today, which quite correctly gave real prominence and highlight to the other side of this equation:In the wake of our ship of shame - That is the only part of the editorial they got wrong. It is not our ship of shame. It is John Coombs's ship of shame. It is the MUA's ship of shame. It is Kim Beazley's ship of shame, who has in no way condemned this costly transhipment of Australian containers which are the subject of a piece of blackmail, a piece of thuggery, which you seem to rejoice in. Why have you not rejected this development?In addition to vital Australian beef exports, in addition to wheat gluten, there is yet another container in that shipment, involving a market breakthrough for the first time to USA and Mexico by a smaller company, Lavery International, a small dairy company based in Victoria. That company had just managed to win a contract in northern America - and part of that in Mexico - after strong competition from other competitors. Loaded on that ship is gouda cheese valued at $US60,000 - about $A100,000. It is now past its use-by date and is no longer suitable for the client. You have contributed to the destruction of a new export deal to northern America from Australia.The government stands very firm in support of waterfront reform. And why wouldn't we, when you have this shocking conduct mounted against Australian exporters and agreed to by the Leader of the Opposition, the person who would have us believe that he would be a responsible Prime Minister of this country? I quote further from the Daily Telegraph editorial:It demonstrates that the Federal Government is right to insist on waterfront reform to put an end  to the corrupt practices and poor productivity of the MUA.A union willing to undermine our export markets to maintain a closed shop must not be tolerated.We will push on with genuine waterfront reform. We have made a number of diplomatic representations with regard to the Columbus Canada  and we will stand up for our exporters.</DOC>

 - You are a great definition of an emphatic negative, if I have ever heard of one! It is very interesting, this line that the opposition is taking. Apparently there is something wrong with a political leader going to the public and actually telling them what he is going to do if he gets re-elected. I am guilty of the political crime of saying to the Australian public that I am going to tell the Australian public what I am going to do and, if I am re-elected, I am going to do it. The Leader of the Opposition does the reverse when he is in government; in other words, he deceives the Australian public about what he intends to do. He did not do it once; he did it twice. In 1993, he conspired with Paul Keating to mislead the Australian public about the introduction of the Labor Party's version of a goods and services tax. And in 1996 he conspired with the same Paul Keating to mislead the Australian public about the size of the budget deficit.By contrast, I went to the 1996 election saying that there will not be a GST in our first term. I go to the coming election saying that we are going to reform the Australian tax  system and I will tell them how we are going to reform it. What is the reply of the Leader of the Opposition? The reply of the Leader of the Opposition is that, even if the Australian public votes for our tax reform policy, he will try to stop it.I operate on the principle that the Australian public are the political masters of this nation. The Australian public will decide who they want to vote for. The Australian public are entitled to be told before an election what a government will do after the election. They do not deserve to be misled. They do not deserve to be deceived. They will not be misled and deceived by me. I will lay out our tax plan and I will be very happy to accept the verdict of the Australian public.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for La Trobe for his question. It is not a reasonable response from the MUA. - The reason I say that is that the relationship between the MUA and the ITF is well known. To give the House two examples, on Melbourne Radio 3AW earlier this year, on 2 February, Mr Kees Marges from the ITF - which is the international union for the Maritime Union - was asked by the compere, `The MUA has asked you?' He said, `We are following requests and we are looking at what is going on in ports all over the world.' So it is quite clear, as he makes that statement, that the ITF is responding to requests from the MUA to black-ban Austral  ian exports. Furthermore, on 8 April on Australian television, Mr Cockcroft from the ITF was asked about the involvement of the ITF organising against Australian exports. He said:We had a meeting last June in Miami where all the dockers union signed what we called a solidarity contract -  - It would be of no surprise to anybody in this House -  - It would be no surprise to anybody in this House to see the embarrassment of the Leader of the Opposition, whose political party is today raising funds - $50 a week from his own front and back bench - to support the MUA which is running a campaign against Australian exports. As Mr Cockcroft said:We had a meeting last June in Miami where all the dockers unions signed what we call a solidarity contract where they pledged this kind of action, if this kind of thing happened, that they would take the necessary action.Here it is as plain as the nose on your face: these people have been in cahoots, conspiring against Australian exporters. Yesterday, we got a Federal Court injunction against them. You ought to be apologising to Australian exporters. -  - They are not passing the hat around for small business; they are passing the hat around for the MUA which is running a campaign against Australian exporters. So we get `Labour International'. Exporters finally break into a market, they have a container of gouda cheese, valued at $96,000, on board and they are now unable to supply that market as a result.The Manildra group has containers on this ship. They reckon, in a letter we have from them, that the cost to them is $450,000 to $500,000 in this financial year alone as a result of the deduction from the quota. Why? Because Australia is not a reliable supplier. Why? Because the MUA is running a campaign against Australian exporters which you are publicly supporting. We have some details of the what is on board the Columbus Canada -  - Mr Speaker, the member for Charlton did not address the chair when he called for this ship to be sunk. This is the member who has the support of the Leader of the Opposition when he stated publicly he was pleased that 40 tonnes of top quality beef, which was only chilled, would now have to be dumped. This is an opposition that thinks it is reasonable, fair and in the public interest that any produce of those who are not members of a union ought to be black banned.This is a member, supported by the Leader of the Opposition, who believes that if you are not a member of a union, you are a scab. This is a member, with the support of the Leader of the Opposition, who probably thought it was fair enough, when those workers went back to work at Darling Harbour, that this union, as its first act, took industrial action. The second act that it took -  - Your embarrassment is clear for all to see. - Mr Speaker, it does range far and wide for the opposition to publicly  condemn anybody who is not a member of a union as a scab. It does range far and wide, when thousands of businesses have been affected by a policy position advocated by the Labor Party, when they are publicly raising funds to support the MUA which today is in breach of a Federal Court injunction. That ranges pretty wide, Mr Speaker. That ranges right across the national interest.Those workers at Darling Harbour complained that they were asked to wear the safety vests of those people who had been wearing them and had been working there before. They said, `These vests are unclean, put them in a plastic bag and burn them,' because they were worn by people who are not members of a union. It is pretty far ranging that, at the heart of this dispute, the Labor Party is supporting compulsory unionism on the waterfront and the repealing of the secondary boycott provisions which were the subject of the proceedings in the Federal Court yesterday and which allow this union to hold this country to economic ransom. - Mr Speaker, I have had more interruptions from the Leader of the Opposition than I usually get from the ABC. - You are always guaranteed to react. Mr Speaker, what we are seeing with the Columbus Canada  is the Labor Party's policy in action. This injunction yesterday was an injunction granted under the secondary boycott provisions of the Trade Practices Act and their policy is to repeal those provisions. Why are they doing so? Because it is a payback for the support from the MUA. They are publicly raising funds for a union which is working against the public interest. They  deserve to be condemned. It shows you what a weak leader the Leader of the Opposition is.</DOC>

 - I wonder whether, before we get to the election, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, having `fessed up about the budget deficit and having `fessed up a couple of days ago about giving Chris Skase a new passport, will `fess up to the fact that they all got their heads together before 1993 and said, `We'll run this line about giving tax cuts without a GST, but if we slip back into office, we'll introduce our own version of a GST.' I say to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that I have stated government policy. It remains the position. You can say what you like; nothing will alter the position and the Australian public will decide whether they believe you or us.</DOC>

 - Yesterday the President of the Business Council, Mr Stan Wallis, delivered a very important speech on the future of the Australian taxation system. In the course of that speech, he presented a very coherent and indeed an overwhelmingly effective case in support of taxation reform. Mr Wallis not only explained many of the domestic advantages of reforming the Australian taxation system but, not surprisingly, as the President of the Business Council of Australia, addressed his mind and turned his attention to the competitiveness of the Australian economy.He drew attention to the global competitiveness report which is published annually by the respected World Economic Forum. This latest report found that Australia ranked 17th out of 53 countries in terms of overall competitiveness. But, interestingly enough, what that survey disclosed - and what Mr Wallis's speech also analysed and disclosed - was that Australia's outdated taxation system is a major reason why our competitiveness position is not higher.The report found that the overall competitiveness of Australia's tax system ranked 41 out of 53 countries. That is the system that the Leader of the Opposition wants to maintain. That is the system that the Leader of the Opposition says does not need any change. That is the system that the Leader of the Opposition is now bound to hand and foot. In other words, the Leader of the Opposition will say to the Australian public, `Although we are approaching the next millennium, although we are going into the 21st century, we do not need a 21st century taxation system.' The Leader of the Opposition is quite prepared to say to the Australian public, `To hell with the competitiveness of the Australian economy.'By contrast, all of the actions that my government has taken since being elected have been designed to provide greater security, stability and safety through greater competitiveness for the Australian economy. The speech delivered by Stan Wallis yesterday demonstrated that, unlike the Australian Labor Party and unlike sections of the trade union  movement, the business community of Australia is looking to the national interest.There are two prerequisites for taxation reform in Australia. One of them is that the reform should be in the national interest of Australia, and the second is that the structure of the reforms should be fair to all sections of the Australian community. The Australian community is indebted to Mr Wallis for such a penetrating and cogent analysis of the weakness of the present Australian taxation system. What he has done is to look to the national interest. What he has done is to say that we need a tax system that makes Australia more competitive.We need a taxation system that will take Australia with pride and strength, and in a forward looking way, into the 21st century. It is very obvious, as every day goes by in this tax debate, that the only side of politics that is interested in the national interest, the only side of politics which is looking to the future, the only side of politics that really wants a competitive Australia is made up of the members of the Liberal and National parties.</DOC>

 - Thank you, Mr Speaker. Can I add to those remarks that I am supervising an economy that is in very, very good shape as the result of the work of the coalition government. I note with interest that the member for Holt has asked me a question on a consumption tax - on a broad-based indirect tax. I know the member for Holt is a great supporter of indirect taxes and a consumption tax. The authority for that comes from one David Morgan. It came through an ABC documentary - and, of course, we know that an ABC documentary would be very, very accurate - called Labor in power . The quote from David Morgan was:For me the breakthrough came, I think, around 1 a.m. on the Monday morning when Gareth Evans threw down his papers and took off his glasses and said, `I've listened to this consumption tax argument for two days, and I have been waiting for the hole to be punched in it. None of you have been able to punch a hole in it.' - The reason I informed the House of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition's views on broad based indirect taxes, consumption taxes, is that he referred to a time in New Zealand in 1986. That quote comes from around that same time. -  - I am delighted that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition welcomed the fact that I used that quote and that he remembered it so well. If only he had such a good memory in respect of passports - people like Christopher Skase and what might have happened there. Of course, the Australian people would like to know a little more about that.What I can say is this: the Australian economy is in very good shape because this government accepted the challenges that were presented to it. We accepted the fact that we had to address the $10.5 billion black hole. We accepted the fact that we had to live within our means. We promised that we would get the budget back into balance in our first term, and we have delivered. We accepted the fact that our workplace law needed some change, and we have made those changes. We have made the Australian workplace a far more productive place as a result. - The point I make in respect of the last 2¼ years and the way in which the coalition government has brought the economy back into shape is that there is still one step that has to be taken. That step was pointed out, as the Prime Minister said, so coherently and so logically by the President of the Business Council of Australia only yesterday. The one thing we need to ensure that productivity continues, that job creation continues, that we maintain low inflation and low interest rates and that we increase our exports is to fix up a tax system which is all but broken.	 I do not care what New Zealand did. I know what will happen in Australia. I can assure you that what New Zealand did in the 1980s will have no bearing on what this government will bring to Australia in the 1990s. The next step that will ensure that that happens, that we will get that sustainable economic growth, is that we will put a taxation system in place that will give that incentive to exports, that will create those jobs and that will maintain that sustainable growth.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I have seen reference to proposals by the Labor Party to cut income tax. Those references, of course, had their origins in a speech made by the Leader of the Opposition last Sunday to the Victorian branch of the ALP. Since that time, I have noted that the Leader of the Opposition and  the Deputy Leader of the Opposition have been embracing the airwaves; they have been running round the dial getting an opportunity wherever they can to speak on what they propose by way of income tax cuts.What they are saying they will deliver to low and middle income families is a new fridge and some new clothes and that they will fund that new fridge and some new clothes by way of income tax cuts. We know, of course, that all of this has been said before; it is deja vu. Before the 1993 election the promises coming from these very same people were that, firstly, there will be no increases in taxes and, secondly, `We will in fact give you tax cuts; we will legislate l-a-w tax cuts.' What happened after the 1993 election? It was fairly obvious, because in that budget - the preparations for that budget were undoubtedly done probably before the count in the Senate had been completed - what did they deliver? They delivered their own version of the GST - increases in wholesale sales tax. So the new fridge that they are now offering low and middle income families was given a 10 per cent tax rise, and the equivalent in the way of a wholesale sales tax rise of a new fridge was given in respect of a motor vehicle.But we are seeing a little truth from the Labor Party in recent times. A couple of weeks ago we had an admission by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that, yes, they did leave the budget in that $10.5 billion deficit state. Again, we had the acknowledgment last night on the PM program by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, `Yes, we did increase wholesale sales taxes back after the 1993 election, despite the promise we made to the Australian people.' So what we know is that this is the man, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, who is going to be the author of the tax policies; he is going to be the author of what Labor presents to the Australian people before the next election. He is the man that has this truth tablet he takes each night and then out he goes and indicates clearly that he supports a consumption tax. He told the states only last year that he would encourage them to introduce death duties to get their income. This is the man that supports new taxes; he supports increased taxes.What they are saying now to the Australian people is, `We are going to give you relief if you are low and middle income families, the equivalent of a new fridge.' What they are saying is, `We are going to fund that by increases in wholesale sales tax.' Our GST is going to get you, and added taxes to it.' There is only one thing that you can believe the Australian Labor Party on when it comes to taxes. The one thing that you can believe, the one thing that you can trust them on, is that they never tell the truth on tax. - </DOC>

 - The answer to the first part of the question is no, I was not aware, but as the statement has been -  - Well, I wasn't. I have been busying myself with other matters today, I can assure you. My attention having been drawn to the words uttered by the former Prime Minister, let me say a couple of things.  The first thing I would say is that the distribution of preferences in the state election in Queensland is, of course, a matter for the Queensland division of the party and is a matter for the Queensland divisions of both the Liberal Party and the National Party.The second observation I would make is that, when it comes to the allocation of preferences, the man who has just asked me the question is the man who authorised the Western Australian branch of the Labor Party in the 1996 election to place the former Labor member for Kalgoorlie, the continuing member for Kalgoorlie, Mr Campbell, in preferences terms ahead of the Liberal Party candidate in that ballot, despite the fact that views expressed by the current member for Kalgoorlie on many immigration matters are similar to those expressed by the One Nation Party.The man who asked the question is also the person who authorised a sleazy preference deal between Australians Against Further Immigration and the Australian Labor Party in the Lindsay by-election. He is also the person who has said to his shadow ministry, `When you go to Queensland be careful what you say about Wik and when you go to Queensland make sure that you run your comments past Wayne Swan before you say anything about Wik in Queensland.'I remind the Leader of the Opposition that in taking that stance what he is doing is speaking with one voice to one section of the Australian community and speaking with another voice to another section of the Australian community. The Leader of the Opposition has no authority to give moral lectures to me or to any member of the Liberal Party or the National Party.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. As the honourable member for Prospect once more - for the 496th time today - interjects, this time she is right: it will go down well in Macquarie. It is a very good question and well asked.I would have to say that over the last nine or 10 months or so we have been wrestling in the Asia-Pacific region with the impact of the Asian economic crisis, but out of any crisis comes opportunity and the Australian government has taken the opportunity during this period to make a historic shift in Australia's positioning in the region.We have gone from a country which at times looked like a howling and scratching country at Asia's door to a confident country able to make a strong contribution during a time of crisis. We have done that in a very constructive and very positive way. We have contributed to all three East Asian IMF packages and we have provided export insurance to Korea and Indonesia. The Reserve Bank of Australia has provided assistance, including seconding an officer to Indonesia. AusAID has established an Asia crisis fund in next year's aid budget.Importantly - and I note that this has received rather little publicity, if I could complain about that - the Prime Minister's initiative for the APEC finance ministers meeting, which was carried forward by the Treasurer, was an initiative adopted by the APEC finance ministers meeting to build stronger  financial sectors through improving the standards of prudential regulation. It includes training initiatives amongst regional financial institutions. There is a whole range of different things that Australia has done to change its standing in the region from a country which was clawing to try to be accepted by the region, to being a country which is a serious, considered and valued contributor and friend as part of the region. - It is in that context that I have to say I was just a tad disappointed to hear the speech of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition last night, who sought to misrepresent the government's policies towards Asia and suggest, almost incredibly, that the government was pursuing a policy of withdrawing from Asia. This allegation is clearly false. Anybody who knows anything about public policy in Australia knows how totally false that is. But it does remind us of the way, in years gone by, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, as the foreign minister, went to Asia in a deferential way trying to claw his way into the region. I do not think anybody should ever be allowed to forget July 1995 in Brunei when the then foreign minister, the now Deputy Leader of the Opposition, went up there carrying with him a map of East Asia. This is the map. You will remember the map. Here is Australia on the map. Here is Antarctica. Here is East Asia. He went around with this map to foreign ministers from the Asia-Pacific region and pointed out to them, `Here's Australia. It's on this map. We're part of the region. Australia is on this map.' This was one of the all-time humiliating moments for Australia, and it was summed up in an article by Geoffrey Barker of the Financial Review , who said:Senator Evans has seemed pathetically anxious to establish Australia as an East Asian Hemisphere nation.Pathetically anxious, that is what you were. As the Reuters Business Briefing said:Mr Evans's definition of the East Asian Hemisphere and of his country's place in it evoked surprise followed by indignation.We have gone from the position under Labor where we were almost apologetic in our approach to Asia, pleading to be accepted as part of the region, to being a country which is a major contributor, which plays a significant role in the region and can stand proud at last, instead of crawling in the humiliating way we did under Labor.</DOC>

 - I am very interested that the honourable member has raised the great Australian dream. One of the greatest contributions that you can make to buying a home in this country is having record low housing interest rates. I would remind her and everybody who sits opposite that my government has delivered the lowest housing interest rates that this country has had since the 1960s, that it is my government that has cut interest rates by $330 a month on the average loan, and that it is my government that has delivered interest rate cuts that are worth the equivalent of a $100-a-week wage rise for the average wage and salary earner in Australia. So the message out of that is that, if you want to enjoy the great Australian dream, there are  only two parties to vote for - that is, the Liberal Party or the National Party. - The honourable member for Oxley's raising the great Australian dream gives me an opportunity to remind her and those who sit opposite not only of the way in which housing interest rates have fallen but also, of course, that when the Labor Party was in power housing interest rates in this country climbed to levels that had not been experienced at any time since the end of World War II. In the early 1990s, housing interest rates in Australia went to 17½ per cent. Now they are in the order of six, seven or eight per cent. In other words, they are down at levels that were undreamt of by Australians only a few short years ago. The most comprehensive legacy in the past 2¼ years that my government has given to the average Australian has been to bring those housing interest rates down.The other message that I would give to the member for Oxley is that, if the Labor Party were to be elected to the government benches at the next election, those low interest rates would be at risk because the tax and spend policies of a Beazley Labor government would drive interest rates up again. As sure as one can be of anything in Australian politics, if Labor again becomes the government of this country all of those low interest rates will disappear. They will disappear very quickly. Just as Labor ran a high interest rate policy when it was in government before, it will run a high interest rate policy if it is in government again. - No, I have not. - I am glad the member for Oxley asked me about the great Australian dream, because the great Australian dream is of enormous importance to all Australians. So far as the impact of tax reform on the housing industry is concerned, I can assure the honourable member for Oxley that the building industry and all allied industries in this country - like all other sections of the Australian business community - will welcome the tax reform package when it is announced.</DOC>

 - As it happens, my attention has been drawn to some remarks that were made by the Queensland opposition leader, Mr Peter Beattie. He said that he has conceded that he could be forced to implement our native title legislation. The article makes the very interesting observation that:Sources said Mr Howard was expected to seize on Mr Beattie's concession to attack federal Labor over the issue.They were very perspicacious sources. What this represents is an attempt by the Leader of the Opposition in Queensland to have it both ways. What he is really saying is that he does not agree with the native title legislation but  wink-wink, nod-nod, he is saying to the Queensland community, `I really basically do think it is not a bad idea. The way in which I am going to demonstrate that is that, if after all of my valiant efforts to stop it coming in John Howard gets it through the federal parliament after the next election, I am going to get it in as quickly as possible.' In other words, when he talks to the Queensland people - particularly when he is touring the rural areas of Queensland - he will be able to say, `I have to stand shoulder to shoulder with Kim Beazley when I am in Melbourne or Sydney or when I am addressing some kind of congress that has another point of view, but you must understand that, when I am addressing you as a Queensland audience, I really think Howard has got it right.'He is right on this. Howard has got it right. Our native title legislation is a balanced attempt to deal with a very difficult problem. Our native title legislation will benefit Queensland. Our native title legislation should not have been rejected in the Senate and those people who voted against it in the Senate were voting against the interests of the Queensland people. Those people who voted against it in the Senate were voting to delay resolution of a difficult problem. What Peter Beattie has done by his two-sided admission yesterday is acknowledge that deep down it is in the interests of Queensland that the government's native title legislation be passed, but he is hamstrung by the commitment he has made to the federal Leader of the Opposition. This is yet the latest example of where the Labor Party, on issues related to native title, say one thing to one audience and say another thing, either directly or by a wink and a nod, to a different audience.What Peter Beattie has done is to demonstrate very clearly to the Queensland public that deep down a resolution of the native title issue as proposed by my government is the only way to solve the problem, it is the only fair way to deal with the problem, it is the only way you will deliver security and predictability to the pastoralists of Queensland. Unless the native title issue is resolved, there will be many hundreds, indeed thousands, of jobs destroyed in Queensland over  the years and into the future. Of all the states in Australia, none has a greater need of predictability and certainty when it comes to mining and pastoral titles and none has a greater stake in the proper resolution of this issue. What the Labor Party has done is to betray the interests of Queensland by opposing this legislation, and what Peter Beattie has done is to pathetically say, `I know in my heart the coalition is right, but I am not strong enough to stand up for Queensland.' He does not deserve to be the Premier of Queensland.</DOC>

 - I don't mind, Mr Speaker. Please don't rule it out of order. - I have two answers for that. The first answer is that, when it comes to government advertising, my reply to the Australian Labor Party is `Bill Hunter'. That is what I say in reply to government advertising. Of course, any new program that a government has is entitled to an appropriate communication of the details. The Australian Labor Party, when they were in government, adhered to that practice. We observed them adhering to that practice and we observed, with great interest, the extent to which they adhered to that practice.As to the second part of the question in which the honourable member said that I will  not be selling a GST, that is typical of what the Labor Party does on this issue. You deliberately chopped out the rest of what I said. What I said was that I would be selling an aggregate package. What I said was that I would be selling a total reform of the Australian tax system. I will be selling reductions in personal income tax. I will be selling a tax system that boosts Australia's competitiveness. I will be selling a tax system that attacks the loss of $15 billion of revenue through the black economy. I will be selling a tax system that takes the load off the backs of Australian exporters. In other words, I will be selling as the head of a government which is proudly determined to improve the efficiencies of the Australian tax system a proposal that will take this nation positively into the 21st century. I will not be peddling backward-looking fear. I will not be running a negative campaign, a destructive campaign, a campaign being run by people who in their hearts say, `No, it is in Australia's interest to reform the taxation system.'The man who sits opposite me, the Leader of the Opposition, knows that reform of the Australian taxation system is needed. When he was in government, he had the courage in 1985 to support the former Prime Minister, Mr Keating, on this subject. He knows that reform is needed and by opposing it, by being negative, he is gutlessly selling out Australia's national interest.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Deakin for his question. I have seen the reports in today's newspapers about this matter. There was, of course, nothing new in the information provided in that article. In fact, it was based on information that I have publicly used myself on a number of occasions. It is a fact that, worldwide, we are seeing a significant movement of people  occurring, essentially seeking either guest worker status or a long-term immigration outcome, but not approaching governments with a view to achieving that result lawfully. Many people are involved in the process of finding ways and means to circumvent the lawful arrangements that are in place for entry of people.We have seen a situation where, over a period of time, the International Convention for the Protection of Refugees has been used by people intent on claiming that they have an entitlement to asylum whether or not they have such an entitlement. We have seen a situation where Australia has been challenged in relation to those matters by large numbers of boat arrivals, and those issues have had to be effectively addressed by this government. At the moment in the Port Hedland Detention Centre we have something in the order of 30 people. This is very different to the 500 or so that we had a number of years ago. One of the reasons that that has occurred is because there has been a determination to return non-bona fide people and a determination to use, as part of an integrated system, a system whereby people are detained when entering Australia clandestinely.But, having addressed those issues effectively, what we find now is that people attempt to find new ways around it. The way in which they are attempting to do that is by using fraudulent documentation. Often, they dispose of documentation when they are on aircraft seeking to enter Australia. In  three years since 1994-95 we have seen an increase of 278 per cent, from 485 such arrivals to something of the order of 1,350. Those with bogus travel documents are projected to increase significantly this year. Those issues need to be addressed effectively. In the recent budget we brought forward a number of proposals to do that. We are going to place additional compliance officers in overseas posts where we believe these issues arise, where there is a high incidence of malpractice, and that includes Jakarta, Guangzhou, and another centre on which I have yet to make a decision. That complements the staff already in Beirut, Beijing, Hong Kong and Manila. Additionally, we will put airline liaison officers in a number of places, increasing from two to four Australian officers who will assist airline staff in identifying people using bogus documentation before they get on aircraft. Further, we will put additional staff in our airports here in Australia. We will strengthen the totality of the regime to deal with these matters, including the provision of resources to deal with asylum claims, to get asylum claimants out of the system, and to put in place a new detention centre in Sydney as part of the overall framework to ensure that these issues are effectively addressed.</DOC>

 - I am grateful for your ruling, Mr Speaker. Can I just say, in reply to the member for Batman, that he has put a whole lot of hypothetical assumptions which I do not care to respond to. What I do intend to say is that what he has put today is all of a piece with the attitude of the Labor Party to the issue of tax reform. The most damning criticism you can make of Labor is they know what is right for Australia but won't do it. The most damning criticism you can make of the Leader of the Opposition is that you in your heart, Kim Beazley, know Australia needs tax reform. You once were man enough, you once had the intellectual honesty, to support it. You once stood shoulder to shoulder with Paul Keating when he courageously argued for it before he lost his courage and became expedient in the early 1990s. At a time when Australia needs tax reform, at a time when the national interest requires that political leaders have the courage to embrace reform, what you are prepared to do is to authorise an insubstantial, scurrilous scare campaign.It may cheer your hearts at question time, you may gather in your caucus conclave and slap each other on the back and say, `Wasn't that clever?', but I suspect that out there on the highways and byways of Australia what they are really saying is, `Hang on, this is a bit strange. Wasn't there a time when Kim Beazley and Paul Keating told us that this was a good idea? Isn't it a bit strange that a man who was prepared to say one thing before the 1993 election and do the complete opposite should now be taking this stand?' - The worst criticism, the most damning indictment of all that can be made of the Leader of the Opposition of the Australian Labor Party, is that they know what is right for Australia but will not do it. They know that it is in Australia's interest to reform the tax system. They know that the scurrilous fear campaign they are trying to mount is inimical to Australia's national interest. I believe that as the weeks go by there will be a greater realisation of that amongst the men and women of Australia, and they will, in political terms, rue the day that they put short-term expediency and political dishonesty ahead of Australia's national interest.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for McMillan for his question to me. There have been a number of publications this  week which I will draw to the attention of honourable members. One very important document published by my department on the economic impact of changes in the migration program between 1995-96 and 1997-98 is a report commissioned from Ecnotech. It is a very important statement about the economic advantages to Australia as a result of changes that have taken place in relation to the immigration program. By way of interjection, some members asked me whether I was going to refer to a book entitled Among the Barbarians  by Paul Sheehan. - Yes, I am aware of the published book. I intend to read all of it. Others may care to interest themselves in that matter, but I only wish to draw on one quote from the president of the Labor Party that I understand was included in the book. It was a comment offered by the member for Lalor when he spoke at a conference in northern Sydney dealing with migration. He had this to say:The handling of immigration by the previous government was, I have to say, less than distinguished, partly because immigration was seen as a tremendously important element in building up a long-term political constituency.Let me say in relation to that that it confirms, I think in a very graphic way, what I have been saying about the way in which the immigration program which we inherited was seriously out of balance - where 70 per cent of the migration program was represented in the family stream; where something in the order of 40 per cent of the program was spouse and fiance categories, amounting to some 33,500 places; and where parents represented 10 per cent of the program. We have addressed that imbalance. The family stream now represents about 50 per cent of the program. How have we done that? We have done that by dealing with a problem that you allowed to remain in the immigration program, where people who were entering into arranged and sham marriages -  - It is absolutely right. We have seen a situation now where the number of applications are down by 30 per cent since changes were implemented to deal with these matters - not the rejection rates but the numbers of people coming forward and saying, `I want to have my relationship tested against reasonable criteria.' - But again we have seen a situation in which -  - There has been a very effective redressing of the way in which people with skills are able to enter Australia, and we have an effective rebalancing of the program. That has been confirmed in the study that I have referred to. I would like to perhaps table the study at the end of this answer and encourage members to read it as well, but it shows that Australians generally have benefited by an increase in their standard of living by $95 per year for each and every Australian, and that if we are able to introduce the further changes that we have in mind in relation to the skills categories it will add another $39 per person. That has been achieved with marginal reduced population growth, with a younger population, because of the capping of the parents category, with a higher underlying labour force participation rate, and a higher skill level in the work force.One would have to wonder when those benefits are there why the Leader of the Opposition when he comes to speak on these matters, as he did when he spoke to the Australia-Israel review, has this to say - and I have spoken about the Leader of the Opposition before and the way in which he likes to walk on both sides of the street on these matters -  -  - The Labor Party, when it is out speaking for the Australian community as a whole, would have us believe that it was concerned about very important moral and wider questions. But when it comes to going out and talking to specific constituencies it has another message to take. What it says about immigration generally is that it is interested in a population policy for Australia, implying, of course, that we should not have regular reviews of the migration program but that we ought to have a long-term view. - I quote from the Leader of the Opposition in relation to this, because there has been this criticism that our decisions in relation to immigration each year have been ad hoc and taken in the context of immediate issues. But the Leader of the Opposition, when he is asked on this matter, says:I think the annual intake is something we ought to determine on the basis of the exigencies of the economy at the time and on a non-discriminatory basis.So there he is saying that it ought to be considered on the basis of the economy in the particular year. - I will wind up, Mr Speaker, on this point. He then had to comment on the question of whether or not the Labor Party would be changing the immigration program. What did he have to say when he was speaking to a specific constituency? Oh yes, he said he would maintain the current immigration program levels but added that the ALP would also increase the family reunion component. In other words, there they are again out there pleading to a specific constituency for the very politicisation of the immigration program that the honourable member for Lalor identified.</DOC>

 - The member for Batman has waged a continuing campaign of disinformation against the Job Network. The one thing we know for certain is that he has been wrong in every accusation he has made. He has used his union mates out there to try to get information about Job Network members, and every time the scurrilous statements about Job Network members have been proven to be incorrect. Let me make it absolutely clear to members of the House that the Prime Minister's statement was 100 per cent correct. There is a clear clause in the contract with every Job Network member that no member may charge any unemployed person any fee where they are providing a service for which the government is subsidising the Job Network. In other words, whatever the government pays, that service is free to job seekers. - I do not accept for a moment the facts as they are stated by the member for Batman. There is no reason, without investigation, to accept them. Let me make this  point: there are many professional job placement agencies in this country who charge professional people looking for work for a job placement or job assistance. These services are not part of the services provided by the Job Network on behalf of the Commonwealth government to unemployed people.It may well be that there is an agency which is charging within the law people who are seeking services beyond those provided by the Job Network. But let me also make it quite clear that many Job Network members are providing completely free services to unemployed people who are not on unemployment allowances. In fact, I can tell the House that early indications are that some 20 per cent of the total job placements made by members of the Job Network are for people who are not carrying job seeker cards. So the Job Network is lifting enormously the opportunities for the unemployed in this country to get jobs.

 - I thank the member for Dunkley for his question. The member for Dunkley is well known for his commitment to helping young people in his electorate expand their opportunities to get employment. The work for the dole program has been one of the pioneering breakthroughs of the Howard government. It has been a highly success  ful program which has helped to build confidence and raise the self-esteem for thousands of young people who have been shut out of employment for too long - until this government took positive action to help them.That is why the government is expanding the work for the dole program. As the Prime Minister announced earlier this year, over the following 12 months the government will be providing some 25,000 places in work for the dole. The first tender round for the first six months of that additional work for the dole program has now concluded, and the government has received applications to place some 12,500 young people on the work for the dole.I am delighted to be able to tell the House that the enormous community enthusiasm for this program, which was demonstrated by the very large number of applications we received for the pilot project, has been more than fully borne out in the response to this second tender round. The government has received some 680 applications from communities and organisations around Australia to place young people in these 12,500 places. That is some three to four times the number of projects likely to be contracted in this round. It shows the enormous community support out there for the work for the dole program.I would like to remind members of the House just how work for the dole is assisting young people. Let me quote, for example, the comment of Linda Green from the Caboolture area, who has been working with the Endeavour Foundation supporting people with a disability. Linda Green said this:This scheme has been great. It has helped me with contacts in the business community and given me much more confidence. I can see a much brighter future for my career now and will be returning to study.Mr Michael Shovelton, 19, of Tugun, who is involved in a project on the Gold Coast said:It has given me a lot more motivation to go out and get a job and it has boosted my morale.The member for Dunkley has drawn my attention to propaganda being distributed in his electorate by the Labor Party. That propaganda makes two things very clear: first, that the Labor Party opposes work for the dole  and would discontinue this immensely successful and popular program if it were ever to return to government; second, that Labor also proposes to discontinue the common youth allowance which will give young people the positive message that it is not in their interests to drop out of school and go on the dole.The Labor Party supports a welfare system in which young people are given an incentive to go on the dole, and it opposes communities helping those young people to rebuild their confidence. All the gains that have been made by this government would be swept away by Labor. There are now 52,000 fewer young people - teenagers - looking for work than there were when the Leader of the Opposition was minister for employment. Young people deserve a chance. Communities want to help young people, and this government will give them that opportunity.</DOC>

 - I have not seen those particular documents but I have seen the press reports. - In terms of the government's approach to redundancy, I had said in December last year that, given that there was overmanning in the industry, it was then appropriate for the government to have a redundancy policy for the shipping industry and for the stevedoring industry. - Therefore, it was appropriate for the government to have as a specific policy in this area of the maritime industry a position which would ensure that, in addressing the problems of overmanning, as people left the industry they would receive their full entitlements. There is no question about the government's policy. I repeated that policy in January, February and March of this year. Further to the member's question, we had discussions with shipping companies, with Patrick's and with P&amp;O about that policy. That is our public policy. We believe in fixing up the waterfront.This is incredible. There is an application before the courts for discovery of documents. The Commonwealth will produce documents in accordance with the discovery requirements of the proper legal processes. I can advise the House that there will be literally thousands and thousands of pages of documents. Those documents will go back through the whole time of this government and further, because I can take you to papers which I had published going back to 1989 where I was arguing for a package of reforms to fix up the waterfront. As the parliament meets today, the Columbus Canada is coming back from the United States as a symbol of the public campaign by the Labor Party to provide funds to the MUA to maintain the MUA's stranglehold on the Australian economy. There is talk about there being a hearing in the Federal Court and evidence being given. When that evidence is given it will show that, when this government said we were intent on fixing up the waterfront, we actually meant it. That is what it will show. Furthermore, when there is a hearing - if there is a hearing - in the Federal Court, there will be evidence produced by this government as to what the purpose of that government policy was. - And that will show that for years and years when Labor was in office they conspired with the MUA to maintain a closed shop against the interests of Australian business -  - against the interests of Australian exporters -  - and generally against the national economic interest. So there has been a lot of talk about what has happened. This government is proudly in favour of fixing up the waterfront. And every time I hear the saga of the Columbus Canada  it will remind me of the Labor Party's support for the MUA; it will remind me of the Labor Party's policy for years and years against the national interest.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dawson for her question. The principal objectives of the government's policies for education are to provide more opportunities for qualified young Australians to enter university and to ensure that universities are funded to provide a quality education. This year there are more domestic students on university campuses than ever before, and universities' revenues at $8.55 billion are higher than ever before.The member for Werriwa, the opposition spokesperson on education, has said very little on the topic of his portfolio, although he has given a great deal of advice to other members of his frontbench. What he has said and what the Labor Party has said has now been roundly condemned by one of Australia's leading Vice-Chancellors, Professor Alan Gilbert of Melbourne University. In a speech yesterday in Melbourne, Professor Gilbert said that Labor's policy position on universities:. . . was bereft of attention to quality, deficient and unconvincing.Again referring to Labor's policy, Professor Gilbert said:It will need to be fundamentally reconfigured or it will threaten seriously the quality of Australia's universities.That is a very clear statement by one of Australia's leading Vice-Chancellors, one of the leaders of higher education in this country, about the total failure of the Labor Party to come to grips with what is needed to provide quality university education to young Australians. Already, Labor's higher education policies have been rejected. Labor's dangerous policies on education are fooling no-one. They threaten the quality of the universities and the extra places that the universities have created.Another very significant statement was made yesterday by the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee, which endorsed this government's policy position of increasing the total resourcing of universities through a mixture of public and private sources, including tuition fees which this government has introduced to give Australian students the same rights that overseas students have to  access the courses which form their first preference. That policy has already opened the doors to hundreds of students who would otherwise have been denied the opportunity to study the courses they wanted.The Vice-Chancellors' statement is very deliberate and very clear, and it is rejecting the Labor Party's policy on higher education to abolish those undergraduate fees and  those undergraduate opportunities. That is what the Vice-Chancellors of Australia's 37 universities have said. They support the coalition's policy to provide a range of funding sources for Australian universities and they reject the policy of the Australian Labor Party. And as the Labor Party now look down that long, dark track towards another election defeat, they might well consider that the neglect that the member for Werriwa has given to university education and to education generally is now beginning to reap its inevitable consequences, that all those people in this country who care for quality education, who care to open the doors of Australia's universities to qualified young people, who want Australia's universities to be better funded, are rejecting the alternative offered by the Australian Labor Party and supporting that offered by the federal coalition.</DOC>

 - There is something supremely hypocritical, if not completely sanctimonious, about this. I want to ask everybody to pause for a moment. This is a question relying upon the reported remarks of a predecessor of mine whose policies in the 1993 election the Labor Party completely opposed. The question is asked by a man who, unlike the man he opposed in 1993, was unwilling to tell the Australian public what he intended to do if he got re-elected. The last person who has any credibility to ask John Howard questions based on John Hewson's remarks is Kim Beazley - l-a-w, law Kim Beazley, who absolutely deceived the Australian people before the last election. I am very happy to say that the coalition's tax policy for the next election will be launched at the right time. - I can assure those sitting opposite that it will be a good policy. - It will be very well received by the Australian people.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Groom for his question. I recognise the interest he has in these extremely important issues. The Australian government has made abundantly clear its strong condemnation of the nuclear testing by both India and Pakistan. Frankly, we are profoundly disappointed that Pakistan saw fit over the weekend to add to the folly of its tests of last week.This morning I met with the Australian High Commissioner to Pakistan, Mr Geoff Allen, whom we recalled for consultations following Pakistan's first set of tests during the course of last week. I discussed with him the government's handling of the serious security implications of Pakistan's and India's actions. In addition to specific measures the government has already announced against India and Pakistan - and the House would be familiar with those - Australia is taking action in international fora to drive home the message that nuclear testing is unacceptable.Australia has taken the lead in the United Nations Conference on Disarmament in Geneva by calling for the convening of a special session of the conference on disarmament. This historic special session will take place tomorrow, 2 June, and will provide an opportunity for the international community to express its abhorrence of nuclear testing and the desire for India and Pakistan to join the global non-proliferation regime. We will use all appropriate multilateral and regional fora to promote urgent consideration of means to address the security implications of India's and Pakistan's actions and the broader nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament challenges. Australia has long accepted that South Asia presents particular security challenges, but we resolutely do not accept that a nuclear arms race is the way to address these challenges.Once again, Australia calls on both India and Pakistan immediately to sign and ratify the comprehensive test ban treaty. We will be taking a number of measures over the next few days and weeks to encourage the signature by those two countries of that treaty. We also would like to see India and Pakistan accede to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. The Australian government has been very active in Geneva in trying to get started negotiations on a so-called `cut-off' treaty to ban the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons. We hope that the international community will use this occasion, the occasion of the testing of nuclear devices by India and Pakistan, as a catalyst to get those negotiations for a `cut-off' treaty under way.I strongly urge India and Pakistan to cease their dangerous brinkmanship, to avoid making provocative statements or taking acts which could increase the possibility of a precipitate response. I hope that both sides would look to resume as soon as possible bilateral dialogue on important outstanding issues, in particular, the question of Kashmir.</DOC>

 - I am not a commentator here any more than anybody else is on the New Zealand economy, but let me take the opportunity of reminding those who sit opposite that one of the reasons why in the 1980s the New Zealand economy recovered in a spectacular fashion -  - Well, anybody who understands the history of the New Zealand economy will also remember that the tax to which you refer was introduced by a New Zealand Labor government. -  - It was the finance minister in the New Zealand Labor government of David Lange who introduced the taxation reform. Despite the comfort that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition apparently thinks he draws from the New Zealand experience, it is good to remind the Deputy that the reforms that were undertaken in New Zealand have delivered to the New Zealand economy a strength that was undreamt of in the early 1980s. - The reforms that were undertaken, at first by the Labor government of Lange in New Zealand and subsequently by the National government led by Mr Bolger, have resulted in the New Zealand economy now being in a far more competitive position than it was in the early 1980s. As to the details of -  -  - their tax system, I have absolutely no intention of answering for it; you go and ask the New Zealand government about it.</DOC>

 - The Australian taxation system at present is the system that the Labor Party wants to keep, the system that the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition specifically have said they wish to keep. Last week, I think it was on Perth radio, the Leader of the Opposition confirmed that, in his view, the wholesale tax system at present should be kept as it is with very little variation. I found that, in the context of the current tax debate, a very interesting proposition. You have the leader of the Australian Labor Party saying that the present wholesale tax system ought to be maintained.The present wholesale tax system inflicts a very heavy penalty on Australian exporters. It has been estimated that the annual burden, the annual negative impact, of the existing wholesale tax system on Australian exporters is almost $5 billion. In other words, a figure of almost $5 billion a year is the extra penalty which is carried by Australian exporters because of the wholesale tax system. The Business Council of Australia has estimated that the effect of cascading taxes on exporters has a negative impact of $4.7 billion annually. The cascading effect of Australia's indirect taxes is estimated to add anywhere from four to nine per cent to the cost of Australian industry.One of the major reasons why we want to reform the Australian taxation system is to give to the exporters of Australia a fairer go. We want to take that $5 billion load off the backs of Australian exporters. We want to say to Australian exporters that they will be able to compete on an even basis with exporters from other countries.Unlike the Labor Party, the coalition is prepared to stand up for Australian exporters; unlike the Australian Labor Party, the coalition is prepared to tackle the penal, inequitable way in which the existing wholesale tax system affects Australian exporters. There is one message that is coming out of this taxation debate loud and clear for Australian exporters: if you want to tie one arm of Australian exporters behind your back, vote  for Mr Beazley; if you want to reform the taxation system, if you want to get rid of the wholesale tax system, vote for the coalition. Vote to remove that $4.7 to $5 billion burden on the backs of Australian exporters.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I think he would be interested to know that today the Australian Bureau of Statistics released figures both in relation to retail trade and in relation to stocks and sales. In relation to retail trade, retail  trade, seasonally adjusted, grew by 0.2 per cent in April after rising 0.7 per cent in March. Over the year, to April of this year, retail trade grew by a very healthy 5.2 per cent. In relation to stocks and sales, total private non-farm stocks increased significantly in the March quarter, implying a 1.7 percentage point contribution to GDP expenditure growth in March. - What was your interjection? - You think that is good. Yes, a 1.7 per cent contribution is a good contribution to growth. - GDP is gross domestic product, just in case the Leader of the Opposition needs further information in relation to it. A large part of the rise in stocks occurred in manufacturing and wholesale industries, which experienced strong sales growth. Manufacturing sales grew 2.6 per cent in the quarter, consistent with indicators from other surveys. The ABS publication also includes data on manufacturers' and wholesalers' sales expectations, suggesting expectations are for solid sales over the next few quarters. The retail trade and the stocks figures are positive indicators in the Australian economy at a time when, in our region, there is severe dislocation in relation to economic growth.	One of the reasons why retail trade has held up in Australia is historically low interest rates. Low interest rates do not just come by chance; low interest rates are the result of good policy. It was the policy of this government to get the budget position right that contributed to low inflation. It was the policy of this government to get inflation under control which contributed to low interest rates. It was the policy of this government to retire Commonwealth debt which contributed  to low interest rates and the benefits they have given to home buyers and small business. None of these things comes by chance and it would be folly in the extreme to think that now would be the time to risk low interest rates on the profligate failure of Labor Party economic policy. After 13 years of failure they seek another go at high deficit, high debt, high interest rate, high inflation economy. One of the things that this government can say is that over the last couple of years it has pursued against opposition right through in its budget policy good economic policy - and that good economic policy will continue.</DOC>

 - This government has recovered much more than $800 million from high wealth individuals through its measures in relation to tax - much more. In relation to winding down Labor's infrastructure borrowings, we saved billions. - In relation to winding down Labor's R&amp;D syndicates, we saved billions. - In relation to the superannuation surcharge -  - The question was about what the government has done to secure tax from high wealth individuals. - You are the king of evasion for high wealth individuals, aren't you, Hotham? We know all about the R&amp;D syndicates in the back seat of the Roller - and it is still Labor policy to bring back the R&amp;D syndicate. You are worried, are you, that high taxpayers are paying too much tax? Mr Speaker, they fought us hardest on the R&amp;D syndicate because it was one of the mechanisms that the member for Hotham's wealthy friends used. - The other thing I want to remind the House of is that when I became Treasurer we became aware of the largest haemorrhage of the Australian taxation system which was worth billions of dollars. - I am talking about the measures which the government has taken to collect taxes from high wealth individuals. I can disclose to the House that the scheme which the government was alerted to, which cost the revenue more than any other single measure, of the order of billions of dollars, which made it optional to pay taxation if you earned over $500,000, was the use of negatively geared infrastructure borrowings which this government closed and the Labor Party opened. The Labor Party opened, back in the early 1990s, infrastructure borrowings which caused the biggest haemorrhage on the Australian taxation system for high wealth individuals which this government had to close. - I regret the fact that it had been opened and I regret the fact that billions of dollars were lost before this government actually closed it down. I am also interested to hear the member for Holt talk about discretionary trusts - that is your latest target, is it? - Listen to the press release issued by the then Treasurer, Ralph Willis, on high wealth individuals - taxation of trusts -  - No, listen to the words. He said:Trusts provide an appropriate structure to meet a legitimate range of needs such as for charities, educational, non-profit organisations, deceased estates, a variety of family purposes - Listen to this - and for solicitors and other professionals.  -  - Wait. Listen to this - The government will not interfere with these arrangements.That was the press release of 11 February 1996 on high wealth individuals in relation to discretionary trusts. The Australian Labor Party says, `Oh, we're against discretionary trusts.' Leave aside the fact that you had 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 years -  - I am referring directly to the advice in the situation as it was - leave aside the fact that there was no move on discretionary trusts for Labor's first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, tenth, eleventh, twelfth and thirteenth year.On 11 February 1996 - which was what? Four or five weeks before the March 1996 election - when they suddenly discovered an interest in trusts - this is what they said. They said in relation to this that they served a legitimate number of purposes, they provided an appropriate structure to meet a range of legitimate needs - charities, educational, non-profit, decreased estates, family purposes, solicitors and other professionals - and that `The government will not interfere with these arrangements.'The Australian Labor Party's interest in trusts is totally phoney, totally cooked up. - There is no reason to believe that they would take any different attitude than they did in 13 years of government. When they looked at the thing they decided that they would not. There it is, it is in black and white - 11 February 1996.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dawson for her question. I know she is a very vigorous support of exporters in the Dawson seat, including the $500 million of sugar exports which flow through the port of Mackay, and the coal exports through Abbot Point, Hay Point and elsewhere.I am able to inform the House that, for the period from 1 July 1997 to 1 May 1998, the first 10 months of this financial  year, exports of goods and services were $94.31 billion - an increase of 10.5 per cent over the 10-month period of the previous financial year. Imports over the same period were $97.44 billion - up 13.5 per cent. Clearly, in that circumstance, given all the challenges the Australian economy is facing and given what is happening in Asia, that is a very satisfactory set of figures which I am now able to present to the House for the first time. In fact, rural exports are up 6.7 per cent, non-rural exports are up 13 per cent and services exports are up 3.1 per cent over the first 10 months of this financial year.This is a gold medal performance by our exporters. It is a fantastic effort by small business, by medium business and, indeed, by large business in exporting to the world. I know that if you accept the logic of one, the shadow minister for trade -  - The member for Perth is not the shadow minister for trade any more - it is someone up there in the Senate. I think the shadow minister for trade is now the Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator Peter Cook.We have brought about 273,000 extra jobs as a consequence of this climb in exports. This has come about with the help of the policies pursued by the government and by  me as Minister for Trade. Firstly, we have diversified our markets beyond Asia. Exports to Egypt are up over 50 per cent. Exports to South Africa are up over 30 per cent. Exports to Iran are up over 70 per cent. Exports to Europe and Northern America are holding up very well indeed. There has been a lot of market diversification, reflecting the facilitation provided by Austrade and other government agencies. Secondly, we have put real effort into bilateral arrangements, as I have mentioned previously - not just with Mexico, but in a range of other directions. There have been regional and multilateral negotiations as well.There is a very helpful person sitting behind me on the left. He is hard-edged, but he is helpful and he has a very nice character. The Treasurer of Australia has been very helpful in presenting a budget surplus. The thing that has helped exporters even more in the circumstances we face with the economic firestorms in Asia is a federal budget surplus of $2.7 billion. Had we still had the Beazley budget deficit of $10½ billion we would not have these trade figures for the first 10 months of this financial year.I have been fortified in saying that by the press gallery. I know that they now accept that, in their professional role, they have a right to an opinion, they have a right to an intelligent opinion and they have a right to state that opinion. So, when I asked them all at a doorstop on Friday afternoon whether they felt our trade figures would be this good if we had had a $10 billion deficit this financial year, their silence was absolutely admirable. In fact, they concurred with that notion.We have helped our exporters where it counts. I have to say there is no such thing as a level playing field - we recognise that. We are providing facilitation of our exports. Our figures for the first 10 months of this financial year are outstanding in all the circumstances.</DOC>

 - I am pleased you are all watching; I like to entertain you. Small things amuse small minds and we like to keep you entertained. - In fact, we will keep you entertained in opposition for a very long period of time. Can I report, in answer to the question from the member for Page, for which I thank him, that this was a very successful APEC meeting in Canada. All of the economies of the APEC region were represented, including those that have visitor status and will be admitted at the next meeting: Russia, Peru and Vietnam.As you would expect, the main topic of the conference was financial instability in the Asian region and its working out into the real economy. It is estimated that the Korean economy could contract by 3.8 per cent through the year to March 1998 and the Malaysian economy by 1.8 per cent through the year to March 1998. Hong Kong's econ  omy contracted by two per cent through the year to March, and this gave it the first negative growth in 13 years, while in the Philippines economic growth slowed to 1.7 per cent.It is becoming increasingly clear that a large part of the problem in the Asian region was insufficient financial sector regulation and the difficulty in separating the financial sector from the corporate sector. As a result, discussions focused on strengthening financial regulation in financial sectors and improving corporate governance. The Australian government has been in the forefront of reforms in these areas with the new wave of legislation introducing the Wallis recommendations which will ensure that Australia has world's best practice in relation to financial regulation. The Australian government has been in the forefront of corporate governance issues with its corporate law economic reform program, which is designed to strengthen Australia's corporate law and give it a stronger economic focus.After discussions in Canada, the Australian government was able to offer to play a central role in new programs directed at improving the training of regulators in banking and securities sectors in the Asia-Pacific region. The Australian Securities Commission and the Reserve Bank will be involved in helping to run seminars to improve training standards, contributing to regional training efforts through institutions such as the South-East Asian Central Banks Research and Training Centre and the Asia-Pacific Regional Committee of the International Organisation of Securities Commissions. We will be contributing with better coordinating regional and bilateral training efforts and we will be improving the training culture in national financial sector regulatory agencies.As a result of the steps that we have taken to strengthen the Australian economy in the face of the external challenge, Australia is one of the economies in the Asia-Pacific region which is now experiencing continued growth. I also pay tribute to the hard-edged but helpful man behind me on my right, the Minister for Trade, who has spearheaded Australia's introduction to new export markets  and has spearheaded a very successful trade strategy that Australia should be concentrating on markets not just in the immediate region.With the external challenge of the nature and the dimension that it now is in the Asia-Pacific region, it is imperative that Australia continue to deliver good economic policies, sound budget settings, low inflation, low interest rates, reduction of government debt - the policies which this government has been putting in place to strengthen the Australian economy against the external challenge. Now is not the time to depart from good economic policy. Now is not the time to listen to the misguided and ignorant populism of the Australian Labor Party. Now is the time to develop strong economic policy to protect Australia from an external challenge and to make sure the basis of the Australian economy is kept strong.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. It is not often  that I get to announce a golden anniversary, but today is actually the 50th anniversary of the introduction of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme on 1 June 1948. - It was the United Australia Party government that attempted to introduce this first, in 1939, and it did have some controversy. - The Sydney Morning Herald  on 1 June 1948 said it believed:Few doctors will participate in the scheme which provided essential medicines free of charge.It is very comforting to know that, 50 years later, not much has changed! The pharmaceutical benefits scheme per se is a great scheme and it is going very strong. In some respects it is leading the world. Certainly it leads the world in the way that we list new drugs onto the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, with an evidenced-based approach whereby drugs have to pass certain hurdles of cost effectiveness and therapeutic effectiveness.Fifty years ago, there was no pharmaceutical industry to speak of. Pharmacists would make up themselves such things as ointments, mixtures, emulsions, suppositories and eye drops. They went by the unusual name of extemporaneous compounding. Just as these vestiges are disappearing today from the PBS and have been replaced by commercial products, so the pharmaceutical industry has transformed itself, and there are very many very high cost preparations now on the scheme. For example, in the last two years we have been able to bring onto the pharmaceutical benefits scheme betaferon - for relapsing multiple sclerosis - which will cost $20 million this year, and Olanzapine, a new drug for severe schizophrenia, which will alone cost $13 million. The two of them add about 1½ per cent to the PBS in terms of cost. I realise not everybody in this place would have a detailed working knowledge of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, nor should they be expected to, but you would think the  shadow minister for health might know the first thing about it. - One of my colleagues says `Too optimistic', and I guess that is - from the person who confuses a cholesterol lowering drug with a sugar pill. On the AM  program on 21 May, the shadow minister for health was being asked about Labor policy. The reporter said:Michael Lee, Labor was the first party to think about introducing co-payments, weren't they?The shadow minister replied:Labor certainly toyed with the idea - which is interesting, Mr Speaker, because they actually introduced them - but we found our experience with the introduction of co-payments with pharmaceuticals that it had no impact on the demand for services.He was asked again:Didn't Mr Richardson and Mr Keating have an argument about it?He answered:No, no, I think you've got that mixed up.He is the one who has it mixed up. But then he went on to repeat:The introduction of co-payments for pharmaceuticals did not make a difference for demand for services.That is news to anyone who works with the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. In the journal Pharmicoepidemiology and Drug Safety of 1996 , there is an academic article called `Prescription drug utilisation following patient co-payment changes in Australia', and I will table this for the benefit of honourable members. Basically the results were as follows:There was a significant decrease in the level of prescriptions for discretionary drugs associated with the co-payment changes by approximately 758,000 prescriptions. Prior to the co-payment, discretionary drug prescriptions were increasing by 16½ thousand a month, while afterwards they reduced by 3,300 a month . . . There was also a significant decrease in the prescription of essential drugs associated with the co-payment changes of approximately 816,000 prescriptions. This is extraordinary given that, when this change was actually introduced into the parliament in 1990, the shadow minister for health actually spoke on the bill on 12 September 1990. In this House he extolled the need for change to the pharmaceutical benefits system because of the high cost increase and to do something about the demand for drugs. Clearly he knew what he was talking about, but when it comes to actually having to try to defend the scheme now, he is prepared to show he has no knowledge whatsoever of the basic health economics that apply. That is very disturbing given that we are two years and three months into this parliament. Basically in this job you can either be constructive or destructive, and this shows quite clearly that, one, the shadow minister for health knows nothing about his portfolio and, two, he will take the opportunity to be destructive no matter what the truth. - Yes, thank you.</DOC>

 - I welcome the question from the member for Makin because it is in her electorate that very many of the workers at the Elizabeth plant of Holden live. Therefore, when I visit the area, which is quite frequently, I hear from her of the concerns that those workers have for their employment there and for the general state of the South Australian economy.It is very pleasing indeed to be able to say that, last week, General Motors Holden announced a significant development in relation to their plant at Elizabeth. This is in direct response to the government's policy initiative last year, which was set down on the criteria of getting investment in Australia, getting research innovation in Australia and getting access to export markets in Australia. It is based on those criteria that industry policy for the auto industry came down. As a consequence of that, the certainty and security that corporations need for that sort of investment were put in place.Toyota cemented their export production at Altona and continues to go ahead at a faster rate. But the development at Elizabeth is really quite exceptional in so far as there is now a second production line. Left-hand drive vehicles will be produced there for an export market, in the Middle East and later in South America. These will produce roughly a billion dollars a year in export income and a third of the production of Elizabeth will now be for the export market. This is very good not only for the people who live in the seat of Makin but in the whole of Australia because it produces jobs right through the auto industry and the component areas.Policy for the government is certainly working across the board. Just to complement what the Treasurer said about it, I draw the House's attention to an article in the Asian  Wall Street Journal, which is particularly important because it shows the way in which the government's policies have been successful. In a recent edition, it says:Australia's competitive edgeThe economy makes strides and ranks high on many international measures.I would recommend it to all those who have a chance to read it. It completely secures the forecast that the government will make, that all industry will respond to the initiatives of the December industry statement and that the investment that will flow from it will produce employment in this nation. It will produce innovation and it certainly will produce excellent incomes for the whole of Australia.</DOC>

 - Devastating. Absolutely devastating questions. The member for Hotham and I think the member for Batman and a number of other frontbenchers in the Labor Party would no doubt have been present at the annual dinner held by the major automotive group here in Canberra last Monday night. In case there are other members of the House who might have wanted to be there could not get there, I inform the House of the ringing endorsement my government received from the industry for the quality of the decisions that we have taken in relation to the motor vehicle industry. Our policy decision was widely acclaimed by the motor vehicle  industry. Our policy decision has saved thousands of jobs. - The policy we announced was a great policy. The policy we announced will be fully implemented. The policy that we announced has the support not only of the industry but also of the trade unions involved in the automotive industry. The legislation will be introduced and we will honour in full what we announced.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Herbert for his question. He has been a great supporter of the development of opportunities for small businesses to establish in the electorate of Herbert through the business incubator at Thuringowa. It has been a highly successful exercise and I know the member for Herbert has supported it along with many other initiatives in the Townsville area.The government's policies are aimed at expanding real job opportunities for Australians right across this country. Australians are interested in real job opportunities and that is what the policies of this government - the workplace relations policies, the low interest rate policies, the low inflation policies and getting the budget back into balance - are all  about. We have seen real jobs now coming through right  across regional Australia. - By the year to March, according to the latest and most reliable figures, the number of people out of work has decreased in 63 per cent of the regions across Australia. Over the last nine months, of course, the government's policies have led to 183,000 new jobs and the rate of jobs growth has been higher in regional Australia than in metropolitan Australia. The government has also consulted widely with regional Australia about the policies that it believes will generate real jobs. A number of members on this side of the House have been very effective in those consultations. - The member for Dunkley, I recognise, has played a leading role in this. - The member for Longman. - The member for Eden-Monaro, the member for Canning and the member for Grey have all been involved in very significant consultations in regional Australia. - As a result of that, the government has strengthened the role of the area consultative committees preparing a new charter for these committees, which will help them develop and implement job creation and employment and training policies in their regions.The budget this year allocated an extra $13 million for the regional assistance program designed to support regional jobs growth and help new businesses get off the ground. The work for the dole scheme has been targeted to regional Australia and it has been expand  ing from its initial 10,000 places in the pilot scheme to 100,000 places over the next four years. The number of places in Green Corps this year has expanded. The government has set aside $1.25 million for the Natural Heritage Trust and $1 billion for the Federation Fund. So it is clear that this side of the House is interested in regional Australia. Regional Australia found you out at the last election. That is why you have virtually no seats in regional Australia. - This government will continue to increase job opportunities for people right across the great regions of this country.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. Last week, residents of the southern suburbs of Canberra received in the mail a copy of the Namadgi Advocate  from the office of Annette Ellis MP, member for Namadgi. It is dated 19 May 1998. - Page 2 contains a story titled `Howard out to destroy Medicare.' While this is certainly not true - and our track record clearly demonstrates that - I will go on. The first subheading of the article is entitled `Bulk billing - a thing of the past.' Let me quote the second sentence:By cutting family doctors' fees last year, Mr Howard is making it harder for them to bulk bill patients.There are two problems with this. The first is that we did not cut doctors' fees last year, so that is a complete fabrication. The second thing is that Health Insurance Commission data for the Canberra region - if you look at the doctors who practise in the Canberra region - shows that for unreferred attendances, which is what we call GP attendances, for the March quarter 1998, GPs bulk-billed at -  - He is getting excited, Mr Speaker; Viagra is on the way.For the March quarter 1998, bulk-billing in Canberra was at its highest level in history. If you compare this with the past two years, bulk-billing in March 1996 was 63.2 per cent; in March 1997, 65.7 per cent; and in March 1998, 66.5 per cent. So bulk-billing has gone up three percentage points, or five per cent in total, over the last two years. Unfortunately, the member for Namadgi has been talking to the shadow minister for health and does not believe facts should get in the way of a good  story. It just again shows that when it comes to health they will say or do anything.</DOC>

 - I am rather pleased that the Leader of the Opposition has asked me this question because it gives me the opportunity to say two things. Firstly, it gives me the opportunity to say to those in whatever party they may be in the country that my government and I will be totally opposed with all the constitutional authority at our disposal to any attempt to water down Australia's gun laws. I want to make it  clear that we do not support any attempt to water down Australia's gun laws.Having dealt with that part of the Leader of the Opposition's question, let me now deal with another aspect of it, and that goes far deeper to this whole debate about the allocation of preferences in both the Queensland election and the up-coming federal election. As I understand it, what the Leader of the Opposition is saying is that there is something so distasteful about the policies of the One Nation Party that the One Nation Party should be placed below any other party on the ballot papers of the Australian Labor Party, the Liberal Party and the National Party. - I do think that this is an important issue and if those on the other side want to try to shout me down on the subject, let them try to do so. They can shout me down and make the transmission of this answer very difficult. If they do that, I will simply go outside and give the answer that I intend to give if they will allow me to do it. -  - In the process they are going to do some damage to the institution of parliament. The basis of the Leader of the Opposition's claims is that in some way they have some kind of presumed moral high ground in relation to this. -  - They say, `Hear, hear.' It is very interesting because you have got a situation where it is the moral high ground to put somebody last but it is not the moral high ground to beg for their preferences. That is what is happening in the Queensland election. - The Leader of the Opposition laughs, but this is what is happening. You have got Mr Peter Beattie, who is the Leader of the Opposition, saying, `Please consider giving your second preference to the Labor Party.' -  - That is what Mr Beattie is saying, `Please consider giving your second preference to the Labor Party.' - So apparently the morality of the situation stops -  -  - as soon as it starts to hurt you. -  - Everybody in Australia knows damn well that it really does not matter -  -  - In electoral terms it doesn't matter about the distribution of Liberal or Labor preferences -  - All that matters is the distribution of the preferences of the One Nation Party. -  - When it comes to the distribution of the preferences of the One Nation Party, the Australian Labor Party is in there begging on its hands and knees. It is in there begging on its hands and knees to have the preferences of the One Nation Party. -  - In other words, I am moral when it comes to preferences that will never be distributed but I am absolutely immoral -  -  - I am absolutely amoral when it comes to the distribution of prefer  ences of a party that might make a difference. Everyone knows that at the next Queensland election the only party whose preference distribution can really have an impact on the result -  - is in fact the preferences of the One Nation Party. This attitude which is being taken by the Australian Labor Party is all of a piece with the attitude that it took in the last federal election. -  - In the last federal election the Australian Labor Party put Australians Against Further Immigration ahead of the Liberal Party in the Leader of the Opposition's own seat. In the last federal election, the Australian Labor Party placed parties holding views similar to One Nation's ahead of the Liberal Party in a number of seats. In the Lindsay by-election the Australian Labor Party was prepared to do a preference deal with Australians Against Further Immigration. The Labor Party is engaging in Clayton's morality on the issue of preferences. The Labor Party is begging for the preferences of the One Nation Party in Queensland. Their leader has destroyed its credibility on this issue.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Longman for his question. He is a very strong supporter, a tireless worker, for the small business community in his electorate and I appreciate his interest in the small business policy issues before the parliament.As we look over some of the debates we have already had this year, it is interesting that, whenever there is a choice between the interests of the small business community and the trade union dictates on the Labor Party, on each and every occasion they always come down in favour of the unions. In this parliament we have had votes on whether or not there should be an exemption for small business in respect of unfair dismissal. It has been rejected twice by the Senate. Why has it been rejected? Because, when it comes to a choice between the interests of small business and the unions, the Labor Party always supports the unions.In the recent waterfront dispute, when it has been a choice between the thuggery of the MUA and the interests of some small business, whom do they support? They support the unions as usual. They always support the unions.When it comes to award simplification and trying to remove red tape, whom do they support: small business or the unions? Every time it is the unions. Now with one of the proposals before the House there is this question of representative actions being taken by the ACCC. This is a law which we are proposing which simply says that, where you have a number of small business people who have a legal right to take action, instead of their individually taking the action - and they cannot afford to because of the legal costs - the ACCC should be able to do so. That is a good idea. That is a sensible idea.In fact this idea has been around for years. When the Labor Party was in office, they themselves thought it was a good idea. In fact they gave to the ACCC the capacity to take representative action on behalf of consumers and, when the Reid committee report came down, the Labor Party said it should be adopted lock, stock and barrel. - That was your policy. - When we introduced our policy, they were saying, `You ought to go the whole way and adopt each and every recommendation of the Reid committee. You ought to dot the i's and cross the t's.' We announced then that the ACCC would have a representative capacity to take action on behalf of small business.The only reason we did not introduce the legislation there and then back in September was that, when you are changing the Trade Practices Act, you have got to go around and consult with the states. That is the only reason. So we had a process of consultation with the states and, when that was completed, we introduced the legislation.Now what do we find with Labor Party again? They say to themselves, `This may allow the ACCC to take a representative action to defend small business against the MUA.' They have a choice. Are you going to support the small business community, as you said you would, or are you going to support the MUA? So what do they do? They dump the small business community on every possible occasion. This is not creating new rights for small business; this is simply saying, `Where they have existing rights, an ACCC can come in and take a representative action.'So is it retrospectively creating rights for small business? No, it is not. It is simply allowing the rights already existant for small business to be taken up on their behalf by the ACCC. That is a sensible idea. You have publicly supported it. You have done the same thing for consumers and you yourself have been saying, `A small business person ought to have the same protection as a consumer.' If you are fair dinkum about that, why aren't you supporting this measure? The answer is obvious. On every possible occasion - unfair dismissals, getting interest rates down, doing the right thing by small business - whenever you have a choice, the member for Cunningham, who is supposed to be the spokesperson for small business in the Labor Party, is silent because he gets rolled  by the trade union thuggery which runs the Labor Party. We are pro-small business. We are proud of it. This is a good measure that you ought to be supporting.</DOC>

 - I have not seen the entirety of what Senator Gibson has said, so I will not make a comment on what the Leader of the Opposition selects from what he said. However, I had a lengthy discussion last night with Senator Gibson -  - Indeed, and it was a very illuminating. I am very happy to say that, unlike those who sit opposite, my backbench is full of men and women who are interested in tax reform. I think the Gibson committee - I am very pleased to call this task force the Gibson committee - went around Australia and listened and consulted, and the Gibson committee had quite a lot of advice that they wanted to pass on to the Treasurer and me last night. All I can say is that the process of tax reform has been greatly aided by the deliberations of the Gibson committee.There was one piece of advice that I can assure you we did not receive from the Gibson committee last night, and that is that we were not told that it would be madness to implement the promises you make to the Australian people. I would not be surprised if this got a run later in question time, but I was very interested in what I heard when I turned on my radio, like, might I disclose, a dutiful ABC Radio National listener. After a long walk in the crisp Canberra mornings I go back and I turn on ABC Radio National. I heard Fran Kelly interviewing the Leader of the Opposition. She was taking him through  his paces and saying, `What about 1993, Mr Beazley? What about l-a-w, law? What about those promises that you dishonoured when you went to the Australian people?' Do you know what he said? He said, `Well, actually, we did not dishonour them. You know, it would have been madness to do what we promised. It would have been absolute madness to do what we promised.' One piece of advice that I did not get from the Gibson committee is that it would be madness to implement your election undertakings. The truth is that ours will be implemented, as you will find out in the days and the weeks and the months ahead.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Lilley for a magnificently astute and perspicacious question, if I may say so myself. I remind the House that the public response to the budget brought down by the Treasurer three weeks ago has been in recent times exceeded in its positive effect only by the public response to the first budget the Treasurer brought down in 1996. One of the reasons why the public has responded in such an enthusiastic and endorsing fashion to the Treasurer's budget is that for the third time in a row he was not announcing any increases in personal tax, sales tax, excise duty or company tax. In other words, it was three in a row with no tax increases. That honours the commitment that I made to the Australian public before the last election. I said we were not going to increase taxes and we have not increased taxes. - We said we were not going to increase the income tax, the sales tax or the company tax and we have kept the promise. It goes further than that. Before the last election, as all my colleagues behind me will remember, we made a number of quite  explicit tax commitments. The first one was that we would deliver a $1 billion family tax initiative, and I am very happy to say that that initiative was delivered in full, on time and without any deduction. The families of Australia, particularly those on modest incomes, are grateful for the $1 billion of extra spending power they now have. When you add to that extra spending power the extra spending power they get through the lowest interest rates in 30 years, it means that Australian families with mortgages are better off than they have been for 30 or 40 years. Not only has their interest rate come down and not only are prices stable, but they have also had the benefit of the $1 billion family tax initiative. They well know that the biggest risk posed by a change of government is that their interest rate falls would be taken away and that, under a Labor government, interest rates would start going up again. Labor's biggest risk is to the present low level of interest rates.The second commitment we made was that we would cut the provisional tax uplift factor. We have in fact gone further in that area than what we promised. We promised to reduce it only to the tune of about $160 million. We have, as a result of the Treasurer's last budget, given provisional tax relief in relation to the uplift factor of $250 million. That feeds straight into the pockets of small business people and provisional taxpayers, including many self-funded retirees, all around Australia.We also promised that we would introduce a tax rebate for private health insurance. This is the tax rebate that the member for Dobell would like to get rid of. This is the tax rebate that he says is no good. If he thinks it is no good, presumably he wants to get rid of it. The undeniable fact is that, without that tax rebate, private health insurance premiums in Australia would be much higher and more costly than they otherwise are. Whatever the opposition may say, their plan to get rid of that tax rebate will push up private health insurance premiums even higher. We also promised to reduce the tax burden on self-funded retirees. We promised to give them the same income tax threshold as pensioners at  equivalent levels of income. We have delivered that commitment in full.I am happy to say to the people of Australia that we have honoured the general commitment we made to keep tax down. We have honoured the specific commitments we made to cut tax and, in one or two areas, we have gone much further than we originally promised. That is a record of which my government can be immensely proud. That is a record that is in stark contrast to what happened when the Labor party was last elected. They went to the election campaigning against a goods and services tax and, as Neil Warren has pointed out, when they sneaked back into office they introduced their own version of a goods and services tax and, to add insult to injury, they did not include any compensation for low income earners. Their record stands in a very pale and poor light against the record of our tax commitments which have been fully implemented and honoured in full.</DOC>

 - The answer to the question is no, it does not. Could I remind the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that the circumstances of our current account at the present time and the responses to that situation are very different from what obtained in the middle 1980s when the highest levels, so far as our current account deficit is concerned,  were recorded. I am very interested that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has changed his language since his press conference. At his press conference, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition was saying that this was the worst quarter on record. When he discovered that that was wrong and that in fact it was in 1995 - when his leader was the Minister for Finance - he politically adjusted it to be the worst deterioration.One of the reasons we took the action we did to repair the budget deficit, one of the reasons we have a medium- and long-term strategy to reduce debt in this country - which the Labor party does not have - and one of the reasons why the Labor Party was utterly irresponsible in trying to stop our attempts to repair the Australian budget deficit is that a stable budget position is one of the best responses to any weakening of the current account deficit. The weakening of the current account deficit has been dealt with quite comprehensively in the budget papers, and any examination of the budget papers will demonstrate that the strength of the government monetary policy and fiscal policy and our commitment to taxation reform demonstrate that we have the policy responses for a deterioration which is overwhelmingly due, as the Deputy Leader of the Opposition knows, to the circumstances that are  occurring in our part of the world.I would say to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that if a current account deficit of the amount that you have referred to were responded to with the sort of policies that you have advocated over the last 2¼ years, it would indeed loom as a very serious threat to the stability and security of the Australian economy.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Deakin for his question because this morning, as I was listening to ABC radio -  -  - It is not something that I do all that often. We heard one of those moments that lightens the heart of every politician. We heard the Leader of the Opposition expounding a new doctrine in relation to tax credibility. He was asked whether he had a credibility problem by Fran Kelly. She asked:Do you have a credibility problem though, I mean, given the actions of Labor in 1993, when you jacked up a whole raft of wholesale sales taxes?Beazley: Well, we'll find out and I would dispute your analysis. I mean, that's Liberal propaganda that says that.Apparently we made up the fact that the wholesale sales tax went from 10 per cent to 12 per cent. We made it up. We made up the fact that the 20 per cent rate went to 22 per cent. We apparently made it up that the 30 per cent went to 32 per cent. All of those businesses have been out there paying wholesale sales tax when they never needed to, I suppose, when the law never said they had to - and I suppose the Australian Labor Party is now going to give them all refunds. They have been paying under Liberal propaganda. He went on and he said:Keating went into the 1993 election and said he would not increase the total tax take.Well, he did. - He did:What I am promising is not to put up tax. - We remember so well that Keating went into the 1993 election campaign with income tax cuts. They were not a promise, he said, they were l-a-w. - They were l-a-w. What happened? Let us just recall. -  - Mr Speaker, they always shout loudest when they like the message least. Let's remember what happened:So the second point I'd say on that is, yes, we delivered half the income tax cuts we said we were, and then we were faced with the consequences - listen to this - that to deliver the second half would have been an act of pure madness.So, in other words, if you make a mad promise, you are entitled to break it. So I say this to the gallery: when the Labor Party makes a tax promise in the next election, your question to Mr Beazley must be: Is this a mad promise or not? If it is a mad promise, he does not have to deliver. The interesting thing is: do you test the promise for madness or the maker of the promise for madness? If you test the maker of the promise for madness, he has got the whole game covered! He does not have to keep to any of his promises! Then he went on and said this:So we didn't deliver because it would have been an act of pure madness. So the way in which delivered the second half - listen to this - and we did deliver it, was to say, `Okay, instead of getting it as a tax cut, you'll get it as a savings break. - That is the bit that you want me to read. Just explain this to me: what year did you get that savings break again? What year did you get that? Was it in 1992? - Was it in 1993? Was it in 1994? Was it in 1995? Was it in 1996? Was it in 1997? They had a policy to deliver that in the year 2000 - a three per cent delivery in the year 2000, which was convenient.  You could not trust them on their income tax promise from before the election until after the election. So what he said is, `Even though we didn't deliver that one, just you wait for another six years. You can believe us in another six years.' You could not believe these people for six days, let alone six years! This is an opposition which has form on tax. When it says, `We intend to cut income tax rates without a GST,' people of Australia remember this: you have heard it before. You heard it before the 1993 election -  -  - After the 1993 election it meant that $3½ billion worth of income taxes were taken away. Three billion dollars of new indirect taxes were imposed. Do not worry about saying the Labor Party did not have credibility. It was not suffering from a lack of credibility; it was suffering from an act of pure madness.</DOC>

 - Naturally, all members in the House will be disappointed to hear reports  that there is a possibility that the pulp mill at Burnie could close. I am particularly disappointed and amazed that the member for Hotham could stand in this House and point an accusing finger at this side of the House, at the government, for this particular response. - The situation clearly is that this government has acted regarding matters of concern to Amcor in relation to the continuing operation of the paper industry. We have introduced into the House of Representatives - and it has passed through the House, as you know - a massive reform of Australia's anti-dumping and countervailing duty mechanisms. - `Too late,' he says. Who put the measures in place? The member for Hotham has been vocal in criticising Australia's anti-dumping and countervailing duty mechanisms - and rightly so - but he and his government put them in place. For eight years Amcor and, indeed, other Australian industries suffered under the incompetent measures that Labor had put in place. We have moved to reform those measures and the company has welcomed that response. As regards the situation at the paper mill at Burnie, the member for Braddon has been very active in putting forward the concerns of the local industry and addressing the issues of concern. Everyone is aware of the fact that the mill is old and that the company was anxious, having spent some considerable money on investments there and in other places.But let us look at the core of the problem. Many of the problems of that plant and indeed other manufacturing industries in Australia can fairly go back to the industrial relations practices of the Labor government - their failure to provide the kind of environment in which business could invest and expand with confidence. - Yes, but only after you left government. It has to be said that over the last couple of years the union has worked with management to try to improve work practices and to get some of the rorts that were put in place and  remained in place under a Labor government out of the system. - Indeed some of the things that were going on in that plant made the MUA look like a work gang. -  - And the President of the ACTU during that period was none other than the member for Hotham, who stood by while those practices occurred. Over recent times, with the assistance of this government and the member for Braddon, there have been substantial advances. I believe that the company should respond to that improvement in the work force and look at ways in which the workers in this plant can be put to productive employment. The government is considering the proposals that are being put to it by the member for Braddon and the way in which it should respond to this issue. We have delivered effective anti-dumping and countervailing duty mechanisms. We delivered the sort of investment environment that business wants in this country and we have created the sort of circumstances to make profitable investment in Australia a reality for many Australian companies including, I believe, in the paper industry.</DOC>

 - No-one could have missed the point that the Australian Labor Party opposes tax reform. -  - Mr Speaker, they keep saying that they are in favour of tax reform - they are just against every measure that would actually implement it. They keep saying that they are in favour of tax reform - it is just that they never really got around to doing it in their 13 years of government. They keep saying that they are in favour of tax reform - but we are still to know the membership of the Labor Party backbench consultative committee on tax reform. They are very interested in backbench committees on consultative tax reform. Let me ask this question: who is on the Labor Party backbench consultative committee on tax reform? Who is on it? Put your hands up. Dick Adams is on it. Who else? Good heavens, Mr Speaker, Mr Dick Adams is the only one on it. I will not say any more, Dick, but you will have a big presence in relation to tax reform. Could it be that the Labor Party does not have a backbench committee on tax reform? Could that be the explanation? -  - This is the party that is so interested in tax reform - the only things it has forgotten to do is to set up a body to look at it and to announce who is on it. Let me tell you what the Labor Party really does want. The Labor Party really loves the wholesale sales tax. It is important that people realise this: the Labor Party is going to fight in the next election for the wholesale sales tax system. That is the Labor Party. They say, `We are against GSTs or broad based indirect tax regimes because they can go up.' -  - They always shout the loudest when they are about to get the biggest  point. Would we be right in asking the Australian Labor Party this question -  - It is an unfair fight, Mr Speaker. Can a wholesale sales tax rise? It would not be the case that you could increase a wholesale sales tax, would it? You would not get a government taking a 10 per cent rate to a 12 per cent rate, would you? A government could not take a 20 per cent rate to a 22 per cent rate, could it? A government could not increase the wholesale sales tax from 30 per cent to 32 per cent, could it? Let me tell you about the Labor Party's wholesale sales tax system. In 1985, the wholesale sales tax did not cover biscuits, ice-cream and snack foods. Labor put a wholesale sales tax, without people knowing it, on biscuits, ice-cream and snack foods. In 1985, the wholesale sales tax did not cover domestic stoves and ranges. In 1985 the wholesale sales tax did not cover boats; it did not cover flavoured milk and fruit juice. Right throughout 13 years of government the Australian Labor Party not only increased the rates by stealth but also changed the classifications by stealth. The people of Australia ought to know this: the reason Labor likes the wholesale sales tax system is that they increase the taxes without letting on. That is the real advantage of a wholesale sales tax. You do it in two ways: by changing the classifications and by increasing the rates.These are very important figures and I hope that the Labor Party's consultative backbench committee on tax reform takes them in. At the beginning of the 1990s, total indirect taxes - that is, the taxes the government collected off goods - represented seven per cent of GDP. In 1993, that had fallen to 6.1 per cent. Why? Because the proportion of goods as a proportion to the economy is naturally declining. As a consequence, if you want to maintain a declining tax base, Labor in the 1993 budget, in order to preserve that tax base, lifted indirect tax by $3 billion. You do not have to do anything but just let the system run for the wholesale sales tax take to decline in proportion to GDP.This is very important. The 1998-99 budget papers show that the total indirect tax is forecast to decline further as a share of GDP to 5.9 per cent in 2001-2002. For the Labor Party to maintain the indirect tax to GDP ratio, it means that by 2001-2002 it would have to lift tax on indirect taxes; it would have to lift taxes on goods by one per cent of GDP, or $7 billion, just to maintain the tax to GDP ratio - by $7 billion. On the current declining indirect tax base, if the Labor Party just wants to keep revenues to GDP constant - this is leaving aside how the Labor Party would fund an income tax cut, because that is off in the never-never - in the next term of parliament, if the Labor Party is elected and it wants to maintain the current goods based indirect tax system, it will have to lift taxes by one per cent of GDP, or by $6 billion or $7 billion.Mr Speaker, are you starting to get the picture? Are you starting to get the picture of what it actually means when you say that you are against a GST? What it actually means is precisely what it meant in 1993. It means this: higher indirect taxes which would have to rise by $6 billion or $7 billion, and no income tax cuts. That is precisely what Labor policy means. That is precisely the trick it is going to try and get away with again.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker -  -  - Let me tell you what we are going to do. We are going to announce reform of the Australian taxation system. We are going to reform the indirect tax base -  - Mr Speaker, we are going to reform the indirect tax base because it needs reforming. We are going to give ordinary wage and salary earners a better deal under income tax. - I want the House to know what the government's tax position is. -  - We are going to reform the indirect tax base. We are going to make sure that ordinary wage and salary earners get a better deal out of income tax. We are going to make sure -  - Mr Speaker, I would have long finished before now, but I just want to give the House a view on the government's tax position. The government is going to reform the indirect tax system. The government is going to give average wage and salary earners a better deal under income tax. -  - The government is going to take poverty traps out of the interplay between the income tax and social security system. - The way in which that works out will ensure that revenue to GDP does not increase. - Mr Speaker, why does revenue to GDP not increase? Revenue to GDP does not increase because the budget is in surplus. - Mr Speaker, we also give this undertaking: that the tax to GDP proportion will not rise. -  - Why will the tax to GDP proportion not rise? Because the budget is in surplus. - The budget is in surplus. This government does not need more revenue. The budget is in surplus - and the budget is in surplus, Mr Speaker, not because of anything the Labor Party did. Here is the Labor Party. The Labor Party says -  - But the Labor Party says, `We are against indirect tax reform. We want to cut income taxes and, what is more, we will do it out of coalition surpluses.' That is what they are saying. How would we have been if we had tried to fund our income tax cuts, our family tax initiative, out of Mr Beazley's surplus? We would have minus $10,000 million to pay for the family tax initiative.When we release our tax package, not only will we be releasing a broad reform of the Australian taxation system but we will be releasing full costings and we will be doing it much more than the Australian Labor Party. If it had anything to do with you, sport, there would be no surpluses for the Australian economy or for anything else.</DOC>

 - Today's current account deficit was better than expectations. The balance of payments estimates for the March quarter of 1998 indicate a seasonally adjusted current account deficit of $7.5 billion, in line with the budget time expected outcome for 1997-98 of $25 billion. The sharp rise in current account deficit is expected to be temporary and concentrated in 1998, with some narrowing occurring in 1999. The budget papers note that the widening of the current account deficit in 1998-99 is expected to be concentrated in 1998 and that, as a percentage of GDP, the outcome for a particular quarter will be higher than the year average deficit of 5¼ per cent of GDP. This is consistent with comments by the governor of the Reserve Bank that the current account deficit will be 5½ per cent of GDP in calendar 1998 or even touch six per cent for a time. The reason for the widening -  - Yes, six per cent. - Not the 6.7 per cent of three years ago. Yes, that was the point I think the member for Werriwa was making. - The sharp downturn in Asia has come at a time when growth in domestic spending is strong, which is leading to continued strong growth in imports. - Further evidence of the health of domestic demand came today with the release of the April housing approvals figures. - The April rise of 8.3 per cent in relation to housing approvals was well above market expectations of a two per cent fall.As I said earlier, the balance of payments estimate in nominal dollars was $7.5 billion. This was apparently too much for the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, who went out to do a doorstop. I call on him to release the transcript of his doorstop today because it began with this statement:Evans: We have just announced Australia's worst ever current account deficit. - No, this is what you said:Evans: We have just announced Australia's worst ever current account deficit.Journalist: Mr Evans, you said this is the worst on record. Statistics say it is the worst for three years. Can you explain how you are saying it is the worst ever?Evans: $7.5 billion is the worst dollar outcome for a current account deficit in Australian history.Journalist: It reached 7.8 in May 1995.Evans: That is unless they have revised the figures. - That is not what he said at all. This is what he said:We have just announced Australia's worst ever current account deficit. . . Journalist: It reached 7.78 in May 1995. - He said:Evans: That is unless they have revised the figures. I mean, at 7.5, I was - On the figures that I saw it was the worst ever.Journalist: Well today they are saying it is the worst in three years.Evans: Well it's certainly the worst in the memory of most Australians.Three years - isn't it convenient to have a memory that only goes back three years? -  - The Australian Labor Party loves a memory going back for three years -  -  - His memory only goes back three years because the year he does not want to remember is 1993, when they had income tax -  -  - He does not want to go back more than three years because he does not want to remember those income tax cuts which were not a promise but were L-A-W and which the Australian Labor Party stole. Here we have the Deputy Leader of the Opposition whose memory goes back three years. He's Mr Amnesia. We have the Leader of the Opposition who pleads insanity. We have Mr Amnesia and Mr Insane, the Deputy Leader and the Leader - the Goof Brothers.</DOC>

 - I have heard in the past few days of the possibility of the closure. I will check exactly when, and if there is any relevance in the exact time I will inform the House.I am glad the honourable member for Hotham has raised this matter, and I say at the outset that, irrespective of any political points that may be made on it, if the closure does go ahead it will be a matter of concern for the several hundred men and women who may lose their jobs. I want to compliment the work of my colleague the member for Braddon, my parliamentary secretary, who spent the large part of this morning, as I understand it, in Melbourne meeting senior executives of the company trying to persuade them to delay the closure.I want to make a couple of relevant points. It passes not only strange but absolutely hypocritical for the Labor Party, which, in a conspiracy with the Greens and others, destroyed in 1989 the largest ever manufacturing investment in Australia's history - namely, the Wesley Vale pulp mill. If the Labor Party had not bowed to the radical environmental view on the Wesley Vale pulp mill, then hundreds of Tasmanian blue-collar workers would now have a brighter employment outlook. The Labor Party's weakness in 1989 on the Wesley Vale pulp mill has done more than anything else to jeopardise the economic and employment future of people working in north-west Tasmania.It is indecent hypocrisy for the Labor Party to be shedding crocodile tears about the employees in Burnie when they calculatedly destroyed the job prospects of perhaps a thousand people in 1989 when they rejected a manufacturing investment worth $1.2 billion - a manufacturing investment that would have given employment hope for the people of north-west Tasmania years into the future. Yet you now have the indecency and  you have the hypocrisy to come into this parliament and start lecturing my government. - Yes, you do have the hypocrisy to do it. Yet your government in 1989 had the opportunity to give a new lease of life to the workers of north-west Tasmania. You had the opportunity in 1989. - You had the opportunity to do something, and what did you do? You threw away an investment of $1.2 billion. That investment would have guaranteed the future of hundreds of jobs in north-west Tasmania, but you threw it away. At that time, it was the biggest manufacturing investment that Australia had seen, and you threw it away. You showed a complete indifference.I have already set in train arrangements for a meeting this afternoon of a number of ministers who have responsibility in this area, and I can assure you that whatever action that can be taken by my government will be taken. We do not draw any pleasure at all from this closure, but we draw equal displeasure from the humbug and the hypocrisy of a Labor government that destroyed hundreds of workers' jobs. You destroyed them deliberately and cold-bloodedly. - The Labor Party thought there were more votes in placating the Greens  than there were in preserving the jobs of blue-collar workers. That was the political judgment you made in 1989. You said Green votes in Tasmania were more important than the votes of battlers, and that is why you destroyed the Wesley Vale pulp mill. That is why you threw away a manufacturing investment of $1.2 billion. That is why you defied a lot of the advice you got from the trade union movement at that time. I remember these events well because I happened to be in Devonport with -  - You're one of the culprits. - I remember the day well when the Labor Party decided that Green votes in Tasmania were worth more than the jobs of blue-collar workers because I happened to be in Devonport that day attending a function with my colleague the parliamentary secretary, Mr Miles. I remember the dismay in the local community. I remember the sense of devastation amongst ordinary working families. - This was the first real hope that the workers of north-west Tasmania had had for 20 years. -  - They thought, `At long last this is a Labor government. They are meant to look after us.' -  - They said, `They will strike a blow for us.' -  - And, `Here's the biggest manufacturing investment in Australia's history.' And what did the Labor government of 1989 do? Remember the year? That year - 1989 - was the beginning of Graham Richardson's `get re-elected on Green preferences' strategy for the 1990 election. In 1989 the only thing that mattered was the affection of the Green movement, and if it meant sacrificing a few hundred blue-collar workers, if it meant throwing a few trade unionists on the scrap heap, if it meant destroying the biggest manufacturing investment in Australia's history - what the matter? They were interested only in the votes of environmentalists.The last people who have any credibility to come into this parliament and tell us what to do in relation to protecting the jobs of blue-collar workers are the members of that government stretching back to 1989. They had a choice in 1989. It was either you placate the Greens or you generate jobs for blue-collar battlers. What they decided to do was to dump the blue-collar battlers and placate the Greens, and it will ever be to their discredit that, when faced with that choice, they turned their back on the blue-collar workers of north-west Tasmania.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for her question. The question of the unfair dismissal law has been on ongoing issue. -  - It is interesting that we have that interjection from the Leader of the Opposition because the Labor Party is continuing, and has, a policy to oppose a further exemption for small business from the unfair dismissal law. In fact, we have been advocating a change to provide a benefit for the small business community and you have been doing as you usually do: under direction from the trade union movement, you have twice rejected a measure which would provide real benefit to the small business community and would create jobs. That is the reality of it. You have stood in the way of a sensible reform that would provide a lot of jobs in the small business community. So whether it is Wesley Vale or whether it is small business today, what is your interest? You are dictated to by the trade union movement. You have got frontbenches more interested in fashion than they are in jobs in their own electorates.This latest survey just reinforces the point that we do need further reform in the area of unfair dismissal. If you look at this particular survey, it has come out at a time when we also have a survey from the New South Wales Chamber of Commerce. That is an interesting fact as well because not only do we have a federal unfair dismissal law, but there is also a state unfair dismissal law, in particular in New South Wales. In New South Wales, with the only Labor government in the country in  place, in the period between January and April this year we have seen 1,850 unfair dismissal claims at the state level, which is more than four times the number of federal claims lodged in that state.We have certainly seen a reduction in the total level of unfair dismissal claims in the federal system as a result of our reforms. They have reduced by about 50 per cent, which is a significant reduction, particularly when you take into account that during that period, at the Commonwealth level, we have taken over responsibility for the Victorian jurisdiction. So we have seen a significant reduction in the total level federally.In the state of New South Wales, though, within the state system, we have seen an increase in the number of unfair dismissal claims. That reflects the fact that, at both the state level as well as the federal level, the state administration is doing as the unions dictate, that is, have a very free and easy unfair dismissal scheme that has encouraged claims in New South Wales. Who are the people to suffer? They are those who are unemployed and those in small business who would otherwise give those people a job.The last point I make comes from Recruitment Solutions. What they say is - and I am quoting from the Daily Telegraph today:. . . around the country between 5 and 10 per cent of all businesses report cutting their work forces because they fear being caught in legal action.Between five and 10 per cent! There are 900,000 small businesses in Australia. If the number is between five and 10 per cent, then obviously the estimate from the small business association is that you would have 50,000 new jobs if we could have the exemption which we have proposed to the Senate carried. That is, I think, therefore, further evidence why it is very important that that measure finally achieves passage so that we get a benefit for small business. You could not put it better than the Daily Telegraph  puts it in its editorial today. It says:Labour market reform was a critical issue in the last federal election, and it will be so in the next - which senators hoping to return to office should remember.  It makes this simple point: that the unfair dismissal laws are a `brake on the wheels of production.' Who is applying that brake? None other than the Labor Party.</DOC>

 - I take the opportunity of affirming to the member for Dickson that my government is committed to fair and effective and comprehensive tax reforms. I also take the opportunity of affirming to the member for Dickson that my government seeks a balanced and fair approach in the more difficult social areas related to child support. I think all of us, whatever our politics, will know that, of the many issues that come across our desks as local members, nothing quite excites the unrelieved passion and feeling of people - on either side of the argument - as feeling that they have not been fairly treated by child support processes. As a local member I have spoken to aggrieved custodial parents and aggrieved non-custodial parents and they have each spoken with the same degree of passion and feeling about how unfair the system is. It is just a timely and regular commentary on the human fact that, when a marriage or a relationship breaks down, sadly enough there is a great deal of human emotion unleashed. -  - I can tell by the responses of the member for Cunningham and the member for Brisbane, at least, that they have probably had the same experiences, unless they have constituencies that are atypical of the rest of Australia.But while I am on my feet, and mindful of the person who asked me the question, I am delighted to announce that the endorsed Liberal candidate against Mrs Cheryl Kernot for the next federal election is the former ABC talkback host Mr Rod Henshaw. He will be an outstanding candidate, and he will carry the standard in a very articulate way. I believe that Mr Henshaw, of all the candidates that will be on offer, will offer a better understanding. I understand, for example, he has been an resident of the electorate of Dickson for 20 years. That makes him a little different from that blow-in from the Gold Coast who in fact has now become the ALP candidate.I say to the person who asked me the question that I know from my discussions with him and I know from the interviews that I have had with him that Mr Henshaw is committed to a better taxation system for the future of Australia. I know that Mr Henshaw has a very balanced view towards the many social challenges that face people within the electorate of Dickson. I think he will bring an understanding of the young person's view. I think he will also have a sympathy -  - Oh, Tony! I am trying to disadvantage Cheryl. - I have not finished. I think Mr Henshaw will bring an understanding of tax issues. He will bring an understanding of the family relationship issues that are involved in child support. I think he will have a very good understanding of the concerns, the hopes and the aspirations of that often referred to group in the Australian community called the `baby boomers'. But, consonant with the approach of my party, he will not be taking the view that the baby boomers are the only people on the planet; he will be taking the view that, as a Liberal member of parliament, he is elected to represent the entire constituency. I believe that he will do it admirably and with very great distinction in the next parliament.</DOC>

 - First of all, I thank the honourable member for Griffith for his question. I recognise the enormous amount of work the honourable member does to advance Australia's interests, including in the field of international relations. What an excellent job he has done for Australia in this parliament.The relationship between Australia and the United Kingdom is a very warm, a very close and a very strong relationship. I think it was very much epitomised by the most successful New Images promotion we had last year that brought to the attention of the British people and the Australian people much more modern perspectives of our respective societies. I think both of us believe that the New Images program was very successful. We operate on our relationship now as a relationship based on mutual respect and equality and, as I have said, it is a relationship that has developed very well.That does not mean of course that in the 1990s we, as a government, go to the United Kingdom to find the source of our policies or ideas for the evolution of our foreign policy. We clearly do not. When we put together before the last election our document A Confident Australia, we wrote it ourselves. When we produced the white paper on foreign policy and trade, we wrote that ourselves.That does stand in some contrast to other documents that have been brought to my attention. In January this year at the Labor Party conference - and we all remember that - the Labor Party produced a document called Securing Australia's Place in the World. People may wonder, members may wonder, `Why is that relevant to Australia's relationship with the United Kingdom?' It is, in a very interesting way. That document has at its outset an explanation of Labor's objectives and challenges. What is interesting about that explanation is the way it contrasts with the British Labour government's `Mission Statement' of its foreign policy - a very interesting comparison, Mr Speaker. The British government says that its foreign policy is to promote the national interests of the United Kingdom. Labor's is to promote Australia's national interest. That is all right. - You are right. That is okay. -  - But is this okay? The British government outlined four specific ways in which they are going to do that: security, prosperity - most governments would do that - quality of life, mutual respect. Australian Labor: security, living standards, quality of life, mutual respect. Where did you get that from? They are sitting down there reading Robin Cook's documents, reading the documents of the British government, and then repackaging them and presenting them as something original.The fact is that this act of subservience is the most subservient act in Australian political history since the Scullin government called on  the Governor of the Bank of England to try to fix the Australian economy. That was in the 1930s. You did it then, and you did it again in the 1980s. This is to say nothing of the extensive plagiarism in the Labor Party document. There are 13 policies in the Labor Party document which have either been completely plagiarised or paraphrased from either government policy or the Simons review of foreign aid.Two years in opposition; no work except to look up the British Labour government's policy and to read the government's documents. We have as the opposition spokesman the member for Kingsford-Smith, a man who will go down in history as the laziest opposition spokesman on foreign affairs in history. It is 2 June today. He is about to ask a question. If he asks that question of me, it will be the first he has asked in 1998.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kingsford-Smith for the question. It is true that the Israeli Prime Minister has been invited. The precise date is still to be finally settled but there are dates around the one mentioned by the member for Kingsford-Smith that are under consideration. I take the  view that the Prime Minister of Israel, whoever he or she may be, is always welcome in Australia. I take the opportunity on behalf of my government to strongly reaffirm our strong commitment to and affection for Israel and our admiration of what has been achieved by the state of Israel since its foundation in such difficult and hostile circumstances in 1948.As it happens, I have had the opportunity on two occasions in recent months - one when speaking at the United Israel Appeal in Sydney in the presence of Mr Shimon Peres, former Prime Minister of Israel and a person for whom I have immense personal regard - to not only state what I have just said about my attitude and the attitude of my government to the state and the people of Israel but also to say that I look forward to the full consummation of the peace process in the Middle East. I said at that dinner, as I have said on other occasions, that Israel has a responsibility as much as the other parties in the Middle East to bring about that peace settlement.I think Israel carries a special responsibility along with the representatives of the Palestinian people. I respect the rights and the aspirations of the Palestinian people and I will use my opportunities and authority to press that view on the Prime Minister of Israel. The close friendship which I have personally with the people of the Jewish community in Australia and the close friendship between Australia and Israel carry with them the right and opportunity to press a point of view that might temporarily be unpopular. I will certainly be pressing very strongly on the Israeli government the need for it to play its part, but I do that against the background of saying yet again to the people of Israel that their right to exist behind secure, defensible and impregnable boundaries is something that successive Australian governments have always held dear, and that will continue to be our policy. I think it is very important that the aspirations of the Palestinian people, which have been recognised in UN resolutions, also be respected. It will be the intention of my government to see that fairness and justice is done to all parties in the Middle East.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hinkler for his question and I acknowledge his great support for young people in his electorate. The government's policies for higher education are aimed at increasing the quality of the university education available to Australians and aimed at access to universities. I am very pleased to inform the House that this year there will be record numbers of domestic students in Australian universities. In 1998 there will be 457,000 domestic students in Australian universities, 18,000 more than in Labor's last year, 1996. It is of interest that when we look at the Labor Party's forward estimates for government funded undergraduate places for this year, 1998, we see the Labor Party undertook to provide 364,000 government funded undergraduate places.This government has delivered 28,000 government funded undergraduate places more than Labor undertook to deliver this year. So this government is widening access dramatically for young Australians to get a university education. We have been able to do this because we have taken a practical, non-ideological approach to opening the doors to Australian universities. We have increased the numbers of fully funded government places in Australian universities, which are now running for undergraduates at 10,000 more than in Labor's last year.This is the first year in which the government is providing funding at an average of some $2,500 for overenrolments. The government this year has provided for some 29,000 overenrolments in universities. Perhaps most importantly and significantly, because this goes to the fundamental equity of entry to Australian universities, we have given young Australians the same rights of entry to Australian universities as overseas students, rights  they were denied for years by the Labor Party. These policies which are opening the doors to young Australians -  - are under threat from the Labor Party. So far, the only policy the Labor Party has announced for universities is to cut places -  - to take away places from the hundreds of young Australians who are showing they are prepared to invest in their first preference university course. This is a purely ideological policy. What they want to do is to restore the discrimination against young Australians of getting a place in Australian universities, as overseas students are permitted to do. Why is this the only policy that the Labor Party has announced? Because it is the only policy that has been strongly advocated to them by the trade union movement; because it is the policy of the National Union of Students; and because it is the policy of the National Tertiary Education Union. Beyond that, there is nothing else. There is no other policy.The member for Werriwa has had no interest, as we know, in developing education policies for the Labor Party. Their schools policy is closing schools. Why? Because that is the policy of the Australian Education Union. I am pleased to see that the member for Werriwa is up-front about this. At the ALP National Conference in January this year, he was nothing if not frank. I would like to quote what the member for Werriwa had to say. He said:. . . in the months ahead - that is, in the months ahead from January - I look forward to working closely with the leadership of the two unions, the Australian Education Union and the National Tertiary Education Union, to turn the contents of this Chapter into the programs and policies of a Beazley Labor Government.  You cannot get franker than that. That is how the education policies of the Labor Party are formed. That is why their only policies so far are to close schools and to cut places for young Australians to enter universities. They are not interested in educational opportunities for young Australians; they are not interested in expanding educational opportunity. They are interested in who is going to man the polling booths on polling day; they are interested in who is going to give the funds to the Australian Labor Party for their election campaign; they are interested in the people who control the votes at the Labor Party conferences and control the preselections because the Labor Party is a sectional party. It is a party which speaks on behalf of narrow, sectional interests in the community. It is not interested in young Australians, it is not interested in education, it is not interested in expanding access, it is not interested in quality; and it is up to this government to continue to defend the rights of young Australians to gain the education for which they are qualified.</DOC>

 - As I have said before, one of the fairly good things about getting a question from the member for Batman is that it always give you a very clear steer to what the facts are: they are the exact opposite to the facts implied in the question. You can never rely on anything the member for Batman says, and  the reason for that is that the Labor Party deeply resents the fact that this government has been responsible for one of the greatest social reforms of the last 50 years, one that will be giving unemployed people a real chance to get a job. - The member for Batman is totally wrong, as usual. These matters are monitored in close detail day by day by my department, and I can inform the House of the facts. As of 1 June, over 133,000 job seekers have been identified for referral, 89,000 have already been referred to intensive assistance and a further 44,000 job seekers are currently making their choice of provider. The government is already ahead of the target for the end of June of 125,000 referrals. The Job Network has been extraordinarily effective in its first month of operation. The Job Network members, with enormous enthusiasm, are out there -  - The Job Network has been extraordinarily effective in building up the number of vacancies available to unemployed people. It now has well over 1,400 sites open around Australia for unemployed people to go to, and unemployed people have got the real dignity of being able to choose which provider they will go to. They are no longer treated as statistics. They are now able to get the sort  of help that they really need. One of the important features of the Job Network is that it is especially geared to help those most in need of extra assistance and intensive assistance. I am pleased to be able to say that it appears from early indications that over 40 per cent of -  - The government, as I have already said, is well ahead of its target for June of 125,000 referrals. We already have another 44,000 job seekers referred to intensive assistance in the process of choosing their agency, and that will happen within the next couple of weeks. It is quite clear that the information that the honourable member for Batman has purported to put before the House is quite wrong. I was in the process of saying that the Job Network is especially effective in helping the most disadvantaged job seekers. It appears that over 40 per cent of the vacancies already filled by Job Network members have been filled by long-term unemployed people.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for La Trobe for his question. The member has a lot of experience in the building industry. I know he is very supportive of the policy that we have for this area, which was part of an ongoing program the government has in place to encourage reform in the building industry. Last week on Friday I released guidelines for the building and construction industry that will set in train and will encourage further reform of that industry and will provide further protections for subcontractors in that industry, particularly against the ravages of the CFMEU. - I am, Mr Speaker. I am referring to a policy which has already been announced. - These interjections come from an opposition that cannot even lodge an MPI on time. These are the people who are concerned about the workers in Burnie but could not lodge an MPI. They could not even get it in by 12 o'clock. - No interjection will save you, Simon. - Mr Speaker, your policy for requiring letters on the MPI has been in place for many years. You have to get it in by 12 o'clock. If you think it is really important, get it in by 12. - I am answering the question, Mr Speaker. I am answering the question which goes to the incompetence of the Labor Party, whether it is lodging MPIs or whether it is doing what they are told by the trade union movement.I was very pleased that in the Sydney Morning Herald the building industry specialists contractors organisation is reported as welcoming the government's policy announcements and our reform initiatives for the building industry. It was said that the move by the government to introduce a code of practice for the industry was long overdue. It certainly has been well overdue. This is one of a series of steps that we have taken since we have been in government to give a fair go to the building industry and, in particular, to the tens of thousands of small businesses that make up the building industry and that for far  too long have been subject to coercion and duress by the CFMEU and others.It was therefore no surprise that in response to the very sensible, moderate and considered proposals that the government has previously announced that Mr Kingham of the CFMEU made some statements. What he said was very revealing. The following was reported in the Sunday Age:Mr Kingham said the CFMEU had secured a commitment from the federal opposition leader Mr Kim Beazley to unravel any changes made by employers if Labor wins the next federal election.What is Labor's secret policy? What is the special deal they have done with the building workers union? - I suppose you are not allowed to work in the building industry unless you are a member of the CFMEU. - The CFMEU went on, through Mr Kingham, on the weekend to state:Unions wanted a Beazley government to return to the centralised system that preceded the enterprise bargaining approach legislated by Mr Paul Keating as Prime Minister.Isn't it interesting, Mr Speaker, if you go back over the public record, that one of the biggest donors to the Labor Party is none other than the CFMEU. I went back to 1992-93, $116,000; 1994-95, $251,000; 1995-96 -  - Oh yes, a great sensitivity. Got you again. You have had a busy day, haven't you, Kimbo? - In 1995-96 they paid $553,000 to tell you what your policy would be. - In 1996-97 the CFMEU paid the Labor Party $277,000 to buy you off. Over a million dollars, with the unions telling you what to do. - I intend to conclude, Mr Speaker. I thank you for the invitation to do so. My point is a simple one. We announced a policy for the benefit of the building industry which would provide real protection for small business, and within three days the unions, who fund the Labor Party, are telling the Labor Party to oppose the very benefits for the small business community which we have announced. Whether it is in the building industry, whether it is in unfair dismissal, whether it is with the MUA, when it is a choice between the unions and small business, every time they are for the unions.</DOC>

 - I will come directly to the question asked about Mr Ryan, but before I do, by way of putting the issue into context, could I say that my attention has been drawn to what can only be described as appallingly destructive comments made by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition about the Australian economy. Not only did the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, in giving a doorstop, get his historical facts wrong about the current account deficit but the Deputy Leader of the Opposition did something that no responsible shadow Treasurer should do, and that is he  deliberately sought to talk down the Australian economy. -  - I would like Hansard  to note, Mr Speaker, that in response to that comment of mine the Deputy Leader of the Opposition received some pats on the back from members of the Labor Party. Apparently it is perfectly acceptable to talk down the Australian economy.This is what he had to say. Bear in mind that these remarks are made against the background that we have established the first budget surplus in eight years, we have established the strongest economic foundations that Australia has had for 25 years, we had the lowest interest rates in 30 years and the lowest inflation rate in the OECD area, and we are seen by the rest of the world as being a stable, secure and safe economy amidst a sea of economic turmoil. This is what the Deputy Leader of the Opposition had to say today. He was asked by a journalist, `Are we looking at banana republic levels?' - No wonder the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is sensitive, because apparently this is the same transcript from which the Treasurer quoted earlier in question time. Like the Leader of the Opposition, this deputy has a habit that, if he said something embarrassing, he does not distribute his transcript, and we have to go around pointing these things out to the gallery. He was asked the question, `Are we looking at banana republic levels?' - This is what he had to say:Journalist: GDP. Are we looking at banana republic levels?Well, not quite yet, but clearly banana republic was six per cent plus; we're looking at 5½ per cent now, with the full effect of Asia still to bite.In other words, you were deliberately trying to fan a sense of insecurity in the Australian economy. You were trying to talk the Australian economy down. You were trying to make it plain that the Australian economy faced the same problems that it had faced in the 1980s. For anybody with any sense of responsibility to compare the state of the Australian economy now with the situation in the 1980s is utterly and completely irresponsible.I do not know the writings of Mr Ryan. I will go and have a look at them. The reality is that the existing indirect tax system does have a very harmful effect on our exporters and a very harmful effect on our manufacturers.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kennedy for his question because I know of his interest in defence matters. I am pleased to say that this morning I announced our strategic defence industry policy at the annual procurement conference, attended by some 750 people who are interested in these matters.This is the third policy in a trilogy of defence policies brought down by this government; the first being the defence efficiency review, the second being Australia's strategic  policy and the third being the strategic defence industry policy. - This policy, quite frankly, was required because our strategic policy identified that we needed to do the direct opposite of what the former government had decided was the role of defence, which was to puddle around in its own backyard. - Thank you, Mr Speaker. The policy has been announced. - If you had been listening, I told you a few moments ago that it was announced at the annual procurement conference, which was attended by some 750 people. - As I said, the strategic industry policy is needed to back up the strategic policy, which puts in place this government's strategic policy for defence. It is the direct opposite of what the former government required of our defence force, which was to puddle around in its own backyard.This government has clearly identified the need of our defence force to be able to deploy  off this continent and to deploy in the region. To enable us to do that, we need a strategic defence industry policy to sustain that deployment. The policy itself has 49 initiatives and, unlike defence industry policy that has been brought down by the former government - which never had the endorsement of whole of government and indeed never had an implementation plan - this policy has full endorsement and consultation of industry. - Thank you, Mr Speaker. As I said, the legacy that we received from the previous government was one that needed tremendous attention from this government, both from Mr McLachlan and myself. Indeed, it was the commitment of the Prime Minister, Mr John Howard, who said that there were to be no further cuts to defence under this government, that has enabled us to put into place policies that will allow the ADF to truly be able to defend this country. The policy that the previous government followed, of fitting platforms for but not with, has left us with a situation where we have built splendid new frigates for but not with, which in fact are floating targets. It is up to this government to give them the wherewithal to be able to truly defend this nation. - Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. As I said, it is really necessary for our frigates to be able to defend themselves in a high threat environment. If the Leader of the Opposition, the former minister for defence, thinks you can do that with a five-inch gun and a Sea Sparrow missile, he had better think again. What is clearly required is an upgrade of both missiles and radar, which are clearly in the area of defence industry. This is the government which will enable our defence force to adequately defend this country.As I said, there are 49 initiatives in the policy. There is also an implementation plan so that people will be able to see the time line when things will be implemented. It has  whole of government support, and I table a copy of this document, Defence and Industry Strategic Policy Statement.</DOC>

 - In reply to the Acting Leader of the Opposition, he must be the only Acting Leader of the Opposition whose party won't list any of his speeches on its web site page, but I will come to that in a minute. I wonder whether the Deputy Leader of the Opposition was watching the Lateline  program last night. If he had been watching the Lateline  program last night he would have seen the exposure of the complete hypocrisy of the Labor Party on this issue. In an interview the state secretary of the ALP in Queensland, Mike Kaiser, made this comment in relation to the seat of Ashgrove, where the Labor Party has put the Australia First party, whose views on many matters are similar to those of One Nation. - In fact, the founder of Australia First accused One Nation of stealing its policies from Australia First. What Kaiser said was as follows:What we've done in the seat of Ashgrove is simply put a party ahead of the Nationals and Liberals which can't win seats in Queensland. The reality is no poll has suggested that Australia First can win a seat. - So what in reality the Labor Party is saying is that it is not a ques  tion of what a party believes in, it is not a question of what its platform is; it is a question of political tactics, it is a question of political advantage. What you are doing is pretending that you have the high moral ground -  - when in reality it is simply a matter of political tactics. Your own leader this morning had this to say. -  - Not surprisingly, he said that he appeals to everybody in Australia to give their first preference to the Labor Party, and, if they don't give it to the Labor Party, to give the Labor party their second preference. - In other words, he is prepared to take the preferences of people who support a party he criticised, yet he has the nerve to pour moral scorn on the government. - By all means let the Leader of the Opposition appeal for support around Australia but on the issue of preferences, after what Mr Kaiser has said, please spare us the sanctimonious sermons.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. Today's national accounts confirm that the Australian economy is growing strongly. In the March quarter the national accounts recorded 1.3 per cent growth, and over the course of the year 4.9 per cent growth in the Australian economy. A 4.9 per cent growth in the Australian economy puts Australia probably at the highest of the OECD, with possible exceptions in Finland and Mexico, but certainly higher than all of the G-7 economies.Although the national accounts are always subject to revision, and care has to be taken in interpreting any particular quarter, one can see that this is totally consistent with the budget forecasts of growth in 1997-98 of 3¾ per cent - indeed, at the moment considerably exceeding those forecasts. On the back of strong growth in this quarter those forecasts will be realised.Although today's national accounts showed that domestic demand was flat, other indicators, such as employment growth, job vacancies, building approvals, credit growth, import growth and continued strength in trading performance and business surveys all support strong domestic demand continuing. Although today's accounts also show a build-up in private stocks allowing for a trend decline in the stock to sales ratio, there was a low stock to sales ratio. Indeed, it appears that the build-up in public marketing authority stocks, particularly by the Australian Wheat Board, indicates that the Wheat Board was holding commodities such as wheat, barley and sugar - commodities which have now been sold and which will become exports in the next quarter and contribute to export growth in the final quarter of 1997-98.More recent building approvals numbers showing growth of 8.3 per cent in April and 19.5 per cent over the year indicate good investment in the economy. Business investment will be underpinned by continuing growth in corporate profits, which grew 3.5 per cent in March to be 7.5 per cent higher than a year earlier.  These figures are consistent with an economy which is showing low inflation, enjoying the lowest interest rates in generations and enjoying a government which has put the budget back in the black and is now reducing Commonwealth debt, and which has had remarkably strong growth up until March of this year, at 4.9 per cent. - I think most Australians will welcome strong growth in the Australian economy. Even though we hear interjections from some of the backbench of the Labor Party, complaining about high growth in the  Australian economy, I think the frontbench of the Australian Labor Party would be pleased to see growth of 4.9 per cent. I think even the frontbench of the Labor Party would say that the important decisions of getting Australia's budget back in the black, of locking in low inflation and of giving Australia low interest rates were important markers to get to this position.Whilst an external downturn in Asia will affect the Australian economy and mark down growth in 1998-99 from the levels that it has been in 1997-98, we can say without qualification that it was the decisions of the government to turn around the haemorrhaging deficit and debt strategy of Labor, to reduce inflation and to bring down interest rates that strengthened the Australian economy at a time of external challenge. No-one would want to be running the Australian economy if it were still running a $10 billion deficit now in the face of an external challenge of the dimension that we now have. Now is not the time to turn our backs on good economic policy; now is the time to continue it, to continue to strengthen the Australian economy against external challenge and to bring the benefits of low inflation and low interest rates to small businesses and home buyers in this country.</DOC>

 - As usual, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is completely wrong. How can a figure of 4.9 per cent, which is an accumulation of four quarters, be one-off? It is an accumulation of four quarters; you add up 12 months worth. It is not one-off, it is 12 months worth to get to 4.9 per cent. How can it be one-off? One-off over 12 months, is that what you are saying? This is a 4.9 per cent growth rate, 1.3 per cent for the quarter, and we get the Deputy Leader of the Opposition trying to make out that 4.9 per cent is a bad result. This is weird. This is absolutely weird.Yesterday, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition went out and said that we had the largest current account deficit ever, until it was pointed out that we had had a larger one back in - when was it? - 1995. He said it was the largest current account deficit in living memory. This morning, the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Beazley, came in at his doorstop to defend the credibility of his deputy leader with these words -  - I quote from the media report:Opposition Leader Kim Beazley today defended the credibility of his deputy Gareth Evans over his comments on yesterday's balance of payment figures.Mr Evans was forced into an embarrassing backdown after he described a $7.5 billion current account deficit for the first three months of 1998 as the worst in Australian history. . . Mr Beazley said people should not focus entirely on Mr Evans' comments . . . He may be his shadow Treasurer but, whatever you do, do not listen to him. It is Gareth - do not focus on his comments, just make him the Treasurer of the country. Here we have an incredible situation where a leader defends his deputy by saying, `Don't listen to what he says.' I do not think the people of Australia needed that advice; I think they had already come to that conclusion.</DOC>

 - Today's growth rate for the four quarters to March 1998 indicates that the Australian economy grew by 4.9 per cent. According to OECD data, a growth rate of that dimension - the growth rate of Australia in the last quarter - was higher -  - than that of Austria, Belgium, Britain, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United States. With the possible of exception of Finland and Mexico - both coming off recent downturns - the Australian economy is growing the fastest of the industrialised nations of the world, and I think that is good news. Even the Australian Labor Party would say now that getting good growth in the Australian economy, and the jobs growth and the increase in people's disposable income that that means, is a good thing. Even though they opposed the govern  ment in producing its budget surplus and opposed our economic strategy, I think that they would now concede that they were wrong to do that and that we are now seeing some of the benefits.The growth rate in Australia is probably - with the exception of China and Chinese Taipei - the highest growth rate in the Asian region. We are in a region which is now predominantly in recession. In Korea, there was a contraction of 3.8 per cent through the year to March 1998. In Malaysia, there was a contraction of 1.8 per cent through the year to March 1998. In Hong Kong, the economy contracted by two per cent through the year to March 1998 - the first negative growth in 13 years. In the Philippines, economic growth slowed to 1.7 per cent through the year to March 1998. And, as most people in Australia would know, Indonesia is currently in a severe contraction.One of the consequences of this is that Asia, which for 2½ decades has been an impetus to growth for Australia, is now having a contractionary effect on our economy. It means that it is more important than ever to get the domestic fundamentals right in Australia. The one thing that policy makers in Australia could always count on, regardless of what was happening in the domestic economy, was that Asia would be an engine of growth for Australia. Even when Labor had Australia in its worst recession in 60 years in 1990-91, they knew that Asia would be an engine for growth - it would be counteracting the recessionary forces in the domestic economy. We do not have that luxury today. Asia is now a contractionary force and we have to take countercyclical action in Australia to offset the downturn coming out of Asia.What measures do we have to have in Australia to make sure that we strengthen our domestic economy against this adverse external environment? A budget back in balance was the first thing that Australia needed, and it was what this government delivered on. The second thing was a low inflation rate, which we locked in by an agreement between the Reserve Bank of Australia and the government. We know the Labor Party opposed this. The Labor Party threatened to sue us over  locking in low inflation by an agreement with the Reserve Bank, but how important was that now? - When this government came to office, interest rates were 10½ per cent. Today, your standard variable mortgage will be as low as 6½ per cent - maybe lower. That is a benefit of four percentage points for the home buyer in Australia. That is great news for home buyers. That is great news for young people who are trying to buy homes and get a start in life - to give them those low interest rates.The fourth thing is to concentrate on reducing Labor's debt. The member for Cunningham interjects. Over the last five budgets of Labor Party government - and the member for Cunningham was the Speaker over that period - Labor ran up $80,000 million of debt. We cannot abolish Labor's debt overnight. We cannot just say that we will write off $80 billion that Labor bequeathed to us. But this government has a strategy to stabilise that government debt and to turn it. This will give young people opportunities that they would never have had. This is a pro-youth strategy to free young Australians from Labor's debt -  - to give them the opportunity to buy a house, to have low interest rates for small business, to give the economy a bit of a go under low inflation and to create opportunities. That is what the government is about. Those are the opportunities that we believe in.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker -  -  - I am not aware of the circumstances to which the honourable member refers. But I take the opportunity to say that the first legislation that I introduced as federal Treasurer in 1978 was the abolition of death duties -  -  - fulfilling a promise that was made by the coalition during the 1977 election. The reference made by the member for Jagajaga reminded me of the fulfilment of that commitment.But can I also take the opportunity of saying to those who sit opposite, and through them to the Australian people, that my government remains very strongly committed to taxation reform. My government remains very strongly committed to delivering a fairer taxation system to the Australian people. My government remains very strongly committed to removing a hidden wholesale taxation system whereby many household goods are taxed at rates of 22 per cent. My government remains very committed to reforming the taxation system so that the cheats are caught,  so that average families have a lighter tax burden and so that we have a fairer system all round.</DOC>

 - As it happens -  - When I was looking through the various news reports this morning, like the Treasurer I came across the ingenious defence made by the Leader of the Opposition of his deputy, in which he said,  `Please don't look at what my deputy said.' As I read further down -  - I found that the Leader of the Opposition was in fact suggesting that current economic settings were exerting upward pressure on interest rates. The Leader of the Opposition made this statement at about 11 o'clock this morning, and one would have thought that the Leader of the Opposition might have been roughly in tune with market circumstances. But, having made the allegation that the policies of the government were exerting upward pressure on interest rates, right on cue, eight minutes later at 11.08 a.m., the Commonwealth Bank of Australia issued a statement in which it said: `Australia's largest home loan provider, the Commonwealth Bank, today announced interest rate cuts of up to 0.35 per cent on its popular three-, four- and five-year fixed home loan rates.'Yesterday you had the Deputy Leader of the Opposition saying that 7.5 is more than 7.8. This morning you had the Leader of the Opposition, in the course of trying to explain away what his deputy had done yesterday and the appalling mess his deputy had made of a doorstop yesterday, making the bold statement that the government's policies are pushing interest rates up or exerting upward pressure on interest rates, as he has been running around the country doing for the last couple of weeks. But not within a day, not within half an hour, not within 15 minutes, but within eight minutes of that statement having come off the wire the Commonwealth Bank of Australia says that they are cutting their interest rates even further.It is a demonstration that the leadership of the Australian Labor Party is bereft of any economic intellect, that the leadership of the Australian Labor Party is utterly disconnected with what is happening in the Australian economy, that the leadership of the Australian Labor Party in government ran this country deeply into debt. They gave us the highest interest rates for 25 or 30 years and, in the face of the biggest interest rate reductions for  three decades, this morning you had the Leader of the Opposition trying to scare the Australian people into believing that there was upward pressure on interest rates. - So unintimidating were his remarks that within eight minutes the markets were at work and the markets, through the agency of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia -  - were announcing, unbelievably almost in the eyes of people, given what has happened over the last few years -  -  - They were announcing still further interest rate reductions. -  - I am very proud to say that my government has presided over interest rate levels that we have not seen since the late 1960s or the early 1970s. I think the Leader of the Opposition's understanding of market forces, so far as interest rates are concerned, is completely bereft of any reality. Not only is his deputy out of touch with economic circumstances and economic reality but, by his abysmal performance this morning, the Leader of the Opposition has demonstrated he has no idea of what is going on with the Australian economy and he is totally unqualified to resume any responsibility for years into the future.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, I have seen a summary of that. That particular report was raised with me when I met a group of pig producers in Toowoomba last Saturday and they put their situation to me. I undertook at that meeting to consider what had been put, and in fact I have conducted a number of discussions with colleagues about this matter. Somebody in the government will be having something to say on the subject within the next few days. But I take the opportunity given to me by the question asked by the honourable member to deal directly with the issue that is raised, and that is whether there is some simplistic solution to this problem by simply chopping off imports, because that is precisely what the honourable member is saying.It is very easy when you have an Australian industry under a bit of economic pressure as a result of imports to run around the country saying, `The answer to the problem is to choke off imports.' Unfortunately, most of the imports in this particular instance - unfortunately for the honourable member's argument - are coming from Canada. It so happens that we have something like an eight or nine to one trade balance against Canada. If we were to be so short-sighted as to chop off imports from a country in respect of which we have a trade balance of about nine to one, we would in fact be cutting off our  nose to spite our face. That would be a very unwise thing to do.The international economic reality is that when it comes to a trading nation like Australia, we need markets. We need people to buy the goods and services we produce. If we do not buy the goods and services other people produce, they will not buy what we produce. That is a constant of international trade. I say this very deliberately because the honourable member has been running around the place saying that it is all very easy to solve these problems by chopping off imports. If you chop off imports in the wrong place, you will chop off Australian jobs. If you do that you will chop off Australian jobs.I therefore say to those people in the pig industry - and I am sympathetic to their position; I listened very carefully to what they had to say, just as I am sympathetic to any industry that is under import pressure - that, if you chop off imports from one source and there is retaliation, you will end up doing up far more damage to your country, you will destroy more jobs and you will destroy more industry than if you had not taken that action.It is about time that all of us who are interested in a sensible debate and all of us who are interested in the future of Australian industry face the reality of this and stop running around uttering and mouthing populist one-liners offering simplistic solutions that would in fact damage the situation and leave us with fewer jobs, weaker industry and a far more impoverished trade situation. - </DOC>

 - I thank the member for O'Connor for his very timely question. I welcome some delegates from Farrer who are  here today, I might add. I would point out that Queensland exports - hello! Where is the member for Oxley? She has gone again. She can get to Goombungee to declare that she is pro-choice on abortion, but she cannot hang about here in question time for more than a few minutes. She has missed over 70 divisions this year.Opposition members - Put her last! Put her last! - It is interesting that in the first two years on votes on actual legislation she has missed 100 out of 148 divisions. - On Monday, she missed another five divisions, including one on the wheat industry.Opposition members - Put her last! Put her last! - Queensland, through great export effort, in fact exports over $200 million of sugar to Canada. Australian agriculture exports over eight times in dollar value to Canada what we import from Canada, as the Prime Minister has said with regard to agricultural products. It is a very important market for us.I am very pleased the member for O'Connor, in his astute way, has highlighted the fact that we have a great investment in sensible trade liberalisation. I recognise there is no such thing as a level playing field. I also recognise that the economic firestorms raging through Asia have forced our exporters to join with the government strategy of diversifying to other parts of the world as they deal with a very difficult situation which exists on our doorstep with a number of our key Asian markets. Therefore, in commenting on the Australian national account figures and the in effect 4.9 or five per cent growth over the last 12 months, I salute our exporters who have helped make a contribution, especially over the 10-month figures.In regard to diversification, I want to make two additional points. Japan is the world's second largest economy. Yes, it is hovering around zero growth, and that is a matter of concern. But, if you are the second largest economy in the world, even at zero growth you still need a lot of Australian intermediate goods, including coal and iron ore. And thank God they do. Hence, our intermediate goods exports have contributed to the fact that in the first 10 months of this financial year our exports to Japan are up 15.4 per cent, our exports to Taiwan are up 16.7 per cent, and our exports to China are up 9.4 per cent.If we look at another part of the world, one which I share a deep interest with my colleague the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who is about to go to the Middle East, the House would be interested to know that in the United Arab Emirates, Abu Dhabi and Dubai, two-way trade is now $1.6 billion. In Saudi Arabia two-way trade is now $1.3 billion.  Trade with Iran is $1 billion. With Egypt it is half a billion dollars. With Israel it is $394 million. The figures are available to the House through the trade outcomes and objective statement, which I tabled earlier this year. In other words, what we have done is help facilitate our export effort, help diversify our export effort, help demand and encourage demand, particularly with regard to our intermediate goods, and help with some hard edged trade negotiations at the bilateral, the regional and the multilateral levels.I want to add one other thing. In regard to the Australian national account figures, this is a bit of very important bookkeeping at the end of another quarter. I want to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the troika of the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, all three of whom through the economic management and leadership they have provided in regard to the budget and, in particular, the budget surplus are further helping to facilitate our export effort. If we were $10 billion in deficit today, if the Beazley deficit were still applying today, we would not be able to achieve those trade figures.The modernisation of Australian agriculture under the leadership provided by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has helped in that regard. The Australian government will do all it can to facilitate a diversified trade effort to the world, exports to every market opportunity in the world. We recognise there is no such thing as a level playing field, and we will work hard to further provide sensible support within the parameters of the World Trade Organisation to ensure that our exporters continue to create even more jobs.</DOC>

 - I am not aware of that particular analysis but I am aware of the analysis by Professor Neil Warren, which said that after 1993 your government, despite its promises, introduced its own GST without compensation for low income earners. That is what you did. You went to the 1993 election campaign, you swore blind to the Australian public that you were against a GST and then, according to one of the greatest tax experts in Australia, you introduced your GST without compensation. I think a government that introduces a broad based indirect tax of the type you introduced after 1993 without compensation for the elderly, the sick and the poor is a government that deserves to be condemned. - The question was about an analysis of indirect taxes, and I am referring to an analysis of indirect taxation of which I am very comprehensively aware. It is an analysis that was carried out by somebody who is recognised as an Australian expert. What Neil Warren reminded us of was that Mr Beazley and Mr Keating, despite their promises to the contrary, after the 1993 election introduced their own version of the GST without any compensation.I can certainly assure the elderly of Australia that there is no way that my government is going to alter the taxation system to leave them disadvantaged. I also say to those people: do not take any notice of the scare campaign that is now being deliberately conducted by the Australian Labor Party. They  are running around Australia putting pamphlets in letter boxes trying to scare the elderly of Australia, trying to scare the vulnerable. I have been handed a copy of a pamphlet that has been distributed by the member for Cunningham trying to scare the elderly of Australia. Absolutely disgraceful material is being distributed by the member for Cunningham. - They are already at it, Mr Speaker. They are running around the highways and the back streets of Australia putting pamphlets in letter boxes, and they are trying to scare people. You did that in 1993, and I would say to every Australian who gets one of these ALP pamphlets that you got that material in 1993. Some of you were deceived by it. Some of you voted Labor. After you got the Labor government that you voted for, that Labor government, having campaigned against a GST, introduced one of its own without compensation.Not only did they repudiate everything they had said; they crushed the elderly, the sick and the poor by introducing a GST without compensation. You even had the spectacle of people like Peter Sams and Michael Easson of the New South Wales Labor Council saying that the Dawkins budget of 1993 had more comprehensively betrayed the working class of Australia than any budget that had ever been introduced in the history of this country.What has Neil Warren's analysis demonstrated? On page 3 of this analysis he makes  it very clear that a GST was introduced without compensation. He says:Even though in practice no-one advocates the introduction of a GST without compensation, an important finding of this paper is that this was effectively what Labor did in the period of 1993 to 1996.You have no credibility on this issue. In 1993, despite your promises, you introduced your own GST and you did it in a heartless, cruel way without any compensation for the elderly.</DOC>

 - I say in response to the member for Corangamite that our response will certainly not include rejection of the largest manufacturing investment in Australia's history, as was the response of the Labor government in 1989 to the blue-collar workers of north-west Tasmania. This morning I had a meeting with ministers responsible in various portfolio areas, and we have given consideration to a package of measures to help respond to the impact of the closure. I note, incidentally, that many comments have been made by community leaders recognising that this closure has not come about as a result of any policy failure or policy decision of my government. Amongst those statements is included one - and the member for Braddon will correct me if I am wrong - from the mayor of one of the local shires or municipalities who is a member of the Australian Labor Party - in fact, he may even be a candidate for the Australian Labor Party in the forthcoming election.On Friday, the Minister for Finance and Administration and the Minister for Social Security, at my request, will both be going to Burnie to meet community representatives. They will be discussing the implications of the closure, and they will be discussing with community leaders various responses that might responsibly be undertaken. Against the background of those discussions, the government will be making some announcement and giving consideration to a further series of  responses. I take this opportunity to point out that, despite the intense disappointment the government feels about the decision to close the pulp mill and the concern we have for the welfare of the 150 to 200 men and women and their families who will be affected by the closure, -  - It is worthwhile pointing out that in the year to April 1998 there were 2,900 new jobs created in north-west Tasmania and the unemployment rate over that period in that region has fallen by 1.3 per cent. So the overall employment direction in north-west Tasmania, despite the adverse circumstances of the pulp mill, has been very positive. I remind the House that, since being elected, the government has put in place a number of very positive employment measures for the people of north-west Tasmania. There was the regional forest agreement, which was criticised by the member for Denison; the regional forest agreement that represented a very generous provision and which was put in place by the federal government. It is not only pro-environment but also pro-employment. And there was, of course, the Bass Strait vehicle subsidy, which has led to a strengthening of the tourist industry in Tasmania.I again say what I told the House yesterday, about the great employment opportunity of a generation for north-west Tasmanians - the Wesley Vale pulp mill - being sacrificed on the altar of the Labor Party pursuing the agenda of a sectional interest. The rejection of the Wesley Vale pulp mill represented the height of the determination of the Labor Party to pay court to sectional interests at the expense of its traditional working-class base. I notice the member for Lalor, the National President of the Labor Party, is nodding his agreement.  - He is nodding his agreement because in 1989 you had this classic example. I applaud the candour of the National President of the Australian Labor Party because once again he has reminded the House that, when Labor was in government, Labor was driven by sectional interests. - What happened in Wesley Vale was that the Labor Party faced a choice between giving blue-collar workers in north-west Tasmania a job, a future and some hope, or placating the greenies - and they chose the latter. They chose the green option and they threw the blue-collar workers to the wolves. Nothing that Labor has said since or nothing that Labor might say to try to exploit the Burnie situation at present can alter the fact that when you were in government you sacrificed the jobs of hundreds, if not thousands, of blue-collar workers in order to meet your green agenda. You did it with Wesley Vale; you did it all over the country. It was a deliberate tactic to serve the sectional interests of the Australian Labor Party, and that is one of the reasons why, in their hundreds of thousands, blue-collar workers all over the nation deserted you in 1996.</DOC>

 - The answer to the question asked by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is yes, I still do have a great deal of respect for Dr Warren and I regard him as one of the foremost tax experts in Australia. You ask me do I agree with his statement that a GST will not solve every imaginable ill, or words to that effect; of course I do. I have never asserted that it would. I take the opportunity afforded me by the very convenient question of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to say that, in order to build even greater security for the Australian economy, what you  need is reform on a number of fronts. Reforming the taxation system is the next logical thing Australia must do in order to further strengthen the Australian economy.We have the budget into balance, indeed into surplus. We have business investment running strongly. We have reformed the industrial relations system. We have many other micro-economic reforms under way and the next thing we have to do, not in a revolutionary but in a sensible evolutionary way, is to reform the Australian taxation system. Looking at the indirect taxation system is part of it.The Deputy Leader of the Opposition asked me a question about speeches made by Dr Warren. When you trawl around for speeches made by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, it is interesting what you come up against. One of the things that I came up against was a compilation of speeches and statements made, which are available. There is a very interesting document entitled Speeches and statements available on the Labor Party's Internet site. Going through it, this is what a search reveals. The ALP Internet site has a section called `Speeches and policy statements'. It contains, so it says, a list of major speeches and policy statements by the leadership group. That sounds impressive.For the years 1997 and 1998 the site lists the following: 48 speeches and statements by Kim Beazley; three by Cheryl Kernot; three by Mark Latham, and a book; two by Simon Crean; one by Paul Keating called `A prospect of Europe'; one by Martin Ferguson; one by Nick Bolkus; one by Martyn Evans; and one by Bob McMullan. There is a strange omission - there are none from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. In the whole of 1997 and 1998, there was none.So it is apparent that the Leader of the Opposition's injunction at the doorstop this morning has had retrospective effect and that all of the speeches of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition have been deleted. I address a heartfelt plea to the National Secretary of the Australian Labor Party, Gary Gray: please can we have Gareth's speeches, because we love them?</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Fadden for his question. I recognise that the honourable member for Fadden is one of all of the members on this side of the House who want to see Mr Skase brought back to Australia to face charges - unlike some of the people over there, apparently.We have been trying to clean up this problem which was left for us by, above all, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. As the House knows, I cancelled Mr Skase's last Australian passport on 29 April last year. That passport has now been returned to Australia by the Spanish authorities. They confiscated it when Mr Skase applied to renew his residence permit in Majorca which expired on 13 May this year.On 27 May - that is, last Wednesday - a lawyer representing Mr Christopher Skase wrote to the Australian Embassy in Madrid seeking a new Australian passport for Mr Skase. Mr Skase claimed he needed a new passport because he now has no identification documents. I can inform the House that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade will not be issuing Mr Skase with a new passport. That is the policy of this government. We have informed Mr Skase's lawyer, through our embassy in Madrid, that his application for a new passport has been rejected and that he will not receive a passport.Immediately after question time, I will be meeting with the Spanish Minister for Industry and Energy, Mr Pique. During our discussions, I will be taking the opportunity to ask that the Spanish government not renew Mr Skase's residency in Spain. Whilst the Australian government will not be issuing Mr Skase with a new passport, we are prepared to do one thing for him; that is, to issue him with a travel document to enable him to return to Australia. And that's it.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for the Northern Territory for his question in relation to the maintenance of the integrity of our borders. It is a particularly relevant issue to the Northern Territory, as in the past it has been one of the places where people have clandestinely attempted to enter Australia. An important aspect of dealing with the issue of the extent to which people seek to circumvent our very reasonable immigration requirements is the issue of how you manage the entry of people who seek to come clandestinely. We know that in the early 1990s hundreds and hundreds of people arrived by boat, and this year we expect something of the order of 1,700 unauthorised arrivals by air. We have seen very significant trafficking and people making large amounts of money out of smuggling people from one country to another and exploiting people's vulnerability.Some of the people who seek to access Australia may have legitimate claims for refugee status for protection. That is a matter for which we have proper regard. We do accept our international obligations and we do  allow those people who have proper claims to access Australia promptly. But, in relation to those people who arrive with no authority, often without any identification or documentation, who have deliberately disguised the way in which they are trying to enter Australia, you need to have a framework of law to deal with that situation. The framework of law has to be complemented by a range of measures to deal with those initiatives.That does not seem to be well understood by some members of the human rights bodies that we have, by some well-meaning people who argue that when people arrive clandestinely they ought to be released into the community immediately or shortly after. The fact is that if you are going to ensure the integrity of the borders you need to have a system in place in which people are detained and, if they have no claims, are available for removal. You need to have a situation in which you are able to effectively administer that arrangement, and detention complements that regime. It is not an end in itself, but without it our ability to remove people in a timely way would not occur.It is important to know that over a period of time we have been able to effectively reform the way in which this task is being undertaken. Today, protection visa applications are dealt with, for those in detention, in 51 days. The average length of detention for unauthorised boat arrivals in November 1995 was 417 days, compared with the average length of detention for all unauthorised arrivals - that includes boat and air arrivals - of 174 days. There has been a very effective removal of people, such that we have only 13 boat arrivals presently in Australia, and one is seeking to resolve their situation as quickly as possible. Those who refuse to cooperate, those who refuse to pursue their applications, can often be held for times longer than we would like.Finally, in relation to the question of the way in which people are maintained in Australia, let me say that there had been, I think, except for the purchase of the Port Hedland detention centre, no activity by the former government in looking at the way in which accommodation was provided. In the time that  we have been in office, some $12.5 million has been spent on upgrading the Port Hedland detention centre, and in the most recent budget provision has been made for a $35 million project to upgrade the Villawood detention centre. They are important developments, ensuring that we do detain people in humane conditions and appropriate conditions -  - The full story, for the honourable member for Banks, is that there was an abysmal record that led to large numbers of people seeking to enter Australia clandestinely. They did over time. We have turned that around, and we do not hold people in detention for the sorts of periods that brought Australia into disrepute before international human rights bodies. I have been defending Australia in relation to your record. If you want to raise your record, put it up every time and I will compare it with ours.</DOC>

 - I can assure the House that, from the time I became Prime Minister, in relation to the Australian waterfront I had one single aim, and that was to bring about reform of the Australian waterfront. Can I say that that remains my attitude. I want to praise the work of the Minister for Workplace  Relations and Small Business in relation to that. - I repeat that from the time I became Prime Minister I had the aim in relation to the waterfront of bringing about reform. I specifically instructed the two ministers in my government who are responsible, the former Minister for Transport and Regional Development and the member for Hume and the current Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business. Naturally, in the course of that many options and many proposals were discussed. Those discussions and examination of those proposals proceeded upon the basis that we wanted a reformed, competitive waterfront and that change should occur to achieve those objectives, and upon the understanding always that change should be in accordance with the laws of Australia. I have always said that I would support efforts by anybody to reform the Australian waterfront provided those efforts were in accordance with the laws of Australia. That was my view, it is my view and it will remain my view, and I am very proud it.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Herbert for his question. The member for Herbert, who is a very good representative for North Queensland, is always lobbying for assistance for his area from all government ministers. A couple of items of note that have taken place out of my portfolio in his area are the upgrading of the national highway system on the Bruce Highway and the upgrading of Wilcox Street in Townsville, which was a $21 million project which was promised by Labor for 13 years but never undertaken. It was one of those 14th year commitments: `We were gunna do it.' The coalition government has just brought down a very good budget which produced a $2.7 billion surplus - a turnaround of $13 billion from what we inherited from Labor. - As part of that budget, the road funding - I will come to the interjection of the member for Melbourne in a minute - was $1.62 billion. - The last budget that the Labor Party brought down was $1.594 billion for roads, so it was an increase on that. We also had a $250 million allocation for rail and  $3.5 billion worth of programs for regional Australia. The coalition knows the direction in which it wants to take Australia. We have a very clear view of where we are going. That contrasts greatly with the Australian Labor Party, which seems to be in a bit of a quandary as to the direction they want to go in. With the leadership up front here, it is whether they want to take the middle road, and with the young and the restless on the other end there is one wanting to take off to the right and the other wanting to take off to the left.I was interested to note an article in yesterday's Age written by the member for Melbourne, entitled `Why Labor Must Take a New Road.' He said in that article:At the recent Victorian ALP Conference, John Brumby urged delegates to embrace the politics of the Third Way.Not the first way or the second way - the third way.He went on to say:Why are leading Labor politicians in Australia starting to identify it as a potential source of policy inspiration?They are plagiarising the policies of New Labour in the United Kingdom. They do not have any policies for Australia. He went on to say:Without such principles New Labour risks being no more than a group of well-intentioned men and women making it up as they go along.That is exactly what the Labor Party are doing. They are making it up as they go along. The penultimate line in this article is the last one, where he said -  - The question was about the policy initiatives of our government and alternative proposals, and the member for Melbourne has put up some alternative proposals. He said:Labor must look beyond seductive slogans like the Third Way and understand the significance of the economic transformation.We can only presume that he is talking about the significance of the economic transformation that the coalition government has introduced over the last 2½ years in fixing up the structural deficiencies of the Australian economy that we inherited from the Australian Labor Party. - It is only the coalition government that has a view to the future of Australia. The Labor Party does not know which direction it is going in.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Moore for his question. When the Prime Minister announced that the government was serious about tax reform and would  take a policy to the next election for tax reform, he laid down five principles. The five principles included broad based indirect tax, significant personal income tax cuts, compensation for those in need, and the fifth was addressing Commonwealth-state financial relations. - I cannot remember the fourth for the moment, but there is a fourth. -  - The fifth was addressing Commonwealth-state relations, and that is the basis upon which we approach tax reform. One of the difficulties where you are putting together a tax reform package - and we have sought to engage the states in this discussion - is that not all of the states have the same view. The meeting that we had with state premiers to discuss issues was very productive, and I think a majority of the state premiers are significantly committed to tax reform. But there is, of course, one Labor Premier. That Labor Premier - although I believe he will say privately that he agrees with tax reform - is being heavied by the leadership of the Australian Labor Party, for political opportunist reasons, not to engage in it.I think Premier Carr if he had his druthers - he is quite an intelligent man - would join the movement for tax reform. - It will not reduce the IQ of the Labor frontbench. - The Premier of New South Wales, I believe, would be interested in tax reform. One must remember that, when  the government first announced that it was going to engage in tax reform, we got support from the federal leadership of the Labor Party. The deputy leader of the Labor Party said on Radio 3LO on 19 May 1997:If the business community and the welfare community can get together and come up with some proposal that makes some kind of sense on all these fronts, that genuinely meets the concerns that people had about equity of attacks on consumption or expenditure and it meets the needs of the larger economy, then of course we would have to look at any such proposal.So the Deputy Leader of the Opposition was prepared to join the tax reform, and then of course Labor, for completely opportunistic reasons, ruled itself out of the tax debate. In ruling federal Labor out of the tax debate, all the state branches were automatically ruled out, and as a result Premier Carr is unable to agree.This puts us into a difficult position, doesn't it, because you have the Premier of the largest state who, whatever his private views, has been blackballed from the tax reform debate by Beazley, who has also blackballed Evans. This is, of course, giving a difficulty to discussing Commonwealth-state relations, but we are seeking to make progress in relation to it, and addressing vertical fiscal imbalance is one of the significant areas of doing that.Can I assure the honourable member for Moore that, as the government progresses these things, it progresses in relation to all five principles that the Prime Minister had mentioned - broad based indirect tax, lower personal income taxes, compensation for those that would be otherwise disadvantaged, no increase in the overall tax to GDP position and Commonwealth-state relations; all five principles that the Prime Minister outlined.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Petrie for her question, particularly as the honourable member for Petrie is a strong supporter of the immigration program and certainly for the maintenance of its integrity. - And I am glad the honourable members have drawn attention to the way in which, as part of our approach to migration and the participation of people in the Australian community, that people from non-English speaking backgrounds can settle in Australia, settle well and rise to very distinguished places in this parliament. The honourable member for Petrie demonstrates that admirably.I do thank her for the question because it enables me to tell the House about the recent data that has emanated from the longitudinal survey of independent migrants. The fact is that independent migrants have had a very positive impact upon our economy, upon employment and government finances. The survey shows that three years after arrival they have a labour market participation -  - This survey shows that three years after arrival independent migrants exhibit these characteristics: they have a labour market participation rate of more than 90 per cent, their unemployment rate is well below the Australian average at five per cent, the majority have obtained employment which is commensurate with their employment experience prior to migration and they earn on average over $40,000 per year. - In other words, what this survey demonstrates is that those migrants create more jobs than they fill. This has to, I think, be characterised against the sort of program that we saw before we came to  office - one that was lacking balance. Clearly the information that I released last week in the independent economic analysis by Econtech showed it contributes very significantly, as a result of the changes we have made, to economic benefits for all Australians in the form of a $95 per person per annum increase in income. This government, by enhancing skill, age and English language requirements for skilled migrants, has ensured that all Australians benefit significantly as a result of the entry of skilled migrants.This contrasts with the position that the Labor Party is taking. The Labor leader made it clear last week in the article he wrote for the Australia-Israel Review that it is intent on increasing the family reunion stream without changing the total program numbers. The impact of that would be to increase family reunion entrants at the expense of skilled migrants. In other words, it would increase the number of people who are highly welfare dependent - those people who are very often non bona fide - because if you look at the family reunion program as it was conducted by our predecessors -  -  - Understand this: most of the family reunion program is for spouses, de facto partners and fiances. - Those people who have bona fide applications access Australia. It is demand driven. If you want to increase it, the only way you will increase it is by introducing more people in sham relationships - more people who are non bona fide. - That is the only way you are going to get up: if all the spouse applicants who are bona fide are able to access Australia. If it is demand driven, the only way  to increase it is to get non bona fide applicants. - Let me move on from the point I was making to the only substantial area in family reunion, which is in relation to parents. They can be parents who are aged or working age. The fact is that we have put a cap on those numbers. We do not apologise for that; we have done it very deliberately. The longitudinal survey demonstrated why that was necessary. The position with family reunion entrants is that generally the labour participation rate is only 20 per cent - I am sorry - this is in relation to the parent category; let me make it clear. - No, I am not suggesting that they are bogus parents. - I am simply saying that in the parent category they have a labour participation rate of only 20 per cent and that includes working age parents. The unemployment rate is more than 60 per cent. They earn on average just over $10,000 per year. In other words, the positive economic outcomes of skilled migration would be lost if you were to shift the balance back to family reunion. That is the point that needs to be understood by the opposition and the Australian community. The Labor Party wants to turn the  clock back to the point where the Australian community would have absolutely no confidence in the way the program was being conducted.</DOC>

 - I wonder where the member for Lyons was, and I wonder what he said, when Graham Richardson said on 8 September 1989 - oh, we will come to you in a minute too. - The sensitivity of the Australian Labor Party to the special interest group politics that it played at the expense of blue-collar workers - and continues to play at the expense of blue-collar workers - is demonstrated by the actions of the Carr Labor government in New South Wales where it is selling out interests of blue-collar workers in the timber industry in the coastal regions of New South Wales. - As I was saying in response to the member for Lyons, I wonder where he was and what he said when Graham  Richardson proudly boasted as a senior minister in the Hawke Labor government:There is absolutely no reason for me to apologise to anyone over the government's handling of the Wesley Vale proposal.That particular decision destroyed the job prospects of hundreds of blue-collar workers in Tasmania and it was done by the Labor Party. You destroyed the interests of the men and women you are meant to represent in this parliament. - You do not like this, do you? - That is what Graham Richardson said. I also wonder where the member for Lyons was and what he said when Christine Milne, who conspired with Graham Richardson to destroy hundreds of jobs in north-west Tasmania, said:I am absolutely delighted that Noranda and North Broken Hill are not going to proceed with the Wesley Vale pulp mill.That was a once-in-a-generation opportunity to give new economic life and hope to the people of north-west Tasmania; and the Labor Party and the Green movement ignored the  interests of blue-collar workers. You destroyed the one-in-a-generation opportunity they had for a secure economic future. You neglected the interests of your trade union base to pay court to the special interest groups of the Green movement. So I start by reminding the member for Lyons of the abysmal record that your government and your party have. I also remind him that the closure -  - You have also asked me in your question about the timber industry. You have asked me about value adding. I would remind the member for Lyons that we have put record money and record planning into value adding for the timber industry in Australia. The decision that we took in relation to the regional forest agreement in Tasmania was a pro-environmental and pro-jobs decision. Unlike the attitude that was taken when you were in government in  relation to blue collar workers, we were able to balance the interests of both.I have already announced that the Minister for Finance, in whom I have enormous confidence and trust, and the Minister for Social Security, two very senior ministers in my government, will be going to Burnie on Friday. I am quite certain that when they go to Burnie on Friday they will meet many people who will say to them: `If only the Labor government had built the Wesley Vale pulp mill' or `If only the government had not bowed to the sectoral interests of the radical environmental movement.' They will be reminded by my colleague that men like the member for Denison were responsible. The member for Denison is proud of the fact that he has destroyed the jobs of hundreds of blue collar workers in north-west Tasmania. He is proud of the role that he played in stopping what would have been the largest manufacturing investment in Australia's history.You had an opportunity when you were in government to build a future for the blue collar workers of north-west Tasmania. You could have built that pulp mill. You bowed to the pressure of the Greens and it will ever be to your discredit in the minds and the hearts of the blue collar workers and the battlers of Tasmania that, when they needed your help, when you could afford to help them, you let them down, you ignored them and you threw them on the scrap heap.</DOC>

 - Today is the 56th anniversary of the great naval battle of Midway in the Pacific during the Second  World War. I acknowledge the great support that the member for Capricornia gives to the veteran community in his electorate. There is no doubt that our veterans and war widows, wherever they live, need access to good services, particularly if they can be found in their home town or region.Since coming to government it has been a priority of the government not only to focus on the needs of our veterans who live in urban areas but also, because one-third of our veterans and war widows live outside urban Australia, it has been important to make sure that those in regional and rural areas have access to information services. This is an area of government service that was not delivered under the Labor Party when they were in government for 13 years.It is important, too, that veterans do not have to rely solely on telephone access for this valuable service or information. Since coming to government less than two and a quarter years ago, we have not only introduced new services for veterans in rural Australia, including psychiatric services, podiatry services and more easily accessed transport services, but one of our most important improvements is that we have made it easier for veterans to gain information about their entitlements. Only recently in Rockhampton, the member for Capricornia's town, the TPI Association through the joint venture scheme was successful in gaining $3,500 for transport services for its TPI members and $4,500 for other services for its association.Since coming to government we have opened up veterans affairs network offices in Bendigo, Maroochydore and Toowoomba. We have also established information services for veterans throughout New South Wales through the New South Wales government access centres in Gilgandra, in Grenfell, in Oberon; and through the Queensland government agents program, in Biloela, Cunnamulla, Blackall and Julia Creek. We have established information services through Centrelink in Orange, in the member for Calare's electorate, in your own electorate, Mr Speaker, in Tamworth; in Wagga Wagga, and in Rockhampton in the member for Capricornia's electorate.  Soon we will be doing it in Mount Gambier in South Australia.Contracted information services have also been established at Roma and Emerald, in Queensland. We have contracted community development services in Mildura and in Darwin. We have also assisted the veteran community to establish veteran information centres in Alice Springs, Port Lincoln and Murray Bridge. We are currently negotiating with the Tasmanian state government for information services to be provided in Smithton and also in Queenstown.This is the way the government is acknowledging that one-third of veterans live outside of metropolitan Australia. The information that these offices provide is invaluable to our veteran community. We have established 22 information services locations throughout Australia since coming to government and there are more to come. This is acknowledgment of our veteran community and the very special place they hold not only in urban Australia but also in rural and remote parts of our nation.</DOC>

 - The last mentioned claim by the Leader of the Opposition is according to my information -  - quite wrong. Without any reference to any notes, I can remember back in the middle 1980s, when you were having a tax summit, you spent a lot of public money advertising the need for taxation reform. That is when you had a bit of backbone on the subject of taxation reform - before you lost it.But I am glad that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has asked me what I choose to call `the Bill Hunter question'. Bill Hunter was a very talented Australian actor who featured in many government funded advertisements under the former government. - And my answer is going to be even more specific than his question. I am told that the Keating government spent $315.5 million on advertising and market research over the five-year period between 1991 and 1996.I was mentioning Mr Hunter. Mr Hunter's most famous contribution to promoting the programs of the former government was, in fact, his contribution to publicising the One Nation program. If my memory serves me correctly -  - Working Nation, that is right. -  - You had a One Nation statement. That was Keating's statement in 1991. -  - Are you saying that she pinched the name of the party from Paul Keating? I would not get too clever with those interjections. - I think it probably would have been in about March, April, May of 1994, if my memory serves me correctly, that Working Nation was brought down. - Equally, if my memory serves me correctly -  - it was not until the former Prime Minister took that trip down Dunrossil  Drive and went to the Governor-General late in January of 1996, almost two years later, that the Bill Hunter advertisements were taken off television. - In other words, those advertisements ran and ran. Working Nation had been introduced two years earlier, but they were still running advertisements when Keating pulled the plug in January of 1996. They spent $9 million on promoting Working Nation. They spent $7 million in 1992 and 1993 on just the superannuation guarantee campaign. If I remember rightly, that was the one where the dollars were falling off the tree, or where you were planting the dollars and the trees were sprouting forth, like plants in the spring. And they spent $10 million in 1995 on the superannuation community education program. Between 1985 and 1987, they spent $6.2 million on a tax reform advertising campaign - and, in 1997 dollars, this equates with spending of between $9 million and $10 million. - The deputy leader's knowledge of past Labor expenditure on advertising is as insubstantial as his knowledge of past balance of payments statistics. So it goes on. You conducted continuous market research by the ALP's then official pollster, ANOP. You engaged print, radio and television advertising on the need for taxation  reform - not just a particular change in policy but, indeed, the need for taxation reform, which is the very point at issue. You spent enormous amounts of money publicising the policies of the government. Of course, in defending the decisions that had been taken, the former Prime Minister Mr Keating in October 1986 said:For some time the government has been conducting - listen to this - a public information campaign on various aspects of the tax reform package. Consistent with that duty to keep the public informed, the Australian Taxation Office has already produced television, radio, newspaper and printed material.What we are doing is completely proper. What we are doing fulfils our obligation to the Australian public. What the Labor Party did was advertise not only the need for reform but also the details of reform. I want to make it very plain that we have every intention of ensuring that the Australian public is made well aware of the details of this very important reform to the Australian taxation system that will produce a stronger, better, more secure, more stable and more safe Australian economy.</DOC>

 - The past week has demonstrated again the fundamental strength of the Australian economy, and it has demonstrated again the wisdoms of the policy that was put in place by my government when it came to power in March 1996. The statistics that have come out have demonstrated very clearly that the Australian economy cannot expect to be untouched by the Asian economic downturn, but because of the policies we have put in place the Australian economy is in a strong, stable and secure situation in a very difficult part of the world.On Monday the ABS retail trade data showed continued growth in retail turnover,  especially for department stores. On Tuesday the ABS building approvals data for April rose by 8.3 per cent, and that followed a rise of 9.2 per cent in March. Private dwelling approvals are at their highest level since 1994. The national accounts data released yesterday showed that Australia's economic growth increased by 1.3 per cent in the March quarter to be 4.9 per cent higher in through the year terms. This growth puts Australia virtually at the top of all industrial countries. I noted the remarks of a number of economic commentators yesterday to the effect that most other countries would give their eye teeth to have the sort of economic performance, the economic strength and the economic growth that this country is securing at the present time.Those accounts reported strong growth in communications services and construction and manufacturing. The national accounts also showed that productivity continues to rise and that inflation remains low. Despite the claim by the Leader of the Opposition yesterday that there was upward pressure on interest rates, the reality is that we heard yesterday yet another announcement by the Commonwealth Bank of a further reduction in housing interest rates. The current account deficit naturally reflected, as the figures released during the week showed, the impact of the Asian economic downturn on Australia's exports.I simply make the point that, if we had not done what we had done with the economy over the last two years, that current account deficit situation would be a lot worse. Our situation would be a lot more vulnerable, and I believe a growing number of Australians are saying thank heaven's the Howard-Fisher government had the courage to take the budget measures and the economic measures that it did, because it has made us safer and secure. The alternative on offer is a distinct economic risk to Australia's future.</DOC>

 - I do not canvass what goes on at cabinet meetings. -  - Oh, big surprise! I would be the first Prime Minister in the 24 years that I have been in this place on both sides to get up and say, `Let me tell you what went on in cabinet yesterday.' I remember Gough Whitlam doing that every day when I came here! I remember Malcolm used to do it every day too. I can remember Bob Hawke doing it, and I can remember Paul Keating doing it. Of course you do not canvass what goes on in cabinet.Let me tell you what I will canvass. I will canvass the determination I had when I became Prime Minister to reform the Australian waterfront. I will canvass the fact that I authorised the Minister for Transport and Regional Development in my first government to pursue an active strategy. I make no apology for pursuing an active strategy. If you are elected on a policy of reforming the waterfront, what do you do: do nothing about it? There is this incredible proposition that there is something wrong with a government that wants to reform the waterfront. Of course we were active about it. Of course we talked to a lot of people. We even had discussions with representatives of the trade union movement.I can remember about two or three months after I became Prime Minister some members of the MUA had a stroll down one of Sydney's streets, they gathered outside my office and sang a few songs and said a few words. I invited a delegation up for morning tea. It included John Coombs and other representatives of the union. We talked about the issue of the waterfront. We agreed that there should be further discussion between representatives of the trade union movement, because it was self-evident that if you wanted to try to reform the Australian waterfront you had to talk to everybody. You had to examine a whole lot of options, test a whole lot of theories and hear a whole lot of views. Of course you did.I listened to what the trade union people had to say on that occasion. I understand that there were a number of discussions involving Mr Sharp, who was then the minister for transport and the minister for workplace relations. I understand that those discussions ended not because of the refusal of my government to talk to the union but because some time in December last year during the discussions the union representative simply got up and walked out of that discussion. That was an indication of how far they were prepared to go. Fully consistent with that, of course I pursued an active policy. Of course I wanted waterfront reform. I had some discussions with representatives of stevedoring companies. Of course I have. I do not make any  denial of that. Why would I? It would be a very strange Prime Minister who wanted waterfront reform who did not talk to the principal players. It would be very odd indeed. My minister also had numerous discussions, and all sorts of options were canvassed.It was always my goal to achieve waterfront reform, but it was always to be upon the basis that that reform would be achieved in accordance with the laws of Australia. I am proud of the fact that we have tried to get waterfront reform and I remain as determined as ever to see that the Australian economy is benefited by a reformed, more competitive Australian waterfront where the encumbrance and the blight of compulsory unionism have been removed.</DOC>

 - The government has decided to provide a community education and information program on Australia's taxation system. I thank the member for his question and his interest because Australians are entitled to know about how their taxation system works - after all, they pay it. What is more, they are entitled to know whether or  not we can improve the taxation system. It is in the interests of millions of Australians to have a better taxation system and, as part of community education, that involves telling them how the system is currently working and how it can be improved.I am asked, `Are there any precedents for such campaigns?' As the Prime Minister has said, between 1991 and 1996, the Keating government spent over $300 million - $320 million I think the Prime Minister said - on advertising and market research, $9 million on Working Nation, $7 million on the super guarantee, $10 million on the superannuation community education campaign. Between 1985 and 1987, Labor spent $6.2 million on a tax reform advertising campaign, which equates in today's dollar terms to around $10 million. The government in fact came to the conclusion that it should set aside about $10 million because it searched back in the precedents and found that that was what the Labor Party had thought was necessary back in 1985.I was rather surprised to hear that when the Deputy Leader of the Opposition was asked about this this morning he fulminated against it - `Shameless! Outrageous!' - with all of the anger that he could muster at the doors this morning. He was asked:How does this differ from 1985 when Bob Hawke used taxpayers' money to sell government policies?EVANS: There's a very obvious difference. In 1985, there'd been introduced, or foreshadowed, absolutely major changes to the tax system with capital gains and fringe benefits taxes needing to be explained in detail to those who are going to be affected by them. The ads, as I remember them, were entirely of that information character.We would like to help him a little bit more with his memory. I do actually have one of the ads that the Australian Labor Party put out. This one came from the Financial Review  of Wednesday, 19 June 1985 - these were the information campaigns that the Australian Labor Party was running - `You've heard the rumours. Now get the facts.' A guide to tax reform . That led me off looking for this book, A guide to tax reform , that was being advertised, of a purely informational character before any policy had been decided. I was particularly taken by this bit on page 9 that  the Australian Labor Party was advertising in June 1985. Listen to this:A broadly based consumption tax set at a higher rate of, say, 12½ per cent would - .	 provide much larger income tax cuts..	 reduce marginal tax rates substantially at all  income levels.. . .              . . .             . . ..	 increase the tax take from people who continue to avoid or evade income tax..	 provide enough revenue to enable a more generous net benefit for wage and salary earners . . ..	 enable the wholesale tax to be abolished altogether.That is such a good leaflet, it almost matches my own. In fact, there is an argument about copyright. - This also took me back to that memorable ABC documentary Labor in Power  when former Treasury official David Morgan, now working for Westpac, said:For me, the breakthrough, I think came around 1 am on the Monday morning when Gareth Evans threw down his papers and took off his glasses and said -  - No, no, no. He threw down his papers and took off his glasses; he did not throw down his glasses and take off his papers. He took off his glasses and said:`I've listened to this consumption tax argument for two days and I've been waiting for a hole to be punched in it and none of you have been able to punch a hole in it.'That is advertising for tax reform.</DOC>

 - As I said in answer to the earlier question, I do not intend to canvass cabinet matters, but I very happily repeat that I set out after I became Prime Minister in quite an active way to achieve waterfront reform. I wanted to reform the Australian waterfront because a reformed waterfront is good for Australia. It has never been our objective to destroy unions or to destroy unionism. It has only been our objective, and proudly our objective, to reform the Australian waterfront and to provide choice on the Australian waterfront. The destructive behaviour in this whole dispute has of course been on the part of the Maritime Union of Australia. The Maritime Union of Australia for a period of three years refused to abide by an agreement that was entered into between the union and the Patrick company and, for a period of months leading up to April this year, the Maritime Union of Australia set out to destroy the business of its own employer. That is what they set out to do.Our goal is not to destroy unions. Our goal is to increase jobs. Our goal is to attract more investment. Our goal is to improve productivity on the Australian waterfront. As I have said before and as I will say again: our policy objective was to achieve the goal of waterfront reform. In the course of pursuing that objective, of course we canvassed numerous options with the players. Why wouldn't we? When you were in government you canvassed numerous options with players in industrial  issues. The evidence came out in the book written by Brad Norrington the Sydney Morning Herald journalist on the pilots dispute in 1989, where a former Labor government conspired with the trade union movement to import foreign pilots into Australia to take the jobs of Australian pilots. As that book so graphically demonstrates, when industrial disputes start, when industrial issues are involved, of course there are regular discussions and exchanges about all manner of things between governments, companies and trade unions. But at all stages the objective was to achieve waterfront reform. The objective was to give freedom of choice on the Australian waterfront. Our goal was to do that, as always, consonant with the laws of Australia.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Cook for his question. I actually happen to have with me an article dated 15 August 1997, the very day of the quotation from the Leader of the Opposition a moment ago in his question to the Prime Minister. It is an article in the Financial Review  by Pamela Williams. In that article there is a quote from John Coombs which, quite frankly, is typical of this union. This quote is not surprising. We have heard them on many occasions. At that time, if my memory serves my right, the shipping reform group was looking at maritime issues generally. This is what Mr Coombs said in respect of one issue, namely, cabotage. He said:`We will go all out if they cut cabotage,' said Coombs. `We will close the joint down, and I've  told Sharp that, six inches from his face. I've told the Prime Minister as well.'Since the day we were elected, the MUA has been threatening to close Australia down, and that should hardly be a surprise. They did it when Labor was in office when you attempted to sell ANL. One of the great humiliations of Labor's time in office was when the MUA forced you to cave in as usual.We as a government have a national responsibility to ensure that in the face of industrial action all steps would be taken and would have been considered in advance to keep the ports open. We make no mistake about that. We have said it on many occasions on the public record. Are we any different from any other government? No, we are not. It is just that the difference between you and us is that we have had the guts to be prepared to introduce legislative changes and to advocate a reform in the way in which you never were prepared to when you were in office.In respect of the current situation, it is interesting. What have the MUA done in respect of P&amp;O? They have cut off negotiations. Why? Because P&amp;O have taken legal redress against them in the New South Wales Supreme Court seeking appropriate relief in respect of the industrial action taken by the MUA in Adelaide and in Newcastle.In respect of Patrick, on the advice that I have there has certainly been some negotiations this week. I am not sure where those negotiations are going. I sense from some of the reports - they are second hand - that there are some in the trade union movement who are uncertain as to whether or not they should face the reality of coming to an agreement about reform. We understand that the National Council of the MUA is meeting today. That meeting will obviously be considering their attitude to the legal proceedings to reform and all the current issues in this dispute.In respect of the legal proceedings, I can inform the House that, whilst the MUA has been determined to get rid of the administrators, yesterday on their application to the courts to terminate the administration they actually sought an adjournment of those proceedings, and they sought an adjournment  of the application to appoint a court appointed receiver. Those adjournments were through to 9 July.In respect of discovery, which is an important aspect of the principal proceedings, discovery is due on 24 June, all other things being equal. We have said to the Commonwealth's lawyers that we must meet that deadline. That is a deadline set by the court, of course. There are thousands of pages, so I am informed, which would comprise the documents which would fall within the discovery processes, reflecting the very wide ambit of the legal claims being made by the MUA.Our legal team have a lot of issues to look at in respect of these documents, including public interest immunity for cabinet documents and other documents - as much for this case as it is relevant to the precedents that it would create in respect of any other proceedings in the future.From the Commonwealth's perspective, I can advise the House that we will strongly defend the claim and deny the claim. The fact of the matter is, as we have said consistently through these whole proceedings, while the rights of the parties in the judicial process are important and will be proceeded with in a proper way in respect of the judicial system, the point I make is that in the end, for the national interest, we must have reform on the Australian waterfront. What I can say to both the MUA and Patrick and to any other interested parties is that, from the government's perspective, in the end, regardless of the court proceedings, important as they are, the government's position will not change. We will continue to press for reform because we believe it is in the national interest. So what I say to the parties is that sooner or later you are going to have to face the reality of significant reform.I say to the Labor Party that your consistent support for the MUA will be seen by the Australian public for what it is: support for a union which has not been prepared to reform. Therefore, I think it is for you an electoral liability. - To conclude, Mr Speaker, I make this point. From the government's perspective, this is an important issue. I do not know when the legal proceedings will come to the matters being heard before the courts. I do not know when the next federal election is; that is a matter for the Prime Minister. But I do say that we will continue to campaign on waterfront reform because it is important for this country, and I say to the parties that they ought to understand that this government is not going to budge on the absolute national imperative to see an efficient waterfront.</DOC>

 - I will certainly have a look at that document. -  - I will have a look at it. But what may or may not be in that document does not in any way contradict what I have said. I make no apology whatever for the fact that I have been in favour of waterfront reform, I have been willing to pursue waterfront reform and I have been willing to pursue a range of options, consistent with the laws of Australia, in order to achieve waterfront reform.I do not have the file with me, but I have been provided with evidence of all manner of discussions that went on between the former Labor government and people in the stevedoring industry about reforming the Australian  waterfront. Let us get it straight: if you are elected on a platform of reforming the waterfront, it is not surprising that you would discuss reform of the waterfront with companies carrying on business on the waterfront, nor is it surprising that you would discuss it with members of the trade union movement. I repeat that it was our policy to reform the waterfront and it remains our policy to reform the waterfront. I was engaged in some discussions with players. Most of the discussions were engaged in by others, but they were acting under my general instruction to achieve waterfront reform, naturally on the basis that it had to occur in accordance with the laws of Australia.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Parkes for his question. I was pleased to visit Narromine and Dubbo recently with him and meet with a number of exporters. In fact, export trade creates jobs right here in Australia and, the better the market access, the more job activity that means for the Australian economy and the GDP results such as yesterday's. I further commend our exporters and highlight one of the bigger markets, the United States. For the first 10 months of this financial year, our exports to the USA are up 40 per cent. That includes meat exports, many of which have probably come through Roger Fletcher's operation at Dubbo, as well as transport equipment, but no wave piercing ferries are in that category. The reason that is so is because of the continuing application of the Jones Act by the USA, the largest economy in the world, which still has not repealed from the congressional statute books some  legislation from the Civil War which blocks us from exporting high-tech ferries to the USA. - I hear the interjection on the member for Hume. I take this opportunity to praise the member for Hume for his powerful contribution to the parliament over many years, and I wish him well.In respect of Italy, our exports are up 32 per cent. That involves a lot of textiles and also involves a lot of leather. I was pleased to go to Milano recently en route to Geneva to open the IWS European development centre. The Northern Italian economy centred on Milano is a very powerful market in its own right, especially with regard to the fashion industry. Turkey is a country where Australia has had enormous links, especially with the ANZAC tradition. - That includes hides, skins, transport equipment and, again, coal. In respect of the Netherlands, they are up 36 per cent. -  - I know little things amuse little minds. But this increase again in the export of goods means more jobs here in Australia with coal, non-ferrous metals, dairy products and the like. The Netherlands is Australia's fourth largest investor and, of course, the trade relationship and the investment relationship is expanding nicely.There are just two other things I would say of interest to the House. I am please to be able to inform the House for the first time that the Taiwan Legislative Assembly, the Legislative Yuan, has just passed legislation this week formally lowering by 40 per cent the discriminatory tariff on Australian beef going from Australia to Taiwan. They are lowering it from NT$8 to NT$5 per kilo. This  is about facilitating further our market access to Asia - in this case,  Taiwan, our fourth largest market for beef exports currently worth over $80 million a year - and is a direct result of representations lodged by my colleague the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, John Anderson. Of course, in conjunction with the Prime Minister, the minister for primary industries and others, we are working to further facilitate beef exports, citrus exports and pork exports at this critical time.Finally, I will make the point that there are exporters large and small. Out there in Chester Hill, Sydney, is a small company called Woodland Home Products. It has some 45 staff manufacturing quality barbecues and heating products. Its Beefeater range won a coveted Australian Design Award in 1991 for its top of the line Signature product. I am very pleased to say that Woodland Home Products' Beefeater barbecues are now taking the United States market by storm and represent a further example of the diversification of the Australian export effort creating additional jobs here in Australia.</DOC>

 - We have had a series of discussions with the major stevedores about what -  -  - to a circumstance of industrial action being taken by the MUA. It is  amazing that the Labor Party opposition should find it surprising that we should see that as a responsibility that we had to protect the national interest. - What I said in the parliament when I was asked about Dubai I repeat. - Their excitement only reflects their continuing embarrassment at their alignment with the MUA. Let me say, as to the plans of various parties -  - Mr Speaker, various parties have had various plans to deal with industrial action and reform in the stevedoring industry for as long as anybody can remember. You ask the question: would a federal cabinet consider these issues? -  - We would not be the first government to consider what you do with industrial action being taken by the MUA. You can go back to 1991 -  - I am not evading anything. I am going to come to that in two minutes. - Let me just put this in perspective. You can go back to March 1991 and probably further back if you want to. Here is a quote from the Australian Financial Review  of 21 March 1991 -  - I certainly will, Mr Speaker. - If it needs to be a long answer, then so be it, but this answer is relevant. The reason I say it is relevant is there have been plans and discussions as to how you deal with the industrial -  - I will come to the document that you tabled in a moment. But the point I make is that here it is, back in March 1991, facing concerns that the waterfront reform package was not performing as is expected. - I will, Mr Speaker. I will complete the quote and then I want to move on. - Senator Cook said:Cabinet considered a range of options which included using the armed services to man the wharves and Mr Kerin said, `If you want to really crash through on the waterfront there is a chance you might just end up where we were with the airline pilots - having to put the troops in.That is an interesting comment because I have made it clear to my department and anybody that I have spoken to that, as incoming government, we were prepared to use all the tools of government in exactly the same way as the Labor government dealt with the pilots strike. - That is certainly considered. That is certainly involved the canvassing of a whole lot of options. -  - When we were elected I was told by my newly appointed ministerial colleague, the Minister for Transport and  Regional Development, that he had been told that P&amp;O had a plan that would, in the event of industrial action, see them sack them all and replace the existing work force with a new work force within a couple of weeks. - It is not a matter of taking blame. If you want to take blame -  -  - You wait! You wait! - Mr Sharp told me then that he was told by P&amp;O that they had had that plan for some time; in fact, going back to when Labor was in office. -  - So why don't we ask: what did Laurie Brereton know about plans of stevedores to deal with industrial action? - I then had other discussions on the circumstances of what you would do in the event of industrial action. For example, I was aware that P&amp;O had a plan to import foreign workers who would be crane drivers in the event of industrial action. Would you consider that to be part of the conspiracy? Would you? - The document goes on to say that a government role would be to `set the scene' - to use some of these words. Part of that setting the scene was the passage of the Workplace Relations Act. I can inform the House that in the discussions about the Workplace Relations Act with Senator Kernot - now a frontbench member of the Labor Party - we had discussions about industrial action on the Australian waterfront and the plans and options necessary to deal with it. -  - As Mr Sharp said this morning, during his period as a minister there were a lot of plans and options discussed with the government, and that should be hardly a surprise. The question that was put to me back in December was: was I aware of the Dubai operation? - It was exactly the question that was put to me. The fact of the matter is, Mr Speaker, I was very surprised when I was asked that question. Furthermore, when I was asked that question after question time I went back to my office and I rang around the major stevedores to ask them if they were involved. My staff also rang some of the smaller stevedores to see whether or not any of those stevedoring operations were involved. I was told by the senior person at P&amp;O - Mr Hein was away; I spoke to his deputy - that P&amp;O  were not involved. I spoke to Mr Corrigan about the issue and I was advised by him that he was not involved.That night, as the record shows, I did a doorstop and said publicly what I had been advised. The fact is, we did not know about it. That is the truth of the matter. We did not know about it. Were we aware of plans and options by the major  stevedoring companies? Of course we were. I have said that on the public record. - If you would only listen and notice. I have said that on a number of occasions.As to this cabinet document, as it purports to be, I have no reason to believe that it is not authentic. As I understand it, the document that was released yesterday - you have not asked me about that; I await your question - and I believe this document, although I have not had it checked, were with a number of documents in the possession of a member of Mr Sharp's staff. When he resigned his ministerial position, he made arrangements for all the documents to go across to the department. Last night, when I was shown the Webster minute - which was the first time I had seen it - I asked my department -  - I am giving you an explanation. As I was saying, last night, when I was shown the Webster note to John Sharp dated 21 September, I asked the department had they seen that document before. Apparently, they had. They said it was one of a number of documents that had gone across to the department at the time John Sharp resigned as minister. - To conclude, Mr Speaker, as far as this document is concerned, it simply notes the fact that we have an activist approach to waterfront reform, which we have said publicly. We make no apologies for it. We were elected to take an activist approach  to fixing up the waterfront. We are proud of the fact that we have done so.My last remark is this. One of the parties close to this dispute relayed this anecdote to me this morning. They said that back in 1997 most people in the business community said that their worry about us was that, if ever there was a waterfront dispute, we would be the first to cave in. And they said what has now been shown is that the reality is this government is prepared to stick, and I tell you what, we are.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. Most people in the House, and indeed in Australia, were dismayed to see the terrible floods in the Katherine region in January 1998. The House will recall that the Prime Minister, together with his wife, visited the Katherine region in response and on 5 February 1998, in a joint press release with the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory, he announced the Katherine regional development program and the establishment of the Katherine and district business re-establishment trust fund.The Australian Defence Force was active in the alleviation of the situation in Katherine. They had up to 1,000 people involved in the movement of people, rescue, protection and the clean-up of the town, and we all give our thanks to them for that fine work.The Katherine and district re-establishment trust fund has tax deductibility; that is, donations to that trust fund are tax deductible. From that fund, $10,000 grants are being paid to businesses to re-establish, to primary produces and to other eligible businesses that were devastated by floods.The member for the Northern Territory raised with me earlier on this week the question of whether or not those grants would be taxable. I sought advice from the Australian Taxation Office in response to his request and the advice which I received was that the $10,000 grants out of the trust would be taxable under existing law. I pay tribute to the hard work of the member for the Northern Territory and to the representations he has made to me on this issue. If it had not been for the representations and the work that the member for the Northern Territory has made, I would not be able to now announce that the government will be amending the legislation to ensure that $10,000 grants from the trust for the re-establishment of businesses in Katherine will not be assessable for taxation.The government feels, after listening carefully to the representations which were made by the member for the Northern Territory, that it is only right that sums out of that trust fund do go wholly and totally for the re-establishment of businesses in the flood affected area. The government wants to underscore the importance that we attach to it. On behalf of the government, I thank the honourable member for the Northern Territory for his work on this issue.</DOC>

 - In respect of the first question, no, I have not heard any such claims, but, if the member is aware of tangible evidence which supports that, I would obviously be interested in hearing it. As to the second, I cannot comment on the classification of a particular video but, as the member  would well know, the classification of films, videos, literature, computer games and the like is done by the Office of Film and Literature Classification's Classification Board,  and is subject to review by the Classification Review Board.That body operates under guidelines which are set up under cooperative Commonwealth and state legislation. The guidelines are subject to the approval of each of the governments that participate. On that basis I can only assume that the video to which he refers has been through that system. It has been categorised as an `X' category video. It would be subject to appeal if an appropriate person thought it was inappropriately classified. I am not aware, obviously, of the particular video or of whether any appeal has been brought.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his excellent question. I am pleased to be able to tell him that the government has certainly had an activist approach to waterfront reform. In fact, we were elected to have an activist or interventionist approach. Australia had been waiting 13 years for a government that was prepared to take an approach which would encourage genuine reform on the Australian waterfront. We were encouraged to do so by a number of reports on the public record, for example the Bureau of Industry Economics report, I think back in 1995. Some us were encouraged, going all the way back to 1989, when we saw the Labor Party fail to implement the recommendations of the interstate commission. We were encouraged during the early 1990s, when even the Labor Party itself was publicly saying that the progress of waterfront reform was inadequate.We were encouraged by a recent Bureau of Transport, Communications and Economics study which stated that conservative estimates of economic benefit arising from waterfront reform were that it would amount to $1.24  billion annually and 4,350 additional jobs. The public would be surprised if this government was not prepared to actively promote a policy that would create over $1 billion worth of addition to GDP and literally thousands of jobs. Even in that work the advice to the government was that it did not take into account the benefits of a more reliable service. As we have seen on so many occasions, it is the lack of reliability on the Australian waterfront which has undermined the commercial prospects of literally thousands of Australian businesses.It is no surprise that, when the government undertook some internal work on the question of an approach that we would take, a study to the government concluded that `the activist approach is the only strategy which holds out the prospect of achieving the proposed objectives.' Why wouldn't that be surprising? The previous government had done nothing. Unless the government of the day was clearly prepared to politically take a leadership role with respect to the waterfront, quite frankly you would have seen absolutely no reform. That is the fact of the matter. For many years one of the features of this industry has been a high level of government involvement. In a situation which characterised this industry, unless the government was prepared to say unequivocally that it would support reform then it was certainly always our view that reform would not be achieved.What was the government's policy approach? It was to set the scene to facilitate the changes that the stevedores and others want to make and to give them the political and regulatory tools to get their businesses working again as quickly as possible in the event of industrial action. You say this is a great document. Surprise, surprise! I am very pleased you have tabled it. - The position as far as documents are concerned is that I have been  talking to our legal people and saying: `I would like to get some of these documents out.' Do you know what they say to me? They say: `You have to get these documents out in accordance with the court processes.' - What this document reveals is that the government was preparing and had a plan to be activist in respect of waterfront reform. Some of the tasks that we set would include close cooperation with waterfront industry employers to assist them to develop and implement strategies for overcoming a strike and maintain the flow of trade. Why would you object to that? Why would anybody in their right mind object to a government taking that position? It was exactly that position you took in the pilots' strike. Was that a conspiracy? Is that the confession we are going to get from you today? No, of course not, because it doesn't suit your political circumstances and you hate to be reminded of the fact that you were the ones who put the military into the pilots' dispute.We had a task force which was to identify government actions necessary to assist employers in the run-up to and during a dispute, which would include legal assistance. Is that a revelation? We give legal advice to people virtually on a daily basis. So what! That is a responsibility we have -  -  - particularly as we have introduced new laws, including the `Cheryl' clauses, which we think people ought to know about and ought to use if they need them. Issues would include access to pilots and tugs. If the country is being brought to a standstill, why wouldn't the government of the day be concerned to know where pilots and tugs would be available? - Okay. You want me to go back to physical security? - Why wouldn't the government be concerned about physical security for people involved in the waterfront dispute? People should never forget that within the MUA are the painters and dockers. The painters and dockers are well-known for their long history of violence and intimidation. I hesitate now to be selective. Going to the third point, `development of government strategy and tactics, including the disposal of ANL and the implementation of other maritime reform issues', why wouldn't the government have a task force on those issues; something you were never able to do? - That is your embarrassment. `Managing public and business opinion'. Is this a secret strategy that the coalition had - to manage public and business opinion? `Coordination of political information and effort.' Oh, yes. This was a secret plan, that the government would want to manage political information and effort. Lastly, `consultation with business leaders to gain their support and confidence'. Why wouldn't we? It was about time we had a government that was prepared to tackle this issue.</DOC>

 - The document says what it says. I have not had a chance to read it since I was asked the question but I will show uncharacteristic charity towards the member for Melbourne and accept that he may have read it out accurately. I do not find that remark the least bit surprising or the least bit embarrassing. If he is referring to visas in relation to the waterfront that arose in another context, I refer him to the answer that was given by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, I think some weeks ago in this House, which very comprehensively dealt with that matter.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question and for her support in this area. Yesterday I released the National Diabetes Strategy and Implementation Plan . It has been over two years in coming and it is the first time in this country that we got all key stakeholders in diabetes together to look at one of the country's biggest health problems and to come to a consensus. I was hoping it would be out earlier. It proved to be a much harder task than I first imagined, but we have managed to achieve it and for the first time we have a consensus on a way to deal with this very important illness in Australia.There are something like 750,000 people with diabetes in Australia. Half of them do not know that they have it. The complications of diabetes are nasty: loss of vision, kidney failure, loss of limb and heart disease. But there is a great message of hope because  diabetes and its complications can be prevented.The honourable member asked about the government's response to it and I am pleased to announce that, yesterday, we announced $6.2 million worth of funding for projects specifically in response to the national strategy report. I hope that this will not be the end of it. I hope in the future that people in state, territory and Commonwealth governments working together through the structure I have set up will be able to do much more. Briefly, there are four areas in particular that I find very exciting and that I think give great hope for people with diabetes.The first is that we are going to run, through the auspices of Diabetes Australia, a very substantial community awareness campaign because one of the biggest problems is that half the people with diabetes in Australia do not know that they have it. If they do not know they have it, they cannot get proper treatment and we cannot prevent the complications.The second thing is that studies in Sweden have shown that almost half the blindness due to diabetes can be prevented. There are 44,000 people, as of today, whose sight is in imminent danger from diabetes and the prospect of preventing half that blindness is something that any health minister should be very excited about.The third thing we are doing is establishing a national diabetes register. We have never had that in Australia. The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare is going to auspice this register, which will put all new cases of insulin dependent diabetes on the register. It will be for the very long term; it should still be operating in 50 years time. It will give us a capacity with research that we have never been able to have before; it is something we have only been able to dream of.Finally, there is a particular problem with diabetes in the Asian, particularly South-East Asian, communities. In my home town of Melbourne, one in every three cases of gestational diabetes in a hospital is of a Chinese or a Vietnamese woman. The Chinese and Vietnamese communities have very high rates of gestational diabetes. Two-thirds  of these women go on to develop diabetes in later life. There is not a single Chinese endocrinologist in Australia and there are very few Chinese or Chinese speaking diabetes educators. So we are working with the Australian Chinese Medical Association and the Australian Chinese Health Foundation to try to look at the causes and prevention. In the end, a lot of what I do as health minister is about treating illness once it happens. This is a great message of hope for people with diabetes that we are going to try to prevent illness as well.</DOC>

 - That is a commentary rather than a question but I will still be very happy to answer. Of course I recall saying that and I made that remark in the context of the very welcome intervention into the stevedoring business of the farmers. I congratulate the National Farmers Federation on the courage, foresight and tenacity that the National Farmers Federation displayed in getting involved in this matter.While we are talking about work forces, I want to take a moment, as this is a very general question, to thank and congratulate the non-union staff of the farmers stevedoring group who had the courage to work on the waterfront after 7 April, because those particular men and women were subjected to an enormous amount of intimidation and abuse. -  - And if ever -  -  - They were not only subjected to intimidation and abuse by members of the Maritime Union of Australia but insulted and reviled by members of the Australian Labor Party. - And I am giving a very specific answer. - To the specific question as to whether I recall an interview I gave on the Today  show, yes, I do recall it. I spoke then against the background of what the farmers had done. Today I speak in praise of what the farmers did in this dispute and I speak in praise of what their employees did. I thank them for the courage that they displayed in trying to involve themselves -  - My friend, the member for Charlton, mutters the normal Labor mantra of `scab'. - Apparently you are a scab and you are entitled to be described as the member for Charlton described them in his infamous adjournment speech. - I rather like the member for Charlton, as he knows, but I am very sorry that he used such vile, unforgiving,  hateful language about his fellow Australians. That is basically what this kind of dispute generates. You have this visceral tribal hatred of anybody who wants to work without belonging to a union.This issue is about one thing and one thing alone, and that is the determination of the Maritime Union of Australia to maintain a monopoly on the Australian waterfront. That is what it is about. If there were no MUA monopoly, we would have had higher productivity levels. If there had been higher productivity levels and there had been no MUA monopoly, it would not have been necessary for a newly elected coalition government to embark upon an activist reform strategy.I say again on behalf of the government: I make no apology at all for the activist strategy we followed because that strategy was designed to boost the productivity of the Australian waterfront. It was against the background of years and years of rorts. It was against the background of years and years of low productivity. It was against the background of the former government having spent $425 million for no measurable improvement in productivity. It was against the background of people who had wanted to remain out of the trade union being physically bullied and mentally intimidated into joining the MUA. - Voluntary unionism was a myth on the Australian waterfront. The reality was that, unless you agreed to belong to a union, you did not last on the Australian waterfront. - Yes, that is right. You nod and you think it is right, and by your nodded assent you validate the very argument that we have been using. When the chips were down on this issue, you in the Australian Labor Party lined up with the rorters, you lined up with the thugs who wanted compulsory unionism, you lined up with the men and  women on the Australian waterfront who wanted to preserve the stranglehold.I will ever remain proud of the fact that my government, with the help of the National Farmers Federation, was determined to bring about reform in accordance with the laws of Australia. But reform we were determined to bring about, because we believe it is in the long-term interests of the Australian community to have a reformed and more competitive Australian waterfront.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hinkler for his question. I acknowledge the fact that he has been a tremendous supporter of young apprentices in his electorate and has been very active in that regard. The government's aim has been to put in place a range of practical policies to assist particularly the 70 per cent of young people who are not going directly from school to university - the young people neglected by Labor.I am very pleased to be able to tell the House that there have been record numbers of new traineeships over the year to 1 June. Some 49,320 young Australians have entered these new traineeships - 14 per cent up on last year. One of the most encouraging features of these figures is that a very significant number of these new apprenticeships have gone to indigenous young people. I think one of the most tragic failures of the previous Labor  government was that it did nothing in this area to assist indigenous Australians gain the opportunities that they wanted. It was not interested in results; it was interested in throwing money at programs which did not work. There has been a record number of 5,000 traineeship commencements for indigenous Australians in the year up to the end of May. These figures exceed last year's record levels. It is worth comparing this with Labor's last year, 1995, when there were only 1,321 indigenous trainees.This government is taking practical measures to help indigenous Australians. We are interested in results. I had the great pleasure two weeks ago to be present at a graduation ceremony at Notre Dame University in Broome where 27 indigenous students graduated with certificates for teaching from their diploma courses. Many of these indigenous Australians were from remote communities. While in Broome, I also had the great satisfaction of meeting with representatives from the Aboriginal Independent Communities Schools - people who have been empowered by educational choice - who spoke to me with enormous pride about the progress that they are making in remote communities to assist their students.In recent months the government has announced $35 million for a range of practical measures to help young indigenous Australians get educational opportunities, including school buses to bring students to school, houses to attract teachers and projects to reinforce literacy outcomes. - The Leader of the Opposition is not interested because he is covering up 13 years of failure and humbug in this area and this government has put in place practical measures. The failure of the Leader of the Opposition unfortunately gave many Australians the impression that nothing was being achieved in this area. What I am showing is that we are achieving practical results. The member for Oxley apparently believes that nothing practical has been achieved. - Where is she? She is not here again; another absence from the House. She is not interested in these important national issues and she apparently does not support these special measures to help indigenous Australians. - Indigenous Australians have equal rights with every other Australian to human dignity and to the right to opportunities in this society. This government has been prepared, by its focus on results, by its action, by its positive policies, to give indigenous Australians the opportunities that they were denied for 13 years and to put in place policies that will work.Our message to the Australian people is this: that while there has been waste in the past under the previous government, with a focus on results - empowering indigenous Australians who want to take charge of their own lives and their own opportunities - results can be achieved and we will work with them to achieve those results in a united Australian community.</DOC>

 - This confirms what I have been saying all day, and that is that my government was determined to reform the Australian waterfront. It was a whole of government commitment and, as I gaze upon  my cabinet colleagues and think of the numerous discussions we had about this issue, I cannot think of an issue where there was a more united determination to achieve an objective that was good for Australia than this one. Of course we authorised whatever was necessary. Of course, we did! Can I say that the policy of the government was to achieve reform of the Australian waterfront, and the policy was to talk to, to listen to, and to discuss issues with players, and of course to provide whatever assistance was appropriate - always consistent with the laws of Australia.</DOC>

 - I want to acknowledge the member for Paterson and the tireless work that he does for his veterans community in the seat of Paterson. - I want to assure all members of this House that the government does provide assistance to those who have seen service for their country and who have had difficulty finding civilian employment or who are having difficulty remaining in employment. The government recognises the unique nature of the training of those who have served this country, particularly those who have served in a war zone, and the effect it does have on many of these people, both psychologically and physically. Through my department, we have introduced a vocational rehabilitation scheme and I want to reassure all members of the House - and the member for Paterson I know is most interested in this, because he has a very large population of veterans in his own community, particularly Vietnam veterans; I think there are over 270 Vietnam veterans currently receiving assist  ance in his electorate from my department - that this scheme is entirely voluntary. It is not going to be forced on any veteran and I want to reassure members of the House of that point.What those veterans get is a personally tailored rehabilitation service to assist them either to remain in work or to find work in the civilian work force. The assistance is in the form of professional advice to make sure that they are getting the right advice to remain in that work, but also, importantly, if they have had trouble - particularly those younger veterans with entitlements - they know that when they are on this scheme those entitlements are legislated and will not be taken away from them. I think that has been a major barrier for many younger veterans who feel that the entitlements that they have, should they enter the work force, may be revisited by my department. Let me assure them and members of this House that those entitlements will not be taken away while they are on this rehabilitation scheme. They are entitlements that they are entitled to while they under this scheme.The scheme has been running for about six months now. Whilst the numbers who have been through the process and are actually now in work are only modest, there are many more coming forward. And that is very encouraging. It does deserve the support of all members of the parliament.Because of the level of interest in the scheme coming from the younger veterans particularly, we now will be contracting that service out through the Commonwealth rehabilitation scheme. That means it will be able to bring professional advice and professional services to veterans right across Australia.I just want to say to those veterans who choose to take up this scheme because they see a need to seek that professional advice that they will be able to get it. It is not compulsory. I am certainly looking forward to being in the electorate of the member for Paterson next week where I know this will be a subject that will be dear to many of his constituents' hearts.</DOC>

 - This is an interesting theory. -  - Didn't you get the question right? You should have let Hotham ask it. Kim, you got it wrong; he should have asked it. -  - The situation is this simply this: that naturally, as Prime Minister and somebody who is interested in waterfront reform, I met the chief executive of the stevedoring company - and do not hold me to this; I will have to check my records; I think I had a discussion with Lord Sterling, who is the Chairman of P&amp;O, when I was in London in the middle of last year -  - I have had a number of meetings with Mr Hine. From recollection -  - I had one meeting with Mr Corrigan; I would have met him in a social environment on one or two occasions. - Oh yes, that is very conspiratorial. It is well known that the federal politician that Mr Corrigan has had the closest association with over the years in this place is Paul Keating. I may well have met - and I would have to check my diaries - other representatives of stevedoring companies, as I have met representatives of the trade union movement. So what? It would be a very strange Prime Minister who did not meet the chief executives of large companies; the fact that he meets them hardly represents a conspiracy. I remain defiantly proud of what my government has done to achieve reform of the Australian waterfront. I believe that it was being pursued in the interests of the Australian community.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for the question. - There has been a very interesting survey put out by the Victorian Employers Chamber of Commerce and Industry this week on -  - port reform. What it demonstrates graphically is that there is very wide support - majority support, in fact - for waterfront reform amongst the users of the  Australian ports. These are the people who know what it is like. They know what the rorts are like; they are sick of the rorts. They know what the problems of lack of reliability are. It is further evidence of the need for reform, but it is also welcome evidence of the support for reform. As David Edwards, who runs VECCI, says:The survey found that nearly three-quarters of port users at the Port of Melbourne supported moves to introduce greater competition to stevedoring services such as that initiated by the National Farmers Federation.It was then said:The clear message is that the majority of port users want, need and support waterfront reform, and will continue to do so should the current dispute escalate. Port users are conscious that continuing unrest will cost them money. However, the survey shows that most are prepared to weather these costs in order to realise longer term benefits.My message for all those people who signed up to that proposition is that this government is prepared to stick at this issue to see genuine waterfront reform.I just want to conclude on this: it is also my view that it is not just the users of the waterfront who support reform; I actually think there are a lot of rank and file MUA members who also believe that it is time that some of these issues were addressed. I have absolutely no doubt that there are very large numbers of rank and file MUA members who would like to take what is a very generous redundancy package. I am told that, when Mick O'Leary went down to East Swanston dock the other day, he got up in front of the crowd and he said, `It's finally time, guys; we're going have to undertake real reform.' And he went through the things that would be needed to be implemented for real reform on the waterfront, like contracting out -  - I was not there. You get your own version and table it. - The report came back that he went through the various reforms that would need to be undertaken and, basically, there was no response - that people were effectively, as it was reported to me, acquiescing in it. The only thing in which they really disagreed with the union was when Mick said to the assembled rank and file that there would have to be a limit on the number who could take redundancies. Do you know why they are complaining about that? Because a lot of them would like to take what is an extremely generous redundancy package, as has been clearly outlined by the Productivity Commission.All of those employees, according to the MUA, are creditors of those labour hire companies. As such, they are entitled to speak to the administrators. Grant Thornton are the independent administrators. As creditors, therefore, they are entitled to ring up Grant Thornton and seek from Grant Thornton a statement of their entitlements. They can do so, I am informed, on a confidential basis. They can similarly ring up MIFCo, which the government has established, and a month or so ago we established a hotline; the number is 1300 363 472. - I will, Prime Minister: 1300 363 472. Grant Thornton's telephone number is 02 92846666, and they can ring and get an impartial and confidential statement of their entitlements.I have absolutely no doubt that a lot of those blokes would like to take what is a very fair package. I believe it is time that the union allowed the rank and file to have a say on this issue, instead of being more concerned, as the union is, to hold people into the MUA so that it can hang onto its monopoly position. That is the real agenda. It always has been on this issue. We are prepared, as we have always said, to see people receive a fair redundancy, but it has to be in the context of the genuine reform that we really need on the Australian waterfront.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Murray for her question. On Saturday, Australian officials participated in joint talks in Tokyo between the Manila framework group and G7. Australia played an active part in the discussions that led to the calling of the meeting and the meeting itself. The meeting provided an opportunity for senior officials from key countries to discuss  the regional financial crisis. In particular, it was valuable for officials from around the world to discuss with Japan the extent of the difficulty it now faces, the impact that that has on other countries and the action that Japan is taking to resolve its problems.The meeting emphasised the vital importance to Japan, the region and the entire world that Japan restore its banking system to health, achieve domestic demand led growth and open and deregulate its markets. It also welcomed China's commitment to maintain the stability of the renmimbi and Indonesia's renewed commitment to economic reform.The Australian government welcomes statements by Japan of its commitment to restructure its financial system. This is a matter of the highest urgency. We again underline our support for those Japanese efforts to do that and stress its importance in getting the Japanese financial system stabilised, in getting the bad loans out of those financial institutions that are carrying excessive debts, and also in stimulating domestic demand. From our point of view, from the region's point of view - indeed, from the world's point of view - steps taken to reform the Japanese financial system and to stabilise the situation of the Japanese economy are of the utmost importance and have our very strong support.</DOC>

 - There are many messages arising from the Queensland state elections - some of those state, some of those federal, and I am honest enough to admit that. Perhaps one of them is that the sort of nit-picking angst and mantras here at question time - nit-picking which drives people abso  lutely mad because they see the real issues being by-passed by the Labor Party - is part of those messages. If you think people are impressed by the deliberations and the style of deliberations in question time, you might like to think again.As the Prime Minister said, the National Party is a separate party to the Liberal Party. The National Party and the Federal President and I have said we will decide this issue on a state-by-state, seat-by-seat basis. Furthermore, whilst I have a clear-cut disposition, I will go about a comprehensive process of consultation; and that will be not just in places like Brisbane and elsewhere later this week, but it will be right across the nation. You will get an announcement on this matter - an honourable announcement on this matter - at the right time.</DOC>

 - I am aware of a recent survey compiled by the Economist Intelligence Unit. It has found that over the past 12 months Australia has become the most attractive location for investment in the whole of Asia. And this is a tribute to the very sensible economic management that my government has brought to the economic affairs of this country.A survey published earlier this month in the Business Asia journal found that 37 per cent of respondents considered that Australia was a more attractive investment location - the highest for the entire region. This survey and what it means reveal the benefits to Australia of following a prudent fiscal policy. That policy has seen the conversion of a $10.5 billion deficit into a surplus of $2.7 billion. It has seen the delivery to the farmers, the small business men and women and the home buyers of Australia the lowest interest rates that this country has seen for 30 years.I suggest to the member for Lindsay and to all honourable members that it is a very important goal of public policy in Australia  that we continue to welcome foreign investment, because foreign investment generates jobs for Australians. Without foreign investment there would be fewer Australians employed. If we become unfriendly to foreign investment, we will put Australians out of work. The fact that Australia is the most attractive investment location in the whole of Asia ought to be a source of immense pride to all Australians.</DOC>

 - I think all Australians of goodwill would welcome the widespread support in Australia for tax reform that is developing across the board. The Business Coalition for Tax Reform has today announced the release of television commercials which will be airing on commercial television from 5 p.m. this evening talking about the need for Australia to improve its tax system. In launching that campaign today, the Chair  man of Australians for Fairer Tax, Mr John Ralph, said, `Never before has there been such a united front from small business to retailers, to manufacturers and farmers on the need for tax reform.'It is not only the business community of Australia that wants tax reform. I was particularly interested to see last Friday the release by the Australian Council of Social Services of its agenda for tax reform where ACOSS said this:If tax reform is to be genuine and acceptable, it must tackle all four elements of our tax system: personal income and assets, business income, consumption and federal-state financial relations.And listen to this from the Australian Council of Social Services:The alternatives to good and comprehensive tax reform are stark for low and middle income people and consequently for all Australians. Without it, federal and state governments will continue to cut back essential services and increase their reliance on regressive taxes and equally regressive user charges.We now have in Australia a strong movement from the business community towards tax reform; we now have a strong movement from the Australian Council of Social Services towards tax reform. We might ask ourselves, as Australia begins to grapple with the challenges that it faces: why would any decent political party stand in the way of tax reform?  Why other than complete political opportunism would you as the Labor Party nail yourself to the Australian taxation system and all of its flaws?After this very positive contribution from the Australian Council of Social Services, I saw on the weekend that the Australian Labor Party came out and attacked them in the most vicious of terms. We will not always agree with the Australian Council of Social Services, but I say this for them: they had the decency to sit down and work hard on producing a better and fairer tax system for Australia. They did not take themselves out of the debate as the Australian Labor Party did.I know that the member for Kingston has in the public gallery today a group of people from a Neighbourhood Watch competition in her electorate who have come across as part  of the prize to meet the Prime Minister. It will be a great opportunity for them to hear from the Prime Minister how his government wants to give Australia a much better taxation system. The Australian Labor Party stands squarely against tax reform hand in hand with One Nation. The two political parties that are on a joint ticket to oppose tax reform in Australia today are Labor and One Nation. -  - Both for the same reason: complete political opportunism. As the member for Werriwa said, a political party in a time warp walking hand in hand down the economic path of Hansonism. That is where Labor stands today. It stands for the outmoded wholesale sales tax; it stands for putting people on average earnings up into high marginal tax brackets; it stands against the opportunity for fairer and decent taxation in this country.Even the Australian Democrats have shown much more responsibility on this issue than Labor and One Nation. The Australian Democrats' social security spokesman, Senator Andrew Bartlett, said this of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition when he attacked ACOSS for supporting tax reform, `It is distressing to see Gareth going ballistic at a well respected independent body like ACOSS purely because they can't be bullied.' The bullying of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and Labor has not silenced ACOSS on the need for tax reform. As for ourselves, we hardly find it distressing to see the Deputy Leader of the Opposition going ballistic. In fact, we find it quite entertaining.</DOC>

 - My understanding of that particular piece of analysis assumes no compensation. While I am on my feet, might I remind the member for Jagajaga of another piece of analysis which was released last week by, I think, the Institute of Chartered Accountants that demonstrated that, under the taxation system that the Labor Party supports, a family on $30,000 a year is worse off than a family on $20,000 a year. I ask you, Mr Speaker, how can it be that any political party in this country can actually support a tax system where a family - same number, same circumstances - earning $30,000 a year is actually worse off than a family on $20,000 a year? Yet, that is the Beazley-Evans taxation system where the harder you work, the more you earn, the more you lose. That is the system that the Labor Party is supporting. I think those figures speak far more eloquently than the question asked by the member for Jagajaga.</DOC>

 - I think if I had to name the elements of the Australian taxation system which require reform the most, I would pick up from where the Prime Minister was just speaking. Why would you support a system - like Labor does - where the average person, a person on 1½ times average earnings, pays 47 per cent in income tax? Why would you support a system - as Labor does - whereby people that are just getting past average earnings, maybe doing a bit of overtime, have to pay $1 in $2 in tax? - Why would you support a system where people in the $20,000 to $30,000 wage range, not only have tax imposed on them, but have social security taken away and are paying 80 per cent and 90 per cent in taking away income tax and social security benefits? - I hear the Labor Party now interjecting and saying, `Oh, no, no, no, we are going to deal with all of that! We are going to deal with that with an income tax credit.' Yes - just like you dealt with it in 1983, and 1984, and 1985, and 1986, and 1987, and 1988. You had 13 years and you did nothing. We now have a Labor opposition whose sole reason to get back into government is to stop change. That is its sole reason. The one policy that the Beazley opposition has come up with - think about this - is a policy for its next term in opposition: to oppose indirect tax reform. That is the only policy that it has actually put down in relation to tax.Why would you support a system like that? Why does Labor support a system of indirect tax where you tax soft toys at 22 per cent but do not tax antique mirrors? Why does Labor support that kind of tax system? Why does Labor support a tax system where you start taxing biscuits but you will not tax caviar? Why does Labor support a system where you put a 22 per cent tax on a car but do not tax an aeroplane?The Labor Party presided over 13 years of absolute tax unfairness, and where it stands now is not on a principle. Labor now stands precisely where One Nation stands, on the same basis of populism, because they will not face up to the big issues that are confronting this country. This is an opposition without any spine or principle; an opposition which cannot deal with any of the big political issues; and an opposition which has the most contradictory position on tax possibly imaginable.We want to give a better deal for wage and salary earners. We want to cut top marginal tax rates, give a better go to average wage and salary earners, get a better interplay  between wage and salary and social security, harmonise out all of those irregularities in relation to indirect tax, and give families the kind of justice they deserve with a new tax system and a better tax system.</DOC>

 - The answer to the question is that I had, two years after that interview was given. Everyone knows that GST has not been introduced in the first term that we have been in government. Everyone knows that we are honest enough - unlike the Labor Party -  -  - to go to the Australian public at the next election with a tax reform program; unlike the Labor Party who promised no GST, but when they got back in power in 1993 introduced one without having the courage to face the electorate before that change of policy. There is a vast difference in  the situation and the Australian public well knows it.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Riverina for his question. As the honourable member would know, some of the indirect taxes that are applied to the transport sector have a severe impact, particularly on some of the operators in his electorate, and I instance Ron Finemores Transport in the city of Wagga Wagga, which the honourable member represents.A couple of examples where anomalies in the taxation system do dramatically impact on the transport sector should be noted. The first one is the diesel fuel excise. Members would recall that in 1983 when the Labor Party came to office diesel fuel excise was 7c a litre. In 1996, after 13 years of Labor, the diesel fuel excise was 36c a litre. Remember those infamous promises in the middle of that in 1993 when they were not going to increase any of those taxes and in fact they did? We have maintained that we would not increase those taxes since we have been in office, and we have not. But that is just one anomaly. One of the other anomalies in the aviation area - this is part of the crazy system that the Labor Party wants to protect and do not want anybody to change - is that powered aircraft are exempt from the wholesale sales tax. However, powered gliders are taxed at 22 per cent. Non-motorised gliders are also taxed at 22 per cent. However, hot-air balloons are exempt. What is the difference between an ultralight and a powered glider? What is the difference between a glider and a hot-air balloon? - There are a few hot-air balloons opposite, Mr Speaker.The other point I would like to make is that we have shown a great deal of faith with the  Australian public in terms of taxation, because, in fact, in the last budget, we abolished a tax. We abolished the avgas tax in the last budget, a tax that the Labor Party introduced and kept putting up, a tax that the Labor Party, in the dying days of their government, wanted to increase again. We stopped them and now we have abolished that avgas tax. In fact, a number of people from around Australia have appreciated the fact that we have abolished that avgas tax so much that they have written to me acknowledging that. I have heard from Norman Brown from North Queensland and Loxton Engineering in South Australia. - No, there is not one here from Dick Smith. I have also heard from Dr James Auld in Inverell in New South Wales, Ron Knapp of Western Australia and a Fred Fahey from the Southern Highlands, no relation to the finance minister. These people have taken the time to write to our government thanking us for the genuineness of the way we have implemented policy.We have eliminated a tax that the Labor Party put into place and the Labor Party increased. The Labor Party now want to protect the taxation system. They want to keep the taxation system that has been proven day in and day out to be an impost, particularly on our export sector. I know that the Leader of the Opposition in one of his speeches noted that fuel excise was an impost on the export sector.</DOC>

 - I will not dispute the first part of the question. I will rely on the anecdotal evidence that the member for Curtin refers to. At the beginning of the 1990s there was difficulty in respect of Australia's managed funds. There were a number that suffered from liquidity problems and there were a number of investors that got hurt. The Companies and Securities Advisory Committee and the Law Reform Council did a joint report to look at it and said one of the reasons the two entity structure was not working was that there was nobody who carried single legal liability.In relation to the dual responsibility, there was overlap. There were different duties. It was not clear who was totally responsible to the investor. Every time there was litigation, there were cross-actions between the two parties concerned. The then Labor government produced a bill for a single responsible entity. Subsequent to that, we had a financial system inquiry. The financial system inquiry was not requested by me, but it did look at this issue. It came to the same conclusion - that is, that there should be a single responsible entity. The matter has been referred to a committee in the Senate and the Senate has come to the same conclusion. In addition to this, after discussions with the Australian Securities Commission, the government decided to act in accordance with the recommendations of, by now, the Companies and Securities Advisory Committee, the Law Reform Commission, the financial system inquiry, a Senate committee and the Australian Securities Commission. What that requires is that there be a single responsible entity who takes the totality of the legal liability for a scheme to an individual investor. That person can, if they wish to, by contract, set up a situation where there is another party to hold assets. Indeed, under ASC requirements, the ASC will insist that there not be the opportunity for related parties, except with protections, to both hold assets in its name and to manage the funds. The ASC has produced extensive notes in relation to this. Given the fact that you have had strong findings by independent bodies, given the fact that you had a problem which commenced all  of those inquiries and given the fact that you now have strong regulatory regimes set by the Australian Securities Commission, this government believes that these will be good investments with proper safeguards. What is more, there will be more efficiency and the prospects of returns for investors will be better. I understand that, in relation to the industry, those who manage funds will be happier with those situations and those trustee companies, which obviously perform the role of trustees for funds, will be less happy. I believe that the in-built safeguards that the government has put in place will protect investors whilst dealing with the problems which gave rise to this whole issue and bring to a finality this issue which has been going on now for seven or eight years.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Richmond for his question. We had a very busy week for small business last week in implementing and announcing various policy initiatives. One was the matrix of employee definitions and employer responsibilities. This policy is called Unravelling the Threads. I refer it to members because, if you are running a small business, to know when a person is an employee as opposed to dealing with a subbie is the bane of the life of many people in small business. This was a recommendation to us. I know it is not a headline issue and that the opposition is obviously not interested, but I tell you what: this is a very practical initiative for the benefit of small business. - I will say a bit more about that when I am asked a question later. It is on the Internet, we have booklets and the like for people, and I do strongly recommend it to all those members who deal with their constituencies on small business issues. My colleague the parliamentary secretary, Mr Cadman, last  week released an information kit on alternative dispute resolution. This is also aimed at providing a benefit to the small business community. Like the first one, it will save them red tape and costs. It is a very useful initiative.Lastly, we have the franchise code - a big measure I launched last week. This of course comes out of the Reid committee recommendations and is one of the significant policy initiatives of this government. Labor had a voluntary scheme; it did not work. We have come in, we have put a proper scheme in place and we have underpinned it with the Trade Practices Act reforms. This is going to be a major boost to a $52 billion industry. This government made a lot of commitments to small business. We give it very high priority; we have put it in cabinet and in the last week we have delivered not once, not twice, but on three important occasions for the benefit of small business.</DOC>

 - What I said yesterday was that our response to the report would not lead to closures of post offices or mail centres in the bush. That response will fully honour our election commitments. I take the opportunity afforded to me by the member for Hotham to repeat those commitments, and I repeat them for the benefit of people not only in rural and regional Australia but throughout the Australian community: we intend to maintain Australia Post in full public ownership, and we intend to maintain Post's obligation to provide all Australians with a standard letter service  at a uniform rate. 	 I remind the parliament that we have already ensured two deliveries per week where people were previously receiving one per week and requested an additional service. Our response to the NCC report will benefit, not harm, the bush. Whilst Post's presence in the bush will not be harmed by our response, the Labor Party wants to deny to farmers and small businesses in rural and regional Australia the benefits of better services and lower prices. The answer that I gave yesterday I repeat, and I stand by it.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. Since July of last year, the government has been playing a role in trying to assist with the restoration of proper democratic processes in Cambodia. Part of that process was the effort we made with others to establish what is known as the `Friends of Cambodia' group. It met with the ASEAN Troika on 20 June - that is, on Saturday - and we discussed the situation in Cambodia in the lead-up to the elections on 26 July. It was agreed that there had been some positive achievements. For example, the registration of voters has moved ahead relatively successfully, but problems remain - problems in terms of the opposition's access to the electronic media and the right to unhindered assembly, and there are still some threats of intimidation. At this stage there is also a lack of voter education in preparation for the election.The `Friends of Cambodia' made it perfectly clear, as did the ASEAN Troika, that we still want to see free, fair and credible elections. It is our judgment that that is possible, but that will only be achieved if the sorts of concerns I have mentioned have been fully addressed by the time the election occurs. Over and above that, let me say that it is very  important that there is in Cambodia an independent investigation into politically motivated killings. We hope that that investigation will now proceed. But, overall, the `Friends of Cambodia' group has helped to promote both that investigation and free, fair and credible elections in Cambodia.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and his interest. There are some good things happening in general practice. A number of them were announced in the budget, and they take place  starting from next week. There are three initiatives. The first is rural work force agencies, which will help coordinate rural retention and rural recruitment, which has been an ongoing problem for country people. The second is a program of micro-economic reform, which I think holds very big prospects for general practice.In Australia the average size of general practice is just over two GPs. This compares with somewhere like the UK where the average size is around five general practitioners. When you have larger numbers of general practitioners, people can specialise; they can get a bit of time off; they can have ongoing education; and the practice itself can provide comprehensive 24 hour a day care. So the money we are putting in for micro-economic reform, I think, will have a very great effect on general practice in the years to come. Thirdly, we are supporting information technology in general practice, an area of very great need. Doctors have been slow to take up information technology, yet it holds very great prospect for the public.Other initiatives in response to the honourable member's questions are that from 1 November this year general practitioners will be getting a full indexation of the MBS rebate and a further increase from 1 March next year in recognition that the rebate has been held back for some five to six years. Further, we are changing the general practice strategy in response to general practice strategy review. There has been a very large component of that called the better practice program. It seems to have done anything but promote better practice. So from 1 July we are changing it to the practice incentives program. It will be much clearer and easier for general practitioners to understand and will reward specific achievable outcomes such as a high rate of immunisation amongst the children that they see.Finally, we are changing the method of remuneration of general practice trainees in response to a recommendation and review into general practice education. This will mean that general practitioners who are in training can actually focus on educational outcomes and will not be required to see patients to  generate their income. All in all, I believe that these changes will underpin a very positive future for general practice, which is the cornerstone of health care in Australia.</DOC>

 - Obviously, over the years, I have had a number of meetings with Mr Santamaria. I agreed with him on some things and I disagreed with him profoundly on others. I certainly agreed with him about the need to fight communism in the trade unions and the Australian Labor Party, which he did a very good job of. I thoroughly disagreed with Mr Santamaria on the need for compulsory unionism. I can remember arguing that with him and his organisation.I must say that I have never taken my economic guidance from Mr Santamaria. I do not want to speak ill of anybody who is obviously a great Australian, but, starting from the National Rural Catholic Action Movement back, I do not think many of his economic ventures were a success, including setting up cooperatives and communes in rural Victoria back in the 1940s. I think you would agree with me. If you want to know whether the League of Rights has written One Nation's economic policies -  - Well, you don't because you think you have a monopoly on the League of Rights economic policy. - If you want evidence of that proposition, you need go no further than Eric Butler, who, as I recall, got on AM  and said that, yes, he had influenced the economic policy of One Nation but then went on to say that he would not agree with everything One Nation did because it had people who were too extreme for him in it. I would have thought if Mr Eric Butler of the League of Rights believes that there are elements of One Nation that are too extreme for him he ought to know. Mr Eric Butler can pick an extremist when he sees one, and he has. - If I were giving advice in relation to economic policy, I would say that the economic prescriptions of the League of Rights are not good for Australia; nor are the economic prescriptions which say we can solve our problems by printing money; nor are the economic prescriptions that say that unproven theories which have never been adopted by any other country, with the possible exception of Latin America in its debt crisis in the Weimar Republic in the 1920s, should be followed by One Nation, the League of Rights or by any other political party.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Casey for the question. The government has legislated to stop the dangerous and potentially hazardous practice of substituting or blending concessional fuels with diesel and petrol for use in cars and trucks. The legislation came into effect on 31 January this year. Now these concessional fuels have a chemical marker placed in them that can be detected in a  simple test. I am delighted to be able to report to the House that these measures have proved to be very successful.When the government introduced these measures we had in mind that we may save about $25 million in revenue. Early indications are that we are saving around $10 million a month already from this measure. Whilst it may take some time to know whether those figures actually continue, it is clear that the practice of substitution has been more widespread than was previously thought.This not only has revenue implications, but also has safety implications because many of these excise free fuels have lower flashpoints and so can cause damage to engines and even can be hazardous to human life. So it is very important that this practice be stamped out. The government's action is indeed proving to be successful. In 14 tests conducted in Victoria, five have produced positive results. In New South Wales, out of 20 tests six have proved positive. In total, $35 million worth of potential fuel fraud is under investigation. This legislation is a clear demonstration yet again that this government is tough on tax cheats, but it is also concerned about the safety and security of consumers.</DOC>

 - The honourable member seems to have little understanding of the way  in which Australia's workplace relations systems operate. The fact of the matter is that, whether you have a certified agreement under 170LK, whether you have a certified agreement with a union, whether you have a certified agreement directly with employees, whether you have an Australian workplace agreement collectively or individually, or whether you have an informal agreement, all of those forms of agreement making simply provide people with choices as to the manner in which they cement the terms and conditions upon which they have been employed. That is all that it does.Your question betrays the underlying policy position that you have, and that is that you intend to abolish Australian workplace agreements. You publicly say that this is a good thing, even though 18,000 of them have so far been approved - and the number has been growing exponentially - and even though 18,000 of those people in literally hundreds of businesses find those arrangements convenient for their own particular arrangements. This is a classic glimpse into the Labor Party's attitude to workplace relations. Because the unions have told you that the unions are opposed to individuals having their own agreements, you follow the dictates of the trade union movement and you are advocating the most regressive industrial relations policy to be unveiled by a major political party in this country. All Australians ought to be aware that it is not just AWAs you intend to abolish but, at the dictates of the trade union movement, you will also abolish the secondary boycott bans in the Trade Practices Act. Why is it, when you look at the waterfront dispute, you have people like Bob Brown telling you how to run your industrial relations policy. What was one of the incredible aspects of the recent dispute on the Australian waterfront? One of the most incredible aspects of it was that at no stage did we have a nationwide stoppage. Why was that? Because of the effectiveness of the Australian Workplace Relations Act and the ban on secondary boycotts. AWAs are a great idea, and there are thousands of individuals enjoying them. The only reason you would abolish them is  because you have been told to by the trade union movement.</DOC>

 - I can advise the House that there have been very extensive discussions and negotiations with respect to the waterfront dispute. We expect that the union is likely to be in a position with Patrick's tomorrow to sign some form of agreement, generally as a framework agreement in settlement of the dispute but with further documentation to follow.In a nutshell, if matters continue on the basis which has been discussed, we would expect to see something like half the current work force take a redundancy package. The manning levels under the agreement have been based on the government's productivity target rate of 25 crane lifts an hour. - It is specified in the agreement, Simon. You ought to read it; it is on the Internet. That would see an end to the overmanning on the Australian waterfront which has been the basis of much of the problem and the lack of productivity.Secondly, the intention of the parties would be to sign industrial agreements. These industrial agreements would be signed under the government's Workplace Relations Act. Under the Workplace Relations Act, once you sign an agreement you give up the right to take industrial action during the currency of that agreement. That is a significant change in itself because a lack of reliability on the Australian waterfront has come about because these guys have always been taking industrial action. So, firstly, you get a cut in the overmanning - a reduction in the work force by about half; secondly, with the entering into of industrial agreements, you will bring into full play the operations of the Workplace Relations Act limiting industrial action. Thirdly, in this -  - Yes, I will say something about contractors. I have often given this House an example of the rorts on the Australian waterfront. One of the rorts on the Australian waterfront has been the use of double-headers - where people get paid double time and a half. Under the agreement, double-headers will be abolished.The fourth element, just to give members a sense of the changes and the extent of them, is the agreement to contract out maintenance. I mention this one because members will remember that the MUA was taking industrial action at one stage to prevent P&amp;O in Port Botany from replacing second-hand diesel engines with new and more reliable capital equipment. The contracting out provisions and the performance requirements under contracting out will of course also abolish yet another rort - in particular, that one which has been a problem for a long time. So we will see the work force reduced by roughly half, we will see contracting out and we will see the adoption of the government's productivity targets as just some of the elements in what will be the biggest and most significant set of changes on the Australian waterfront in living memory.Just to conclude, given that I have had the interjection, I contrast that with the WIRA process when Labor was in office. The day after Labor announced WIRA - remembering our 25 crane rate is actually built into the manning levels - Tas Bull, who was running the unions, said, `We certainly haven't been asked to give any guarantees as to productivity improvements. That would be impossible for the work force to provide.' You got nothing out of WIRA. You forked out $170 million worth of taxpayers' money and you left us to clean up your mess.</DOC>

 - The Business Council ads were the responsibility of the Business Council. We have never provided any misleading information. - Never ever. I am glad that the Leader of the Opposition has asked me a question about taxation. When I was reading the papers early this morning, I saw a news report which carried the views of a former minister of the Keating Labor government, Mr Gary Johns. Mr Gary Johns writes a great deal of sense these days. Mr Gary Johns was saying that he had basically said to the Australian Labor Party, `Why don't you wake up to yourselves. Why don't you look to the Australian interest and don't be so stupid. Drop your fearmongering against taxation reform.'</DOC>

 - I saw at the weekend that the Leader of theOpposition is now saying that if he were in government he would divert money out of the Telstra dividends to worthy causes, particularly in regional Australia. There is one thing that he did not do: he did not say what he would do with the money he would thereby be taking from health, education and other services. Unfortunately for the Leader of the Opposition, the Telstra dividend is already factored into the budget. If you are going to take $500 million out of the Telstra dividend and give it to bush infrastructure, you are taking the $500 million from somewhere else. Are you going to take it from nursing homes, Medicare, government schools or poor Catholic schools? I think the Leader of the Opposition ought to answer this simple question: where is the money coming from?</DOC>

 - Of course, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and others should wait and see the tax package. When they see the tax package, they will find that it deals  with the tax obligations of Australians at all income ranges in a very fair and equitable fashion. Perhaps instead of asking me questions the Deputy Leader of the Opposition should explain to the Australian public why he continues to support a tax system which says that if are you wealthy enough to buy a Lear jet you do not pay any wholesale sales tax but that if you are like the rest of us you pay 22 per cent on your family car. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition ought to explain to the Australian public why he supports a system that allows at present a wealthy person to buy a Lear jet for millions of dollars and not pay a cent in wholesale sales tax but which, like the rest of us, if you can only afford a family car, requires you to pay 22 per cent wholesale sales tax. Gareth Evans should explain that to the Australian battlers.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I was rather taken by a story in the Australian Financial Review  this morning on the problems of Australia's tax system. I went back to the source of the article. I can reveal to the House that it is a very stimulating magazine, well worth reading, called Options . As it turns out, the publisher of this magazine is the member for Sturt, who asked me the question. There are a number of articles in this Options  magazine on producing a better tax system for Australia, including one by me. I would like to refer the House to the one which appears on page 7, which tells us what needs to be fixed in the current tax system. It reads:1. It consists of too many different and overlapping taxes.We would agree with that.2. It is complex and makes compliance difficult. We would agree with that.3. It is unduly focused on business inputs and income and reduces competitiveness.We would agree with that.4. It applies differently to different parts of the economy and distorts performance.I think the government would agree with that.5. It is inequitable because the wealthy can minimise tax.We would agree with that.6. It does little to encourage savings.That article was written by Gary Johns, a former minister in the Keating government, who then goes on to say -  - The Leader of the Opposition says that everyone has to make a living. And you will try to make one out of opposing sensible reform in Australia, won't you? Mr Johns says:This is the one great reform that Labor could not tackle, outside the waterfront labour monopoly, after Keating's 1985 option C died.ACOSS is saying that the Australian taxation system needs reform. It says:If we want a better future, we must find better ways of financing it. That is why tax reform is such a fundamental issue.ACOSS wants tax reform; the business community wants tax reform; the Commonwealth government wants tax reform; the state premiers want tax reform; Gary Johns wants tax reform; Bob Hogg wants tax reform. You are only allowed to tell the truth in the Labor Party once you have resigned from it. And who is opposed to tax reform? - A joint ticket between Labor and One Nation, led by their respective economic spokesmen, Gareth Evans and David Ettridge, is now opposing tax reform in this country on precisely the same grounds, not because there is any principle, not because you can justify the current tax system, not  because you believe in it, but for straight, pure, opportunistic reasons there is a unity ticket between Labor and One Nation, neither of them with a clue as to how to run the Australian economy, and neither of them with a clue as to what to do about a good tax system.</DOC>

 - One of the significant aspects of the reforms now being put in place will be to significantly reduce overmanning on the Australian waterfront. The union says there will be a net number of around 400, but they are only talking about MUA members in that net number. In fact, there are a significant number of AMOU members who will also be taking up the redundancies. But we will leave  it to the union to explain the numbers as they have agreed with Patrick's.As a result of a significant reduction in overmanning, roughly half of the work force, we will see the end of some of the worst rorts and restrictive practices on the Australian waterfront. Members will remember the infamous `nick'. The nick is where somebody is working and they get paid to go home; they get paid to sit at home and watch TV, at double time and a half. The nick was a consequence of the problems of overmanning. One of the aspects of the agreement is that there will be one person per machine. One person per machine - one man, one machine - is a revolution on the Australian waterfront. It is commonplace everywhere else but it is a very significant change on the Australian waterfront.As we see this agreement implemented, instead of a rort a day, we are going to see a rort abolished a day as a result of these reforms. We will see crane rates reaching 25 lifts an hour, which is the basis upon which the manning levels have been agreed. If Australia can have - and I believe it can strive to achieve - internationally competitive productivity rates on the waterfront, the benefit for the Australian economy is something like an extra 4,000 jobs spread throughout the economy and an extra $1 billion added to the living standards of all Australians. That is a huge benefit.To ensure that we achieve these real gains from reform, the government will put in place a comprehensive monitoring system; there will be the quarterly publication by the BTCE of Waterline to monitor crane rates and reliability; the ACCC will monitor costs and pricing; we will commission an independent report from the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission in 18 months to ensure that we are also getting the benefits directly for the benefit of employees; and my department will publish separate industrial relations dispute figures quarterly from 1 July, as yet another indicator of reliability.Lastly, as people vote for these packages, the government obviously will need to be in a position to proceed with the stevedoring levy legislation that is currently before the  parliament. The Labor Party has been opposed to it but we look forward to their support when they see the benefits to the Australian economy of the huge reforms now under way.</DOC>

 - As the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has pointed out, it would help if the member would do some more research and not be led up the garden path by some of his New South Wales contacts. I do not administer this aspect of competition policy. It is in the portfolio of the Treasurer, but I liaise very carefully with the Treasurer and with other ministerial colleagues on what are very important issues.Some 12 months ago, in conjunction with the member for Riverina, who also has a large  rice area in his electorate, I went into bat and arranged for a deferral for 12 months of a $10 million dockage, pending some examination of a report which the New South Wales state government itself had commissioned and which the New South Wales state government has brought forward. At that time, the New South Wales state government accepted the report. It is not my business to reject or accept aspects which involve state legislation, except as they may come forward under aspects relating to competition policy.An arrangement was reached where there would be a deferment for 12 months to allow further and careful consideration of all aspects involved with the rice industry. The rice industry is an outstanding example of a well-organised, export oriented industry successfully exporting to the world, including Riverina rice into Japan at this time, as a consequence of trade negotiation outcomes. We are ensuring that there is further liaison and cooperation.I do not want to see any $10 million dockage take place, but that, of course, is contingent upon some reasonable steps agreed to by stakeholders 12 months ago being advanced. They have not been advanced until 1 May. Steps are being taken to see whether they can be advanced, most notably between now and 30 June so the $10 million dockage does not take place. If the $10 million dockage takes place, it rests on the shoulders of the New South Wales state government and its underwhelming performance on the matter. It is not our decision. It is part of a package of arrangements which it has failed to comply with. I will stick up for the efficient and effective structure of the Australian rice industry.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question, and I know that all members would be conscious that there are many people in our rural communities, farmers in particular, who are experiencing enormous difficulties at the moment. In part, that is because of low commodity prices, in many areas enormously exacerbated by drought - in some cases, it has gone on for five, six and seven years. I know that everyone in this place feels very deeply for those farm families and the communities around them that are so badly affected by the circumstances often over which they have little or no control.Quite apart from the obvious benefits of low interest rates, beating farm inflation and so forth, we have been providing some very valuable, worthwhile and direct assistance. For example, in the time that we have been in government, we have spent well over $200 million on exceptional circumstances relief, firstly, under the drought relief program and now under exceptional circumstances relief payments which see both income support and business support for those hard hit farm families.Under current arrangements, even when the drought breaks, farm families are entitled to a 12-month recovery period, which is a doubling of the old arrangements. I do know that that has been very much appreciated by Queensland farmers because they have been especially hard hit by drought in recent years. At its peak, there were some 10,000 farm families accessing this assistance. Even as we speak, there are 3,000 farm families directly benefiting, including 350 in East Gippsland and some 85 or so in the member for Eden Monaro's seat.Under the government's new Agriculture - Advancing Australia package, there is further assistance for those who are really facing great financial stress. They can access the new program farm family restart, which offers them income support and a voucher which entitles them to have an in-depth business analysis of their operation undertaken. If they find a way forward, if they identify a way forward, they can access further assistance through, for example, property management  planning under Landcare and Farmbis. Alternatively, in those tragic circumstances that do happen, that do bedevil some farm families, they will be assisted in a generous way to re-establish themselves in something else.In addition to that, retirement assistance for farmers is currently being legislated. Some 500 farm families have registered with Centrelink to access that valuable program where more than one generation lives on a farm and needs to be able to access the pension more readily than under existing programs where, of course, it takes them up to five years.Let me say in conclusion that, as another very worthwhile example that strikes at the heart of many concerns in the bush about the withdrawal of services, we have been operating creditcare. Creditcare is a joint government and credit union facility. There are some 39 towns now that have credit unions where they once had banks that have withdrawn. There are many more on the drawing boards. It is a very practical example of a way in which we are able to help with a very real problem in rural Australia.</DOC>

 - The youth allowance policy is based on the principle that people should be given an incentive to prefer training over unemployment. It is based upon the principle that people should be encouraged to stay at school rather than to leave school without the prospect of a job. For too long, the social security system has encouraged people to leave school without knowing whether they had a job in prospect. What we have done is to alter the incentives so that there is either an incentive to stay at school longer or an incentive to go into training.I think the Leader of the Opposition is mistaken when he alleges that people in non-metropolitan areas are going to be disadvantaged. Indeed, there are tens of thousands of Australian families whose children will receive enhanced benefits because of the increased allowances for families where children must be educated away from home. I would invite those members in this parliament who represent regional areas to have a look at the detail and they will find that the great bulk of their constituents who have children in this age cohort will in fact be better off under the government's proposal.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Forde for her question. I had the great satisfaction of visiting her electorate last week and she took me to visit one of the highly successful work for the dole projects. It was a great pleasure to see the young people on that  project and how they had been inspired by the opportunity that work for the dole had offered them. In fact, they had been greatly encouraged by the fact that a number of members of that project had already got jobs in the surrounding community. Work for the dole, I believe, has tapped a very deep chord in the Australian community. People in Australia believe that there is a mutual obligation between those people who are receiving benefits from the community and those people who are working very hard to provide those benefits; and no-one recognises that more than young people themselves.We now have something like 6,500 young participants on work for the dole projects around Australia and 156 projects. Many communities around Australia have received the benefits of these projects. Indeed Raptis Plaza in Surfers Paradise has had an outstanding public mural done by work for the dole participants which has delighted shopping centre managements and passers-by. As one participant said, `It has given me a lot more motivation to go out and get a job and has boosted my morale.'  Members of this House should realise that there would not be work for the dole if it were not for this government. There would not be work for the dole opportunities if it had not been for this government and if it had not been for the leadership of the Prime Minister. It just goes to show how out of touch the Labor Party is. As the Leader of the Opposition has said in the past, and as he is repeating here today by way of interjection, `Well, what about jobs for these young people?' I have now visited many communities and I can tell the Leader of the Opposition that there are a lot of employers - for example, in the member for Ballarat's electorate - who have made it a rule now to only hire young people who have been on work for the dole projects, because they appreciate the attitude and commitment to their community that participants in these projects have shown.The government believes that work for the dole is worthwhile and should be expanded. Over the next four years there will be 100,000 new work for the dole places at a cost of  some $260 million. Submissions for projects over the next six months have already been called for. Some 691 submissions have been received and the government will be announcing the results of these applications in the middle of July.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hughes for her question. I do say to the citizens in her electorate that she is a very strong and effective advocate for small business in particular in the Hughes electorate. We look forward to her continuing strong representation in the next parliament. I was delighted to be down in her electorate the other day and I spoke to a lot of small business people who spontaneously said what a tremendous and effective advocate she is in her community. I tell you what: if that David Hill ever got into the federal parliament, the first thing he would do is take for granted the people who put him in. That is typical of Labor candidates.Anyway, this franchising code is a tremendous step forward for small business. The franchising industry is a $52 billion industry, and that is why this government was committed to ensure that we had a sensible regulatory framework in place for this industry. Our franchising code of conduct will be underpinned by the Trade Practices Act. It comes into operation on 1 July and it means that our code has got real teeth. It really will be an effective means of providing proper protection and a sensible regulatory framework, which is in the interests of everybody in the franchising sector - the many hundreds of franchisors and the tens of thousands of franchisees.The fact is that Labor had a code. It was a voluntary code and, like many things that Labor did, it did not work. It was not effective and we needed, therefore, a parliamentary inquiry - conducted by the member for Bendigo and supported by so many excellent members on this side of the parliament - to come in, look at the problems and make some recommendations so that, for the small business sector, we would have a system that really does work and works effectively. This code comes into effect, as I said, on 1 July, but we have given the industry three months to meet the compliance requirements. So it starts on 1 July and there are some things which immediately come into effect but, in general terms, the compliance comes into effect on 1 October.One thing I want to say about this code is that it does not affect business decisions. I could sum up the code by using the word disclosure - in other words, the focus of this document is on informing people about what they are getting into so they know what they are getting into with their eyes open. That will offset many of the problems that the industry has faced.Labor had 13 years to do something in this area. They never did. This government always gave, and has from the moment we were elected, the highest priority to small business. When this code comes into effect on 1 July, it will be yet another symbol that, when we said we would give small business high priority, we really meant it. We have given it  a fair go, and it is about time this industry had the support at the highest levels of government that it so obviously deserves.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Deakin for his question and his interest. I am actually aware of this. As well as the member for Namadgi making completely fictitious claims about levels of bulk-billing, we also have the Labor Party candidate in Deakin making similar claims. I have here a copy of a letter that has been sent around to households in the electorate that makes a number of quite astonishing claims. Firstly, he is claiming that people in Deakin have less access to Medicare. Secondly, he is saying that fewer doctors are able to provide  bulk-billing because of cuts to rebates. Thirdly, he is saying that we have plans to abolish Medicare. I will not name him because he is eminently forgettable.I will take these three claims on a factual basis one by one. Firstly, the people of Deakin actually have the same or maybe a slightly better access to Medicare than they did two years ago. Deakin has two Medicare offices, in Forest Hill and Ringwood. They are both still functioning very well and we have offered a Medicare claiming facility to a pharmacy on the Maroondah Highway. If they take it up, the electorate of Deakin will actually have greater claiming facilities than they had two years ago. So the first claim is completely fictitious.Secondly, in relation to levels of bulk-billing, I asked the Health Insurance Commission to give me the rate of bulk-billing for general practitioners in Deakin. In March 1996, the rate was 76.2 per cent. In March 1997, it was 77.0 per cent. In March 1998 - the latest figures available - it was 77.9 per cent. So the rate of bulk-billing in Deakin has gone up 1.7 per cent over two years.It is true that Medicare rebates for general practitioners have been increasing at a very slow rate, but that is actually a decision of the previous government. In 1993 the previous government made a decision to only half index GP rebates. The GP schedule fee for a standard consultation is $24.70. If the previous government had kept its promise - and it was a very specific promise - not to discount rebates to pay for the GP strategy, the practice rebate today would be $26 exactly. So general practitioners rebates are $1.30 less today than they would have been otherwise because of a specific decision of the Labor Party while in office. - It is true that in 1996 we had to make a decision to take away half indexation, and that resulted in a 15c reduction. So for the carping, whining interjection from the shadow minister over there, our decision reduced rebates by six-tenths of a per cent; your decision reduced rebates by 5.3 per cent. If there is any effect on GP rebates, it is as a direct result of the decision  you took six years ago. Finally, this whole letter is no more than a tawdry misrepresentation on health. If it is the standard of the campaigning of the Labor Party in Deakin, the current honourable member, Phil Barresi, will have no trouble at all.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker - Opposition members - Oh! - I have responsibility for award simplification -  -  - and I am very happy to advise the House about it. It is surprising that the Labor Party should ask this question, given the fact that back in 1993 Paul Keating himself publicly supported the very concept. - The previous Labor government publicly declared itself as being in favour of the concept of award simplification. They introduced section 150(a) of the Industrial Relations Act 1988 to implement that policy, yet they failed to implement it. Why? Not because it was not a good idea, they publicly declared it to be a good idea. They never implemented it because the ACTU dictated whether or not that policy could in fact be carried out. It took the election of a coalition government to require that process to be completed and to put in place a time frame within which it would happen. As at 30 June the allowable matters of the Workplace Relations Act definition and schema come into place, and as at 1 July if matters are outside of the allowable matters list, they become null and void. Sure, there are a few unions that are complaining about that, and that is exactly as we predicted. The reason we put a timetable in place was that we knew that, unless there was a timetable to make this actually happen, it never would.Lastly, in respect of occupational health and safety matters, these are by and large covered by state regulation and are extensively monitored by state authorities. It is complete nonsense for you to put up the example that you did. Workers in regional areas suffered high unemployment for the years that you were in office, and you treated them with absolute contempt. Even today, when we are trying to put through sensible measures in the  Senate for the benefit of small business to create jobs, the Labor Party having created the problem is up there in the Senate using its numbers to prevent us from implementing a solution. Don't you talk to us about workers in regional areas. -  - You treated them with contempt for 13 years.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Longman for his question. As members would know, the member for Longman has taken a great deal of interest in the actions that have been undertaken by our government to facilitate the security and extension of rail services in Australia. Members would be aware that, along with a private sector company, the Prime Minister participated in an announcement of the possibility of the private sector getting involved in the development of the inland rail bridge. I acknowledge the presence in the gallery of Mr Everald Compton of the Australian Transport and Energy Corridor group, which is one of the principal proposers of this visionary project.Along with that, members would be aware of some of the changes that the Howard-Fischer government has undertaken with regard to underpinning the security of rail in Australia, following the pitiful experience that this country suffered under the Labor Party. For instance, in Tasmania, Tasrail has announced a profit on its rail operations - the first time there has been a profit in rail in Tasmania for 130 years. Tasrail also announced a $12.5 million investment in a new  fleet of locos to haul an increasing level of freight, a 20 per cent increase since it took over in November 1997, as well as new rail wagons that are to be built in Burnie.In South Australia, Great Southern Railways, the private owners of the interstate passenger service, have today announced the extension of the Ghan service from Alice Springs to Melbourne. That, coupled with better marketing of the Ghan, the Indian Pacific and the overland trains, means a boost to regional and outback tourism, which means more jobs in places like Broken Hill, Adelaide, Port Augusta, Kalgoorlie and Alice Springs.It is quite clear that our government is supporting the rebirth of rail in Australia, and this means securing more jobs in other towns such as Pinnaroo and Leigh Creek in South Australia with the development and expansion of the freight services in South Australia. As well as facilitating the rebirth of rail in South Australia and Tasmania, our government is supporting rail right across Australia.We have allocated $100 million towards the Alice Springs to Darwin rail link. We have budgeted $250 million towards the upgrade of the interstate track. We are working with the New South Wales and ACT governments on the very high speed train between Sydney and Canberra. As was announced today, we are working with facilitating the development of the inland rail bridge. Members should contrast this with the appalling legacy left by Labor when in South Australia alone the Labor Party cost 7,000 jobs in the rail industry.</DOC>

 - Thanks for the welcome. As I have said previously about the outside school hours care changes that have been made, they followed a two-year study that was commissioned by the previous government. The design of outside school hours care has been that we wanted to bring in to the net those people who use outside school hours care who previously did not receive the benefit of child care assistance. There are some 51,000 families who will receive child care assistance who previously did not receive that assistance. Because of that change, those families are increasingly seeing outside school hours care, which is a shorter use of the child care system, as being beneficial.That was a study that was commissioned by you. We acted on it. The registration since the commencement of those families who want to use that service, as I have previously said, nearly equals now the full 51,000 that we estimated would be entitled to receive it. In addition, because of the changes that we made, we have provided an additional $20 million to those outside school hours services that need additional assistance to cope with the changes that are taking place. I have to say to you that any of those individual services that have had issues about making the change and informing the parents about those  matters have been provided with individual attention from officers from my department. In common with everybody else in this parliament who have approached my office, we have found that where they have done that most of those services have been able to be attended to and their needs have been met.Let us face the reality about child care assistance. What we want to do in this country is provide choice. We want to provide choice for families to enter into long day care, outside school hours care or before care or vacation care - whatever their choice is. That is something that you ignored when you had the opportunity to address the needs of child care in this country. You allowed unrestrained growth, absolutely unrestrained growth. I come back to the point that I have made previously about child care in this country. If you were genuine about the need that you are now articulating, you would not have supported the legislation I brought to the parliament to make these changes in child care last year and again earlier this year.You are proceeding just as you did with aged care, trying to elevate this issue into a scare campaign. You have done more harm to child care providers in this country by your outrageous scare campaign than any constructive policy considerations of the needs of Australian families. We are addressing their needs. We extended child care assistance to outside school hours care, which previously you did not do anything about. The people who are providing care in this country in child care know that we are the ones who are concerned about the long-term security and future of providers but, more importantly, are providing meaningful and real choice for Australian families.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, I join with you in welcoming members of the parliament of New Zealand visiting Australia. In doing so, I note that the growth rate of tourists from New Zealand is very high. Indeed, it is in the low teens. Ladies and gentlemen, you are most welcome in our country. While you are here, if you have some spare time, I urge you to consider a holiday in this country and, in particular, in the seat of Eden-Monaro, not far from the capital city of Canberra where we sit now. - It is one of those parts of Australia where on the same day you can catch yellowfin tuna and ski some of the best ski fields in the Southern Hemisphere. In the last couple of days the member for Eden-Monaro and I, when meeting a delegation of tourism leaders from his electorate, discussed the third of the three great initiatives the Howard-Fischer government has taken to deliver to the tourism industry both the support it needs in a time of some difficulty and also the opportunity to prosper in the years hence. This is the government's national action plan for tourism, which I announced last week in Melbourne. It is a road map for the tourism industry for the future, divided largely into three sections: dealing with the selling and promoting of Australia; dealing with the sorts of measures we have to undertake in government to make it a more competitive industry; and the sorts of measures, likewise, across all portfolios to better prepare people working in enterprises in the tourism industry to prosper in the future.The tourism industry has opportunities; it also has threats. One of those threats is a party that wants to strengthen the role of trade unions in small business. Nothing could be  more pernicious for people seeking to prosper in the tourism industry. Likewise, there are people in the political arena who would do other things or put forward policies that would give the impression beyond our borders that we do not welcome people from overseas. Nothing could be further from the truth.</DOC>

 - I am very pleased that the member for Hotham has asked a question on industry, because it is the first since November 1997. He had to find one very small area, which the government has moved towards -  - Mr Speaker, I will repeat what I said before: it is the first question asked by the member for Hotham, as opposition spokesman for industry, to the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism since 1997. - That is not a bad effort for your interest in industry. The government is concerned that there are some areas of industry which are subject to negative assistance, and some parts of the printing area have been subject to negative assistance. As a consequence of that, the department and I are currently working on a submission in that very area.</DOC>

 - If lifelong learning is going to be a reality, it has to be a reality for all Australians. One of the unfortunate consequences of the failure of the previous government to expand educational opportunity was that many Australians came out of schooling without the fundamental literacy and numeracy skills. As the member for Sydney has admitted on a number of occasions now, the 70 per cent of students who were not going from school to university were neglected, and there were insufficient opportunities offered through the apprenticeship system because the trade union movement was keen to put in place an apprenticeship system under its control.This government has given priority to building a ladder to better skills and better education for all Australians. We have done that through literacy and numeracy. We have done it particularly through the area of post-secondary education. Since 1995 one of the  great achievements of this government has been that the number of young people doing vocational education in schools has increased from 26,000 to 110,000 - an increase of 88,000 opportunities for those young people neglected by the previous government. There are now more than two million Australians in post-secondary education - since 1995 an increase of 110,000. That includes some 62,000 in new apprenticeships, some 40,000 additional people in TAFE and some 51,000 extra in Australian universities.This government is committed to educational opportunity. It is committed to building the ladder for all Australians, whether they are going on to university or not, to lift the level of their skills and to provide a firm foundation for lifelong learning so they can have careers which will maintain them jobs in a highly competitive world. This is one of the great achievements of this government, and it remedies a very serious failure of the previous Labor government.</DOC>

I can say that the purpose of all of those meetings was to achieve the government's objective of reforming the waterfront consistent with the laws of the country.</DOC>

 - The most interesting point that ought to be made about this whole proposal is the extraordinary backflip of the Leader of the Opposition between his performance last night on the 7.30 Report  when he said, `If Everald can get his rail link up, that is cool, that is great, all strength to his right arm,' and this morning when Senator Bolkus, one of his senior shadow ministers, went on Adelaide radio and slammed the proposal that was announced yesterday. He slammed it, he attacked it, he said it was a crazy proposal; and he attacked the government for supporting the proposal.This is what the Leader of the Opposition had to say this morning when he had been brought into line by none other than Senator Bolkus. I know Senator Bolkus has run amok on native title inside the Labor Party, but I do not see why he should be allowed to run amok on this issue. This is the advice that he would have given to Mr Compton if he had been approached:I ain't going to be launching yer and even if I do so, it is a good thing you're doing it and would you just please hold hard, hold your horses, until we have got this other scheme on our plates.In other words, last night, full steam ahead; this morning, after Senator Bolkus had intervened and said, `No, we don't like that,' the Leader of the Opposition has done a monumental backflip.This is barely surprising from the party that had 13 years to commit itself to the Darwin to Alice Springs railway. We all remember that memorable commitment of Bob Hawke - and his words will be ringing in the ears of every South Australian member in this house - when he said, `I promise you that only the Labor government can be trusted to build the Alice Springs to Darwin line.' For 13 years the Leader of the Opposition's party had an opportunity to do something. We are the first government since Federation to commit the taxpayers' dollars to the construction of the Darwin to Alice Springs railway, and the decisions about future rail investment in this country will ultimately be made by investors and by consumers.The Leader of the Opposition does his reputation no good by saying one thing on the 7.30 Report last night and saying another thing this morning. He has got one foot in Adelaide and one foot in Queensland. Last night, it was full steam ahead on the proposal; this morning, now that Senator Bolkus has said no, he has got a completely different tack. It is old Mr Flip-Flop as the Leader of the Opposition once again on the public horizon.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Swan for his question. The World Economic Forum global competitiveness survey, which was released this month, shows that Australia has risen from 17th to 14th in terms of world competitiveness. The World Economic Forum noted that competitiveness is not a volatile phenomena subject to arbi  trary change but the product of well-conceived economic programs. - It is the importance of Australian institutions and Australian economic performance that is leading to Australia becoming a more competitive place in the world in which to do business. This follows a recent Institute for Management Development survey showing Australia's ranking moving up from 18th to 15th. Last night, a number of my colleagues and I had dinner with the board of the Australian Stock Exchange, which told us last night that the Australian Stock Exchange is now the second highest capitalised stock exchange outside of Tokyo in the region. - The US technometric reports of global equity management centres found that Sydney has now replaced Hong Kong as the second biggest equity market in the Asia-Pacific after Tokyo. It has long been a goal of this government to turn Australia into a regional financial centre, to make this the second largest regional financial centre outside of Tokyo in the Asia-Pacific region. In relation to improvements in competitiveness, in relation to the fiscal position, in relation to interest rates and in relation to institutional reform, Australia is now becoming one of the best places to do business in the world, certainly in the region.Yesterday, this parliament passed a final part of legislation to introduce a totally new system for the financial regulation of superannuation, banking and other deposit taking institutions in this country. This is groundbreaking reform, leading edge, world class reform, with the introduction of the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority with the new Australian Securities and Investments Commission with new prudential consumer focused regulation which will drive Australia  further to take on the challenge to become the great regional financial centre. That, coupled with this government's proposed reforms to the taxation system, will be good for Australian business and good for Australian jobs.These are the important reforms that will drive the Australian economy into the future. They take leadership. They take concern. They take dedicated hard work. They take a determination to eschew empty populism to get firm results - firm results for Australian business and firm results for employment in this country.</DOC>

It has never been the motivation of my government to destroy unions, but it was the motivation of the MUA to destroy the Patrick company, and that was known throughout the whole of this dispute. The member for Hotham can ask as many questions as he chooses to. The fact remains that we were committed to waterfront reform. We were committed to doing it within the laws of Australia. Indeed, a large amount of waterfront reform has been achieved.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. He would note, as I have noted, that not only does business in this country support tax reform but the Australian Council of Social Service also supports tax reform. We welcome the fact that the Australian Council of Social Service has entered the tax reform debate, a debate which the Labor Party is incapable of entering because it is incapable of delivering any policy. - I hear the member for Jagajaga interject. I was hoping that she would because she got up here in this parliament and asked a question on Monday of the Prime Minister about the effect of broad based indirect tax and a goods and services tax on married pensioners and wealthy couples. She referred to research from ACOSS, which notes a price effect of any changes in relation to indirect tax. She said to the Prime Minister, `Wouldn't it be a terrible thing?' I interjected at the time, an interjection which she denied, that the research on which she relied, which she did not have the decency to disclose, was instructed to model all changes on the basis that there had been no compensation to any pension involved.What do you think you get from a piece of research when you say, `Model a tax change without any effect on a pension as a result'? What do you expect to get? At least ACOSS had the decency to say in its report, which the scaremongering shadow minister did not have the decency to say, `No attempt was made to model compensation for low income households.'Let me ask the scaremongering shadow minister this question: when the Labor Party  introduced a two per cent increase in wholesale sales tax after the 1993 election when it took one rate from 10 per cent to 12 per cent, what compensation was there? When the Labor Party increased the wholesale sales tax from the 20 per cent rate to the 22 per cent rate, what compensation was there? When the Labor Party took away the l-a-w income tax cuts, what compensation was there? When the Labor Party increased the price of the excise on leaded and unleaded fuel, what compensation was there?We have a Labor Party that, in government, had no compunction whatsoever about increasing taxes without compensation. We get these little scaremongering cameos wandering in with the ACOSS research, not reading out the particular assumptions on which it is done, as part of some kind of attempt by the socialist left of the Labor Party to join forces with economic Hansonism.There are some people in the Labor Party who still think about economic issues. The last dinosaur in the Labor Party prepared to talk about economic issues was the member for Werriwa. Do you remember him? We do. He was removed from any involvement in the economic policy of the Australian Labor Party because he used to make Crean, Evans and co. look bad. Alan Wood summed it up in the Australian on 22 November 1997. I quote:One of Labor's bright young hopes, Mark Latham, has been heard to remark to colleagues: `Oppositions are allowed to be irresponsible.' But the last word belongs to a former Labor minister in the Hawke and Keating governments who confided his alarm that Labor might actually win the next election. `We could never govern,' he said, `with policies like these.'Well, ain't that the truth, Mr Speaker.</DOC>

 - I suggest that the Leader of the Opposition should wait until he sees the totality of the taxation package before he makes assumptions about fairness. What we do know is that his notion of fairness is to introduce his own GST without compensation. We know that his notion of fairness is to campaign in an election against a GST and then, immediately after the election, having won office on opposition to a GST and on the basis of a scurrilous reduction in personal income tax, after you are in office, without any further reference to the Australian people, to introduce your own GST and, for good measure and rubbing the noses of the poor in the dirt, without any compensation. We know that is fairness a la Beazley. I think the Australian people will have an opportunity, when the tax package comes out, to compare fairness a la the coalition with fairness a la Beazley, as demonstrated in the past.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Page for his question. I am aware of a dishonest and irresponsible campaign over Commonwealth funding for government schools currently being mounted by the New South Wales Teachers Federation. Their mouthpiece in this House, of course, is the member for Werriwa. The New South Wales Teachers Federation has embarked on what the Sydney Morning Herald  in an editorial last Thursday described as a series of transparent political stunts in its campaign to misrepresent the nature of Commonwealth support for schooling in New South Wales.It is worth making the point that this is the union that opposes literacy standards, that opposes proper reporting to parents, that prevents and opposes schools proactively helping school leavers to get jobs and has an abiding hatred of the right of parents to choose the school which best suits their child.Last week, the union made the outrageous claim that 42 non-government schools in New South Wales were receiving the same amount of Commonwealth funding as 478 government schools. Let me put firmly on the record that this is absolutely and totally false. The union, in making this outrageous claim, compared the funding for government schools from one specific government program - formerly the disadvantaged schools program, now absorbed into the overall literacy program - with total funding for non-government schools. In other words, it compared one fraction of the Commonwealth funding for government schools with the total funding which the government provides to these non-government schools.The facts are these: government schools in New South Wales this year will be receiving $520 million from the Commonwealth in direct funding, almost $50 million more than they received in the last year of the previous Labor government. What the Commonwealth is doing for government schools is not just about money. We have implemented the first national literacy plan, a series of initiatives to build quality in schooling, school based  apprenticeships and the jobs pathway program.Last week, the union irresponsibly called a two-hour strike to promote its untruths. This union is setting out with the Labor Party to damage and talk down government schools and parents' faith in government schooling. It is seeking to erode public support for government schooling by its untruthful campaign. This government will continue to fight for quality education for all Australian children and will defend the right of parents, particularly low income parents, to choose their own schools.</DOC>

 - The honourable gentleman will have to wait a little longer until the government's entire tax package is released. Let me simply say one thing about sport: one of the government's highest priorities in sport is to remove cheating through any measures we can take to combat the use of drugs. The same principle applies to the approach we take to the tax system. We want to eliminate tax cheats, and the biggest tax cheat this country has ever known is the Australian Labor Party for what you did in 1993. - </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for McEwen for her question. It is a timely question and it points to the practical breakthroughs we have achieved for hard-pressed exporters, including small business agricultural exporters. I want to add that I commend and congratulate the members of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Primary Industries, Resources and Rural and Regional Affairs from both sides of the House - including the member for McEwen, who is the chair of that committee - for their recent report entitled Adjusting to agricultural trade reforms: Australia no longer down under . It is an excellent report with some very interesting recommendations.Trade reform has flowed from many representations over the years, including at the bilateral, regional and multilateral level. The federal coalition government spoke as late as this morning with the Europeans. Under our stewardship, we have emphasised a much more balanced approach, with a lot more energy in the bilaterals and a lot more focus on actual breakthroughs for small exporters.As a consequence, I am pleased to inform the House that Australia's rice is now going to Japan. Australia's rice producers can now look forward to more advantageous tender conditions, partially arising from a meeting between prime ministers Howard and Hashimoto a few months back. Agreement has also been reached for trial shipments of four varieties of Australian citrus into the Japanese markets, which I know the member for Mallee will be interested in. We have secured improved access for Australian seafood and lower tariffs for Australian sugar.For Mexico, there has been the Canola breakthrough, the coal breakthrough and the  wool breakthrough, but also Australia's exports of livestock have shown strong increase following agreement by Mexico for more practical protocols to apply with regard to livestock imports. I commend my colleague the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy for his role on that. Also, in respect of Korea, there has been a very important breakthrough. For years, we have been held up on one key non-tariff measure in respect of Australian UHT milk. Negotiations have now led to the removal of the mandatory prescribed shelf-life and its replacement with one which is more reasonable and uniform. That is a breakthrough for the Australian dairy industry and it is good for jobs in the electorate of McEwen. In Saudi Arabia, negotiations have seen the reduction in the tariff on Australian exports of dairy products to Saudi Arabia from 12 per cent to zero per cent, providing new opportunities for Australian cheese and milk exporters.I want to say that that does not underestimate two things. Firstly, there is no such thing as a level playing field, and I have maintained that in a clear-cut way over my many years of being involved in the trade portfolio. Secondly, through dint of hard work a good deal of progress has been made. I note that page 25 of the committee report that I have has been highlighted. That page deals with Australian citrus production and exports, and it states that exports have tripled over recent years in the course of this decade. Full credit goes to the citrus industry for getting their exports up in difficult circumstances. Another page highlighted is page 116 of the report where it states that, through networking, Riversun Pty Ltd - involving citrus producers from Wakefield, the Riverina, Farrer and elsewhere - have now reached the stage where they are doing counter-cyclical, counter-seasonal exports to the USA with great success. They are putting more jobs into the Australian citrus industry, including the processing industry.I congratulate the small agribusinesses that have taken the export plunge. I will have more to say about the practical ways that the government is helping further. I commend the committee's report as being an extremely  useful document. Given the fact that we produce five times more than we can consume, the report highlights why exports are important to the standard of living of all Australians, including for the future wellbeing of Australian farmers.</DOC>

 - It is very interesting that the Labor Party says that when you introduce a measure that will increase benefits for 153,000 young people in rural Australia that amounts to none. That shows the priorities of the Australian Labor Party. This measure will result in 153,000 young people gaining, and the great bulk of those in regional areas of Australia. Youth allowance recipients in rural and remote areas who have to live away from home to study or to seek work will be eligible for the higher away from home rate, which is $265.50 a fortnight for a single person. The away from home rate for 16- and 17-year olds has been increased to match that of those aged 18 or more, recognising that they face the same costs of living away from home as older students.Youth allowance recipients will now also be eligible for increased income support through access to rent assistance. Some young people will also be eligible for remote area allowance. Full-time tertiary students from rural and remote areas who receive youth allowance at the away from home rate may also receive assistance to travel from their homes to their place of study. For families with two or more tertiary students living away from home, the income limits for maximum youth allowance will be increased by no less than $7,400.This youth allowance measure not only brings great benefits to families in rural and regional Australia but also rebalances the incentives away from the current incentives for people to be on the dole in favour of incentives for people to be in training or to remain at school. That is a wholly desirable social development, and it is not surprising that it should be strongly supported by the coalition parties and strongly opposed by the Australian Labor Party. To rebalance the incentives in favour of training and school and against unemployment and being on the dole is a very worthy objective; and into the bargain we have provided increased assistance for people in remote and regional Australia - all round, a first-class package for the young of Australia and for their families.</DOC>

I want to repeat the assurances that I gave at the weekend and again in the House earlier this week. On the score of retail outlets - and Mrs Davidson is the operator of one of those retail outlets - between 1989-90 and 1995-96 the total number of postal retail outlets fell by 277. I am very happy to say  that in the 2¼ years that the coalition has been in government that trend has been reversed and there has been in that period an increase in total of 151 retail outlets. I say this very respectfully to the member: if you operate on the basis that action speaks louder than rhetoric, she has a lot more assurance by supporting the coalition than any alternative.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Bendigo for his question. I think the statistic that was just announced to the House by the Prime Minister gives a very clear example of how our policies are benefiting regional Australia. Bendigo, like many other communities in regional Australia, is benefiting from coalition policies that are unashamedly targeting regional Australia - policies such as the Natural Heritage Trust fund, the Federation fund, the Agriculture - Advancing Australia fund, the regional telecommunications infrastructure fund, the $1.62 billion on roads in this year's budget; and the regional assistance program, to which this year's budget allocated $33 million to regional Australia, which was an increase of $13 million over the previous year.These policies and these outcomes for regional Australia are quite significant, and we are showing regional Australia quite clearly that we are committed to seeing a growth in their economic fortunes and also a growth in jobs in regional Australia. The question was from the member for Bendigo. It is interesting to note that between 1994 and 1998 there has been a 24 per cent reduction in unemployment in the area of Bendigo in Victoria, in large part due to the policies of the Howard-Fischer government which are unashamedly targeted at assisting regional Australia.It is interesting to note on the issue of roads that the Labor Party, when they put together the national highways system, ignored that  part of Victoria. They did not include the Calder Highway and the national highway system. We have acknowledged that in our policy on roads and we have included the Calder Highway in the roads of national importance. The Labor Party do not have a policy on roads of national importance in regional Australia. The Labor Party have not got that in their platform. The Labor Party cannot stand up and say, `We are supporting regional Australia in this area.' We have committed $75 million to the Calder Highway, which services that part of Victoria.What about black spots? We reintroduced the black spots program, which has seen over 800 road safety black spots addressed in Australia already. But, most importantly, the government's policy of getting interest rates down and keeping them down is the most important benefit that we can give to regional Australia. It is the most important thing we can do for regional Australia and, in particular, for those people who live and work in Bendigo - those small business people, their employees, their primary producers and their exporters.The most important thing we can do is to have policies that keep interest rates down and maintain them at that low rate. What is Labor's answer for regional Australia? Labor's answer is to maintain and protect an antiquated tax system and to have a policy of high interest rates, and that equals fewer jobs. Yesterday in the MPI the member for Hotham said -  - Yesterday the member for Hotham in the MPI on regional Australia said  that Labor was capable of producing budget surpluses. - The question was about regional Australia and the policies of the government of low interest rates. We are maintaining policies of lower interest rates, which is helping everybody in regional Australia. The Labor Party does not have a policy which sustains low interest rates.</DOC>

I begin by saying that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition takes great delight in saying that Asia  will affect the Australian economy. It takes great delight -  - right on cue, the um -  - I have warned him about this before. -  - Right on cue, the Leader of the Opposition engages in his psychobabble. - Psychobabble followed by exaggerated laughter. I remind him of his Deputy Leader's criticism of the government in the Australian  on 13 October 1997. - This is what the Deputy Leader of the Opposition said on 13 October 1997:A Beazley government would hitch a harness to the demand being generated offshore, particularly in the Asian region, which was something the federal government was failing to properly achieve.Thailand had gone into an IMF program two months before. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition then asked me about the MTIA quarterly business survey. - I have the MTIA survey of 24 June 1998 here. I have actually read it. I want to read to the House what it says:Pressure mounts on Australian manufacturing. Toughness and weakness of market conditions in the turbulent wake of the Asian economic crisis. -  - Listen to this:Manufacturing is losing in the competitiveness stakes and there is no option if we wish to preserve these great industries in Australia but to continue to push for further reform starting with the tax system.So what does the MTIA say? The MTIA says that the thing you can really do for us is tax reform. What does the Labor Party say? The Labor Party says that the thing we don't want to do is have tax reform. This Labor Party stands against everything that could possibly help the MTIA or business in Australia. They can stand up here and read all of this report except for these words. Burn them indelibly in your mind. The policies of Hansonism are now being pursued by the Leader of the Opposition - vacuous, economic populism. He should burn into his mind this phrase, and this is from the report itself. - As a clear reading of Hansard  will show, the question was about the MTIA national survey of business conditions on 24 June 1998, and in the first paragraph the MTIA had one piece of advice for the government and the opposition. I read it again. I ask those people in the Labor Party who are embarrassed about their position to note it. It says:Manufacturing is losing in the competitiveness stakes and there is no option if we wish to preserve these great industries in Australia but to continue the push for further reform starting with the tax system.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Groom for his question. Mr Speaker, this morning, the Deputy Prime Minister, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy and I had the opportunity to meet with the Vice President of the European Commission, Sir Leon Brittan, in what are the 15th annual Australia-European Commission ministerial consultations.These talks were extremely successful. It was an opportunity for the government to continue the task of revitalising Australia's relationship with the European Union. We are revamping and rebuilding the relationship with the European Union. I believe, following the signing this time last year of the joint declaration on relations between Australia and the European Union and the initiatives that have flowed from that, as well as today's meetings, that the relationship is going through a period of substantial strengthening.Mr Speaker, let me just make sure that everybody understands the importance of this relationship to Australia. Europe, the European Union, invests $155 billion in the Australian economy. Some people are opposed to  foreign investment in Australia, but that $155 billion worth of investment creates 300,000 jobs in Australia. That is money worth having and they are jobs well worth having.Australia invests, in direct investment in Europe, about $24 billion, and we earn about $500 million a year from that. Over the last year our exports to the European Union grew by around 21 per cent. So, Mr Speaker, the economic relationship is extremely strong. Our exports are growing strongly to the European Union.Where there have been disputes in the past over climate change, those disputes have been resolved. Where there have been disputes over agriculture, there still are tensions, but we are heading in the right direction. So this is a relationship which is growing and strengthening all the time.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, the question, of course, is based on the fact that everyone has forgotten the history because, between 1989 and 1993 -  - Between 1989 and 1993, the Labor Party rubbed out 200,000 jobs in the manufacturing sector alone. - As I was saying, Mr Speaker, between the period 1989 and 1993, some 200,000 jobs were lost by the Labor Party in the manufacturing sector. This contrasts with the government's record since March 1996 of creating new jobs in the order of 250,000 across the whole economy. I draw that contrast because this government has worked on economic policy in a way in which you never could and never did. - Mr Speaker, what I was pointing out was that the Labor Party lost 200,000 jobs but, since we have come to government, because of our pursuit of economic policy, because we have moved to balance the books, we have got interest rates down and we have got inflation down. You have seen high rates of growth in Australia up to this present moment. As a consequence of that, 250,000 have been found. As a consequence of the government's process on policy development -  - As I was saying before the hurt was hitting the Leader of the Opposition, the government's record has been particularly good in job creation since we came to office. That came about because of the policies we have been pursuing. In relation to that, as we press on with further reforms - as the Treasurer said with the announcement of tax reform which will be good for manufacturing and which will be good for jobs - we will show you and show the Labor Party the record that you really have in relation to employment.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Canning for her question in relation to the issue of illegal entrants who may be in Australia and who may be working in the Australian community. I would like to put before the House some of the changes that have occurred and the manner in which these  issues are being addressed, but also to make it very clear that this is one area in which there is often a good deal of misrepresentation and myth about the size and the extent of the problem in Australia. From time to time I have heard it alleged that 400,000 people are illegally in one suburb of Sydney. - That is not one of the suburbs I have heard about. We do have a very accurate picture of the extent to which such a problem exists because we have a universal visa system which enables us to see which people have entered Australia and remain here, and we are able to log them off against those who have in fact left. We estimate that there are around 50,000 people illegally here at any one time. There would be another group of people who are here illegally and who may have made applications and would be counted in addition.I want to make this point very clear: we do encourage bona fide travel to Australia of visitors, students and temporary entrants. There is a small percentage of visitors who come, overstay and work. We have changed the program quite significantly in relation to the way in which these issues are addressed. No longer are we putting our compliance resources into employer awareness; we have in fact put in place a proactive policy of location. During the government's first year in office, the locations have increased by 30 per cent - up from 7,800 in 1995-96 to 10,138 in 1996-97. The locations have jumped again in 1997-98, to 11,600, and it is estimated that this year it will be in the vicinity of 13,000. These measures are complemented by a range of initiatives which include following up refusal decisions, data matching, information provided by the community and police referrals. It is an important part of our approach to ensuring that the immigration program is conducted with integrity.On 28 May I outlined some other measures that we took dealing with the need for integrity in this area. I quoted the honourable member for Lalor from a book that had recently been written by a Mr Paul Sheehan. That evidenced some agreement that there was a need for a proactive approach in this area.  After I read that quote, the honourable member made a personal explanation. He had this to say:. . . [This] is a significant misrepresentation. The author at no time sought to check the accuracy of the words attributed to me and featured last Saturday . . .. . .             . . .             . . .The words attributed to me are a very rough paraphrase of what I said. As quoted, they completely misrepresent my position.The honourable member may not have seen it today, but there was an article in the Sydney Morning Herald . - It says -  - I am sure honourable members would be interested to hear from you later -  - If you have any disagreement in relation to this issue - And, if you do, I would value your further comments by way of personal explanation later on. - Because I think it is important -  - I think it is important -  - I think it is important when the issues are -  - I look to the personal explanation by the member and the addressing of the seven points made in the article.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for McMillan for his question. I can indicate that I and my colleagues in government recognise the close association that the member for McMillan has, along with the member for Gippsland, with this issue and how they continually bring forward rural issues generally. As the Prime Minister indicated, the member for Gippsland is currently travelling in the flood affected area, his electorate, where a state of emergency was  declared last night by the Victorian government.I think it is important at this point to indicate to the House the extent of this damage. There are record flooding levels in East Gippsland in Orbost, Lakes Entrance and the Paynesville area. Several of the areas in that region have become isolated due to floodwaters. There have also been some significant wind storms associated with the heavy rains, and that has damaged homes and knocked down trees. In addition to that, the stock losses are expected to be very high because many farmers have been unable to move their stock to higher ground due to the swiftness of the rising water.Perhaps most importantly - and, again, the Prime Minister indicated this - as a result of the region having been subjected to an extended drought period over the past 3½ years, a huge amount of land degradation has taken place. What has occurred is that topsoil has been lost and river banks have been eroded - that is enormous and follows on from the drought. The member for Gippsland has indicated only just this morning that particularly hard hit is the Omeo Valley.We have noted, and appreciate very much, that some 500 state emergency services staff and volunteers have been out attempting to combat the floods and storm damage. They have worked tirelessly, saving lives and saving property over the last several days, and we are all grateful for that particular effort. As I indicated, last night the Victorian Premier announced a state of emergency and indicated that he would do whatever it takes to assist the residents.I think it is important to indicate briefly what the Commonwealth role is in cases of natural disaster. We provide assistance on a dollar for dollar basis when each of the states and territories exceed a threshold. At a certain point, over another threshold, we provide some $3 for every $1 the states provide. Specifically, the Commonwealth will reimburse Victoria for 50 per cent of all outlays in relation to the provision of personal hardship and distress relief. That includes emergency food, clothing, accommodation and  home re-establishment grant	Debate interrupted.We will provide 50 per cent of expenditure in relation to psychological counselling relief. We will provide 50 per cent of expenditure incurred in the repair and restoration of essential public assets. That includes roads, railways, schools, hospitals and government buildings. We will provide concessional loans to the Victorian government on very favourable terms, with concessional interest rates if they wish to on-lend to persons for home rebuilding, for voluntary non-profit bodies - such as churches, et cetera - and for farmers and small businesses who are unable to obtain commercial finance.I conclude by saying, as has already been indicated in the House today, that the cruelty of natural disaster visits our communities from time to time and governments must respond. It reminds us of that vulnerability that this nation is subjected to through those adverse weather conditions that visit us all too frequently. I note that, earlier this year, the Northern Territory had a problem with flooding in Katherine. Only last week, we paid out $28 million to the Northern Territory government and we anticipate that $42 million will be paid from Commonwealth funds to the Northern Territory. That is on top of the rescue package announced by the Prime Minister at the time of approximately $10 million to assist individual families and to assist in the repair of the national highway. Governments must respond and ensure that, when communities are in trouble, we are there to assist wherever possible.</DOC>

 - This week is described as Treatment Works Week and tomorrow is the International Day Against Drug Abuse. I indulge myself by saying to the member for Grey and to all other members of the parliament that the resolve of my government to contribute $100 million to the construction of the Darwin to Alice Springs railway remains undiminished. I also remind the House that I am the first Prime Minister since Federation to honour a promise to build that railway, in contrast to the dishonoured commitment of many of my Labor predecessors.This week, drug treatment and prevention agencies across Australia will be celebrating the effectiveness of treatment in reducing drug problems. The major new development to celebrate in Australia this year is the government's $190 million Tough on Drugs strategy. This strategy is designed to increase the accessibility of treatment and education programs to the community as well as stepping up the fight against the illicit drug trade.Just a few weeks ago, the health minister announced that community and non-government organisations should consider applying for funding under the strategy. The non-government organisation treatment grant program will fund non-government organisations to establish and operate new services for treating illicit drug problems, with an emphasis on filling geographic gaps in the coverage of existing services. A total of $27.7 million has been allocated.The focus of the community partnership initiative is on prevention and the reduction of the use of illicit drugs by young people, and $4.4 million has been allocated. The guidelines for these programs have been  developed by the government's new Australian National Council on Drugs, headed by Major Brian Watters of the Salvation Army.I conclude by mentioning briefly some discussion that occurred in the press last weekend about the possibility of heroin trials being conducted in Victoria. The comment was made that there should be a national approach in relation to these matters and that a heroin trial should not be conducted by one jurisdiction in isolation from other jurisdictions. As far as the Commonwealth government is concerned, we remain resolutely opposed to any heroin trials.</DOC>

 - It is very interesting that the member for Kingsford-Smith should refer to Mr Mansfield's speech, because one of the areas of instability to which Mr Mansfield referred in his speech was the obstructive tactics of the opposition in the Senate. Many Australians find it very strange that a government with a majority of 44 in the House of Representatives should be prevented, through the obstructive, negative tactics of the Labor Party, the Australian Democrats and the Australian Greens, from passing very important government legislation.I have made it very clear in the past and I make it clear again: as leader of the Liberal Party and as Prime Minister, I will be in coalition with only one party, and that is the  National Party of Australia. I am very proud of the association that my party has with the National Party. We have brought quality government to this country, as we have done to various states. Over the days ahead, as the implications of the Queensland election sink in, many people who voted for the One Nation Party will say to themselves, `We didn't really intend to elect a Labor government and perhaps we'll think again.'</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hinkler for his question. He comes from an export zone of excellence and several companies are eligible under the EMDG scheme in his area. They are all helping to create jobs from exports, and some 204,000 in the direction of the electorate of Hinkler.Let me confirm to the House that next week around 900 cheques will go out under the export market development grants scheme finalisation of arrangements for this financial year. I am pleased to announce that prudent management of the scheme has resulted in a full 100 per cent payout of the entitlements relevant to successful processed applicants. Also, for the first time ever, the tourism industry is getting a full rate of payment from the export market development grants scheme. In fact, there is some $20 million for the tourist industry. -  - Some interjections from the frontbench would indicate how little they know about this scheme. - Yes, we did. We cut out some of the categories - like the one that saw a lady in Melbourne lift $500,000 out of the scheme without exporting one container.  She did export herself to gaol. Let me tell you about another one. What about Labor's second cousin clause in the scheme? The second cousin clause allowed second, third, fourth, fifth and sixth cousins of exporters at the other end of the market overseas to come to Australia at taxpayers' expense and abuse the scheme. As a result, we cracked down on the abuse of the scheme that your sloppy management allowed for. So don't give me any cheek about cutting back the scheme.We have an efficient and effective scheme that has overseen the performance of the export market development grants this year. Businesses are going to receive the assistance more quickly. The scheme is being run more efficiently. The grants are generating more exports per grant dollar for Australia than ever before. The export to grants ratio, which in 1996 was 30 to one, will rise to 36 to one this year. The results will also allow me to raise the initial payment for next year's grants from $50,000 to $60,000, giving approximately 200 additional businesses their full grants at the time of assessment without having to wait for distribution at the end of the year. We reformed the scheme. We have made it an effective scheme. We cut out the areas of abuse which Labor perpetrated.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Kingston for her question and can inform the House that there was a strong rise in ABS job vacancies in the June quarter following strong rises in the previous two quarters and supporting a strong outlook for firm employment growth for Australia generally and, I am sure, for Kingston as well. Job vacancies rose 8.8 per cent over the three months to May, well above market expectations, which were for a fall of 3.5 per cent.Total job vacancies are at their highest level in the history of the series, 28 per cent higher than a year ago in seasonally adjusted terms. This has been led by strong vacancies in the private sector, with private sector vacancies also at their highest level in the series, 32 per cent higher than a year ago. The trend measure of job vacancies also rose strongly, the eleventh consecutive quarterly increase. The other major job vacancies series remains supportive of solid employment growth in the coming months, with both DEETYA and ANZ around their highest levels in the last three years.I should say that, when you are talking about employment growth and creating the right conditions for employment growth, it is important that you lock in low inflation, as this government has. It is important that you have a good interest rate regime, which this government has. Supportive of that is a strong budget position, which the government has also taken steps to address. We would not have had the low interest rates for home buyers in Kingston if we had not been able to address the Labor Party's $10 billion deficit.I would also say that it is important that we continue to look at labour market reforms such as the unfair dismissal laws that the  minister for industrial relations has introduced, because the less the burden in relation to employment and the less the drag on employers creating jobs, the greater the opportunity for creating more jobs, and that is good news for more Australians.</DOC>

 - Let me take the opportunity of saying to those people that they have absolutely nothing to be concerned about from our tax package. Their position will be fully protected. Indeed, the low income people of Australia will be amongst the people who are supported by this tax package, and I would counsel them not to be disturbed by the fearmongering dishonesty of those who sit opposite. You continue to practise the discredited old politics of running a dishonest fear campaign. All I can say is, `Go on doing it. Make our political day.' - The question is as dishonest as the fear campaign. I say again to those who sit opposite and to the Australian public: we will unveil the tax policy. It will be a fair tax policy. It will remove the inequities of  Labor's system. It is very interesting that the member for Melbourne Ports used the word `collusion' in a question that he asked me. Let me say this: the only collusion going on in Australian politics at the moment is between the Australian Labor Party and One Nation to stop Australian battlers have a fairer tax system.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Indi for his question. Expanding opportunities for young people, particularly young people in rural and regional Australia, is, of course, a top priority of this government. I know of the member for Indi's commitment to educational opportunities for young people in his electorate.The government has put in place comprehensive measures to ensure that young Australians in rural areas do not miss out on the expanding education and training opportunities that this government has put in place. Last week, I announced that $525,000 would be provided by the government for the Rural Youth Information Service in 1998-99, and this service provides information to young people on education and training opportunities in regional and rural Australia.It is interesting to note the tremendous increase in the take up of rural traineeships by young people in regional Australia. Last year, the number of regional youth in traineeships jumped some 65 per cent. It is also important to note that access to regional universities is rising quite significantly. In fact, the enrolments at regional universities are growing much more rapidly than enrolments in universities across Australia generally. Student numbers in regional universities last year were up by 7,000, and this is a particularly rapid growth. Perhaps I should also make the point  that this government has looked at the capital needs of regional universities, and 13 out of the 20 grants from the capital development pool have gone to universities in regional Australia.The Prime Minister made the point yesterday that the youth allowance is going to be very significant in opening opportunities for young people in country Australia. I draw attention particularly to the fact that, for the first time, students aged between 16 and 25 will be able to get rent assistance, up to $74.50 per fortnight - and 70,000 young Australians will benefit from this feature of the youth allowance. Probably most of those, certainly a great many of them, will be in regional and remote Australia.Finally, last week I announced that the government would be establishing a national youth round table, and 50 young Australians between the ages of 15 and 24 will be coming together to advise the government on youth issues. The government will make particularly sure that the youth at this round table are representative of regional Australia and that the bush is fully heard in the round table consultations. The coalition is making sure that opportunities for regional youth are continuing to expand, and it has an outstanding record in this regard.</DOC>

 - Both in opposition and in government, I have met on a number of occasions with that particular organisation. But let me just say that the government had  a three-year contract with AYPAC, and that three-year contract has expired. The government reviewed whether it was getting value out of that contract because the government has, of course, put in place an outstanding range of policies for young people. We have put in place policies for literacy and numeracy and the new national apprenticeship system, and we have expanded opportunities for young people to undertake vocational education in school. All of those outstanding policies were put in place -  - Young people around Australia these days are seeking increasingly to speak directly to government. They do not believe that a body with an executive of five people can adequately represent their concerns. The government has determined that the 2.7 million young people between the ages of 15 and 24 should have the opportunity to nominate directly to a national youth round table. That round table will give every young Australian in regional and rural Australia and in metropolitan Australia the chance to be nominated and to talk directly with the government. I am pleased to say that the government's announcement has been welcomed by young people around Australia.</DOC>

 - I appreciate the question. I was rather surprised to see that the Leader of the Opposition said that maybe Australia's indirect tax system could be fixed by introducing a tax on private aircraft. That is what he said on 23 June 1998. He said:This business about family cars being taxed but private aircraft not, if Mr Costello wants to introduce a tax on private aircraft, we'll support it. Tell him to put it in straight away. We'll support it, pass it.I thought that was rather strange because he had 13 years of government to put it, support it and pass it. He apparently came to the conclusion on 23 June, after 13 years of inaction, that the most important reform required to the indirect tax system was to put a tax on private jets. As the Prime Minister asked, why would you tax motor vehicles 22 per cent and private jets nothing? Our view is that, in relation to indirect taxes, you should have the same rate. That is our view.Let me also ask some other questions. Labor wants to tax pens and crayons at 22 per cent but antique, gold-plated fountain pens at nothing. Labor wants to tax household vinyl floor tiles at 12 per cent but household marble floor tiles at nothing. Labor wants to tax biscuits at 12 per cent and caviar at nothing. - Labor wants to tax children's painting sets at 22 per cent but a Van Gogh at nothing. Labor wants to tax peanuts at 12 per cent but lobster and prawns at nothing. Labor wants to tax wrapping paper at 22 per cent but gold wallpaper at nothing. The one thing we know about the Labor Party is that the Labor Party is absolutely addicted to the wholesale sales tax. Make no mistake about it. In the next campaign, Labor will be fighting for the wholesale sales tax. That is the thing it really cares about.Why does the Labor Party care so much about the wholesale sales tax? Not because it has any logic to it. Why does the Labor Party really care so deeply about the wholesale sales tax? I will tell you why: the Labor Party knows, as it has proved, that if people do not know what the rates are, you can secretly increase them.In 1993 the Labor Party went to an election saying that it was against indirect tax reform. Back then in 1993 we had rates of 10, 20 and 30 per cent, but that was not enough for Labor, was it? Labor knew it could increase those wholesale sales tax rates and, as soon as that election was over, the 10 per cent rate went to 11 and then the 11 went to 12; the 20 went to 21 and then the 21 went to 22; and the 30 went to 31 and then the 31 went to 32.How could you in all honesty support a system that says that vinyl floor tiles are taxed at 12 per cent and household marble floor tiles are not taxed? As most countries around the world have discovered, the fair thing is to have a uniform rate across the board, then you do not get into these arguments in relation to caviar and biscuits. But that takes leadership. Tax reform takes leadership, and leadership is the one thing you will never get out of this Leader of the Opposition.</DOC>

 - Because, if you have broad-based indirect tax and you tell people that it is broad based and what the rate is, everybody knows what it is. That is the whole idea. But the advantage of a wholesale sales tax and the reason that the Labor Party wants it is that the Australian Labor Party wants to have differential rates on differential goods. The Australian Labor Party wants to ensure that caviar is tax free. The Australian Labor Party wants to tax biscuits at 12 per cent. The Australian Labor Party wants to tax Van Gogh at zero. The Australian Labor Party wants to tax children's painting sets at 22 per cent. - The one thing you know with a broad based indirect tax is what the rate is. - The member for Hotham talks about putting up rates. We remember 1993, when the Australian Labor Party went to the people of Australia and said, `Vote against indirect taxes.' The rate was then 10 per cent, and it went to 11 per cent. The 11 per cent went to 12 per cent. The 20 per cent went to 21. The 21 per cent went to 22 per cent. The 30 per cent went to 31 per cent. - You always know when the Leader of the Opposition is on weak ground because of the exaggerated laughter, as we just saw. The great thing about a broad based indirect tax is that you know it is across the board, it is fair across the board, and you know what the rate is. But with wholesale sales tax it is concealed - concealed on rates and goods - and there are no input credits in relation to exports or anything else. But not only did the Labor Party increase, secretly and deceitfully, its wholesale sales tax rates after 1993, they also said that they could pay for income tax reductions without increases in indirect taxes. In fact, they did not say they could pay for it; they said it was l-a-w. -  - Those l-a-w income tax cuts have still not been paid to this day. - </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Cowan for his question. When the wharfies voted in Sydney for the agreement with Patrick, they were voting for a reduction in the manning levels in the Port Botany terminal. Just to give members an idea of the extent of the change, in Port Botany as they were voting, the manning levels were just over 320, and what they voted for was an ongoing manning level of 160. That is a very significant change. In one of the regional ports, for example, the manning levels have been over 30. After they voted yesterday, the manning levels will be fewer than 10 people. In terms of remuneration, when they voted, the average annual remuneration was around $90,000 a year. When they voted yesterday, they voted for annual salaries of $58,000. There will be some productivity bonus, but that is tied to achieving a reasonable crane lift rate which is in keeping the government's benchmark productivity rates.When implemented, the agreement will see Australia have internationally competitive benchmarks. Not only will we have internationally competitive benchmarks; we will also see the end of all the rorts and rip-offs which have been supported by the Labor Party in  conjunction with the MUA for far too long. So when they sign up to that agreement they sign up to the abolition of the nick, to the abolition of double-headers - the infamous overtime rort which has seen such high income. They also sign up to the end of the order of pick. I refer to the order of pick because the independent Productivity Commission report singled out the order of pick as one of the real problems on the Australian waterfront.We have abolished all those things because we as a government have been publicly prepared to advocate and give leadership to fix up one of the most intractable problems in the Australian economy. The benefit for the Australian community is an increase in annual income - and therefore in living standards - of about $1 billion, and an extra 4,000 jobs. In fact, we had a report on that well before you wrote that letter to Mr Sharp yesterday, Prime Minister, which is indicative of the very extensive work we have done on the economic benefits of these sorts of reforms.In conclusion, one of the matters still before the parliament is the passage of the levy legislation so that this reform package will be paid for by the industry. The Labor Party has been opposed to it because the MUA was opposed to it. Now the MUA is in favour of it but they have been slow ringing the Labor Party, and so now we find that the Labor Party is reluctant to support the legislation. What an irony it is that the only thing standing between the wharfies and their money is the Labor Party. How do I know that in the end it will stand aside? I know - and I say it with absolute confidence - in the end, when it comes to the MUA requiring their dollars and the only thing to be done is to have the Labor Party set aside, what will the Labor Party do? It will do what it is told by the MUA as usual.</DOC>

 - I would not rule out my having been asked, although it has not come to the top of my attention in recent weeks. I receive numerous submissions and requests in relation to reducing taxes of various kinds, and I have no doubt that there would be lobbyists for venture capital funds who have made representations to me, my office or my department from time to time. You do hear the argument on quite a number of occasions - I have heard it - that a reduction in capital gains tax would help venture capital projects in Australia, but I point out that we already give considerable assistance to venture capital projects in Australia not only through pooled development funds but also through our business innovation funds and through a number of the measures which were actually outlined in the statement by the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism at the end of last year.I am not for a moment saying that everything about our tax system in the capital gains tax area is perfect; clearly there is a great deal of complexity. But the government has outlined the primary areas in which it believes tax reform would help the Australian public: the reform of indirect tax; a reform of personal income tax, particularly the impact of top marginal rates on average income earners; the interplay between the social security and income tax systems which penalise low income earners; and a reduction of complexity in relation to the business income tax system which is fraught with difficulty and complexity. As I have outlined, in accordance with the five principles that the Prime Minister laid down, they form the focus of the government's attention to tax reform.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Makin for her question. The Job Network is one of the most significant social reforms of the last 50 years. Although it is still in its very early days, I am pleased to be able to inform the House that the Job Network is already performing very well. There are many thousands of vacancies now being lodged every week with the Job Network. Indeed, there are more quality jobs now on the national job vacancy database than there ever were with the Commonwealth Employment Service. The most disadvantaged are proving to be particularly assisted by the Job Network. Some 40 per cent of job placements are for the long-term unemployed. All job seekers are benefiting. Indeed, some 20 per cent of the total vacancies filled by members of the Job Network are going to people for whom the government is not paying a fee.Despite some very inaccurate press reports, which probably result from the campaign being waged by the Commonwealth Public Sector Union against the Job Network, the fact is that referrals from Centrelink are on target. My department is working with Centrelink to increase the number of referrals above target. Some members may have seen newspaper reports today about comments by an organisation called Jobs Australia, through Mr David Thompson, purporting to identify flaws in Job Network. Members of the House should know that many of the organisations associated with Jobs Australia are outraged by this report. They regard it as a poor report and quite inaccurate. One of these organisations that belongs to Jobs Australia is an organisation called Job Power. Job Power has written to me to say:We were approached to complete a Jobs Australia telephone survey regarding the provision of FLEX 3 services and elected not to do so. We felt the survey lacked any statement as to its aims and objectives and was poorly presented. It also requested information which was commercial-in-confidence.Other Job Network providers are very angry at the remarks that were made by Mr Thompson maligning their operations. A  media release issued by the Ballarat Community Education Centre said:The federal government's Job Network system is working extremely well, and negative comments surrounding the current report from Jobs Australia are inconsistent with reality. Our employment arm, Ballarat Employment Service and Training, has found the new system far more effective than previously existed under the old CES. Referrals to us from Centrelink have exceeded our expectations. Payments due to us have been paid promptly. One can only wonder at the motivating factors behind comments condemning a new employment system which in the experience of numerous providers is performing extraordinarily well.This government is committed to improving services in employment placement for employers and for unemployed people. The Job Network system is performing well on target. It is right on track. Already it is performing well ahead of the former CES, and I want to congratulate all those members of the Job Network for putting so much of a contribution into their local communities.</DOC>

 - We like to amuse the members of the Labor front bench who find these things so interesting but we see these little traps of giving alternative A or alternative B, and we take neither of them. They are little linguistic traps. If the Labor Party is so interested in making disclosure of taxes on goods, why doesn't the Labor Party insist that toilet paper have 22 per cent added to it at the cash register, as is their tax plan? - If the Labor Party believes in full disclosure, why doesn't it insist that its tax - the wholesale sales tax - is shown on toothpaste as plus 12 per cent? - If you wanted full disclosure of indirect taxes, as the Labor Party appears to now insist on, why wouldn't the Labor Party at the next election have fruit juice plus 22 per cent at the cash register? - It is about the disclosure of indirect tax on goods. And the Australian Labor Party wants to now say, after 13 years, that it wants at the cash register goods to be shown with tax price. And I am saying that, if that were the case, you would have to show that there is, in relation to toilet paper, a 22 per cent Labor tax. I want to also read out a prepared statement in relation to this which says:There is no logical justification for a tax which discriminates against manufactured goods compared with services -  - It continues:There is no logical justification for a tax which discriminates against manufactured goods compared with servicesparticularly in a society which has seen services replace goods as the dominant field of economic activity. Moreover the existing wholesale sales tax is fraught with anomalies and complexities which render administration and compliance unduly burdensome. - They are the words of the Australian Labor Party, and I tender them. If the Australian Labor Party says that prices should be disclosed on goods at the retail cashout, look for their policy in relation to toilet paper, biscuits and orange juice. It will not be to put it on at the retail level. It will not be to disclose it. The question is fraudulent, as is Labor Party policy.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Aston for his question. I know he is one of the members of the House who is deeply concerned about the situation in East Timor and has followed the issue in a very mature and constructive way. The government  welcomes the discussions that have taken place between President Habibie and Bishop Belo. These talks have, we believe, been very helpful in taking the issue of East Timor forward. The government has continuously argued since we were elected to office that we wanted to see a reduction in the military presence in East Timor, and to allow the people of East Timor a greater say in their own affairs. It is pleasing, therefore, that President Habibie has indicated he is prepared to reduce the number of troops in East Timor and to explore options for granting a greater degree of autonomy.East Timor is a deeply divided and troubled place. A satisfactory resolution to the problems facing East Timor will require the development of a dialogue amongst the people of East Timor and, of course, with the government in Jakarta. Our experience in assisting with the Bougainville peace process shows that the people of a divided community can only be brought together through a process of patient dialogue. The Australian government does not think for a moment that simplistic solutions and slogans will solve delicate problems like that of East Timor.</DOC>

 - I am aware of the remarks made by Mrs Sham-Ho. It is a very strange stance to take, given that only last Friday night the New South Wales division of the Liberal Party to which Mrs Sham-Ho belongs unanimously resolved to place One Nation last on every how-to-vote card in the forthcoming federal election.Any suggestion that Mrs Sham-Ho would not have been chosen as the opposition's candidate for the vacant speakership in New South Wales on account of the attitude of  another party, I find quite astonishing. Of course, it is entirely a matter for the New South Wales parliamentary party. It is not a matter on which I have been consulted or would expect to be consulted or indeed wish to be consulted. It is a vacancy which, as everybody knows, arose rather suddenly and unexpectedly.In the brief time that I have had to look at the news reports and assess the situation, I think the principal reason Mrs Sham-Ho has resigned and is contesting the position from the cross benches is that she thinks she has a better chance of winning through doing that. It is rather disappointing, even verging on the ungracious, for somebody who has had great loyalty from the Liberal Party for a long period of time to seek to raise the matters that she has raised.I do not think for a moment that the allegations she has made have any foundation at all. I quite believe that the New South Wales coalition has chosen somebody else as its candidate and that is the reason she has resigned - and there is no other reason.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for this question and I would refer him to the Coopers &amp; Lybrand study, A survey of consumption tax; a worldwide perspective , released in September 1997. That report showed that there are 143 countries that impose a broad based indirect tax on goods and services; 109 of these impose a value added tax. Thirty-four countries impose a general tax on the supply of goods and services, including the USA. Seventeen countries do not impose any taxes on spending and there are seven countries in the world that impose a wholesale sales tax or manufacturers tax.The wholesale sales tax is the Australian Labor Party tax; it is the tax that the Australian Labor Party wants to fight to preserve in  the next election. The other six countries which join the Australian Labor Party and its plans for Australia in supporting a wholesale sales tax are the following: Botswana, Ghana, Jordan, Pakistan, Solomon Islands and Swaziland. They are the six countries in the world which, along with Australia, support a wholesale sales tax - the kind of tax which Australian Labor is fighting for in the next election. It is also One Nation policy; One Nation supports the same tax regime as Botswana, Ghana, Jordan, Pakistan, Solomon Islands and Swaziland. Most countries in the world impose a value added tax because it gives the ability to rebate taxes on inputs to business. - I keep hearing this interjection from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, `What about the United States?' The United States does not impose a wholesale sales tax. Notwithstanding the misleading information put around by the Leader of the Opposition and his deputy, the United States does not impose a wholesale sales tax. The United States imposes an even worse tax than a value added tax - a retail sales tax. If Australian Labor wants to hold up the United States as an example, you will be introducing, as the United States has in 45 of 50 states, a retail sales tax which, as you know, is imposed at the cash register when you go along to buy. But you will find no support for the wholesale sales tax in the United States.The second breathtaking piece of ignorance that the Leader of the Opposition has displayed in relation to this is his claim that value added tax exists in Europe because the French invented it and made it a condition of the existence of the EU. These are the allegedly European countries that have value added tax: Singapore, Taiwan - I suppose Taiwan imposed it to get into the EU, did it? - Japan, China, Chile, Israel and New Zealand. The Australian Labor Party can draw comfort from the following countries: Botswana, Ghana, Jordan, Pakistan, Solomon Islands and Swaziland. They are the countries that support the Australian Labor Party's kind of taxation system.</DOC>

 - Can I just say to the Leader of the Opposition that, as he knows, these matters are determined by our party organisation. I do not intend under any circumstances - nor will they - to have their timetable determined by the Leader of the Opposition. The Liberal Party divisions in New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania have already decided and the other divisions will take a decision at a time of their choosing, not of the nomination of the Leader of the Opposition.On the question asked of me in relation to Mrs Sham-Ho, I have had drawn to my attention a statement she made in the Legislative Council on 26 June, which is only three days ago, in which she said:I put on record that I do not intend to resign from the Liberal Party over One Nation preferences.She then went on to say:I have always said that I can be more effectual inside the Liberal Party working for all the people of New South Wales, while maintaining my personal integrity within the ethnic community.I am very sorry to say that what we are witnessing at the moment is not what is alleged by the Leader of the Opposition. What we are witnessing is the politics not of race but of sour grapes.</DOC>

 - I am pleased to affirm to the House the government established the TradeStart program last year to improve access to export services for new exporters in regional and rural Australia. TradeStart offices have been established already in nine such locations: Albany, Bathurst, Coffs Harbour, Geraldton, Launceston, Nowra, Rockhampton, Tamworth and Wagga Wagga. These offices use state-of-the-art technology to link in exporters. They work with local companies which have the potential and interest to start exporting for the first time. They also provide access to Austrade's information and counselling for new exporters and they act as a focal point to integrate delivery of export services in regional and rural centres, including those already in exporting.Export markets, of course, are essential to jobs and growth right across Australia, and the government's TradeStart offices are bringing those services directly to regional and rural areas where they can be readily accessed. They parallel the full payments  being made under the export market development grant scheme, right across Australia, to several hundred companies involving exporters and trusts and costing some $140 million. I am delighted that Wagga Wagga has a TradeStart office. It is in business. It is helping boost the export efforts of the Riverina to the world and creating extra export jobs.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. Unquestionably this is a time of real challenge in rural Australia with enormous change being something that has accelerated largely as a result of what has happened to our north in recent times where the terms of trade deterioration has been quite alarming.The reality is that, of course, there are great opportunities, but they are going to take a lot of seizing. It is worth noting that, whilst I talked in this place last week about the very real progress the government has made in lowering farm inflation and in beating costs imposed on producers by things like interest rates, the efforts we have made in regard to exceptional circumstances and Agriculture-Advance Australia, it is also worth noting that in a number of areas we are doing some very practical things to help farmers secure their future in a time of enormous change. For example, we have now seen through this place the legislation for the new farm management deposits. They will come into operation in the new financial year. They are a vast improvement on existing arrangements, the IEDs and farm management bonds, and they will be available through the banks. They have been very widely welcomed by the farm community.Another example is the new FarmBis program. This will see a response to the huge increase in demand in recent times for this type of program. It involves some $50 million. That has been widely welcomed by farmers as well. Property management planning is a program that has been running for a few years. We now put in $10 million a year to that and the states put in another $10 million. It takes into account farm management, natural resource management, marketing and risk management - all facets of running a farm business in these new and challenging times. Then there are other packages such as the retirement assistance for farmers. All farmers, of course, can gift their assets and access the pension, but this allows for farmers in particularly difficult circumstances to do so on more liberal and generous terms.These sorts of measures, together with others such as landcare tax credits, for which  we have provided some $80 million over the next three or four years, and our very solid ongoing commitment to rural research and development, demonstrate very clearly the government's willingness to do everything possible to help farmers secure their future, and with it the future of the towns and villages that service them, in times that are challenging and that involve great change for all people in rural Australia.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Wakefield for his question. I know that the honourable member for Wakefield is interested in the important reforms that this government has instituted in this area, and particularly in relation to the plight of young people in his regional electorate who are interested in ways and means by which they can improve their own employability. This system of the youth allowance has enabled us to put in place a scheme which ensures that young people are not paid more in the way of benefits than they would be paid to be supported in education and training. This is a very important reform. It is one which ensures that young people, who have been 2½ times more likely to be unemployed in later life if they do not receive training, are able to access training programs. It is very important and a new message that is going out to young people, that if you are in education you are going to be better off in life over time if you receive educational benefits, and you certainly will not be better off if you receive unemployment benefits in the form of welfare.It is an approach that ought to have had the support of the opposition but, regrettably, that was not the case. They preferred a system in which young people were treated differentially. We now have a system which ensures that all young people are treated equally. It ensures that for the first time students will receive rent assistance - an opportunity that was not available to them before. Under Labor, they did not receive a cent to help them pay the rent if they were living away from home undertaking study. We have a situation now where 70,000 young people, mostly from regional Australia, are able to get up to $75 a fortnight extra to help them with the study. It is interesting that members of the opposition still seem to want to oppose this important measure, which committed additional public funding of the order of $220 million  over four years to put in place these new benefits. It was not a matter of removing public expenditure; it was additional public expenditure to ensure that a fair system was put in place.It is regrettable that the Labor Party is still opposing this measure and that their mates particularly in the Community and Public Sector Union are opposing this measure. I think it is important that members are aware that there is now a campaign to be motivated by the CPSU in relation to this measure. There are documents that are available - I intend to table these documents - outlining the nature of the campaign that they are proposing. It is quite a deceitful campaign. It is one in which thousands of genuine Centrelink employees are being asked to be involved in providing false claims about occupational health and safety matters to their superior officers. Even if they have got no claims and no advice that any client is complaining to them, they have been instructed that they have to file a notice. So the union has distributed kits containing misleading information to be given out to clients, a form of voting form and a pro forma letter that people might send to the minister as well.The motivation of this is clear. It is part of an election campaign in which the CPSU is involved with the Labor Party in trying to mislead customers and clients about the nature of these particular beneficial arrangements. It is using young people as a political football in a campaign which is quite unworthy. I would hope that the Labor Party would dissociate itself from this campaign and support the government in its endeavours to put in place a fairer system and one which considerably repairs the mess that the Labor Party left this country in.</DOC>

 - The question asked by the Leader of the Opposition is, even for him, utterly hypothetical. There will be a lot of speculation and I say to those who sit opposite: when the tax package comes out you will see that it is a fair and balanced tax package. It is a tax policy that addresses the unfairness in the existing system, it is a tax policy that will be good for rural Australia and it is a tax policy that, above everything else, will be fair. It will not be a rich man's tax policy. The only party sitting around here at the present time that has opposed endeavours by this government to clamp down on rorts on the rich are the members of the Australian Labor Party.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for McMillan for drawing attention to this obstructionism in the Senate to the government's very important country of origin legislation. Last week the Greens blocked the speedy passage of this legislation through the Senate. The Greens, it seems, are choosing some cheap political point scoring. They have refused repeated offerings of briefings on the legislation. Instead they have supported ignorance rather than the truth. The facts are that, under the government's proposed legislation, Product of Australia will be restricted to items that are 100 per cent Australian, or as near to it as it is possible to get.Made in Australia can be used on products which have been substantially transformed in Australia and have had at least 50 per cent of the cost of production incurred in Australia; indeed, there will be regulation-making powers to ensure that simple processes will  not pass the substantial transformation test. This test is tougher than has been applied in any legislation in the past. It is tougher than generally applied in the courts. It is tougher than the rules that applied for the very popular green and gold Australian Made logo. It seems that Senator Brown, on behalf of the Greens, wants a Made in Australia test that is set at 75 per cent or maybe even 100 per cent. If he is setting that kind of a test, presumably he is prepared to allow things to be called Australian Made that cannot be called Made in Australia.The other nonsense that Senator Brown needs to explain, particularly to Tasmanians, is why he is advocating a labelling system that would not allow Cadbury chocolates to be called Made in Australia. The Incat ferries could not be called Made in Australia. I think it is time he explained that to Tasmanians. For that matter, Holden cars, most of the whitegoods and most of the clothing and footwear that is manufactured in this country could not be called Made in Australia. The fact is that the government's legislation is supported by the National Farmers Federation, the Pork Council and the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry. It delivers honesty and certainty to labelling claims. I would call on the Senate to allow the passage of this important reform for industry, for farmers and for consumers and to deliver at last honesty and truthfulness in origin labelling claims.</DOC>

I do not need to give Senator Evans a lecture on Dicey and the constitution. - Maybe Senator Evans has been misleading students at Melbourne University in a former life by raising the issue. - As the senator well knows, the limits of the parliament's legislative power are governed by the constitution and not by anything else.

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. This is a very interesting development in the war against drugs in sport. EPO is the acronym for a drug called erythropoietin, which is used to enhance the oxygen-carrying capacity of an athlete's blood. It is in fact a natural substance that occurs in human beings, but it can also be produced synthetically and therefore administered to athletes as a form of cheating.It is not detectable in the urine tests that are carried out by the Sports Drug Agency now, but I am pleased to inform the House that last week the chief sports scientist at the Australian Institute of Sport, Dr Ross Smith, whom some fans of the AFL football code may well remember from his time playing in Melbourne -  - He was a St Kilda player and a Brownlow medallist, was he not? - He has another Brownlow Medal here because in a research project, a collaborative one with the Australian Sports Drug Testing Laboratory, Dr Smith and his colleagues have developed in the laboratory a screening test to identify artificially administered EPO in athletes. This has been done in the laboratory and, henceforth, they propose to conduct screening tests on athletes to see whether or not the breakthrough they have achieved in the laboratory will be efficacious in detecting this form of cheating among athletes.To do that, it is proposed to use a number of volunteers from the ANU - athletes who are not at the elite level but who are participating in endurance sports at the club level. This is to make sure that no accusation could be made of Australia that we are using some of our elite athletes and perhaps mixing this sort of test with the competition that they may be participating in. It will take place, not on the AIS campus here in Canberra but in the ANU medical centre, where it will be supervised by the medical staff there in order to keep it as much as possible at arm's length from our athletes who are training at the AIS.I think this is an occasion when the House can congratulate a group of Australia's best scientists in producing a development that we hope, if it proves efficacious in the clinical trials, will be ready for use at the time of the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games and will eliminate one of the last areas where athletes can use drugs to cheat and to do those who are genuine athletes out of medals.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for McPherson for his question. In looking at the statistical information that is available it is important to note that there have been significant variations in student enrolments from various parts of the world and from various countries. One ought not to be surprised at that. We are, for many source countries, far more competitive than we have been before. In relation to numbers of others, because of the international currency situations and also, because of the extent to which economic factors have impacted in the Asian markets, enrolments from some countries have been down. But overall, as I recall it, for last year, when one might have expected that the impact of what has been happening in Asia could have led to significantly reduced enrolments, that was not the case.Let me pick up the comments that the honourable member has made in relation to developing other markets. It is important to recognise that not all students who come to Australia might have aspirations of study. There are some parts of the world in which people will use the opportunity to enrol as a student to achieve another purpose; it can be a permanent migration purpose or a temporary entry purpose. The honourable member mentions China in particular. One of the aspects in relation to China, even with the very close and quite significant bona fides testing which goes on now, is that we do have a significant overstay rate for students from China. In addition, we have numbers of other students who apply to stay in Australia on other grounds. I think it was something of the order of 22 per cent of students from China in 1995-96 who remained in Australia on the basis that they had entered into a relationship with an Australian.The only comment I would make about that is that it is not necessarily a Chinese phenomenon that people would want to marry an Australian. If you look at Hong Kong, for  instance, where there are also Chinese students, the figure is two per cent. One has to draw the logical conclusion that many of them are using the basis upon which we allow people to remain in Australia - that is, a family relationship - as a basis for perhaps obtaining a migration outcome rather than anything else.It is important, in relation to looking at developing markets, to have regard to bona fides questions. The government is anxious to expand the opportunities for students to study in Australia because bona fide students produce very significant economic benefits for Australia. But if you end up with non-bona fide students there is a significant downside, particularly if they end up in the protection stream making claims, where it costs us something of the order of $60,000 per student in order to be able to process their claims while they remain in Australia.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Makin for her question because I know she has taken a particular interest in this matter. Indeed, the discussion paper was released last week by the Minister for Justice, Senator the Hon. Amanda Vanstone. It strengthens the work done by the Howard government to prevent domestic violence from occurring.All too frequently, domestic violence against women and children does result in fatal offences. Women are at least three times more likely to be the victims rather than the perpetrators of a domestic killing. When these events become the subject of court proceedings, partial defences are often used, such as diminished responsibility through extreme provocation.Provocation potentially is available in any situation in which family conflict or a break-up of a relationship causes a man to kill his spouse or a child. That is a standard which is  arguably too low, if we are to maintain the value of human life in Australia. The discussion paper puts forward a view that these partial defences can never be an excuse for the taking of life. However, we need to examine whether self-defence is an appropriate plea for a woman who has suffered years of abuse and provocation.The paper provides an opportunity for public comment. The government welcomes the community input as we move toward improving this aspect of the legal system and giving people confidence that the legal system is actually working for them.</DOC>

 - I am wondering whether he left out the last sentence because he did not sort of get to the point of the question. But I will say this: this government supports tax reform; your opposition opposes it. We think that indirect tax should be known and should be broad based; you do not. But I will say one thing for the member for Werriwa. The member for Werriwa, I think, is concerned about the tax system; he has actually warned the Labor Party about, as he says it, lapsing into economic populism. -  - The relevant answer, as I have said, is that, in principle, indirect tax should be on a broad base and it should be on a flat rate - and that is a situation which this government supports. Unfortunately, the Labor Party supports a wholesale sales tax whose chief advantages are different rates on different items, which give you the opportunity, as you know, to try to sneak tax rises through.I would recommend to the Australian Labor Party that it think very carefully about its position because, as the goods tax base continues to decline, all that means is that the rates will go up. As sure as night follows day, if the Labor Party were ever to come to office in this country, it would do what it did last time: increase every wholesale sales tax rate and reduce income tax cuts. That is the decision before the Australian people.</DOC>

 - It is the case that, accompanied by the member for Wide Bay, the member for Fisher and the member for Hinkler, I did attend a meeting in Wondai on Thursday night and, subsequently the follow  ing day, at Hervey Bay and Maryborough. It was a very interesting experience - and it is not the first such experience in my political life, nor will it be the last. I took the opportunity of saying to those that I spoke to that I had a very strong personal belief in old fashioned hall meetings.Also, what was very instructive were the views expressed by the Australians I met regarding a lot of things - regarding the government, regarding the opposition and regarding the conduct of politics generally. One of the things that came through very strongly to me was that a lot of Australians do not like the immature points scoring that often goes on in parliament. A lot of the Australians I spoke to had gained the impression that, while their problems were being neglected by those they elected, those they elected spent an enormous amount of time in rather futile debate that was rather irrelevant to the concerns of the daily lives of those Australians.Much as the opposition would never ever listen to any advice from me, I think all members of parliament ought to take that message to heart, whether they belong to the Liberal, the Labor Party or, indeed, to any other party, because increasingly not only do Australians want value from their elected representatives but they want to feel that they are taking their concerns seriously. There is no doubt that there are many areas of rural poverty in our nation. I have little doubt that the major driving force behind recent political events is economic vulnerability rather than anything else.There are other issues, and there are aspects of the alternative policies that are being put around, which are causing some Australians of Asian descent to feel uncomfortable in this community for the first time in their lives. Such experience was related to me when speaking to a member of the Indian community in Melbourne the week before last. I then related that to the audience I addressed in Hervey Bay, saying that I think that is a matter of profound sadness and regret to all Australians who believe in a tolerant and cohesive society.The reality is that a lot of Australians in the bush work very hard. They run very efficient businesses. They have been savagely mauled by the downturn in world markets. Commodity prices are very low. The One Nation Party has come along and has said that the answer is to stop all imports. The answer is not to stop all imports, because if you stop all imports other people will stop all of our exports and we will end up being a great deal worse off than we are now. I think what is needed is a patient application of sensible economic policy. What is also needed is a strong rejection and repudiation of alternative proposals which do not offer any solutions.I think we need to understand that rural and regional Australia regards many people who live in the capital cities as being far better endowed than they are. If you go broke on the land, you do not get a redundancy. If you lose your farm income, you are not automatically entitled to income support. It is no good turning around and saying to those people, `You have a valuable asset,' when you cannot dispose of that asset. I think these are things that ought to be taken into account by all political parties. I can say to the people of rural and regional Australia that in the past I have been a frequent visitor. I continue to be and I will continue to be in the future. I would also say to them that the solution to your problems is not to be found in the transient offerings of those who offer populist solutions without any substance.The final thing I would say is that in the whole of my visit to the Wide Bay electorate, so well represented by my colleague Warren Truss, there was one party - and I must have spoken to something like 1,500 people - that got no mention at all and was not seen as even being relevant on the Australian political scene, and that was the Australian Labor Party.</DOC>

 - The answer to the first part of the question is no. I have not been summonsed to any committee. - On the issue of consultation with industry, there has been very extensive consultation with industry. The report to which you refer I have not actually seen. To the extent of being briefed on it, I am told that it is a study not of the effect of the proposals on the economy or on relevant economic sectors but a suggested effect on some participants in business without looking at the other side of the equation. It is not a study to which I think any attention ought to be paid. The point is that those 1,500 people are the people who are using copyright laws to prevent competition. Copyright laws are not intended to be used for that purpose. They are afraid of competition. What we are intending to do is to offer them some competition so that consumers will benefit and prices will come down.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Parramatta for his question. I congratulate him on the great support that he is giving to the Job  Network in his own electorate. The Job Network has greatly improved services for employers and for unemployed people throughout Australia. There are now over 1,400 Job Network sites around Australia compared with 296 sites under the old CES. There are now many more high quality vacancies available on the national database than there ever were under the CES.The member for Parramatta is referring to the fact that, increasingly, as one listens to talkback radio around Australia, one hears many callers calling in saying how much the service has improved under the Job Network. Let me just quote a few examples for the benefit of the House and for the benefit of the opposition. On the ABC Radio National on 10 June earlier this month a talkback caller called Amanda rang in -  - The opposition does not like to hear this good news, Mr Speaker. The caller said:I found that it (Job Network) was much better than the CES. In the four months that I was unemployed the CES never once approached me to say, `Hey, look, what are you looking for? Can we help you?' There was nothing like that. Under the Job Network I got a job only a few days afterwards.There was a story earlier this month in the Brisbane Courier-Mail  reporting the remark of one Andrew Taylor who had been unemployed for 12 months but got a job as a machinery serviceman through the Job Network on his first try. He was quoted as saying:I wasn't too keen on the old CES. Basically, I'd relied on ads in newspapers and word of mouth. But with my first try at Job Network I got a job.The Townsville Bulletin  quoted Mr Robert Pattel, 47, who said the CES had not been able to find him a job in six months, but he found a job on the first day of using the Job Network:It feels great to be working again.There have been many commendations of the Job Network from employers. Employer Trish  O'Brien of CO Services in South Australia wrote a letter to a local Job Network provider saying:We used the CES as a last resort only . . . We will use your company not as a last resort but as our first option!There was one comment, however, which I think the opposition may be interested to hear because it goes right to the credibility of their attack on the Job Network. There was one phone caller called Trevor on John Stanley's program on 2UE on 11 June who had this to say about the Labor Party spokesman, Mr Martin Ferguson:He had the same old rhetoric, the same old stuff, the old union claptrap, because he, Kelty, got rid of him, out of the trade union movement, so they gave him a nice old safe seat. And I think that it's terrible that that guy (Ferguson) is allowed to be let loose on the airwaves.That is the sort of statement that the people of Australia do not want to hear. They want to hear the truth about the Job Network and there are many positive comments now coming through about the improved services from this significant social reform.</DOC>

 - I am aware of that particular program. The precise details as alleged by the honourable member I will examine. But can I take the opportunity, as she has asked me a question, of referring again to the policy that was put forward by the honourable  member's party during the Queensland election that proposed that there be generally available bank loans of two per cent. The question was asked about how that was going be financed and where you would find the investors that would put money in it at 1½ per cent to enable it to be lent out at two per cent, to which the response was, `Oh, well, it is not going to operate like an ordinary bank. How it is going to operate is that we are going to print the money.'  Nothing that the honourable member says can alter the fact that one of the three shareholders in her party -  -  - Now do not start interrupting; that is very bad. It is very bad to start interrupting. -  - You must never get personal, Pauline. Do not get personal. What I think was the point being made by the Treasurer and by myself was that, if you are not going to finance it by getting depositors to put money in at 1½ per cent so the bank can make a profit, what is the alternative method? The alternative method that was put forward by David Ettridge, who is one of the three sponsors of your party, was that what you had to do was print money. Nothing can erase that remark from the record, and one of the rules of Australian politics is that if you say something, as I have learnt, people will in the future remind you of what you have said. That, I must say, has happened to me and it has happened to him. And I tell you what, it is happening to you as well. Now that your party is on the playing field you have to be made accountable like the rest of us and the reality is that the proposition that you can generally make money available at two per cent is, of course, absurd, for the reasons that the Treasurer and I have pointed out.So far as indigenous people are concerned, one of the reasons for that particular proposal, as I understand it, was to encourage indigenous Australians to become economically self-sufficient. The criticism that is frequently made of indigenous Australians by other  Australians in rural areas is that they are forever depending upon welfare handouts and that they get an undue proportion of welfare handouts. I would have thought, as a matter of elementary logic, that one of the ways to change that is to bring in policies that give them personal economic empowerment. That, in fact, has been the policy that Senator John Herron, my Aboriginal affairs minister, has followed from the day that I appointed him to that ministry. In the face of the most ridiculous criticism from the Australian Labor Party and from others who purport to represent the Aboriginal cause, Senator Herron has been criticised. But I am very proud of the attempts that we have made to give people economic empowerment and I can understand impoverished people in rural areas of Australia resenting anything that resembles economic handouts.Can I say to the honourable member that the criticisms I have made in relation to that bank are absolutely right. You will never be allowed to forget that your offsider said that you could print money to finance a bank any more than I will ever be allowed to forget things that I have said that my opponents think they can criticise, because they are the rules of politics under which you play. I remind the honourable member that, if you seek to influence the affairs of this country, you, like anybody else, are a politician like the rest of us. There is no such thing as a non-political politician any more than there is any such thing as a non-sporting sportsman. You are on the field. Your policies are there for the public to see and like everybody else's they are subject to legitimate analysis and legitimate criticism.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. Indeed, I can -  - I think the Leader of the Opposition forgot his place - and long may he remain in it. -  - I take it the member for Holt thinks there is something wrong with schoolteachers, does he? - I thank the member for Gilmore for her question. I know the concern that she has for industry in her electorate and I know the concern that she has for defence personnel who reside in her electorate. With regard to the defence industry policy, the policy that we announced two weeks ago will certainly give assistance to indigenous Australian small and medium enterprises. I can say that the injection of additional business into her electorate will result in additional jobs. -  - I advise the House that the three most important sectors of finance into her region are, firstly, ordinary manufacturing; thirdly, defence; and - sadly - secondly, social security. So, indeed, additional defence industry business is very important to her electorate. With regard to the question of the Defence Housing Authority and housing for defence personnel, the government has announced in the last two weeks that the Defence Housing Authority will not be privatised. - It will remain in government ownership because this is a proper function for government to carry out. It is not in business, competing with the private sector; it is providing an important part of service  provisioning which means that families have the opportunity to have quality of life while their serving personnel carry out their duties and responsibilities in a straightforward manner. I say to the honourable member that, overall, the importance of those two announcements to your electorate is that the people of Gilmore benefit because you are their voice in government.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Forrest for his question. The international trade in goods and services for May 1998 released this morning were certainly far better than median market expectations. The median market expectations were for a deficit of $700 million. The deficit in fact was broadly unchanged in May at $526 million compared with a revised April result of $525 million. The data provides evidence that, while exports to Asia are down, Australian exporters are diversifying into other markets. Much has been made of the fall in exports in the March quarter and their contribution to the current account for that quarter. The fall  in the March quarter was actually a little less than expected and, as I said at the time, was a result of some one-off factors, particularly a delay in cereal exports. Even so, the rise in the current account deficit came as no surprise for the reasons which were outlined in the budget.As was said in the budget, a widening in the current account is to be expected in 1998 as a consequence of developments in Asia. A substantial part of the contraction in our direct export markets has likely already occurred and exporters will over time have more opportunities for diversification. I have emphasised on a number of occasions that, whilst the budget forecast is 5¼ per cent on average over 1998-99, it would be fully consistent for a particular quarter to have higher than that in terms of current account, perhaps even up to six per cent.The good news out of today's figures is that these figures show that there is substantial diversification going on amongst Australian exporters. Australian exporters unquestionably have been hit hard by the downturn in Asia, which is as serious as we have ever seen in our lifetimes. But the good news is that with the inventiveness of exporters, with a competitive economy, with low inflation and with good interest rates, the domestic conditions are in place to help Australian business and, in fact, to help Australian living standards.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Murray for her question. I also join in welcoming Senator Michai to the chamber and reflect on the fact that Australian-Thailand relations have developed very greatly over the last couple of decades and more so in the last few years, and have seen a good boost of two-way trade investment and tourism between our two countries. The take-out of the figures just referred to by the Treasurer include another dimension. I reveal to the House that the exports of goods and services in the 11 months to the end of May-1 June 1998 were up 10.3 per cent compared with the same period last year. In other words, our exporters, against the odds, have now reached $104.5 billion of exports for this financial year, just about the same as for the entirety of last financial year, with one month's figures to come. That is an outstanding achievement by our exporters and that means more jobs here in Australia.I also refer to the fact that imports in the same 11-month period have increased by 14.1 per cent to $107.8 billion, and they are perfectly manageable at that level. Some of those imports include products, some as small as wine corks, to facilitate the export of $700  million worth of bottled Australian wine to the world - that is the current figure for our excellent wine export effort to the world - right through to other intermediate goods, computer goods and the like.The government's strategy over the last 28 months of encouraging exporters to diversify is not some abstract strategy. It is working and it is working well. It is mirrored by the export market development grant payments going out in full and it is also reflected by the extra energy in the bilateral trade negotiations. I add that Australian exporters, particularly in rural and regional Australia, are also to be congratulated. Today's figures show that exports of rural goods are up, including a 28 per cent increase in meat and meat preparation exports. That is a tremendous effort by hard-pressed primary industry exporters who are doing it against the odds.The Columbus line Australian management advises that right now, throughout this month of June, they have almost record bookings for outbound containers, most notably on the Australia-USA run. That also augers well for a very good set of figures for the month of June. We are doing it with pragmatic trade policy which recognises there is no such thing as a level playing field, but which helps our exporters win gold medals in performance, including this increase of 10 per cent plus for the first 11 months of this financial year. It is our exporters who have helped lay the base for a happier new financial year, which begins in a few hours time.</DOC>

 - On Saturday I had a fairly comprehensive day - a working breakfast in Darwin with exporters, a flood recovery function in Katherine -  -  - Yes, and then went to Finley and Corowa in my electorate, consulting with a raft of people. - Just one day. -  - As a result of that consultation and continuing consultation - I will have more to say on the subject raised by the Leader of the Opposition down the track - I stand by exactly what was said by me on Radio National AM  this morning. I also am very proud to record in Hansard  the comments by the Albury bartender quoted on RN AM . In respect of the federal member for Farrer, he said -  - He was not. He was not prebriefed. We do not act like aNiMaLS. He came bolting through. If you were listening to AM  this morning, you would hear that he really did come bolting through the radio waves. He said:He'll bolt it in, actually. He's a . . . he's firmly entrenched down here. I wouldn't think anyone else. I seen in the paper the other day where he - Tim Fischer - looks a little bit shaky, but I'd . . . jeez, I'd bet . . . nearly bet me life on it he'd get back in with a blood big swing, actually. He's very, very popular.And he went on. On this occasion I will back the bartender from Albury and I will have more to say on the matter down the track.</DOC>

 - I can give an absolute guarantee to the honourable member for Dawson that Telstra will not become foreign owned. -  - The reason I can give that absolute guarantee is that the legislation before the Senate at the present time contains that absolute guarantee. -  - It mirrors the legislation that was passed by the federal parliament that provides not more than 35 per cent of the shares in Telstra can be owned by foreign persons or their associates and not more than five per cent of those shares can be owned by an individual.That does not stop the Labor Party from continuing its fear campaign, the distortion of facts campaign. The Labor Party is in full swing, sending out brochures and telling anybody who wants to read them that, if Telstra is sold, then it will be foreign owned. I noted that the candidate in the Northern Territory has been peddling this line in a letter to people in the Northern Territory claiming that, if Telstra is sold, it will be foreign owned. Not true; that is another Labor lie. I noted that the material produced in Brisbane and circulated in Queensland before the Queensland state election - obviously designed with one object in mind; that is, to pander to the One Nation supporters - claimed that, if Telstra were privatised, there would be foreign ownership. I noted that Senator McKiernan has been circulating material in Western Australia indicating that, if Telstra is sold, only the big fund management companies will own Telstra. I can only presume he was referring to the trade union fund managers who have already acquired ownership in Telstra.It is ironic that the Leader of the Opposition has put out a circular saying the same thing. It is ironic that the man who is beating his breast on this issue of foreign ownership was the minister responsible for the sale of Qantas. What was the percentage of foreign ownership for the sale of Qantas? What was that percentage of foreign ownership in Qantas? It was 49 per cent. The legislation that this government is passing will provide for no more than 35 per cent foreign ownership. Again, the Labor Party talk about only a small group of Australians owning shares in Telstra. I presume they are referring to people like Senator McKiernan and Senator Crowley who bought shares, along with 1½ million other Australians, when the first sale occurred.The guarantee goes further. Every day the trustee of the instalment receipts checks through, looks under the system that the Stock Exchange put in - the CHESS system - and informs the Stock Exchange what the level of ownership is. It ought to be noted that, despite the fact that 35 per cent was available in the first third of Telstra's sale, only between 19 and 21 per cent has been foreign owned to date. There is an entitlement to 35 per cent. Of course, there is a power, if foreign ownership exceeds 35 per cent, for the trustee and for Telstra in due course to force those shares to be sold immediately.I give an absolute guarantee, because the Australian parliament gives that guarantee, that foreign ownership will always be restricted to 35 per cent.</DOC>

 - It is not. The award simplification that is coming into effect from midnight tonight is precisely as foreshadowed in our pre-election policy. Any suggestion by the Leader of the Opposition that it represents a broken promise is a complete distortion of the fact. - What is interesting is that the award simplification process which is coming into force at midnight tonight is very much in line with the speech given by the former Prime Minister Mr Keating when he addressed a meeting of company directors in Melbourne after the 1993 election. It is very much in line with that. The government has honoured, through the no-disadvantage test, the commitment it made in relation to the value of the award and Australian workplace agreements. The commitment that was made by me in January 1996 was that a worker going into an Australian workplace agreement would not be worse off compared with the  provisions of the award. That was the no-disadvantage guarantee that was given by me. That guarantee has been honoured.In the policy that was released before the election, we foreshadowed the process of award simplification, and that process is being carried out in accordance with that commitment. Once again, the Leader of the Opposition is deliberately misleading the Australian people about the commitments I made on behalf of the coalition.</DOC>

 - The Leader of the Opposition interjects and says, `And you're proud of it.' Not only are we proud of it; in fact, these provisions of the Workplace Relations Act were signed off -  - Let me finish. - They were signed off as being fair and reasonable and consistent with the government's policy by none other than a leading member of the frontbench of the Labor Party, Mrs Kernot. She publicly supported them as being consistent with our policy and as being a fair deal for workers - and why shouldn't she? What incredible hypocrisy. It was Paul Keating who said:Let me describe the model of industrial relations we are working towards.The Prime Minister referred to these words a moment ago:It is a model which places primary emphasis on bargaining at the workplace level within a framework of minimum standards provided by arbitral tribunals.This is what the Labor Party publicly advocated as being a good idea but could never deliver. That is the reality of it. You could never deliver this. We have seen part of the reason that that is the case, and that is that, even in the 18-month period that we gave to the trade union movement to cooperatively work to the simplification of awards, they dragged their feet. Why have they dragged their feet? They dragged their feet because they refused to be part and parcel of sensible reform. So we put in a timetable to make sure this actually happened. The Sydney Morning Herald  article this morning says:That a mere handful of unions have bothered to treat award simplification seriously ahead of today's cut-off date says much about why the process was necessary in the first place.They are absolutely right. The fact is that this is one of the many things that should have been done, which you yourselves said should have been done, and yet you yourselves were unable to achieve it.This is the first time in the history of the arbitral system in Australia that we have finally drawn a line and said, `Enough is enough,' and, `Let us have a system where workers can actually have a say in the terms and conditions of their employment instead of those terms and conditions being inflexibly prescribed by arbitral tribunals.' This is an important occasion in the ongoing reform of Australia's industrial relations system - something the Labor Party could never achieve.</DOC>

 - This is just chapter 2 in the question raised by the member for Canberra yesterday. The report on which the member for Canberra relies was something of a survey conducted by an accounting firm which wrote to a number of people who thought themselves threatened, or their businesses threatened, by schedule 3 of the Copyright Amendment Bill 1997 . They asked them, `What would you expect your position to be, as regards turnover, sales, profit, employment and so on, in three years time, and what would it be if this bill was passed in the same time?' And, of course, they came back and they had terrible tales of woe to tell. They were going to lose all sorts of sales. They were going to lose all sorts of profits. They were going to have to sack people.The simple fact of the matter is that this bill is designed to benefit the community, to benefit consumers, and to introduce competition in an area where there is presently no competition. The reason there is no competition is not a valid one. What these exclusive distributors are saying is,  `The goods we import from overseas have a label on them. That label is copyright. We do not care about what the product is - the label is the important thing. We do not want competition in respect of the label.' What nonsense is that? This is a bill that should be supported by the Labor Party as being in the interests of consumers. - How can it possibly destroy jobs when it is going to result in an increase in competition and the creation of more business? -  - This bill is beneficial. You are being sucked in by people who want to preserve something that they are not entitled to.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for her question. The short answer is that much of it can be attributed to the passage of the Workplace Relations Act. If you go back, I think, just over a month, with the ABS figures then released, we had the lowest number of disputes per 1,000 employees since 1913. What an interesting contrast that makes to the claims made by the Labor Party before the last election. Remember Bill Kelty? He said, `If you vote for the coalition, you will get World War III.' On those figures, we did not get World War III. We got the lowest level of disputes since World War I. And, whilst the economy has grown, we had the lowest number of disputes since 1940, would you believe!Why is this? Part of the answer is the fact that we have very strong prohibitions now against secondary boycotts in the Trade Practices Act. We have strong bans against primary boycotts affecting international trade. If you look at the recent waterfront dispute, one of the remarkable aspects of that dispute is that we never actually had a national stoppage during it. We never had a national stoppage. And that is because of the effectiveness of the secondary boycott provisions of the Workplace Relations Act.To conclude, not only have we had record numbers but you can also draw this simple conclusion: if Labor were ever to be re-elected, and if they were to implement their policy, they would repeal the secondary boycott provisions of the Trade Practices Act.  So, for people who support the Labor Party, what they are supporting is an increase in the number of disputes in Australia, the jobs that that would cost, and the fall off in living standards that would result. These record low levels of industrial disputes are as a result of the good policies which we implemented - in particular, the `Cheryl clauses' which Labor are intent on repealing.</DOC>

 - That is the second question from the member for Hotham on industry policy since November last year. - That is the second question since November last year. Since the government announced its industry policy in December of that year, there has been very extensive action taken in relation to it. I am surprised at some of the comments that have been made because, in the area of information technology, for example, the government has moved to establish a ministerial council, chaired by Senator Alston, which is responsible for the implementation of a whole of government information online services strategy. Secondly, the National Office for Information Economy, which has responsibility for the development, coordination and overview of policies, has also been established under Senator Alston.In relation to the industry department's response to it, we have announced that as of  tomorrow - that is, 1 July - the information industry's action agenda will go into effect. Some $28 million was announced - and this was announced some time ago; don't worry about that one - to establish a national network of software engineering quality centres and a new testing and performance infrastructure. So we are very much on the go in relation to responses to those areas.In relation to Ericsson - and the member raises this question - I have here a press release, released at lunchtime, from the managing director which contradicts completely what the member for Hotham was saying. It says:Ericsson Australia said today that it had no intention of withdrawing operations from Australia.None at all. It continues:Australia has been identified as a host of key Ericsson regional centres such as the Regional Supply Centre, Training and Education Centre, Service Centre, Competence Centre and the Global Design Centre among others. With these initiatives in place, Ericsson Australia will continue to build on the high level of competencies available in Australia, strengthening its presence and outlook.All of that stuff completely adds up to nothing.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Aston for his question, and recognise the honourable member's particular interest in important issues such as Australia's relationship with Indonesia. As the honourable member suggests in his question, I will be visiting Indonesia from 8 to 10 July. This will be the first visit to Indonesia by a federal government minister since the installation of the Habibie administration in May of this year.During this visit I want to convey several key messages from the Australian government, and they are essentially, of course, going to be messages of support for Indonesia at this difficult time. Australia is an all-weather friend to Indonesia and its people, and we  will remain a friend of Indonesia for the long haul. We will work with the Indonesian government and we will encourage it to implement not only economic reform but also political reforms which that government is focusing very much on. While I am there, I plan to meet with President Habibie and Foreign Minister Alatas as well as a number of ministers and key community leaders such as Megawati and Amien Rais. It will be an opportunity for me to not only convey some positive messages from Australia but also make my own assessment of the political and economic environment in Indonesia today.While I am in Indonesia, I will also be discussing the issue of East Timor. From Australia's perspective, we very much hope that the constructive discussions that have taken place between President Habibie and Bishop Belo will be the forerunner of further dialogue so that the very tense and difficult environment in East Timor can not only be addressed but become an environment of much greater security and much more comfort than is currently the case. Australia has a very important interest in the situation in East Timor - it being adjacent to Australia and given the history of this issue - and it is important that we engage in discussions with the Indonesian government on that issue, and I shall certainly be doing that during my visit.</DOC>

 - I would like to thank the honourable member for Moore for his question. He no doubt has been sensing my  frustration in bringing forward my private member's bill, which was put forward by me on 6 April 1998.There are few issues before this parliament, I would suggest, as important as an issue that affects more than one million people in Sydney because of aircraft noise and the emissions from those aircraft. I would suggest to anyone who has an electorate that has planes flying over it that this issue is equally important to them. Especially as the use of airports around Australia increases, the issue of noise and the issue of emissions from these aircraft are very serious issues.This matter has been brought to a head because on 25 June, in the Sydney Morning Herald, the Prime Minister himself admitted for the first time, according to reporter Robert Wainwright, that his government cannot meet its aircraft noise sharing promises -  - Mr Speaker, with due respect, this is extremely important because this occurred only a few days ago, with the Prime Minister for the first time publicly admitting that the long-term operating plan for Sydney airport was a sham. In fact, I have been saying that for more than two years. Let me just say that the targets that were promulgated by the minister -  - Mr Speaker, this is why my bill should be brought forward urgently. We now have evidence - if ever we needed evidence - that the emissions from these aircraft at the very least can cause respiratory tract infections and death. Admittedly, on top of that, we have sufficient evidence that the emissions from these aircraft are cancer producing. I raise -  - Mr Speaker, I am not doing that. - Mr Speaker -  - I am not relying at all on hypothetical statements because I have quoted in this parliament before from the report printed in the British Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health , which found that children born near airports -  - Mr Speaker, in regard to the timing, I would like this parliament to know that I have done everything I possibly can to bring this bill on. I think it is very important that every member of this parliament know what is available to a member of parliament to ensure that that member of parliament can bring forward his bill.I then wrote to the minister in charge of the business of this House, I wrote to the minister Peter Reith. I said to him, `When is my bill coming on?' This is what he said to me in his letter of 15 June:Dear Paul,It is not the prerogative of the government to determine when private members bills are scheduled for debate in the House of Representatives, rather it is the responsibility of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Selection.That is fine. Mr Speaker, I then approached the -  - chairman of the Selection Committee. - Mr Speaker, I would like your guidance on this, because this is very, very important to me and my electorate. - Mr Speaker, I want to conclude with what has been said by the  Selection Committee chairman, the Deputy Speaker of the House, in a letter in which he says:Dear Paul,You should know that it is a very rare occurrence for the Selection Committee to agree to a second reading for private members bills.So here we have the Leader of the House saying, `It's not my business, it's the Selection Committee's,' and the Selection Committee chairman writes to me and says, `It's not my business, it's somebody else's business.' So what do I then do, Mr Speaker? I raise the matter with you. - Mr Speaker - who called me a traitor?</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Dunkley for his question and assure the constituents of Dunkley that their member has taken his case directly to me and to the other levels of the government to ensure that the self-funded retirees and superannuants that he represents in Dunkley are given top of the list consideration in relation to tax reform. When he came to see me about this problem, I pointed out that this government has shown a very strong commitment to the self-funded retiree. This was the first government to exempt the pensioner tax rebate to self-funded retirees. This was the government which cut Labor's provisional tax uplift factor of eight per cent down to five per cent. This was the government that gave the gold card to veterans. This was the government that extended the Commonwealth seniors health card to another 220,000 self-funded retirees.I can assure the self-funded retirees and the aged community of Australia that, in relation to taxes and the consideration in tax, they are at the top of the list. They are the people that the government intends to make sure get a square deal out of tax reform in this country. They are the people who are being penalised by the taxation regime as it currently operates. They are the people who throughout the course of their lives have saved for their own retirement, and they are the people who deserve special consideration. I can assure the member for Dunkley that they will get it and that they will be winners under the government's tax reform program.</DOC>

 - I would have thought it would be obvious to anybody, including even the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, that recurrent sums have a net capital value. I would have thought that would be absolutely obvious. You will probably even find in your textbooks called `Garynomics made easy' a capital sum, and it happens in relation to superannuation or any other area. But do not take from that that the reports on the weekend were correct. - We welcome all parts of the question of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. Let me go on to say this - because I think it is important that the self-funded retirement community of Australia understand this - somebody who is living on savings is penalised by high inflation. When inflation under Labor was running at 10 per cent in this country in the eighties, that meant that the value of self-funded retirees -  - Mr Speaker, I always know when he is burned. - Mr Speaker, what it means is that, if inflation is high, and let us say it is 10 per cent, your savings are being undermined. - Right throughout the period of the 1980s when inflation under Labor was high, the capital value of savings was deteriorating. If inflation was at eight per cent, a self-funded retiree was losing eight per cent of the capital value of their savings every year, and over five years this could compound into a 40 per cent reduction in savings. - The final point which can be very quickly finished is this: during that period when self-funded retirees' savings capital value was being eaten away by inflation, what compensation did Labor ever offer them? What compensation did Labor ever offer them? What compensation did Labor offer them for increasing wholesales sales tax? What compensation for increasing petrol excise? What compensation for taking away income tax? This was a party which gave no compensation to the aged in this country, which let them down badly, and it is one of the reasons why our government has treated them so well.</DOC>

 - The one thing our government has recognised is that many women in the community are unable to provide for themselves in their retirement by way of superannuation because of the broken nature of their work pattern and their responsibilities caring for their families. So the Howard government has introduced a range of practical reforms to improve the income security of women in retirement, and those measures address a number of problem areas. They include an 18 per cent tax rebate for spouses who contribute up to $3,000 per annum to the superannuation fund of a low income partner. We have also introduced retirement savings accounts. These assist those people who are seasonal workers who often have a number of different super accounts, and they are now able to consolidate these accounts and reduce the impact of fees and charges on their accumulated savings.We have also extended the age when a person may contribute to superannuation from 65 to 70 years, and this does help women, in particular, to catch up with their contributions.  For many women, full-time entry into the paid work force is often delayed until after their child rearing years are over, which means that they are unable to accumulate like others in the community who have an unbroken time in the work force.The government has also foreshadowed major changes to the treatment of superannuation and divorce, and has put out a position paper on this matter. This is an issue that Labor, when they were in government, were unable to address; they put it in the too-hard basket for over 10 years. We have taken a step to ensure, in that position paper, that we address the issue of the equitable division of superannuation on the dissolution of a marriage - that the family courts have clear guidelines as to the valuation of superannuation savings when a marriage comes to an end and that all parties, importantly, have access to all of the information they require in order to make a decision about the division of assets. It gives couples greater flexibility in determining how assets, including superannuation, are split at the time of the breakdown of a marriage. The Howard government has legislated and will continue to legislate for real and practical changes that will greatly benefit many thousands of Australian women.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Mallee for his question. He is a very effective member for the veteran community in his electorate. In fact, he has many towns in his electorate that go back in history to the early soldier settlement days - some very successful settlements indeed, including Robinvale, which has a very important sister relationship with a town on the western front in France which this weekend will have a very special focus. That town is Villers-Bretonneux.Many members of the parliament, I am sure, are aware that, this weekend, Australia will commemorate its involvement in the First World War. In fact, four veterans of the First World War will shortly be arriving in London - they left Australia yesterday - and, at Villers-Bretonneux war cemetery and at the national memorial, they will receive the Legion of Honour from the French government. They will be the first Allied veterans in the world to receive that very high award from the French government. I know that all Australians will see that as a great gesture by the French government.But I come back to the point of the member's question. I am well aware that there are excellent health services available in the electorate of Mallee, but, quite often, veterans  have to travel long distances to access health services that are not available out there in Mallee. As I outlined in my ministerial statement to the House last week, the implementation of this policy has made it a lot easier for many veterans in rural Australia to not only access better health care but also get the support of the federal government.I want to outline some of those key points in relation to assisting veterans from remote and rural Australia to gain access to better health care if they have to travel. Firstly, by combining the accommodation rates and meal payments, we have been able to make one allowance. That has meant the veterans now receive around a 20 per cent increase in their daily rate. We also now pay a mileage allowance for veterans who travel on public transport for treatment. In addition to that, we also pay allowances for those who use their own transport, and we have increased the mileage rates by 6.6 per cent.We have also introduced payments for stays in private accommodation. In the past, many veterans have stayed with relatives or in private accommodation and have not been assisted; we now meet that commitment. We have also introduced a new allowance to cover the attendance of someone who has to travel with a veteran, like a carer or perhaps a family member. We also reimburse some parking costs associated with health treatment.The allowance to cover carers travelling with a veteran is particularly important because quite often it is traumatic for a veteran to have to leave home where they have the support of relatives or friends, and assisting that carer to travel with them certainly assists those veterans to make that transition from their home to where they receive treatment.I commend the progress report on the implementation of the health policy for the veteran community in rural and remote areas to members of the parliament; it is a way in which we are making sure that we target our assistance to our veterans who live outside metropolitan Australia. I thank the member for Mallee for his question.</DOC>

 - The government has been very active in ensuring that foreign corporations pay Australian tax. We have introduced thin capitalisation rules to ensure that foreign corporations are not able to take advantage of excessive deductions in Australia. We have introduced new foreign investment fund rules to do the same thing and we have been active in relation to transfer pricing.Australian residents who derive income from businesses or personal exertion in Australia would normally be expected to pay Australian tax and the money would come through the Australian system. So I was rather surprised to see that one of the co-owners of One Nation Ltd, Mr David Ettridge, who was apparently paid $150,000 according to the Sydney Morning Herald, was receiving payments through a company which was incorpo  rated in Port Vila, a company called Global Communications Ltd.Just to give a bit of background to this, Mr Ettridge was prosecuted by the Australian Taxation Office for unpaid taxes in August 1992. In September of 1993 a company called Global Communications Ltd was incorporated in the republic of Vanuatu. According to the Sydney Morning Herald, on 13 September 1997 World Vision paid $150,000 to this company, not in Port Vila but in Sydney. According to the Sydney Morning Herald the company Global Communications is not required to pay income tax or exchange duties in Vanuatu.When another of the co-owners of One Nation Ltd, David Oldfield, was asked about this on television on Sunday he said that Mr Ettridge had been employed in Vanuatu. He said:He works for somebody in Vanuatu. He is employed by them at that end. That is how the fundraising business that he was involved in where he was working for World Vision.That is certainly not World Vision's account. According to World Vision, the business was in Australia and the money was paid in Australia, not in Vanuatu, which is a foreign tax haven.I raise these issues for this reason: the public is owed an explanation. There may be an innocent explanation. It is becoming quite apparent that Mr Oldfield and Mr Ettridge have grabbed control of the One Nation Party and are two of the directors of One Nation Ltd. It is clear from revelations in today's press that they are directing the activities of the company and the party. The party's national spokesman ought to have a thorough investigation into the Vanuatu connection. The party's spokesman should hold an immediate press conference and detail the nature of the commissions that Mr Ettridge is on. There should be a full explanation as to whether or not Australian source income has been properly accounted for in relation to taxation matters and whether an advantage is being taken of a foreign tax haven.If it were the case that Australians who are Australian residents were able to divert funds through foreign tax havens the only losers  would be the honest Australian taxpayers. They would be the losers because it is the honest PAYE taxpayer, who has to pay full tax in the dollar, who will have to make that up. They do not have the opportunity to set up companies in Vanuatu.All I am saying is what is on the public record, but the public is now owed a full explanation and the sooner it is given the better.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dunkley. - The Leader of the Opposition interjects about small business. In small business in the area of Frankston, in the member's seat, the fact is that this policy, if ever implemented, would be a disaster for jobs. It is anti-small business. -  - The Leader of the Opposition talks about job security. This policy, which the Labor Party announced this morning, is actually being acted out by the shoppies union  in Victoria. It has got a log of claims against 30,000-odd businesses, which would cost 20,000 jobs in Victoria alone. It is claiming triple time for weekend work, and that is endorsed by the Labor Party. Why is it endorsed by the Labor Party? You only have to look at the donations made by the shoppies union to the Labor Party in the last few years to know. In 1996-97, you got $571,000 from the shoppies union. In 1995-96, you got $879,000 from the shoppies union. - The personal comments of the Leader of the Opposition reveal how sensitive he is. You have been bought off by the shoppies union, and the people who will pay for this are the thousands of people in small business who will lose their jobs as a result. Instead of the personal remarks, why don't you have the guts to stand up and defend your policy? This policy in action, as we are seeing already in Victoria, will add 25 per cent to the cost of small business, and that will mean a lot of people will lose their jobs. This is the Labor Party's policy in action. He talks about Labor's previous policy, but the fact is that, though you are today attacking award simplification, you used to be in favour of it.What incredible hypocrisy. Your only objection to the fact that we have done it is that you were unable to do so. Why were you unable to do so? You have been bought off by the trade unions as usual - in dollars and cents - against the interests of the people who you claim to represent. Not only will they undo award simplification, which is a tremendous benefit to workers; they will also repeal the secondary boycott provisions of the Trade  Practices Act which have given this country the lowest level of disputes since 1940. You people, before the last election, said if the coalition was elected there would be an increase in disputes. Since we have been in, we have a record low level of industrial disputes. Labor's policy means not less disputes but more industrial disputes. What will be the consequences of that? More job losses in the Australian community.It is about time the Leader of the Opposition stood up to these trade union bosses, stood up for small business and stood up for the people who need a job. What a fascinating contrast there is between the Australian Labor Party and the Labour Party in the UK. In the UK, Tony Blair came in and he said, `We can't go back to the policies when Labour was last in office. We need a new approach,' and he abandoned the links with the trade union movement. He actually went to a trade union congress and told them that the old days of union bosses dictating policy had to be over. In conclusion, what an irony it is that Mr Beazley's biography is now being written and the foreword is to be signed off by Tony Blair, a leader who has what it takes to deal with the union movement - instead of the subservient policy which you have today released.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Wannon for his question, and I acknowledge the work that he has done as chairman of the parliamentary committee in this area. Today, 1 July, Australia has a new system for financial regulation. It is probably the biggest overhaul of Australia's financial regulation system ever. Today two new bodies commenced: the Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority - APRA - which, for the first time, will regulate prudential requirements across all deposit taking institutions, including banks and superannuation authorities including, as the states join the system, state based institutions. What that means is that banks will no longer have their own specific regulator. There will be a general regulator which will allow institutions the same kind of regulatory supervision that previously was available only for banks.Today, 1 July, a new corporate and consumer regulator is instituted - the Australian Securities and Investment Commission - which completes the twin peaks doctrine of prudential regulation and consumer regulation. This is the body which will be a one-stop shop for consumers in relation to financial products and a one-stop shop for business in relation to corporate and consumer regulation. I had the privilege of launching both APRA and ASIC in Sydney this morning.In addition to this, the government's reforms include the passing of a company law review bill in relation to meetings and company procedures, the institution of real time gross settlement in the payments system for the Reserve Bank and legislation which has recently been passed to allow credit unions and building societies to issue their own cheques. This is a great improvement, particularly for rural and regional Australia which can have access to credit unions that can now, for the first time in Australian history, issue their own cheques and compete equally in relation to the banks.But it does not stop there. The government's reforms include the corporate law economic reform program, which is going to revolutionise directors' duties, takeovers and fundraising and make it easier for small business to raise funds. That bill will be coming into the parliament next week. Some of the benefits that arise from this state-of-the-art leading edge financial regulation include the fact that we are now getting increased and heightened competition in the financial sector. One of the advantages of increased competition in the financial sector is the fact that, since the government has encouraged competition in the financial sector, the margin on home loans by banks and other financial institutions has fallen two per cent. That is a two per cent benefit for Australian home buyers as a result of competition. 	I know the Labor Party is opposed to competition and I know it is engaged now in a direct race with Ms Hanson to try to steal backward looking economic agendas. One of the great benefits of competition in the financial sector is that we have got official interest rates down from 10½ per cent as they were under Labor to 6½ per cent with a two per cent cut as a result of extra competition on mortgages. That means for the average family - since this government was elected - a saving of over $3,000 a year on the standard variable home mortgage.I say this to the Labor Party opposite: we know that their backward looking economic policies will, as sure as night follows day, lead to higher interest rates. The Labor Party is the party that gave Australia home mort  gage interest rates of 17 per cent. That was the Labor policy on home mortgage interest rates. On this side of the House, we believe in giving young home buyers a go, giving them opportunity, giving them low interest rates and giving them money back in their pockets.</DOC>

 - Once again, I will investigate the assertions that have been made. - Seven out of ten, you get the facts wrong - and that is a pretty good reason to investigate. While I am answering that question, can I remind the House that the government very strongly supports the attempts made by different sections of the community to prevent the exploitation and unfair treatment of outworkers within the Australian community. I would also remind the member for Canberra that concern about the treatment of outworkers did not commence on 2 March 1996. I can remember the first occasion I discussed this matter at length was with an officer of the relevant union. That person indicated to me that it was an issue that had been around and of concern to the union and many other people under the governments of both sides of politics in Australia. Any attempt by the member for Canberra to try and persuade the Australian public that, after them being in power for 13  years and having done nothing to stop the problem, somehow or other the problem -  - The member for Canberra asked me a question about the exploitation of outworkers. What I am saying to the member for Canberra is that for 13 years of Labor government outworkers were exploited. For 13 years you had an opportunity to do something about it; for 13 years you allowed it to go on. You have no moral authority to thump the table and now say the outrage started on 2 March. You did nothing about it for 13 years and you have no credentials to lecture us on this or, indeed, any other matter.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Swan for his question. Today the government puts into place two of the key elements in its comprehensive strategy to address the problem of entrenched youth unemployment. One of these is the youth allowance and the second is the new arrangements for young people on the dole. From today every young person 18 to 24 years of age who passes six months on unemployment benefit will need to do an additional activity in order to continue receiving the unemployment allowance. The base basic principle underlying this measure is, of course, the principle of mutual obligation. The community recognises a strong obligation to young people and the need to  support young people on the dole. In return, the community believes it is fair that young people should do something to increase their own employment prospects and put something back into the community.Under the policy which commences today, young people will have the choice of activity to meet their mutual obligation requirements. They will be able to undertake voluntary activity within the community; they will be able to undertake part-time work. The government is investing some $465 million over the next four years to provide other avenues for constructive job experience. One of those is work for the dole; the other one is important literacy and numeracy training for those young people who have come out of the school system without those skills. If young people do not satisfy these requirements, their dole could be reduced. It is an obligation, but it is also an opportunity. It is an opportunity for young people to take charge of their own future and to make a choice to do something that will actually help their employment prospects.What a fundamental change this is from the dole system that Labor favours. Labor favoured a dole system which encouraged young people to go on the dole. Labor's message to young people was that the dole was an alternative lifestyle; the dole was there as an alternative to work and to gaining useful work experience. Labor's message was it was okay to be on the dole. That is not our message. Under the Leader of the Opposition youth unemployment reached 34 per cent - 135,000 unemployed teenagers. The Labor Party betrayed a generation of young people. It is up to this government to take hold of the fundamental issues which underlie youth unemployment - the lack of literacy and numeracy skills and the lack of proper opportunities for the 70 per cent who do not go on to university. Today we are putting into place the policies that will completely change the incentive on the dole for young people. Instead of the negative message from the Labor Party, we are putting in place a positive message that gives young people the chance to do something to improve their employment prospects in the future.</DOC>

 - This is a patently absurd question and it shows that the Labor Party has completely abandoned the many things which they themselves thought were a good idea when they were in office. I take you back - and it is not so long ago - to October 1993. The then minister, who is now your colleague sitting next to you -  - This question is based on the implementation of a policy known as award simplification, which the Labor Party itself supported. The member for Kingsford-Smith, when he was the minister, said this in October 1993:This legislation marks the culmination of the government's break with the past . . .And he went on to say it was specifically in respect of -  - Yes, I will come to that point. You specifically said:The amendments are also directed at making awards more streamlined and modern, with detailed prescription about the organisation of work increasingly being a matter for agreements. - Just to finish off before the irrelevant interjections -  - Just to conclude - to perhaps explain the system as it was introduced by Labor to the Leader of the Opposition - the fact of the matter is that you boasted about the number of people who had agreements, in other words, whose agreements were subject to the no disadvantage test to displace the operation of the underlying award. - This really is a frivolous and irrelevant point of order. - To conclude, the point I make is that in this particular respect we are doing exactly the thing that you yourself said was a good idea. And it is absolutely incredible hypocrisy for you to even put up such a question.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for La Trobe for his question and I say, like Douglas MacArthur, `He will return.' The seasonally adjusted retail sales rose by 0.5 per cent in May after rising 0.2 per cent in April. The rise was above market expectations and suggests continuing growth in retail trade in Australia. The outcome is consistent with budget forecasts and reflects largely strong growth in food retailing, clothing and soft  goods  retailing,  and  hospitality  and services.The trend estimate in relation to retail trade increased in May - its 20th consecutive monthly increase - and that indicates continuing growth in retailing on a sustained basis. Housing approvals, which were also released today, point to healthy continuing economic activity. Although there was a 6.8 per cent fall in May, this followed a 12.1 per cent increase over the previous two months and the trend remains positive. Approvals have risen 8.1 per cent over the year to May. As I said at the time of the release of the March quarter national accounts, which showed exceptionally strong growth in the Australian economy of 4.9 per cent, we were not predicting 4.9 per cent over the course of the year until June 1998 and our budget forecast was 3¾, which would be consistent with the next quarter coming off the record of the March quarter.These figures suggest that retailing is maintaining domestic strength, led principally of course by the low interest rates, which have given savings to average Australians and have come off a low inflation base, and the extent of this government's fiscal rectification of Labor's $10 billion deficit.I make the point, as I have on a number of occasions to this House, that, if this government had not turned around Labor's $10 billion deficit, if we had not got the Australian budget back into the black and if we had not run a proper fiscal policy, we would not have been able to keep inflation low and keep interest rates down for home buyers. Nothing could affect home buyers and small businesses more than Labor's plan to run Australia back into the red and Labor's plan to get Australia back into deficit with unfunded promises and with unfunded tax policies.It is important at a time like this that Australia continues to rectify its budget position, continues to run down and repay Labor debt, and gets the Australian accounts back into a position where we can sustain a low interest rate regime with good spending opportunities, good housing opportunities and good home buying opportunities for young Australians. </DOC>

 - Thank you for the question. It is timely that there is a question today regarding the reserves, because today I have literally just come from Sydney where 10,000 reservists and former members of the CMF and reserve are marching, with a great deal of pride, to honour the 50th anniversary of establishment of the reserves. Today, in case you did not know, is Reserve Forces Day. I will be in Brisbane on Sunday when reservists will also march there. The important thing about the reserves is that, yes, there is indeed a reliance on reservists forming an important part of the ADF. There is an important emphasis put by this government on liaising with employers in order that those employers can see the benefit that having a reservist in their employ gives to them. - I think the rest of the people in this chamber and the people who watch are getting sick to death of the carping that goes on from the likes of you. The fact of the matter is that the way you treated the defence of this nation was a disgrace. What you left behind and the mess we had to clean up -  - I said yesterday that the Leader of the Opposition forgets his place often, and he is doing it again today. - Very simply, this government is committed to seeing reserves having a very important role to play with the ADF. The question of leave and the question of the value of reservists to employers, which we are promoting, is a question to be negotiated between employers and their employees. Those I saw marching with a great deal of pride today show that this system is working very well. Today, Reserve Forces Day, is a time when we can all celebrate the fact that there are many Australians who give of their time, who give of their energy, to ensure that we can have people who can defend this country.</DOC>

 - I accept your injunction, Mr Speaker. In fact, I was a severe critic of those policies and would accept no responsibility for them. -  - I was shadow minister for social security, as you know. Your colleagues have had some things to say about that from time to time. We have been about introducing a fairer and simpler social security system, one which is better targeted and more consistent and which has significant and improved compliance associated with it. You have already heard from my colleague the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs about the implications of the youth allowance, which comes into operation today. I will not elaborate on that save to say that, of the 560,000 young people affected by it, 153,750 will receive more money and 361,200 will be on the same benefits. - A very insignificant number by comparison. Overall, Australia benefits significantly by having in place a system which encourages people to upgrade their skills to be able to enter effectively into the work force instead of being encouraged to remain on benefits, as occurred under your government. But I am trying to obey your injunction, Mr Speaker, not to make those comparisons.We also introduced from today the deferred pension bonus plan. That is a very important new initiative. It is one that I took some personal responsibility for encouraging my parties to adopt and is one that ensures that older Australians who choose to work longer will be significantly better off. It gives them a choice, it is voluntary, but it offers them a far more secure retirement. It means that the community as a whole can be better off. Taxpayers will be better off. What it means is that women after age 61 and men after age 65, if they continue to work, will be able to receive a bonus, and if they remain in the work force for five years they will be entitled to a full pension as well as a bonus of $21,250. In the case of a couple, that could be as high as $35,450. It is tax free. It is a very  substantial benefit which commences from today, and it is one that I think indicates clearly that we are about addressing issues of ageism, where previously people who had very significant skills and were able to continue in the work force were literally forced out.This is a day when families who have children with disabilities will be considerably better off as well. We have a situation where the domiciliary nursing care benefit will rise by 29 per cent to $75.10 per fortnight. We have a situation where the carer payments will now allow carers to undertake longer absences to study, train and work without losing their benefits. We have a situation where those families with profoundly disabled children will now be able to qualify for a carer payment. We have the provision of influenza injections for pensioners, which is an important related initiative. We have a situation where the families who do not qualify for the child disability allowance but have a child with a less severe disability or a chronic medical condition may be eligible for a health care card to help with the cost of medication and other expenses. That is on top of the very significant record we have in the social security area in relation to the $1 billion family tax initiative, the parenting changes that were introduced from 20 March 1998, the jobs, education and training program, which was extended, and the families that will no longer lose family allowance when their child goes overseas. I could go on and on, but my colleagues would not encourage me to do that.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker -  - I will analyse the details of the case that has been put to me by the member for Jagajaga, as I do with all such cases, and if there is anything I can specifically say about it, I will.I take the opportunity afforded by the honourable member's question to say a few things about the youth allowance. I inform the House that, of the 560,000 young people covered by the youth allowance, payments for 361,200 will remain unchanged, and that is 64 per cent; payments for 153,750 will increase - I repeat: payment for 153,750 will  rise - and that is 27½ per cent; and payment for 45,000 will reduce or cut out entirely, which is eight per cent.I remind the House of the philosophy behind the youth allowance. The philosophy is about altering the incentive so that people will choose work and training rather than the dole. We had a very interesting illustration today - and I want every member of the House and those present in the gallery to listen to this very careful reflection by the member for Batman which reveals the philosophy of the Australian Labor Party towards the dole. This is what he had to say in answer to a searching question from Gareth McCray on radio station 2KY. I ask all members to listen very carefully to this. He said:. . . and I say, you know, they - meaning those receiving the unemployment benefits - are entitled to see their mates now and then and it is not a question of trying to keep them at home in front of the TV, you actually want them to be out there mixing with people and being socially oriented so an employer wants to employ them.In other words, the philosophy of the dole is that you provide them with an alternative lifestyle of living on the dole. That is what you are on about. You are on about providing people with an alternative lifestyle of living on the dole, whereas the purpose of our youth allowance is to provide an additional expenditure of $212 million. The youth allowance does not involve saving expenditure. Those who sit opposite would have you believe that the youth allowance is about cutting expenditure. The youth allowance is not about cutting expenditure; the youth allowance is about altering the attitude to the dole in the Australian community.The youth allowance is about saying to young people, `We want you to choose staying at school, going into a job or going into training instead of going onto the dole.' Under the policies of the Labor Party, going on the dole and staying on the dole was a real live option that they actually encouraged, whereas under the philosophy of my party the purpose of the youth allowance is to do the exact opposite. I reject the claims made by those who sit opposite. The youth allowance  is about altering those incentives. The youth allowance is about encouraging young people to stay at school, to train or to seek a job in preference to going on the dole.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Wakefield for his question. I am sure that there are a lot of aviation operators and consumers in his area who are going to benefit from today's announcement by our government - that is, that the unfair avgas tax has been abolished from today, 1 July. This is the first instalment of our government's commitment to taxation reform in Australia. This was an unfair tax - a tax which levied some $17 million at a rate of about 13c a litre. The people who will benefit the most from the abolition of this tax are the people in the bush, the general aviation operators in rural and remote Australia. - They have been paying the tax on avgas, but rarely, if ever, using Airservices Australia's services that this tax was going to pay for. That is what the member for Melbourne is interjecting about. It is important to note that the people paying this tax were not necessarily using the services it was going to pay for. So we have abolished this tax and we are going to see a much fairer regime in its place. This means real savings for farmers in the electorate of the member for Wakefield. Abolishing the avgas tax will keep down the cost of using aircraft to spread fertilisers, spray crops and muster stock. It will mean savings of up to $10,000 per plane per year to rural and remote operators of air services. For every GA operator, it is 13c per litre off their annual avgas bill forever. It has been abolished and people should recognise this.This decision has been welcomed by industry. I received a fax - and the Labor Party are good at quoting local constituents - interest  ingly, from a company in the electorate of the member for Wakefield. It is from Loxton Engineering Works, which operates light aircraft and sells produce into regional South Australia. The fax said:Minister, we recognise and applaud your work in eliminating the unfair Airservices avgas levy.We operate a light aircraft in our agricultural manufacturing and sales business over much of rural Australia.The fuel levy in the past has forced us to pay for services we did not use.After 1 July 1998 we can select and pay only for the services we require.Our appreciation to you and the Coalition Government.That fax from Loxton Engineering Works in the Riverland is a sign of the understanding in rural and remote Australia of the commitment of the Howard-Fischer government to taxation reform that provides fairness to rural and remote Australia.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kalgoorlie for his question. He raises the difficulties being faced by the pork industry - and I might add the citrus industry. I say at the outset that the government recognises that there is no such thing as a level playing field and we deal within that parameter to help industry. In fact, taxpayers of Australia have given a $28 million leg-up for both the pork and the citrus industries by giving them help where it is needed, particularly in facilitating their longer term export strategy. The problem is the short-term, and I accept that. What have we done there? We have announced a safe  guards measure under article 19, which was not activated by our predecessors but which is being activated on a generic basis with the first reference being specific to the pork industry, and the Treasurer has now signed the reference to allow that to go ahead.To come to the particularity of the question, it is a fact that overall trade is in balance between Australia and Canada, but on agricultural goods we enjoy a surplus with Canada of about 8:1. With regard to the world, I point out that Australian farmers are so efficient that they produce five times more than we can consume in Australia, so the economic keys of hope for our farmers are represented by viably exporting to the world the other four-fifths. The House might like to know the pig meat exports, both wild and farm, from July 1997 to February 1998 country by country - I just happen to have this with me. Some $18 million worth of pork is being exported to Japan. I was at a piggery near Corowa last week seeing containers being loaded with high quality Australian brand-marked pork going to Japan. That is an expanding trade, which I welcome. We export to China, Korea and New Zealand as well. I admire and recognise the efforts by our pork industry to boost their exports. They recognise they need to do more and they need the chance to do so more. Exports to New Zealand were $4 million. Exports to Holland in Europe were $2.4 million. Exports even to the Russian federation were $2.7 million, as that economy comes back into line. Exports to France and Germany totalled over $7 million. My colleague John Anderson, the Prime Minister, John Howard, and I recognise fully that the pork and citrus industries are in a very difficult part of their cycle. We have no magic wands and we have no false solutions for them, but we do have specific targeted help to boost their export efforts, including from the Queensland pork industry, to the world.Finally, it is the sugar industry itself which has voiced concern about what Canada may or may not do. I do not make any specific comment on that, other than to say that at this stage it is in essence hypothetical. We are going about this in a workman-like way so  that the action that may or may not be taken based on the commission inquiry will be unchallengeable by Canada or anybody else.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Kooyong for his question on this matter. His undoubted interest and expertise in this area is well known. I welcome the opportunity to have something to say about the nature and scope of the immigration program and the views that we can move to a situation which is loosely described as `net zero migration'. The first point I would make is that the immigration program we have today is about half the size that it was 10 years ago. It has been very significantly reduced. At the moment there are 68,000 in the immigration program, with 12,000 refugee places. It is a rebalanced program; one which is highly skilled. It is a program that has been - if I can coin the phrase - `de-shammed'. What happened before under our predecessors, particularly in the family reunion area, was that we had considerable scope for abuse which allowed many people to enter Australia who were not in bona fide relationships.Today we have a very tightly administered family reunion program. It is a program in which 70 per cent have an English language capacity before they arrive in Australia and the balance have an opportunity to obtain it under our adult migrant English training programs which are in place. Those programs are in place to meet the needs of those people who require them. -  - I do not wish to invoke the Speaker's injunction, but let me make it very clear that we provided additional support for training in the adult migrant education program -  - Yes, additional support in the forward estimates. We are running forward an additional $4 million for this year, last year and another two years forward. That is to deal specifically with those who have had difficulty in obtaining entry to those programs because they have come as refugees and are not necessarily able to enter into structured education programs.The point I want to make is that we have significantly addressed the abuse that was in the program. We have significantly addressed the balancing of that program. Those who talk about an alternative of net zero migration need to understand that they are talking about an immigration program of 30,000 people. How do you get to a program of 30,000 people? We heard today that one way you do it - because you do not want to say that you will not welcome refugees - is that you say, `We will provide temporary entry. Wait until you want to go back. But, if your children are born in Australia, they will be Australian.' I do not know how it can be characterised as temporary entry. - I was not sure who to believe, Graeme, in relation to that. I heard the honourable member for Oxley make one comment and I heard an alleged spokesman say something else. I suppose if I need an adviser sitting beside me to answer the questions, the adviser ought to be sitting in the chair. But the fact is that the adviser put one view and the member for Oxley put another. I take it that the member for Oxley has a view, and that is that refugee children ought to be Australian. That is the comment that was put. But the fact is that what she is saying is, `We won't count refugees as part of the program.' That is how we can get it down to 30,000.What does she say about the balance? She says 60 per cent will be `close family reunion'. That means 20,000. I have to tell you that `close family reunion' - if you include a wife, a de facto partner or a fiance - numbers 24,000 under the program that we have put down for this year. That is demand driven. If you include their dependent children you have got another 2,000. So there  are at least 4,000 people in close family relationships without any of the others such as last remaining relatives, special need relatives and orphaned children - there are a range of them - who would not be able to obtain entry to Australia.	She says in relation to the balance that there would be 20 per cent for business migration and 20 per cent for skilled migration. What she is saying in effect is that instead of a skilled migration program of 30,000 which is highly beneficial to Australia, she would have a program of 10,000. What she would effectively be doing is what Mr Campbell once described to me as the `deskilling of Australia'. Something of the order of 30,000 young Australians, highly trained young Australians, leave Australia each year. What she would say in relation to the immigration program is that we should make sure that, essentially, unskilled people dominate it, and that skilled people who are able to obtain work, who are able to generate additional economic activity and who would create jobs for Australians are not able to come. - I have to tell you that not only do the figures not add up; now that we have got more detailed explanations, the situation is that the views that are being put are quite absurd as well.</DOC>

Not feeling as though you should leave it at that, you tax flavoured milk, you tax fruit juice, biscuits, ice-cream, cutlery, the fridge, the dishwasher, the cooker and the microwave. They are all taxed at 12 per cent. Milk -  - The Minister for Foreign Affairs said people have been bored by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, but never ever rattled. I say to the member for Prospect that her question is all of a piece with the pattern of questions that have been asked by the opposition. I understand the little game that you are playing. The Australian public know that it is a game. The Australian public will make a judgment on our tax policy when it comes out.I lead a coalition that, unlike the Australian Labor Party, has the courage to tackle serious issues. I lead a coalition that does not go around scaring people. I lead a coalition that is willing to take on long-term economic reform and, despite any short-term political criticism and despite any short-term political adversity, I continue -  - I would say to the House that I do not intend to be deterred by short-term political circumstances, or by the scare tactics of the opposition, from pursuing my commitment and the commitment of my government to bring to Australian families and to the Australian community long-overdue taxation reform. We remain committed to reforming the Australian taxation system. You can run the frivolous scare campaign; you can enjoy yourselves in the luxury of asking these questions but, when the policy comes out, the Australian people will say that the coalition stands for fairness, and the Labor Party and One Nation look backward into Australia's past.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Parkes for his question and I commend him on his keen interest in providing a fair trading environment for primary producers and other industries within his electorate and around Australia. Last week the Senate passed the government's new anti-dumping legislation. As a result, Australian industry will now be protected from unfair dumped or subsidised products in the fastest and fairest way in the world. We have delivered on another government election promise. There will be a commitment - a final decision - in 155 days where there are complaints of dumping or subsidisation of products coming into this country, and there will be interim duties available at day 60.Let us contrast what this government has actually achieved with the position of the Labor Party. The honourable member for Hotham - who is very keen at giving advice on these matters - said, when he was defend  ing the system introduced by Labor, that it could not be done any faster. It could not be done any faster when Labor was in government but, when they went into opposition, he accused us of being too slow at bringing this new system into place. It is now in place; this government has acted. But where is the Labor Party now? I was amazed, after all of the advice that the member for Hotham has been given, that his union masters put out a media release yesterday demanding that the government delay the introduction of this legislation. The CFMEU and the Tasmanian AMWU want the legislation delayed. So where does the member for Hotham stand now? Is it too fast or is it too slow?I can assure the citrus growers, the pork growers and the workers in the paper industry that we will not be taking the advice of the trade union movement. We will be implementing this legislation immediately. In fact, the new anti-dumping system is open for business. If there are industries in Australia which believe that their products are being damaged by unfair imports that have been subsidised or dumped, we are ready to hear their case and to deliver appropriate and fair protection for those industries.</DOC>

The honourable member for North Sydney is one of many members on this side of the House who show a great deal of interest in important international issues. I do not think the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith should nod in agreement because he has not asked a question of me all year - and it is now July. -  - No mock indignation from you. You are the chairman of the tactics committee and you don't ever give him a question. The Australian government is concerned at the recent announcement that the Israeli government has partially approved plans to expand the boundaries of Jerusalem, a move that could see land currently classified as being in the West Bank brought under Jerusalem's direct municipal authority. We have repeatedly expressed the view that unilateral action on the ground by either side only serves to complicate the very difficult negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians. The expansion of Jerusalem to take in Jewish settlements in the West Bank would constitute such a unilateral action of concern. The United States, the European Union and the United Nations Secretary-General himself have expressed similar concerns about the potential of such a decision to complicate negotiations.Our policy has been, and remains, that the status of Jerusalem should be negotiated as  part of final status negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians. Again, as I did on my recent visit to the region, I urge all those involved to redouble their efforts to ensure that the Middle East peace process regains the momentum which, frankly, it has lost.</DOC>

 - I am aware that the Australian Labor Party is unhappy that a deal has been reached on the native title legislation. I am aware also that it is the Australian Labor Party that has wanted to fan division on this issue within the Australian community. I have also been wanting to know - as have many Australians - whether the Leader of the Opposition will give an undertaking to the Australian community that, if the Senate passes the amended bill in accordance with the arrangement reached between the government and Senator Harradine, the Australian Labor Party will give an undertaking that, if it is ever elected to office, it would not seek to repeal that bill. I think the farmers of Australia will want to know whether Kim Beazley is in favour of the settlement or is against it. - I think the Australian public will want to know where the Labor Party stands on certainty for Australian farmers. Does the Australian Labor Party support a settlement that gives security and predictibility to the rural community of Australia or does the Australian Labor Party want to continue the five years of uncertainty that it created commencing with the 1993 Native Title Act? It ought to be said very firmly that the source of this problem lies in the Keating Native Title Act. - I know that every farmer and every person interested in the mining industry in Australia knows that the uncertainty, the doubt and the hesitation in relation to native title are a direct consequence of the Keating Native Title Bill. At long last an arrangement has been reached that will resolve that uncertainty.On the question of compensation, an arrangement was reached in relation to compensation provision of 75 and 25. I have indicated already that there will be further discussion on that issue. The assertion made by the Leader of the Opposition is again wrong.  There has been no buying off. The doubt and concern that he raises about billions of dollars are, once again, a fanciful exaggeration.</DOC>

 - As the House is aware, an arrangment - sorry, Mr Speaker? - No, Mr Speaker. - I do not think the member for O'Connor would ever suggest that I was responsible for the Labor Party.As the House will be aware, an agreement was made yesterday between the government and Senator Brian Harradine to give effect to certain amendments to the Native Title Act. If that new amended bill passes through the parliament it will, after a delay of almost five years, bring an end to an enormous amount of doubt that has hung over land title management in this country as a result of the incompetently drawn Native Title Act of 1993; a piece of legislation that was drawn in blatant disregard of the interests of the states of Australia, particularly states such as Western Australia where 82 per cent of the land mass of the state is now under native title claim.May I say that a comment made by the Premier of Western Australia, Mr Court, this morning to the effect that you are dealing  here with an issue where the legislation is made at a federal level but it is the responsibility of the states to administer land management issues is a point entirely lost by the former Labor government, because the Native Title Act we now grapple with was, in fact, drawn in blatant disregard of the interests of states such as Western Australia. I have got to say that the Leader of the Opposition, who comes from Western Australia, has sold out the interests of his home state on this issue from start to finish. The Leader of the Opposition has paid no regard to the interests of the people of Western Australia or the great resource industry of Western Australia.By reaching this agreement the government has brought the uncertainty, the delay and the obscurity to an end. The government has provided certainty to Australia's farmers and, most importantly, it has provided a regime that treats all Australians equally. The main reason we were not prepared to accept the amendments inserted by the Senate was that those amendments gave rights to one section of the Australian community that were not available to others. It is a cardinal principle of this government's approach to the affairs of this country that we treat all Australians equally. We do not give one set of rights to one group and say to another group, `You can get by with inferior rights.' The reason why we oppose the right to negotiate was that that right to negotiate created rights for one section of the Australian community that were not available to others.It stands as a matter of the public record that the Labor Party is in favour of the inequality of rights of the Australian people; that the Labor Party wants a native title act that says that there should be rights available to the indigenous community that are not available to other sections of the Australian community. That position was repeated this morning by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and it has been repeated by the Leader of the Opposition.I note that the settlement reached with Senator Harradine has been widely supported within the Australian community. It has been supported by the National Farmers Federation, it has been supported by the Minerals Council  of Australia and it has been supported by state governments. I believe it is a fair and balanced settlement. When the act is implemented by this parliament it will bring to an end almost five years of obscurity, delay and hesitation. It will bring to an end almost five years of legal uncertainty. It will bring to an end a failed attempt to create an inequality of rights within the Australian community.It is an honourable settlement. It is a fair settlement. It treats all Australians equally. If the Labor Party had the interests of the Australian community at heart, they would give their full support to the agreement that I have reached with Senator Harradine.</DOC>

 - The member who asked the question was not a member of the Labor subcommittee in 1994, but let me say that, during the whole period Labor was in office, they had the choice to advocate significant reform on the waterfront and on every occasion they failed to exercise the national leadership that was necessary. We make no apology for the fact that this government has advocated significant reform of the Australian waterfront and through 1996 and 1997 was prepared to sit down, not just with employers but with unions, and demand some significant reform. Instead of you carping on about it, the fact is that you ought to have been publicly advocating the very reforms that we ourselves have implemented. What a refreshing change it has been to have a government that is prepared to take some national leadership.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Indi for his question. The government's objective with native title has been to bring certainty, fairness and workability into Australia's land management system. The land management system under Labor's legislation following the High Court's Wik decision has led to great uncertainty. Under Labor's legislation, the Commonwealth has spent more than $200 million on native title, but there have been virtually no determinations made. People have been in the courts for nearly five years without making any real progress.The agreement achieved by the Prime Minister will bring certainty and it will bring fairness to the law. The government has had significant legal advice throughout the negotiating process which confirms that our approach is constitutionally valid. A clear example of how certainty will be achieved is in relation to the interaction of the Native Title Act and the RDA. The changes made to the Native Title Amendment Bill by Labor and the minor parties in the Senate earlier this year, which were expressly rejected back in 1993 by Labor, would have in effect promoted litigation by parties to use the RDA to challenge in court virtually any action taken under the Native Title Act. This would not have promoted certainty; it would have, in fact, promoted great uncertainty.The agreement reached will confirm the High Court's interpretation of the current position as to the interaction between the two acts. It will not allow the courts to go further than the High Court's current position and it will ensure that actions which comply with  the Native Title Act and are valid are not subject to separate challenge under the RDA.Labor's unproductive response to the agreement reached by the Prime Minister has been to create alarm. The Leader of the Opposition in his own words has claimed that it will cause endless litigation. - That is wrong. What everybody wants in a legal system is certainty. That is what is wanted by miners, by farmers, by native title claimants and by tourist operators, and that what they will get under the government's proposals. The government's proposals will lead to certainty and they will lead to fairness.</DOC>

I invite the Leader of the Opposition to table the document and I would be very happy to have a look at it. - As to the substance of the issue, of course the government wanted waterfront reform; of course, we were going to be active; of course, we were going to work hard to achieve waterfront reform - because that is what we campaigned on. -  - I am very proud of the fact that the government I lead wanted to deliver a reformed Australian waterfront and it remains to the eternal discredit of the Australian Labor Party that it opposed those efforts. - Go on; table it.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Leichhardt for his question. I would like to advise him, the member for Capricornia  and others that I will go to Longreach at 6 p.m. on Saturday for the purpose of having interface and dialogue with the good people of Longreach and surrounds and say that the principles and the integrity of the 10-point plan have been delivered, thanks to the good work of the Prime Minister, Minister Nick Minchin and others. The House will be aware that Australia's export industries do rely -  - It has been a long time since any Labor leader has been anywhere near Longreach. - The House will be aware that Australia's export industries do rely on a land title system that stacks up, and that relates to the pastoral industry and the mining industry. One of the key aspects arising from the deal and the outcome on Wik is the tougher threshold test which will apply across the leases, bringing to an end the business of vexatious, disconnected claims, something which Noel Pearson himself has urged at various stages during this debate. So you will no longer have the business of someone near Redfern claiming some area west of Rockhampton; and that has been long overdue as part of getting some sanity into the whole native title equation.We have a tougher threshold test which stacks up. We have a set of circumstances of equality of rights and farmers can get on without being ambushed by rights to negotiate on their farm activity in relation to leaseholds. We have a proper outcome with regard to the Racial Discrimination Act and we have an outcome that will help provide certainty, to quote the National Farmers Federation. This will help the export base of Cape York, the hinterland and the ports of Cairns, Townsville and Rockhampton in establishing the exactitude of the land title system. It will help confirm the exclusive tenure circumstance of GHPL leasehold throughout a good part of Queensland and that extinguishment is confirmed in relation to those leases.Finally, in respect of a claim by the Yorta Yorta people and other people who are claim  ing waters of the Murray River and elsewhere in the Darling-Murray Basin, it will provide a simple, straightforward process so that, whatever the determination might be on that key Yorta Yorta claim, irrigators will be able to get on with their task and circumstance, and the authorities will be empowered to do that. It is a good outcome. What a refreshing change it is to have a government which has delivered in relation to this matter.</DOC>

Isn't this a marvellous little performance? - a little, noisy performance by the Australian Labor Party on the last day of this sitting. It is a very interesting performance. All the fire and brimstone from the Leader of the Opposition last night about native title, and we got one, pathetic, irrelevant question -  -  - What is the point of order? - Trembling in our shoes, we are.

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. - I represent a large rural electorate with a very substantial Aboriginal population, and settlement of this issue will be welcomed by all at the coalface. They have been calling for an end to the division in their communities that has really been ripping at their social fabric. Community leaders have been saying to me for quite some time that they want this uncertainty ended. The government has never sought, I should note, to deny the existence of native title. We have sought to balance the interests of all parties in this, and I believe we have come to an honourable outcome. I commend the Prime Minister and the Leader of the National Party for their work in this area, as well as many others.As in my electorate, I believe that right across the nation the breakthrough on native title legislation is being welcomed, particularly in rural Australia. All Australians, but particularly those living in rural areas, wanted this issue resolved, and now it will be. Senator Harradine, who is a decent man, is in my view to be commended for the responsible and principled position he has taken. We are now in a position to end the uncertainty which has reigned for five years. Our 10-point plan will dramatically improve the operation of the Native Title Act. It will resolve the difficulties that arose as a result of the High Court's Wik decision and it will do so in a way that respects the rights of all parties: pastoralists, indigenous Australians and miners. It ensures that Australians are treated equally. It ensures that we have a secure land title system underpinning investment in the nation.Very importantly, the principles underlying and underpinning the 10-point plan have not been compromised. That has been recognised  by farming communities and by the mining industry. I believe that time will demonstrate that the new arrangements are very sound indeed. I note that the NFF has commented that Australia's farmers have accepted that the agreement on native title is `the only tenable option on the table'. The Minerals Council said in their statement:The amended Act will allow the industry to get on with its business in a way which respects the rights of others and continues to generate wealth and jobs for all Australians.On that note, it is very important that we do not underestimate the benefits that ending all this uncertainty will bring. ABS figures show that exploration spending in the minerals and energy sector has now fallen for three quarters up to the quarter that ended in March 1998. Exploration spending is the lifeblood of the minerals and energy sector so vitally important to the national economy and to rural and regional Australia. It is as well that the uncertainty in relation to this matter is now brought to an end.</DOC>

 - If you read this document, which pre-dates the other document that you released with a lot of fanfare a few weeks ago, the cabinet submission in July, what it says is this:Any serious attempt to implement our maritime reform agenda is likely to create a fight with the MUA.So what? Obviously, if we proceeded to sell ANL, they were likely to pull a national strike. What do you expect us to do: do what you did and cave in? Is that what your expectation was? Or would you perhaps have expected us to get some advice? Would that be your expectation? Perhaps we would, on 9 September 1994, have asked for some advice. - I am answering the question. You find this difficult, don't you? I might have asked for some advice from the head of the legal division. I might have said, `Well, we have got this problem with the MUA. What might we do about it?' - Mr Speaker, if you had been the minister for industrial relations at the time, you might have received some advice, which would have been a brief which outlined certain legal remedies available to you as the government of the day, simply because you were attempting to implement government policy. That advice would deal with bans, it would deal with standing down of employees and it would give you advice about the cancellation of MUA awards and agreements. That is interesting, isn't it? They were carrying on about awards yesterday. They were taking advice on cancelling them. - Mr Speaker, the manner in which I am addressing it is to say that any government has a national responsibility to understand the remedies available to it in the event of a national strike being undertaken by the MUA, which would basically paralyse economic activity. We certainly took that advice. I am pleased to be able to tell the House that we took that advice. Were we alone in doing so? No, we were not. Was it a conspiracy that, at the time back in September -  - You answer the question before I have put it - which shows you what a mug you are. The fact of the matter is: was it a conspiracy for the Labor Party to be getting this advice in September 1994 when they were then negotiating with the MUA? Was it a conspiracy for the Labor Party to be taking advice on the action that they could take under the Crimes Act for interference with international trade? Was it a conspiracy by the then Labor minister to take advice on the dismissal of employees? - I certainly will, Mr Speaker. The point I make is that the government did have options, in the same way that the previous government had options and we had meetings to discuss it. Were those meetings a conspiracy? I say they were no more a conspiracy than the Leader of the Opposition conspired when he was on a committee. - I wonder if the previous government had a committee as well; I wonder. Would people expect such a committee? I wonder if that committee had the then Prime Minister of the day, none other than Mr Keating. - Did that committee have none other than the interjector rising to his feet? - Let me make my concluding remarks. The allegation is made by the Labor Party but the fact of the matter is that, when they were in government, they had a subcommittee of cabinet doing exactly what we were doing. -  - The incredible hypocrisy and fraudulent behaviour of you people knows no bounds! -  - People should remember that the ANL board back in 1994 proposed -  - It is an interesting reflection. - No. Let me finish, Mr Speaker. They actually proposed -  - I just conclude by giving the House a glimpse into 1994, Mr Speaker, because the question was whether or not we have acted in good faith. People have got to remember that in 1994 the Labor government did a deal with Mr Corrigan to sell him a  quarter of Australian Stevedores, which formed the basis for Patrick's, and the minister for industrial relations of the day made sure that Mr Corrigan got a loan to effect the purchase from ANL. Mr Speaker, there is a lot of things yet to be said about this and, if they want to go on about it, we are happy to do so.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for North Sydney for his question. I can say to the small businesses that he represents, of course, that they will be helped greatly by the fact that this government intends to simplify the complexities of the Australian taxation system, give tax relief for middle income earners, get poverty traps out of the system and rationalise inheritance taxes. Members will be aware that I have written today to every member of the parliament, asking them whether or not they would like a reprint of the government booklet In need of tax reform. . . . The reasons I have done that are twofold. One is that the print runs of this booklet have now been exhausted twice. The second reason is that we have had a couple of ALP members come down to my office requesting copies of this booklet.They generally come down at night, very silently, and ask sotto voce, hoping no doubt that the ACTU presidents do not see them, whether they can please have a copy of this book, In need of tax reform . . . This is an offer which is now open to all of the Australian Labor Party. We will be producing this booklet; you can put in your orders and send copies out to your constituents.No sooner had the government announced that the Labor Party could get copies of this booklet than I received requests for the government to do a reprint of this booklet - A guide to tax reform of July 1985. This 1985 guide to tax reform was, you will recall, the guide to tax reform which was solidly supported by Mr Beazley and Mr Evans - the old Mal Colston defence team - Beazley and Evans! Let me tell you the principles they supported. They supported a broad based consumption tax set at 12½ per cent. They said that would provide large income tax cuts; they said that would reduce marginal tax rates. Beazley and Evans said that that would increase the tax take from people who continue to avoid or evade income tax. They said that would provide enough revenue to enable a more generous net benefit for wage and salary earners. They said that if the Australian public supported the Beazley-Evans consumption tax that would enable the wholesale sales tax to be abolished.That was where Beazley and Evans were in 1985. Where are they today? Let me ask the House this question: is there one area of policy where Mr Beazley has been able to lead public opinion? Is there one area of policy where he has been able to take a stand? - Mr Beazley has not been able to lay a glove on One Nation because he has adopted their economic policy - economic Hansonism. Pauline Hanson says that she is against the sale of Telstra and Kim Beazley says that he is against the sale of Telstra. Pauline Hanson says that she is against tax reform; Kim Beazley says that he is against tax reform. Pauline Hanson says she is against competition policy; Kim Beazley says he is against competition policy. Kim Beazley says he wants tariffs; Pauline Hanson says she wants tariffs. This is what Kim Beazley said on radio 2HD on 11 April 1997:What you have there is a situation where as far as her industry policy is concerned you might as well trust the authors, which are us.That is Beazley trying to claim credit for the policies of One Nation and Pauline Hanson. This is somebody who has been unable to take a stand on anything. The only policy he has thought up is a policy for his next term in opposition because he is somebody who is bereft of any leadership whatsoever.</DOC>

 - I will investigate the detail of that question and write back to the member as appropriate. - You are enjoying it, aren't you Stephen? You like it. You give yourself away when you smile like that. It shows how confected this little exercise really is. I have absolutely no reluctance saying that we set out in a very  determined way to achieve reform of the Australian waterfront. We make no apology for that fact. I find it absolutely extraordinary that the Australian Labor Party should be  suggesting that there is something strange about a government wanting to reform the Australian waterfront getting a range of options from its advisers. From time immemorial governments have done that. The difference between the Labor Party and the coalition on this issue is that we were not prepared to do the bidding of the trade union movement. We were prepared to stand up for the interests of the Australian community. We were prepared to stand up for the interests of those Australians who were tired of their industries being destroyed by an uncompetitive -  - And I am addressing it. - I am indebted to the honourable member for O'Connor, who reminds me that, when it comes to expenditure on waterfront matters, the former Labor government spent about $130 million of taxpayers' money without achieving any measurable reforms and presided over a process which cost about $420 million. At the end of that process you still had the monumental rorts, an unproductive Australian waterfront and crane movement rates that were abysmal by world standards. In other words, they spent $130 million of the taxpayers' funds of Australia and another $300 million of the industry funds to achieve absolutely nothing. By contrast, we were prepared to embrace a determined effort to bring about fundamental reform of the Australian waterfront, and I make absolutely no apology for that policy objective at all.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Deakin for his question on this matter, and I would simply observe that the honourable member for Deakin is one of a significant number of members of parliament in this House who came to Australia often young and without any English language capacity and have demonstrated how they can contribute at such a very significant and high level. We commend the honourable member for Deakin for the ongoing contribution that he is making. The honourable member for Deakin gives me the opportunity to say to the House -  -  - and I am sorry it is not to all of the House - that one of the most significant steps taken by this government has been to shift the balance of the immigration program in favour of skilled migration and to  increase substantially the standards of the skilled category applicants. These changes do deliver significant economic, employment and budgetary benefits to Australia.Earlier this year I released a report by Econtech, using the Murphy model, that demonstrated that Australians will be per person $95 better off per year by the year 2007 as a result of the changes that the government has introduced. And there is more to come as a result of the further changes to finetune the independent and skilled Australian linked categories that the government has foreshadowed. The per capita growth in economic terms is essential to enhancing Australia's employment needs. The program that has been recast in that direction has a significant benefit in budgetary terms as well. There has been independent analysis undertaken by the Department of Finance and Administration as well as my own department that shows that these two categories of migration entry have a highly positive impact on the Commonwealth budgets and, I have to say, the budgets of other governments.These benefits are achieved because the independent migrants perform well in the Australian labour market. Within three years of arrival, the longitudinal survey shows that they have a labour participation rate of over 90 per cent and an employment rate of over 95 per cent. By this time, they have average incomes of over $40,000 per annum and are obviously making a major contribution to the nation's tax base. They have brought with them skills, often capital, new ideas and overseas contacts which enable us to expand our global markets. Unlike those who come through the family reunion program - particularly as we saw in the past when it was up to 70 per cent and, unfortunately, they were very often manipulating entry - these migrants are the ones who create jobs and very significant economic benefits.What is the One Nation Party proposing? They are proposing to rebalance the program against skilled migration. They are going to reduce it to 33 per cent of the program. They are going to eliminate entirely those two categories which have brought such substantial economic benefits as I have outlined. The  fact is that Australia does lose about 30,000 people each year overseas. They are, in the main, young and skilled Australians who take up employment opportunities overseas, and we ought not be surprised that that happens. But, if you reduce the skilled migration numbers - as the member for Kalgoorlie pointed out to me - and enhance the family reunion program, you are in fact deskilling Australia, and the consequences for us in terms of our ability to compete in international markets and our ability to become much more engaged in world terms is to tie a hand behind our back and leave us exposed.The very important aspect of the migration program is that it enables us to fill the gaps that the education system cannot fill. As was pointed out last night, the education system is important and, as I saw in discussing some of our programs, the skilling of the Australian labour market is absolutely crucial for ensuring that the unemployment problems amongst our youth are addressed.I want to conclude my comments by adding to an answer that I gave yesterday on this same matter. The changes that are intended to family reunion would ensure that, for instance, no orphan relatives would be able to enter Australia. Some colleagues have asked me, `Who are the orphan relatives who would be left out?' It is a relatively small number, but the orphan relatives arise because sometimes the parents of children die in car accidents overseas and the only family members who are able to provide for their ongoing needs are here in Australia. It is a compassionate response to a need through a family reunion program, and one that the honourable member and her party seem to ignore and think has very little relevance.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Paterson for his question. He does represent the area of the Hunter very well. He was elected into this place arguing the case for more funding on the Pacific Highway, and our government has provided it. It is quite instructive, if you have a look at the budget figures over the last few years, you will see that our government provided $1.62 billion for roads in Australia in this year's budget. In the last Labor budget, it was $1.56 billion. In this year's budget, we had allocations for money on roads of national importance,  including the Pacific Highway, in both the New South Wales and Queensland categories.If you have a look at the figures for roads of national importance in the 1995-96 budget, the last Labor budget, there was nothing. What was in there for the Pacific Highway? Nothing. The member for Cowper has been in here for many years arguing for funding of the Pacific Highway and, at last, it took a coalition government to deliver it. The Australian Labor Party, in government, continually argued against funding for the Pacific Highway.In his question, the member for Paterson asked about a couple of specific projects in his area. I am pleased to inform the member for Paterson that one of the major projects being undertaken on the Pacific Highway is the Bulahdelah-Coolongolook deviation. The road has seen many hundreds of fatalities over the years and the deviation is targeted for completion in June of 1999. The other major project being undertaken in the member's electorate is the Raymond Terrace bypass, which will be completed by December 1998.I reiterate, for the benefit of the House: this work is being undertaken in conjunction with the New South Wales government by the coalition federal government after 13 years of being promised by Labor and never delivered. It was a 14th year promise, and it took members, like the member for Paterson, arguing the case to get the funding for the Pacific Highway. I assure the member for Paterson we will continue our commitment to the Pacific Highway. The member for Paterson will be back here in the next parliament, representing the electorate of Paterson and arguing for funding on the Pacific Highway.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I certainly acknowledge his enormous interest in, and contribution to, the debate about forest policy in this country. And he, of course, enjoys some very good company in the House - the member for Page, the member for McMillan, the member for Gippsland, the member for Corangamite, the member for Cowper, the member for Paterson, the member for Braddon and the member for McEwen - all of them absolutely committed to doing something that the previous regime in this country could not, which was to give Australia a stable and secure policy framework that would encourage investment and job creation in our forest industry. We have achieved an enormous amount in that regard. Again, we have achieved something the previous administration was never able to achieve: we have a number of regional forest agreements in place. Wherever they have been put in place, as the members who have worked so hard for them know, not only are people who are worried about conservation values enormously reassured but investment and jobs are starting to flow. It is, I believe, a real mark of what good policy actively pursued by government determined to see outcomes can achieve.A couple of nights ago in this place the government delivered on another major commitment as part of its regional forest agreement strategy. We introduced the  Regional Forest Agreements Bill 1998  which underpins those RFAs and gives legislative certainty. I believe that the cornerstone of this approach will ensure the real base for industry to bring forth the investment that we need so much in this country.It is absurd that almost alone amongst our agricultural industries - instead of being an enormous exporter - this one puts us in a position where the industries are so paralysed that we have a net deficit in trade in timber and paper products of around $2 billion.The job losses - the jobs you people exported, because you would not put in place a stable regime - serve as an absolute discredit to you as self-proclaimed champions of the interests of people who are looking for jobs in this country. 	The fact is that now the industry is able to say that they welcome very strongly what we have done. NAFI says:This bill deserves the support of all interest groups in the forest debate and all political parties as it addresses the key issues of jobs and communities, as well as forest conservation and sustainable forest management.The RFA process provides a balanced outcome designed to meet a very high standard of conservation criteria, as well as taking into account the social and economic needs of rural Australia.This is in total contrast to what the Labor Party managed when it was in government.The interesting question now is: will they come clean and demonstrate their support for  what we have done in the interests of rural and regional Australians?</DOC>

I was asked also whether I knew of any other such place and the answer was no. - I have read this document. You get far too excited, Simon.

It says:Even without government encouragement a non-union firm may eventually chose to enter the industry and in that circumstance obviously you would have a national strike.What is our responsibility? - Our responsibility is to make sure that whatever can be done to prepare for such a contingency ought to be done, and that is what we did as a government.Mr Speaker, I will tell you the reason why the tactics committee on the other side decided to pull out of their little pile a document that was made back in April 1997, before the other documents that they have. The reason is that, when you look at what has happened on the waterfront, recently in Sydney the MUA unanimously voted to support changes in Patrick's operations in Sydney and to man the premises on the basis of our productivity rate of 25 crane lifts per hour.I had the quote before about the meeting I had with John Coombs in October 1997. When I took over full responsibility in early October 1997, the first thing I did was to make arrangements to see and talk to both the employers and the union. When I was given responsibility, the first thing I did was to get  around and talk to all the industry players. When I went for that meeting with John Coombs, do you know what he told me when it came to productivity rates? He told me that a crane rate of 24 to 25 was unattainable. You ought to have that document as well and table it. That is what he told me.In fact, in the last week or so the MUA itself has finally voted for the government's own productivity target. If you want an example of success, the fact that they have finally voted for it is that measure of success. We have abolished the nick. - We have abolished double headers and we have halved the manning levels on the Australian waterfront - something after 13 years you could never achieve.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Boothby for his question. It gives me the opportunity to remind the House that the Australian government has been extremely active in assisting Indonesia through the economic crisis which it has confronted, and also assisting the east Asian region generally throughout that economic crisis.I would remind the House of two particular things that I have done in recent times. In March of this year I visited the United States and met with not just the Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright, but with the Managing Director of the IMF, Michel Camdessus, the  President of the World Bank and officials from the United States Treasury to talk about the crisis in Indonesia and to urge on the International Monetary Fund a more moderate approach to the very difficult task of rebuilding the Indonesian economy. The IMF has been responsive to representations by Australia and by others to take a rather different course from the course they originally took. So in that respect I think we have been very helpful to Indonesia at this difficult time.I also spoke with the United States Secretary of State more recently, last month, about this whole question and I made it clear to her, as I think my colleague the Treasurer did to his American counterpart a couple of weeks earlier, that in dealing with the East Asian economic crisis we do not want to see the International Monetary Fund applying political conditionality. And I was very pleased that the United States Secretary of State responded positively to my representations on that issue.I make those points simply to illustrate that, for those who think Australia has not done enough to assist Indonesia during this period and, what is more, who suggest we should do more in encouraging the United States to take a constructive approach to Indonesia during this crisis, I do not think there is any country that could reasonably have been expected to do more than Australia and the Australian government have done. The Prime Minister has himself been extremely active in this issue - the Treasurer has; the Minister for Trade and Deputy Prime Minister has; I have - and I know that in Indonesia, amongst all different political complexions, there is a great deal of gratitude for what Australia has done.Let me, in conclusion, remind the House that Australia and Japan are the only two countries in the world which have supported all three IMF packages. The only two countries in the world! We have also provided a significant amount of development assistance to Indonesia during this time. So, to those who think we have not done enough, let me say as politely as I possibly can, they are wrong. Australia has done an enormous amount. We have shown leadership in terms  of our relationship with the United States and we have shown leadership throughout the East Asian region in addressing this most difficult of international issues.</DOC>

 - I completely reject the claim made by the Leader of the Opposition. I reject it completely. I stand by what I have said before, and I repeat it, that we were elected on a policy of reforming the Australian waterfront. We set out to achieve that goal because it is in the interests of the Australian people. The commitment I made to the Australian people, and the promise that I made to the Australian people, was to do all I could to achieve a reformed Australian waterfront, not out of some kind of ideological zeal but because I believe that the Australian people deserve reforms. I believe that the efforts that the government has undertaken have delivered a more competitive waterfront and that we have achieved reforms on the Australian waterfront beyond the capacity of any alternative government in Australia and beyond the beliefs of many sections of the Australian community.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Parramatta for his question which relates to the important matter of the visit to China by the President of the USA - a visit which has proceeded through Xian, Beijing and Shanghai, and he will move on to Hong Kong at about this time - and has led to a number of trade talks taking place between not only the United States President and Beijing interlocutors but also Charlene Barshefski, US trade representative.Your question, of course, I think goes to the nub of the matter: those who would call for  open markets access might also themselves provide that market access. Firstly, with regard to the United States, the Jones Act, which blocks Australia from exporting high-tech wave piercing ferries from Australia to the USA remains an unacceptable non-tariff measure. Secondly, we welcome the recent increase in the sugar quota for Australian exporters into the USA - I would point out that that relates to another aspect - and that will increase the tonnages from all elements of the Australian sugar industry. But there is more work to be done because in fact there should be no quotas. It should not be a restricted form of export from Australia to the USA by way of a quota mechanism, albeit that that is still covered in the Uruguay Round at this time. I might add that 12 countries are now giving Australian sugar exporters zero tariff into their key markets.Let me turn to another area to pick up very much on the question of the member for Parramatta, who represents his exporters very capably. I am pleased to be able to inform the House that consequent upon setting up the market development task force and driving that forward with its chair, Philip Flood, and more recently Dr Ashton Calvert, I am pleased to say that further progress has been made in Australian exporters getting improved market access, especially in the services industry. In relation to China, additional banking licences and legal licences have been granted to Australian companies as well as insurance company licences. Improved market access for wool, apples, wine, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, motor vehicle parts and optical fibres have been secured.There has been a successful negotiation of a protocol on health requirements for slaughter cattle to enter the PRC from Australia and a number of other steps, including the approved destination status for Australia - just one of five countries and secured by the work of the Minister for Sport and Tourism, the Prime Minister, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and other ministers. Indeed, that moment in Beijing - when the Minister for Sport and Tourism held the attention of the entire audience, paused for two minutes after the translation and then, when invited for his  return to reply, did so in fluent Mandarin - was a very similar moment in building a further breakthrough with regard to our tourism connections between Australia and China. We have expanded market access, facilitated the expansion of exports as a consequence and, as a result, created more jobs here in Australia.</DOC>

 - The answer to the question is yes, but I am wondering where the absent opposition frontbench might be on this sitting day. The Prime Minister did consult. The matter went before the cabinet and before the joint party meeting. The matter relates to a very important issue - the coalition doing something about upgrading the infrastructure in rural and regional Australia, when for 13 years you did not. I just make a point -  - I was consulted before. I make just a couple of other additional points. During Labor's period in office, 277 post offices were closed down. We opened 151. With regard to consultation, I was also consulted -  - I will just add two other things. Members are absolutely united about getting increased infrastructure in country areas which we were denied under 13 years of Labor. They agree to disagree about various other aspects, but I tell you one thing: they are absolutely in support of decisions taken by the Telstra board - full marks to that board - following on the federal government's issue of extra spectrum whereby we have resolved the problem created by the ALP legislation to junk analog phones at midnight on 1 January 2000. The CDMA upgraded mobile telephone system will be proceeding separate from the Telstra privatisation matter. It is a good decision. We clean up once again after another Labor mistake which was going to hurt country Australia.</DOC>

 - My attention has been drawn to some comments made in Adelaide last night by the member for Oxley regarding the 1967 referendum. Let me read what the member said. I found the statement made by the member quite extraordinary for two reasons. This is what she had to say:They didn't have the right to vote until the Australian people, in the referendum of 1967 when they cast that vote - when they believed that Aboriginals should have the right the vote and should be treated equally, the same as everyone else.She then went on to say:But if Australians knew today what was foreshadowed for them, they would have thought twice about casting that vote because they were looking at giving the Aboriginal race equality.There are two major areas of concern in that statement. By far the most sinister of those is that the member has actually entertained the notion that one section of the Australian community should not have the vote. Stripped of any kind of rhetoric, any kind of excuse, any kind of explanation, what the member for Oxley was saying last night was that she actually contemplates the notion that one section of the Australian community should not have the vote.I would have thought that, whatever our differences on other issues are, we all believe - as the coalition government believes - that all Australians should be treated equally. I certainly believe that. It has been a cornerstone of the policies that the government has followed since March of 1996 that all Australians should be equal under the law, they should all be entitled to an equal dispensation from that law and they should all be equally accountable to that law.We on this side of the House do not believe in one law for indigenous Australians and another law for other Australians. Equally, we believe that the protection of the law should be equally available to indigenous Australians as it is to other sections of the Australian community. The very notion that you would think twice about giving a section of the Australian community the vote, which is after all the most basic of all democratic rights, is not only a notion that I reject, and I believe all members of this parliament ought to reject, but a notion that I know the overwhelming majority of Australians would reject. That, of course, was the most serious element of the statement.But the other element of the statement which I find quite extraordinary is, of course, that it betrays a complete ignorance of what the 1967 referendum was all about. The 1967 referendum was not about giving indigenous Australians the vote. The 1967 referendum was about counting indigenous Australians in the census and about giving coextensive legal authority to the Commonwealth parliament to  legislate for the Aboriginal people. Indeed, indigenous people in Australia in some parts of the country had had the vote since Federation, with those areas of the country where the vote did not exist prior to the mid-1960s being dealt with by legislation in the mid-1960s repairing the injustice in relation to the franchise in some areas of the country.I am very proud, of course, to record the fact that the 1967 referendum was sponsored by the coalition government led by the late Harold Holt, and the Deputy Prime Minister in that government was in fact the late Sir John McEwen, the then leader of the Country Party. I think it is an abhorrent notion that anybody should contemplate taking the vote away from any section of the Australian community. And I would also make the statement that, before any member of this House gets into a debate about the implications of a referendum, they ought to at least understand what occurred at the referendum.</DOC>

 - I have seen a range of remarks in relation to the telecommunications issue and Telstra issue, and I have listened carefully and met with a wide range of people. I want to make two points. Firstly, the objective of upgrading, including untimed local calls, in outback Australia in the extended zones remains an absolutely legitimate objective. We were going to speed up the implementation of that objective by providing a basis on which it could be paid for through the privatisation of Telstra. -  - We do not have happen to believe in printing money on this side. We do happen to believe in fixing up the problem and making real progress available from the improved technologies. - I acknowledge freely that there is a robust debate about the levels of ownership of Telstra, but that leads me to the second point. You sold Qantas, Mr Beazley, just in case you don't remember, and you sold the Commonwealth Bank. Your left wing were all up your ribs at the particular time. But the funny thing about that is: did your selling of Qantas stop you from leaving in place correct aviation navigation legislation, correct aviation regulation, correct aviation control? Of course it did not. Likewise, with the Commonwealth Bank, is there separate overarching legislation applying to the inspection and dealing with all the banks? Of course there is. Likewise what did you vote against in the Senate? What did your Labor senators vote against, as they reflected on the paternal relationship of Senator Colston to his father in a very grubby way, for which you should all apologise? You should dissociate yourself from Senator Faulkner with his attack on Senator Colston's father - and you should do it now. If you had any courage at all, you would stand up at your next question and apologise for Senator Faulkner's attack on Senator Colston's father. -  - One other thing you voted down was increased penalties on Telstra, Optus and Vodafone to provide repair service in adequate time and to provide adequate levels of service to subscribers right across Australia. You voted that down in the Senate. You should hang your head in shame.</DOC>

 - I start my answer to the honourable member's question - and I think those who are interested in future generations will pay close attention to this - by saying that at 30 June 1998, the total federal government debt of Australia stood at just over $82,000 million. Almost all of that had been accumulated by the man who sits opposite me when he was the Minister for Finance in the Keating government.One of the great benefits to Australia of disposing of the remaining two-thirds of Telstra is that in one hit we would remove  almost half of the national debt Kim Beazley left to the future generations of Australia. That is of itself the greatest single argument in favour of the government's policy. I reassert to the parliament that the government remains committed to the full privatisation of Telstra. That remains government policy because we believe that removing the debt burden on future generations is desirable. We are not people who believe in loading future generations of Australians with debt. When Mr Keating and the Leader of the Opposition ran Australia, they loaded billions of dollars each year of debt onto future generations. If we can proceed with the full privatisation of Telstra, we will achieve by the year 2001 a situation where this country will have the lowest national debt level of virtually any country in the Western world.There are those who sit opposite and those in the Australian community who apparently regard that as being of no account, but the benefits of reducing debt are enormous. You have lower interest rates. The money you would otherwise use to service that debt can be used to build roads, to service hospitals, to provide better education benefits, to build-up our defence forces and to do all of those things that the men and women of Australia want. Instead of that, the Leader of the Opposition would rather have $40 billion that could be used to retire debt and the interest savings on that debt retirement tied up in public ownership. Yet this is the same man who sold the Commonwealth Bank. This is the same man who sold Qantas. This is the same man who said one thing to the Australian people before the election and said another when he was put into office. No wonder the Labor member for Dickson, Mrs Cheryl Kernot, had this to say. - No wonder the Age  on 26 February 1996 reported the member for Dickson as saying, `I think Labor in opposition won't sell Telstra, but I'm more worried about Labor in government.' - Whatever she is, this is what she had to say: `I think Labor in opposition won't sell Telstra, but I'm more worried about Labor in government.' The major reason the government remains committed to the sale of Telstra is that we believe in reducing and not increasing the federal government debt of Australia. We inherited almost $100 billion of government debt from the Keating-Beazley government. We have set about reducing that debt by turning an annual deficit of over $10 billion into a surplus of over $2½ billion. On current projections, with the sale of Telstra, by the year 2002 we will have a debt to GDP ratio of only 1½ per cent. It will be amongst the lowest in the industrialised world, and those who oppose the full privatisation of Telstra stand for a debt ridden Australia in the 21st century. They stand against relieving future generations of young Australians from that debt burden. They are against using the interest payments to provide better education, better schools, better roads and better defence facilities. In other words, they have a backward-looking, negative attitude towards the development of Australia. - </DOC>

 - In 1995, the federal government debt to GDP ratio in this country was in the order of 20 per cent. On current projections, that debt will, before the privatisation of Telstra, be reduced to about 10 per cent of GDP by the turn of the century. If you factor into that the sale of the remaining two-thirds of Telstra, you have it reduced to a bare 1.5 per cent of GDP. In other words, it would be, I believe, probably the lowest in the entire OECD area.I remind the Leader of the Opposition of a speech that he made when he addressed the National Press Club on 24 August 1994. It was under the engaging title of `Paying for our future: The changing role of public investment'. In those days, privatisation was all the rage. In those days, the brave men of the New South Wales right and their acolytes within the Labor government stood out against the left wing of the Labor Party at the national conferences. It was only George Campbell, Daryl Melham and Laurie Ferguson who were running around opposing privatisation. They had these very, very strange views and, in those days, the current Leader of the Opposition as finance minister was a devoted supporter of privatisation, as were those who sit opposite.He was, after all, the man who promised Australians he would not sell the Commonwealth Bank, but he did. He was the man who promised Australians that he would not sell Australian Airlines, but he did. He was the man who promised Australians he would not sell Qantas, but he did. He was the man who ran around Australia at that particular time telling Australians what wonderful benefits would flow from the privatisation of national assets. This is one of the gems that came out of that speech in 1994:Trying to preserve the past may seem to be the best way to protect jobs, but in the longer term it could be a major impediment to achieving a productive future.That was a very prophetic sort of statement, and it got even closer to the bone. He went on to say:The Government's commitment to the deficit reduction strategy means that a halt to privatisation would result in a direct cut to government programs.I repeat that. He said:The Government's commitment to the deficit reduction strategy means that a halt to privatisation would result in a direct cut to government programs.He then went on to say:Rather we are seeking ways to make our infrastructure dollar go further, and in a broader sense to ensure that taxpayers' dollars are directed at the areas of highest priority, such as unemployment.That is what the Leader of the Opposition had to say when he had some skerrick of economic responsibility when he was a member of the former government. If those arguments were potent in 1994, they are even more potent in 1998 because in 1998 we are grappling with that $95 billion of federal government debt that Mr Beazley and Mr Keating left to the incoming coalition government. We are grappling with the need to set up a relatively debt free 21st century for the future generations of Australians.I believe very strongly that, by using the proceeds of the sale of Telstra, in one stroke we will reduce by 50 per cent - I repeat: in one stroke we will reduce by 50 per cent - the current federal government debt of Australia, which is about $82 billion. We will cut that in half in one stroke. We will get rid of the  interest payments. We will have some money for a social bonus. We will be able to pay for things that would not otherwise be available.The Leader of the Opposition talks about dedicating the dividend out of Telstra. If you take the dividend from Telstra and put that into rural services, where do you get the money to pay for the schools towards which the dividend is now going? What do you do with those services? What do you do with the Medicare services?The government remains absolutely committed to the full privatisation of Telstra. We think it is the right policy. It will relieve future generations of Australians from the awful debt burden left by Mr Keating and Mr Beazley.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I can inform the people of Australia of the benefits that they get by reducing government debt. When this government came to office, when I became Treasurer, we had to raise $10 billion of Australian tax to pay for Mr Beazley's debt. Every Australian born comes into Australia owing taxes to service the Beazley debt. - I will, Mr Speaker. When this government came to office, and when I became Treasurer, we had to raise $10 billion to service the debt which Mr Beazley, as finance minister, had run up on behalf of  the Australian people. I just want to put this in context because I know how touchy he is. He is unquestionably Australia's worst finance minister. There is no doubt that the worst finance minister in Australian history was none other than Mr Beazley.When the Fraser government came to office in 1975, Commonwealth government net debt was $0.7 billion. When the Hawke government came to office in 1983, the Commonwealth government net debt was $9.7 billion. When Kim Beazley relinquished control of the finance ministry - remember, debt had been $9.7 billion when Labor came to office - when Kim Beazley ceased being finance minister of Australia, Commonwealth government net debt, which had been $9 billion when Labor came to office, was $95.8 billion. In five years, including the two years when Mr Beazley was the finance minister, Commonwealth net debt went from $16 billion to $95 billion.Until 1990 - in 90 years of Federation - Commonwealth net debt had got to $16 billion. Mr Beazley came in as finance minister and, after five years, took it from $16 billion to $96 billion. When we came to office, we as a government had to raise $10,000 million of taxes just to pay the interest bill. Not only was that just paying the interest bill, that did not repay one dollar of the Beazley Labor debt. There was no plan to repay any dollar of the Beazley Labor debt, and the only opportunity to repay the Beazley Labor debt is by running surpluses. - Thank you, Mr Speaker. Let me give the House the figures. -  - If, in that first budget, this government had not had to raise $10 billion to service the Beazley debt, we could have cut company tax in half. - Just to put some perspective on the $10 billion of debt servicing costs which this government was left, it is half of the company tax collections in this country. If the government did not have to service the legacy of Labor debt, company tax could have been cut in half. The petrol excise, at 43c a litre, raises over $6 billion. If this government did not have to service the cost of Labor debt, you could drop the price of petrol by 43c a litre. If this government did not have to raise $10 million to service Labor debt, the fringe benefits tax could be abolished three times over. That is the servicing cost of $10 billion of debt. Now we see what Labor says. Not only did Labor say, `We put the country in hock. We are going to make Australians pay taxes for endless decades to cover up for the costs of that,' -  - but Labor now says it will oppose any plan to get Australia out of hock again. This is a government which has faced up to the failures of Labor. We turned the Australian budget around. We are not going to sit back here and let Labor continue to penalise future generations for its own wanton financial mismanagement. We have an opportunity to reduce the crushing burden of debt for Australians. We have an opportunity to give Australians the opportunity to pay taxes for their health, their roads and their schools, and not to pay taxes for the failure of the Beazley-Keating administration. - We have an opportunity to get Australia back on track again. We have an opportunity to undo the wanton damage that Mr Beazley, the worst finance minister -  - in the history of federation incurred on this country, and we intend to do it.</DOC>

 - I would be very pleased to do that. If we were able to bring on item No. 12, it would give us an opportunity to do a corrective to the sorts of statements, the nonsense, that have emerged from the Treasurer and the Prime Minister in this question time. We would, under that particular notice of motion, be able to discuss the fact that they inherited the second lowest level of public debt in the Western world. They want to sell Australia's greatest national asset to take us to the lowest level of public debt in the Western world. Bully for them! If, in fact, we were able to debate item No. 12 -  -  - it would give us an opportunity to discuss the fact that, within about four or five years of the total sale of Telstra, you will be losing more in forgone dividend than you will be in relieved public debt interest. Within four or five years, you would be losing more. This is like selling Kalgoorlie before the gold rush. This is a mug's decision. This is not privatising. - Item No. 12, for example, would let us talk about the foreign debt to GDP ratio -  - which has been going through the roof. - We ought to be discussing item No. 12 because it would give us an opportunity to put forward a corrective - this lot can dish it out, but they cannot take it - to the sorts of nonsense points that have been made by them. The position that they inherited was described as `better than good in parts', as far as the economy was concerned, by the Prime Minister himself. - The narrow embrace does, in fact, give us an opportunity to say -  - why you would want to talk about the fiscal position in which this Commonwealth found itself. Given that we are discussing here the question of debt -  - I would have thought item No. 12 would have been a very good one to bring on right now to discuss the fact that you inherited a level of public debt -  - lower than Maggie Thatcher's Britain, lower than Ronald Reagan's United States -  - lower than Helmut Kohl's Germany. - If we were able to do that, we could bring a bit of perspective to this Telstra debate.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker -  - Any allegation of illegality or impropriety should be properly investigated. When a matter alleging illegality or impropriety is drawn to the attention of this government it is referred to the appropriate authority for independent examination. The matters referred to by the member for Moreton appear to relate to compliance or non-compliance with corporations and securities legislation. The appropriate independent authority in relation to the investigation of allegations of illegality or impropriety in that respect is with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. It is up to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission to determine whether it will investigate a matter and, if it will, in what manner. Any person who has information relevant to an investigation of such matters by ASIC is able to provide it to the commission.</DOC>

 - We will be announcing shortly the outcome in relation to the budget for the past year which will give a good indication as to the state of the budget and the revenues that are involved. Can I say in relation to growth that the government has put forward its projections in relation to growth and in relation to the budget. -  - Australia currently has one of the highest growth rates in the world, not only in the Asian region - which is mostly in recession - but in the developed world as well. Australian prospects for the next year of course will be affected by the international downturn and, as a result, we have already marked growth down in our budget forecast. This is a very serious development in relation to Asia. With the exception of China, it could well be that all of the countries of Asia are now in recession.As far as Australia is concerned, we come into this external downturn in a strong position with low inflation, with low interest rates, with a budget which is in surplus and with a program to reduce debt. But let me ask this: if this government had not put the budget into surplus, if we had persisted with the Labor Party's $10 billion deficit, where would we be now? Where would Australia be? - I make two observations in concluding. The first point is this: probably one of the best things that could have been done for the economic management of this country was the decision of this government two years ago to repair the budget. If we had continued $10 billion deficits, as was proposed then by the Australian Labor Party, if we had gone into an external downturn in deficit, if we had added another $20 billion of two $10 billion a year deficits, then Australia would have been terribly exposed. The Labor Party were wrong over the period from 1990 to 1996 and they were wrong thereafter.The second point is this: as we go into an external environment which will be most challenging for Australia, the best thing we can do is we can attend to putting our house in order by reducing debt. The Labor Party's prescription, which is to keep Australia in a high debt position during an adverse external downturn, will ensure that this country would be terribly and fragilely exposed. If the Labor Party had kept Australia in deficit, if the Labor Party can succeed in keeping the government in debt -  - I take it as a compliment that you are now trying to close off question time. An opposition trying to close down question time is a unique occurrence in federal history. We take your point that you would like to close question time. Let me finish by saying that if this government had not decided to turn around the Australian budget two years ago, if we had run a $10 billion deficit last year, if we had run it in 1996-97, in 1997-98, and in 1998-99, as Labor wanted to do, if we had increased Commonwealth net debt, if we had put an exposed Australia into a fragile Asian position, then the prospects for Australia would have been very, very worrying.Now is the time for good economic policy. Now is not the time for the economic populism which is being practised by the Leader of the Opposition in concert with the member for Oxley in a kind of twosome race to see who can be the most irresponsible. Now is the time, in the midst of this big external challenge, for good economic policy. Now is the time for good budget policy. Now is the time to repay debt. Now is the time to keep inflation down. Now is the time to get benefits to home buyers with low interest rates. Now is the time for a better tax system. Now is the time to secure Australia's future. There is one thing that Mr Beazley will never be able to do: he will never be able to run a credible economic policy.</DOC>

 - I assure the honourable member for Cowan that as far as the government is concerned the government believes that all taxpayers should pay their fair share of tax. This government has been more active than any other in ensuring that that is the case. This was the government that closed down the R&amp;D syndicates, which the member for Hotham protected as a tax minimisation device. This was the government that was prepared to deal with superannuation. This was the government that introduced thin capitalisation rules. This was the government that changed the foreign investment rules. This was the government that introduced the measures against dividend streaming. This was the government that introduced the measures against trading in franking credits.From time to time people send to me as the Treasurer material which they believe indicates that taxpayers have not been paying their just and due liabilities. I should make it clear that the administration of the tax laws in this country is the responsibility of the Commissioner of Taxation. Under the Income Tax Assessment Act, the affairs of taxpayers in the hands of the Commissioner of Taxation are protected by privacy legislation and they are not disclosed to me or to anybody else. In relation to any tax matters that are sent to me, I pass them on to the Commissioner of Taxation, which is his responsibility. In relation to any other person who has material which they believe indicates or warrants an investigation, it should also be passed on to the Commissioner of Taxation for a due investigation. - I am sure that the Commissioner of Taxation will ensure that  they do receive due investigation and that the Commissioner of Taxation will ensure that the law is properly enforced. I want to conclude by saying one thing. I was rather amused by the member for Hotham who walked to the dispatch box and complained that the government was going to put muckup in the House of Representatives. All I can say is that you and your dirty tricks, little eunuch, have been the world exemplars of that little tactic.</DOC>

 - I can confirm what was asserted in the tax plan - that is, that, consequent upon the introduction of the goods and services tax and the compensation arrangements proposed by the government, those in receipt of the old age pension and other benefits analogous thereto will always be 1½ per cent in real terms ahead of the CPI impact of the GST.</DOC>

 - I preface my answer by congratulating the member for Makin on her return to this House. One of the reasons why the member for Makin performed so well in the last election campaign was the very strong state of the Australian economy. One of the proudest boasts of my government is how well the Australian economy has performed, despite difficult international economic cir  cumstances. That is not a partisan political boast. It is in fact verified by independent authority. Recently, the Treasury, in its Economic Roundup , said:The current approach to macro-economic policy and the impact of micro-economic reform have strengthened the stabilisation mechanisms in the Australian economy, making it more resilient to disturbances such as the economic and financial crisis in Asia.Even more so, the Reserve Bank, in its semi-annual statement on monetary policy, had this to say:The Australian economy has weathered the first year and a half of a very difficult international environment exceptionally well and the settings of macro-economic policy have made an important contribution to the favourable outcome.That is bankspeak for saying that the government has done a tremendous job in getting the budget back into order. If we had not taken those decisions, we would not have had the lower interest rates. We would not have been able to look the rest of the world in the eye and say that we have got an outstanding economic performance in very difficult international economic circumstances.It is further emphasised by some preliminary figures released by the ABS this morning which showed that the economy grew by a revised 4.4 per cent in 1997-98, up from the four per cent rate previously reported. In other words, a more accurate measure showed that it has gone up by 4.4 per cent. This has all happened despite the 2½ years of the Labor Party talking down the Australian economy.If there is one thing that provides tragic faces opposite, it is good news about the Australian economy. If there is one thing they do not like, it is interest rates going down, inflation going down, the budget being back in surplus and the Australian economy performing very strongly by world standards. I want to thank the Australian people for the contribution that they have made to the fact that this country, to its great credit and to its great pride, has been able to weather the Asian economic storm far better than many expected, in a way that rebounds greatly to the credit of the Australian people and, may I say, to the government that I am proud to lead. </DOC>

 - As I think even the member for Hotham should know, the GST has been modelled, on a CPI basis, at 1.9 per cent. Even on the most generous assumption, which is that every household spends 100 per cent of its income, under the government's tax package, each of those households will be better off. We have seen from the opposition outrageous and false claims to the contrary, no more so than on the day before the election when the Australian Labor Party took out ads in newspapers across this country saying, `Secret government figures show GST will cost you five times more than Howard admits'. - As I said earlier, the Treasury modelling of the impacts of the GST on a CPI basis - the only reliable basis - was 1.9 per cent. The Australian Labor Party, even up until the day before the election, in fabrications put in national newspapers, claimed  there was a Treasury analysis showing that the impact would be five times greater. That was completely false. - No wonder the Leader of the Opposition says he is no longer asking for the documents on the household expenditure survey. No wonder! Before the election he said, in advertisements around the country, which were totally fabricated, that it would come out at five times. What is five times 1.9? It is 9.5 per cent. The advice to this government is and always was that the reliable measure of the price effect of a 10 per cent GST was a consumer price index which was 1.9 per cent, which has been more than adequately compensated for by a four per cent increase in pensions and other measures and which made sure that, contrary to the fabrications of the Australian Labor Party, all quin  tiles of taxpayers and income earners would be better off under a better new Australian taxation system.</DOC>

 - Unquestionably, international developments in our region and elsewhere have been very difficult. This has been a very difficult international environment over the last 12 months. As we look around this particular region, we see Japan is in recession, Singapore moved into recession yesterday, Korea is in an IMF program, Thailand is in an IMF program and Indonesia is in an IMF program. I can report to the House that, whilst nearly all of Asia, bar China, is in recession, the Australian economy continues to grow strongly. As the RBA semi-annual statement on monetary policies said:The Australian economy has also weathered the first year and a half of a very difficult international environment exceptionally well. . .The statement says that this was due to good macro economic policy, combined with the success of exporters in finding new markets.On an unadjusted basis - and the Prime Minister has just referred to the adjusted basis - the Australian economy grew by four per cent in 1997-98, faster than the United States, faster than the United Kingdom, faster than France, New Zealand, faster than our OECD major partners and, of course, faster, outside of China, than any economy in the Asian region.Mr Speaker, these kinds of results do not happen by chance. I would like to pay tribute to the Australian exporters who have shown remarkable ingenuity in switching their exports to different markets. It has in part been a result of allowing an adjustment in relation to the exchange rate to help those exporters find those new markets, but it has also been a response of this government  which decided to repair the Australian budget, to take a $10.3 billion Beazley deficit and put the Australian budget back into surplus. When we did that, we were fought every single step of the way by the Australian Labor Party. Having created the mess, the Australian Labor Party tried to stop all efforts to fix it again.Today we can report that inflation in Australia is well within the band set by this government with the Reserve Bank. We can report that home loan mortgage interest rates are as low as they have been in Australia for 30 years. The small business indicator overdraft rate is the lowest recorded by the Reserve Bank.Mr Speaker, I also note in passing that the Westpac index of consumer sentiment, which was released at 11 this morning, was headed `Consumer sentiment surges' and reads:The Westpac-Melbourne Institute index of consumer sentiment rose by 6.2 per cent in November. Westpac's General Manager Economics, Bill Evans, commented, `This is undoubtedly a strong result which has probably been supported by a clearly benign interest rate outlook.' - And, as the Prime Minister says, no doubt contributed to by the election result as well. Mr Speaker, you do not get that kind of economic management without taking the hard decisions and the tough decisions. This was a government that was prepared to take the big decisions in relation to the Beazley budget deficit of $10.3 billion so as to put the Australian economy back on track, and this is the government which is prepared to take further decisions in the national interest in relation to tax reform to set Australia up for opportunities in the future which it will never get otherwise.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, the member -  - Mr Speaker, the member for Hotham is now trying to defend his advertisement on the grounds that it referred to the Melbourne Institute survey. Is that right? - That is a funny thing. Why would you head it up `Treasury papers show'? It was not the Melbourne Institute, Westpac or anybody else; it was `Treasury papers show'. Why would you have a phrase like this on it: `Secret government figures show'? Are we now running the Melbourne Institute, are we? - Is that now the Treasury figures, in the Melbourne Institute? You could have gone into the paper, and you could have tried to be honest. You could have said `The Melbourne Institute says', or `The Melbourne Institute believes', or something like that. But that was not good enough for you, was it? - That was not the point you were trying to make. - Mr Speaker, I was asked whether or not the Melbourne Institute made that advertisement accurate. The Melbourne Institute did not make that advertisement accurate because it claims there were secret Treasury documents. When the so-called secret Treasury documents are released today, what the Australian public deserves is an apology from the Australian Labor Party for its misleading and fabricated advertisement on the eve of the election. It is as false today as it was then.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, I thank the member for Hinkler for his question, and I congratulate him on his fine victory in that very marginal Queensland seat.The short answer is that our exporters are doing extremely well in very difficult circumstances. They are diversifying and contributing greatly to the economic performance, as reflected by the comments in the Economic Roundup by the Treasury and by the most recent comments this day by the Treasurer. In fact, it is a superb performance, and it means more jobs here in the Australian economy.Exports to the USA are up 40 per cent in the nine months to September compared with the same nine months of the previous year. Exports to the UK are up 85 per cent, and include some specular efforts by the Australian wine industry. Wine industry exports for this calendar year to the world will go through the $800 million mark. Exports to India are up by 33 per cent. South Asia is certainly building up nicely. Exports to Germany are up 32 per cent. Germany is a critical market in Europe and a linchpin for our activities in that direction.Even in Asia exports have been mixed, which is a sign of softening. Japan is up seven per cent, Taiwan is up seven per cent, and Hong Kong, notwithstanding all the difficulties of that economy but perhaps reflecting its hub port role, is up eight per cent.The key to this has been the government's determination to encourage our exporters to diversify and to spread the Austrade network and the focus beyond traditional markets into South America and elsewhere.In addition to that, we are putting real effort into country to country bilateral negotiations, and there is real progress in the outcome for the Market Development Task Force. I am pleased to advise the House that tomorrow, ahead of the APEC meetings in Kuala Lumpur, I will table the individual action plan for Australia, Trade equals jobs. The government has maintained this pattern of producing an IAP so that nothing is being done behind closed doors. That will be available to everybody.Finally, I add that the government will be contributing to the recognition of the gold medal performance of our exporters with the National Export Awards coming up early in December in Sydney. I look forward to those.</DOC>

 - I do remember that speech. I remember it very well. I also re  member the very warm reception I received from 1,200 business men and women, who were very pleased to see that the government had been returned and that once again the coalition was in charge of the economic and political affairs of the Australian nation.When I made those remarks, I had in mind a comparison that caught my fancy and passed through my mind before I got up to speak. That was the comparison between our candour in 1998 and their deceit in 1993. We all remember that in 1993 they promised tax cuts, they campaigned against a goods and services tax -  - I was put in mind of that comparison - of how in 1993 they campaigned against a GST and they promised tax cuts, and when they won the election they did neither. When they won the election, they put up every indirect tax they could lay their hands on. By comparison, if you go back over every election that has been held in this country since World War II, there would not have been an election where any government had been more open, more honest, more candid, more forthright and more explicit about a fundamental measure of economic reform. And it is to the great credit of the coalition that it had the courage, the honesty and the guts to say what was needed for the future of the Australian economy. I remain immensely proud of the fact that we did that and even more proud of the fact that we were able to win the support of the Australian people. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Parramatta for his question and I congratulate him on the close interest he takes in the Job Network. I am aware of an article by Brian Toohey in the Sun-Herald  on Sunday, syndicated to various other newspapers, which claimed that Centrelink would be better advised to employ more people to answer the phone. Centrelink is not my responsibility. But the article went on to say that better call centres would improve the chances of the unemployed getting a job. That is my responsibility.Mr Toohey is a very senior journalist who deserves to be taken seriously, so I can report to the House that I personally called Centrelink's new start line, 132850. I was put on hold for three minutes before being answered by a real-life human being who was able to give me perfectly comprehensive information about Job Network members in my area.I then called Centrelink's employer line, 131158. I am pleased to report to the House that I was immediately answered by a real-life human being. I also called the Department of Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business's job seeker line, 136268, several times. I am pleased to report to the House that on every occasion I was immediately answered by a real-life human being who dealt with my queries in a very courteous way.I can report to the House that since July 1998 the job seeker line operated by the department of employment services, 136268, has had 99 per cent of calls answered within 15 seconds. I can also report that the employment line operated by the department of employment services, 131715, since April  1998 has had 96 per cent of calls answered within 15 seconds. I am told that the call centre industry would regard this performance as absolutely world class. I should also point out that, of the 22 call centres operated by Centrelink, 14 are in regional and rural areas. Obviously, this is very good for employment in country Australia.</DOC>

 - What I propose to release is the work that was done by the Treasury modelling tax changes on the household expenditure survey. That is what I intend to release. - Let me make this point, Mr Speaker -  - Don't get so upset: it is only the first day, Simon! Mr Speaker, what I propose to release is the household expenditure survey -  - As I said, Mr Speaker, what I propose to release is the Treasury advice to the government and the modelling in relation to the effect of the government's tax package done under costing of the household expenditure survey.This treatment of the household expenditure survey data is wrong. It is nothing more than a statistical nonsense. The HES is based on a sample survey. As the data are divided into smaller and smaller subsets, the accuracy of any derived estimates declines rapidly. Some cells used in the opposition analysis contain as few as seven households and are clearly useless as a guide to the impact of the package. Word for word, that was a statement by Mr Dawkins, Labor Treasurer, to this House on 3 March 1992.On 3 March 1992, in response to a freedom of information request from the member for Flinders, he released Treasury modelling of the household expenditure survey which said then, when the Treasury advised the Labor Party, that the household expenditure survey was not reliable. In fact, this was the document that the Labor Treasurer, Mr Dawkins, tabled in the parliament in March 1992, which included a Treasury minute - and the Treasury advice has not changed from 1992 to 1998 - that the HES sample did not accurately reflect the Australian population in respect of the household characteristics -  - We are not relying on it. You are relying on it. That is the whole point. Right throughout the election campaign the Labor Party said, `Where is the household  expenditure survey?' after their own Treasurer, in March 1992, had come into this House and said it was unreliable. In response to the member for Flinders, he had tabled a minute to that effect from the Treasury, and its advice has not changed in the last seven years. And now one of their frontbenchers says, `Why are you relying on it?' For heavens sake, we have been trying to make the point now for seven weeks that we do not rely on it. Neither did the Labor Party up until 1998, when it suited it to turn itself inside out, reverse its position, disagree with what it had said in government and retreat into the isolationist, populist rubbish that it is now going on with.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hughes for her question. I also take the opportunity of congratulating her on her campaign. The great thing about her campaign is that she has been campaigning, in the sense of being a good member, from the day she was elected. It is a great tribute to her. It is no surprise, Mr Speaker, that she would ask a question about the job prospects of young people as it relates to young people in her electorate.The government is very concerned about youth unemployment and, for that reason, it is a policy intention of ours to legislate to protect an existing system which has served this country very well for many years and, in particular, which protects the jobs of young people.Our concern is that when this legislation is introduced into the parliament all the indications from the Labor Party, and certainly very  clearly from the ACTU, are that they will oppose the legislative measures we intend introducing to protect young people's jobs. It is, I believe, an incredible policy position for the Labor Party to be gearing up to oppose a measure which will protect young people's jobs.I say that in the context of some of the very strong positions taken by others on this issue. For example, Tony Blair's government in the UK have recently had a report on minimum wages and they have specifically indicated their intention to introduce an aged based youth wage in the UK, which is all that we are proposing - namely, the retention of that system in Australia. They are going to introduce it.In New South Wales and in Queensland, where we have state Labor governments, neither of those governments have moved to abolish the junior wage rate system that we have. Neither of those governments have moved to adopt the competency based system which the Labor Party, and certainly the ACTU, would prefer. We understand why they would prefer it. But for 10 years they have been looking for a viable alternative to junior wage rates and for 10 years they have failed to come up with a system that would be workable and which would protect young people's jobs.If you look at other evidence on this issue, the National Institute of Labor Studies said on 1 November:This is the most irresponsible action I have seen from the union movement.The Productivity Commission said on 16 October:A one per cent increase in youth wages would lead to a decrease in youth employment of between two and five per cent.The results quite strongly suggest that there would be a more than proportionate reduction in youth employment. The Australian Retailers Association on 30 September said:In the retail industry alone, the jobs of more than 220,000 young people are jeopardised - 60,000 at risk of immediately being laid off.Even the Canberra Times , in a comment piece, said on 26 October:You have to wonder how serious some people are about lowering youth unemployment. Since we all agree the level of youth unemployment is a national tragedy, one can only wonder at how some people keep wanting to put even more obstacles in the way of young people finding jobs.There could not be stronger evidence in support of the proposition the government is advancing. I say to the Labor Party - and perhaps hopefully to the new members of the Labor Party - this is an issue that the Labor Party should re-examine because the fact of the matter is that, if the junior wage rate system goes, a lot of young people will lose their jobs. If that is the case, that result will be on your head.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Eden-Monaro for his question and I acknowledge the great election victory he had on 3 October.Back in 1992, Labor Treasurer John Dawkins informed this House that the household expenditure survey was not a reliable  way to cost all tax changes. It was not a reliable survey to use on that basis. He said:The treatment of household expenditure survey data is wrong. It is nothing more than a statistical nonsense.He also tendered in those large documents a Treasury minute to him as the Treasurer saying why the household expenditure survey was not relevant. It is a survey that is done every five years. If you happen during the survey period to buy a lump sum item, for example, it is assumed you buy one every week. If your expenditure in a particular week includes the purchase of a refrigerator, for example, instead of showing expenditure of $100 for the week, you are assumed on the basis of survey data to have spent $800. In  relation to self-employed people, it is notoriously unreliable as to their savings ratios. On the basis of the household expenditure survey, some of them have a dissaving at the rate of 300 per cent per annum.That did not stop the Labor Party in 1998 reversing its position and saying that the only reliable measure was the household expenditure survey and advertising the day before the election saying that Treasury papers would show that the effect was five times greater than the CPI analysis, which was 1.9 per cent. The analysis that John Dawkins said was right in 1992 was the analysis which was used for the 1985 white paper, where Kim Beazley supported the GST.Today I release all those documents to the House in response to a freedom of information request, precisely the same thing that John Dawkins did in relation to the request by the then member for Flinders. It will show, Mr Speaker, if you look at it on a household expenditure basis, the effect on the cost of living across 11 different household groups at five different income levels. Remember the Labor Party said it would show five times 1.9 per cent, or 9.5 per cent. The cost of living increase varied between 1.3 per cent and 2.5 per cent. Treasury analysis - remember the government said 1.9 per cent and the Labor Party claimed in advertising it was 9.5 - was that the all household price change, on the HES based analysis, was 1.8 per cent, lower than the CPI effect of 1.9. It was lower. - We are back to the documents now, are we? No wonder we are back to the documents. I will table that advertisement, Mr Speaker. The reason why the analysis was not put out - and we said it at the time - was that the Treasury had said in 1985 it had advised the Labor Party to do it on a CPI basis; the Treasury had said in 1992, when it modelled Fightback, to do it on a CPI basis and the Treasury had told us to do it on a CPI basis. The Treasury had said it was unreliable. We had it done to make sure the compensation package would exceed the cost on any measure, which is why we chose four per cent, and the all household result was 1.8 per cent. The Labor Party advertising on the eve of the election, I am afraid to say, was totally false and fabricated. - I table it.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, may I take the opportunity to congratulate you on your elevation, which I have not previously had the chance to do. I also congratulate the member for Kalgoorlie on becoming the representative of the world's largest electorate. He will be an excellent representative. The government, unlike the people on the opposition benches, is committed to providing young Australians with basic literacy and numeracy standards which will ground their education for their future careers, lifting teachers' skills and providing apprenticeships to meet skill shortages in rural Australia. They constitute the core of the very important election commitments we made.On the other side of the House I am aware of alternatives and that the opposition education policy is a shambles. This is not a partisan comment because it is, indeed, the description offered by the member for Werriwa, the little Red Indian sitting on the back bench up there, who made it very clear that this was not a policy worth supporting. - Mr Speaker, far be it from me to debate the point, but that is the description by the member for Werriwa of himself. He was a little Red Indian who was not going to take it any more on the front bench of the Labor Party.I must make it clear that during the election campaign I unfairly criticised the member for Werriwa because I wrongly believed that he was the author of the education policy of the Labor Party. But he has now made it clear through the Sydney Morning Herald of 10 October that the policy was in fact butchered by staffers the day before it was released, to the Labor Party's embarrassment. He said:I put 18 months into a policy document to have it butchered by staffers the day before it was released  . . .He also said:Mike Pezzullo, chief policy adviser, and John Angley, who worked for Kim as finance minister and had no involvement in the education area, rewrote the bloody thing, all under the approval of McMullan. - Mr Speaker, I was asked about alternatives and the quality of those alternatives. There is surely no better authority on this than the member for Werriwa, who described in detail the nature of the Labor Party's education policy. What he said was this:So they stuffed it up. . . . So we have an argument in the airport lounge, and I'm told the Victorian branch was printing different versions at 1 o'clock  in the morning and taking out a dozen spelling mistakes. - Mr Speaker, I am describing the alternatives that I am aware of -  - to the government's comprehensive plan to raise education standards. Let us be quite clear what this means. It means that the Labor Party has an education policy that is so flawed that the shadow minister resigned rather than take responsibility for that policy.All that can be said is that the member for Dobell was not too intellectually proud to pick it up; indeed, apparently any old policy will do for him. He is apparently very satisfied to be the education spokesman for the intellectual vacuum which now exists in the Labor Party in this vital policy area. - </DOC>

 - The Labour Ministers Council is a meeting of state and Commonwealth ministers and, as part of the process of the Labour Ministers Council, it was agreed that a report would be commissioned from Des Moore at a cost of $35,000. The agreement amongst members of the LMC is that those governments which support the proposed project will fund the project. Some are in it. -  - Obviously, the Labor Party ones would not be in it. As to the cost, I think it is $35,000, which I would have to say is a very reasonable figure for the report which he has prepared. The report has not yet been released, but it will be released as it will be presented to the LMC which is meeting at the end of the month. In terms of the contents of the report, they simply establish the argument for further deregulation of the labour market. The bottom line of his proposal is that if we had a more deregulated market then we would be able to create many more jobs. - The only point I would make to the opposition shadow minister is to say that any proposition which is forcefully argued and which is proposing changes to create hundreds of thousands of jobs deserves to be looked at. It deserves to be the subject of reasoned and informed public debate. When you have got that report then you can make, hopefully, an informed and reasoned contribution to it.I am not surprised that the Labor Party would want to attack Des Moore personally because, when Des Moore was running the IPA, he put out an IPA backgrounder which revealed that the Labor Party in government was funding unions - which he estimated at a cost of $130 million to $140 million a year. So, instead of attacking Des Moore personally, why don't you wait until the report is published?</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I might say that it is welcome to have a sensible and informed question on immigration issues, particularly from the area that the member represents. Like my colleagues, I commend him for his magnificent maiden speech so early in the parliament. I want to take the opportunity to explain to members - and perhaps particularly to members opposite - some of the concerns that I have at the moment about immigration.At any time we have in the order of 50,000 people unlawfully here. Many of them are overstayers of visits to Australia - sometimes students, and others. Numbers of people make asylum claims in Australia. We regard our international obligations as being serious issues which we have to address, particularly when asylum claims are made. We spend a great deal of money in assessing those claims properly and making considered judgments in relation to them. Unfortunately, numbers of people today seek to remain in Australia simply for the purpose of working - often when they are unlawful. They are involving themselves in many devious ways of achieving that outcome.At the moment, some 5,000 people are involved in six class actions before the Federal Court challenging immigration status. Most of them are not asylum seekers - let me make that very clear. The numbers are continuing to grow. To give you an idea of the class actions, in one group, 670 people have paid $500 each to legal advisers. You can add that amount up fairly easily - it is in the order of $300,000 to pursue one legal case for a couple of days in court. We have another class action involving 2,900 cases. I do not know what the individual charge is; but, if it is anything like the former, it runs into more than a million and a half dollars.Why are these people pursuing class actions? They are doing it because it enables them, with delays before the Federal Court of Australia sometimes of a year or more, to access employment. What is happening is that -  - You say that, but let me just say to the Leader of the Opposition: if you are serious about these matters let us understand that the more matters before the courts, the longer they take to deal with. What is happening is that, because there is an advantage in being able to obtain work rights, people are obtaining funds to go into these class actions to further delay the system and to delay us being able to give justice to those who have bona fide asylum claims. We know that they are now seeking to use the intervention power that I have to also delay their removal and to use it as a basis for applying for bridging visas to remain in Australia and to obtain work rights.I am receiving at the moment on the average 500 cases per month. Most of them are without substance. Those that do have substance will obviously be considered by me with every compassion that can be offered. But let it be clear that the only way we are able to remove this sore is to remove the opportunity from those who have already had their cases considered by my department, by the Refugee Review Tribunal, perhaps the Immigration Review Tribunal and often by the courts already, because these involve multiple applications. Single cases have been rejected. The removal of this employment opportunity is the only way in which we are going to be able to remove this sore. I lament very much that the Australian Democrats are moving to repeal this regulation, but I will lament it even more if the Labor Party were to support them in relation to that matter, particularly in relation to the important issue of maintaining integrity in relation to this process.</DOC>

 - Let me start at the last statement made by the honourable member for Melbourne. The simple fact was that the fees that were paid for the sale of the first tranche of Telstra were not over budget; they were exactly in accordance with what was approved by cabinet. Let me just indicate this on a comparative basis: the fees that were paid for the sale of Telstra amounted to 1.8 per cent of what was returned. With telco sales in other parts of the world, in Europe or the United States, the average is four per cent. The cost of selling telecommunications companies on the open market averages four per cent. Our cost was 1.8 per cent. Clearly, great value for money was received. What Labor does not accept is that that particular offer by the coalition government was overwhelmingly embraced by the Australian people. - What I am indicating very clearly to the House is that this was not a decision that was welcomed by the Labor Party at the time and they wanted us to pull the sale. They talked about the fire sale. They  told us we were going to flog off the shares for nothing and get no value for taxpayers. It was $6 billion or $7 billion that was being predicted by the Labor Party - not value for money - but I say clearly that the very cost-effective work done by those advisers appointed by the government meant that it did return to the Australian people $14.3 billion on top of a $3 billion recapitalisation. - I simply conclude by saying this: an independent assessment was done to appoint the business advisers. Due regard - in fact absolute regard - was taken for getting value for money for Australian taxpayers. That was achieved, and the Auditor-General stated very clearly that it was a remarkable result in a very volatile market which existed at that time.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, may I congratulate the member for Riverina on her election to this place. The electorate of Riverina is that food bowl seat in New South Wales. Also may I congratulate you on your election to the high office of Speaker of the House of Representatives.Before I respond to the honourable member's question, may I seek your indul  gence to inform the House that I have been alerted earlier today that there has been a fire in the Edmund Barton Building on Kings Avenue, and staff of my department and other departments and visitors in the building have been evacuated. I understand that one person has been injured and taken to hospital. I have no doubt that all members of this House will share my concern for the welfare of all the people who work there. - I apologise, Mr Speaker. It is a very relevant question that the member for Riverina raises, and quite obviously the people of rural and regional Australia support the government's policies by virtue of the fact that they have re-elected us to government. It is the coalition that is sitting on the government benches, not the Australian Labor Party. They quite clearly rejected the policies of the Australian Labor Party. People in rural and regional Australia obviously supported the economic management of this government over the last 2½ to three years, which has produced a low interest rate regime, low inflation and stability for the future. They supported that wholeheartedly by returning seats like those held now by the member for Riverina, the member for Blair and the member for Kalgoorlie back into the coalition fold, not to the Labor Party. You did not win those seats in regional Australia. -  - It is interesting to note the reason why the people in regional Australia have supported the coalition's policies, and particularly the tax reform package. Some very constructive research done by the Centre for Agriculture and Regional Economics out of the University of New England on our tax package indicated that there would be an increase in disposable income in all categories of the farm sector. On a beef or wool farm there would be an increase in disposable income of $5,800 per annum. On dry land cropping and mixed grazing properties there  would be an increase in disposable income of $8,549 per annum. Interestingly, particularly for the Member for Riverina, on irrigated cropping and grazing properties - those that are located in the member for Riverina's electorate - there will be an increase in disposable income of $9,341 per annum.That is a study that has been independently done out of the University of New England. That is the reason rural and regional Australia absolutely supported the coalition's policies that we have implemented over the last 2½ years to provide economic stability in that sector in this country and to build a foundation for the future of Australia. They have supported that.That was supported by New South Wales farmers. What did the farming community say about the policies of the Australian Labor Party? The United Graziers Association in Queensland said:The ALP tax package is of limited help to the bush.The UGA President, Mr Noel Kennedy, commented:We are disappointed that the proposal - this is the ALP's proposal - does not address the myriad of inbuilt taxes which affect our ability to compete internationally and I would call on the opposition to reconsider its proposals.This was during the campaign. He went on to say:In particular, there needs to be a review of the fuel excises which have a direct effect on the cost of freight and hence our competitiveness.Most importantly - and the opposition should take note of this comment by Mr Noel Kennedy - he said:We are also very concerned that assets acquired pre capital gains tax will become taxable from 1 January 1999 and that valuations will mean further expense for already cash-strapped graziers.That was the policy that people in rural Australia did not like from the Australian Labor Party. They voted against it and they supported our policies. The NFF President, Ian Donges, said in a release:On top of the current low interest rates, low inflation and current exchange rate a tax environment like this would make Australia's farm exports  much more competitive. That means more jobs for salary and wage earners in the sector which provides as many as 32 per cent of jobs, mostly in rural and regional Australia, and a better standard of living for all of us.Mr Speaker, that is why rural and regional Australia supported and re-elected the coalition government. That is why straight after the election there was a banner headline in one of the rural newspapers which said `The bush delivers to the coalition'. - The bush recognised that it was only going to be the coalition government that would deliver for them.</DOC>

 - First, I thank the honourable member for her question and congratulate her on her election to the House. I know she will make a very fine member. I also congratulate you, Mr Speaker, on your elevation to the speakership.Iraq's failure to cooperate with the United Nations Special Commission is a totally unacceptable flouting of its international obligations as set out in a variety of Security Council resolutions and in the agreement signed with the United Nations Secretary-General during February of this year. On 5 November the Security Council adopted a further resolution condemning Iraq's action in this respect. We are deeply disturbed by Iraq's calculated defiance of the will of the international community and we condemn unreservedly this breach of international law. A diplomatic resolution to this crisis is still possible if Iraq immediately and unconditionally resumes full cooperation with the United Nations Special Commission and the International Atomic Energy Agency.The House should be aware, though, that if Iraq does not do this then military action may be the only alternative to ensure that Iraq does not resume its weapons of mass destruction program. If this does happen, the Iraqi government will have no-one to blame but itself for the damage and for the hardship that will likely result for the Iraqi people.</DOC>

 - This question passes strange out of the lips of the man whose government had 13 years to fix Commonwealth-state financial relations and did absolutely nothing at all. What I can guarantee to the Leader of the Opposition is that tomorrow I will talk to the premiers and the chief ministers of the Australian states and territories about the best ever offer from a federal government since World War II to reform Australia's financial relations. I have already indicated in private discussions with the premiers that we have no intention of using the route of specific purpose payments to take away through the back door what we are clearly giving in a very generous fashion through the front door in relation to our proposal.What has got to be understood by the Leader of the Opposition, and what should be understood by all those who care about the provision of adequate money for roads, for schools, for hospitals and for police services in the states, is that the only way you can guarantee the continued existence of those services years into the future is to adopt the coalition's taxation reform plan.One of the strangest things about the debate on the goods and services tax is that people attack it in the name of defending the welfare sector. This is a great defence of the welfare sector because what this plan will do is to guarantee, like no other plan, a flow of funds from the federal government to the state governments so they can provide the money for schools, hospitals and the police.If any of you people who sit opposite, particularly the members who have joined us as a result of the last election, are interested in adequate schools, adequate health provision  and adequate police services, you will change your opposition to the government's taxation plan. You will change your opposition to the government's taxation plan because this is the greatest gift that any federal government has offered to the states of Australia to reform their capacity to maintain essential services.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for La Trobe for his question. I also congratulate him on his tremendous campaign result. The Labor Party were only able to take 0.31 per cent off him - a pretty good outcome.The labour force data released today by the Australian Bureau of Statistics shows that the unemployment rate has dropped from 8.1 per cent to 7.7 per cent. This rate is the lowest recorded since October 1990. This is the lowest rate recorded since the Keating-Beazley recession that we had to have. The stats also show the number of people unemployed has fallen by 40,800. In seasonally adjusted terms, the number of people currently unemployed is the lowest since January 1991. But it does not end there. A total of 35,200 new jobs were added to the economy in October. The total number of jobs created since the coalition came into office is 393,500. Within that, more than half of those jobs have been full-time.I am also very pleased to be able to inform the House that the youth unemployment rate is at its lowest since February 1990. The number of 15- to 19-year-olds looking for full-time work fell by 7,400. But I must say there are still thousands of young people unemployed, and we are, of course, very  concerned to ensure that we do all within our power to see those young people have the opportunity they should have. I think it is also fair and important to say these are only one month's figures, but if you look at the trend rate you will see that also fell. That is, I think, very encouraging to those who are arguing for and implementing reform - which provides, of course, much of the explanation for these good results. When we were elected back in March 1996, the rate was 8.5 per cent. It is a tremendous tribute to this government that we have seen that rate fall from 8.5 to 7.7 per cent. - The interjection is on the participation rate. The participation rate was up a bit last month and it is back to an average sort of figure in this month. -  - If they dare ask me a question about it, Mr Speaker, I will run through the stats.I think the other thing that needs to be said is that these very good numbers have been created against a backdrop of economic uncertainty in our region. I think it is also fair to conclude that this is a tremendous tribute to the Prime Minister's leadership and, of course, to the excellent management of the economy by my colleague the Treasurer. It is also, you would have to say, a huge disappointment to the Labor Party. On 1 September, Kim Beazley said:This government has sent unemployment backwards.On 10 September, he said:Basically, what we are talking about now is stall.On 8 November, he said:The leader of the party could only create 16,000 new full-time jobs in six years.Six years for 16,000! He said:The economy is slowing and it is not going to create the jobs it used to create under Labor.The last point that needs to be made is that from the government's point of view it is one month's figures. We have a plan to create more jobs in the future. We have a tremen  dous tax reform plan which will be great for business. If we can encourage our businesses they will create more jobs. For the small business community, which have done a great job in giving us the jobs we have seen announced today, we today introduced legislation to exempt them from unfair dismissal. The reason we did that is that small business is saying to us: if you can give us a fairer system we will create another 50,000 jobs. The Labor Party is responsible for much of the unemployment in this country today. We are working hard to get it down and it should finally be its responsibility to step aside and let this government implement its reform program.</DOC>

The reasons why the government is accepting Senator Colston's vote have been explained, and in  our accepting Senator Colston's vote we are doing no different from what you do every division, accepting the vote of the honourable member for Fremantle, and any more than your Labor colleague -  - I would have thought the Leader of the Opposition has just made a point in favour of the answer that I was giving. I thought he was behaving like counsel for the defence. I have already explained this matter to the Australian people and I think the course of action we have embarked upon is entirely appropriate.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Aston for a very important question about a very important meeting which is to take place in Kuala Lumpur next week. I will be attending the APEC meeting which takes place at a time when some of the goals for which APEC was established and which I understood, certainly up until now, to be supported in a bipartisan way by both the Australian Labor Party and the coalition parties need to be reaffirmed. This will happen at Kuala Lumpur next week.The time of economic difficulty through which the region is passing is no time to walk away from the essence of the Bogor declaration. I have to say in this regard that we are a little concerned about the attitude being taken by the Japanese government in relation to the agreement to fast track liberalisation in 15 sectors, such as the so-called agreement on early voluntary sectoral liberalisation which was canvassed at the Vancouver meeting of APEC at the end of last year.It is also important that the APEC economies adopt policies that will lead to a resumption of strong growth. Part of that process is for all members of APEC to commit themselves to improving their own economic and financial management. Among other things my government has proposed the adoption by APEC of relevant codes of international best practice, such as the Basle code on banking supervision.It is also important that APEC help galvanise international efforts in the IMF, the so-called group of 22 and elsewhere, to reform the international financial system. There has been a lot of talk about these issues recently and we now need some practical proposals and agreement to carry them out.It is also significant that the meeting in Kuala Lumpur is taking place against a background of considerable international examination of events inside Malaysia itself. I take the opportunity of saying that it is my intention to have a bilateral meeting with the Prime Minister of Malaysia. I think it is  appropriate, given our regional association, that I should have such a meeting. I was a little surprised at the suggestion made by the leader of the opposition that in some way I should be reluctant to meet Dr Mahathir.I think it is very important in circumstances such as this that, given the character of our relationship and given the importance of the bilateral relationship and the fact that we are part of this region, we do not automatically follow the stances taken by heads of government from countries that are not geographically part of this region. It is important that we have an independence of action in these matters.I think it is also important for another reason that these meetings take place. If you have concerns about what may be happening inside a country, your obligation is to meet face to face with the head of government of that country and to express those concerns. I can assure those opposite that I will be talking in a very open but constructive fashion with the Prime Minister of Malaysia.I think I was probably the first regional head of government to express a concern about some of the things that were going on inside Malaysia and, as a result of those remarks, other heads of government expressed similar concerns. Let us put down immediately the canard around from the opposition that in some way we have been reluctant to express our concerns.It is an important bilateral relationship. I intend to handle it in a sensitive but frank manner. I regard APEC as extremely important and I hope that, notwithstanding the regional economic difficulties, the heads of government that assemble in Kuala Lumpur next week will see that it is in the long-term interests of their individual societies and of APEC as a whole that the fundamental thrust of the Bogor declaration be reaffirmed.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Hotham for the question. I thank him for talking about Dr Neil Warren. I thank him for talking about the household expenditure survey. In fact, I am generally generous towards him for having asked me the question, because it allows me to remind the House that the household expenditure survey approach, which was on the table for debate in 1992, was comprehensively attacked and discredited by the government of which he was then a member. - It is right. You cannot escape your rhetorical past on these things. Your rhetorical past and the stance that your government took was one of saying that the household expenditure survey approach is completely inappropriate. Our position has always been that the consumer price index measure - the measure that the Labor Party used for 13 years to adjust the pensions of retired Australians on a half yearly basis - is the one to use.If you really are concerned about the right index to use to maintain the living standards of low income people, wouldn't the most sensible thing be to look at the index used to adjust the old age pension? Wouldn't you think that is the fairest way of doing it and that, if there is something wrong with that and it is unfair, a Labor government or a coalition government at some time in the past would have altered that method? But, of course, we have not.The truth is that the Labor Party has been caught out on this issue. Before the election, the Labor Party ran around this country and, as late as a day before the election, dishonest  ly and deceitfully caused an advertisement to be published in the press of Australia saying that the true picture, according to Treasury advice, was that the impact on the poor was five times what the government was saying. They have been caught out. If I were you, I would not ask any more questions about this because the more questions you ask about this, the more you will be reminded by us of how you dishonestly misled the Australian people before the last election.We have a fair compensation package. It is a balanced compensation package. It is a compensation package that will always ensure that the level of the pension is at least 1½ per cent in real terms ahead of the actual price impact of the goods and services tax. That is an absolute guarantee. That is a fundamental part of our plan. That is why the Australian people endorsed our plan on 3 October.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Parramatta for his question. I know how dedicated he is to providing expanded opportunities and a voice for young Australians. The National Youth Round Table is one of the significant initiatives of this government which will give a very clear message to young Australians that they are valued participants in the democratic processes of this country. It will give many young Australians, who I hope will aspire to leadership of this country at some later time in their lives, the chance to talk directly to government.The National Youth Round Table will consist of some 50 young Australians between the ages of 15 and 24 years. It will meet every six months and it will be representative of the whole group of young Australians. It will have the opportunity to talk to government directly about a range of youth issues, of issues of concern to young people such as  jobs - and it is very pleasing to note the significant fall in the numbers of youth unemployed today - education, health, youth suicide, and youth services.Applications for the National Youth Round Table closed in October but there was enormous interest from young Australians, and the fact that the nomination period coincided with the federal election campaign meant that many young people have since sought the opportunity to apply. So I am announcing today that the government has decided to extend the application period for the National Youth Round Table until 4 December. I encourage young people to apply to become representatives of young people in Australia on the round table. I encourage communities and community leaders to nominate their young achievers. I give the House the information that forms are available through the youth web site, The Source, and young people may gain further information by phoning 1800 624 309.</DOC>

 - First of all, may I congratulate the honourable member for Curtin on her maiden question and on her election to the House. It is a great thing to have a woman brought up in the electorate of Mayo representing Curtin. - As I said yesterday, Iraq's current course of action shows a flagrant disregard for the will of the international community and it does risk provoking a military response. In this volatile situation, a prime concern for the government must be the welfare of Australians in the region. Australian embassies have been busy contacting Australians in Iraq and more widely in the Middle East. I understand there are 19 Australian citizens left in Iraq following the withdrawal of United Nations and UNSCOM personnel during the course of last night.Over the last 12 hours I have authorised the issue of travel advisory notices for Iraq, Israel, Kuwait and the Middle East generally. Let me make a couple of points about those. First of all, no Australian should consider travelling to Iraq until further notice. All Australians who do not have essential business that requires their presence in Iraq should leave. Australians should consider deferring non-essential travel to Israel and Kuwait for the time being and Australians in all parts of the Gulf and Middle East should exercise caution and remain vigilant at all times. I have also today authorised non-essential embassy staff and dependants in Israel to leave the country should they wish.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Sturt for his question. My attention has been drawn to comments in today's Australian Financial Review  from Stanley Fischer, the first deputy managing director of the IMF. Mr Fischer is quoted as saying this:The Australian economy has really done remarkably well, and the policy framework has changed amazingly. You have a very coherent monetary policy now; and you're running a fiscal surplus now. There are very few countries running a fiscal surplus.Stanley Fischer is responsible for most of the Asian IMF packages, and this is a very important recognition from an independent third-party source of the government's economic policy.This was a government that put in place a new monetary policy. You will recall that when we did the Australian Labor Party said they were going to sue us for putting in place that monetary policy. And now Mr Stanley Fischer says it is a very coherent monetary policy. When this government came to office, and the then Minister for Finance, Mr Beazley, had left the Australian accounts $10.3 billion in deficit, we said that the Australian budget had to be put into a surplus. The Australian Labor Party fought every single expenditure saving that this government put into place. It fought every single one of them. Then, on the eve of the last election, it said that it actually believed in surplus budgeting. - You are going to see a repeat in this parliament. The Australian  Labor Party is going to fight every single tax reform measure and then when it is put in place say, `We are really in favour of tax reform. We really actually endorse tax reform.'Mr Stanley Fischer went on to say that the government's proposals were:. . . a change toward the efficiency of the tax system . . . He said:. . . it is a good reform.Asked whether the timing was right, he said:I don't know what the right time is. But when politicians campaign, say they are going to do something like that which could be unpopular, I think they get a mandate to do it.He said, `I think they get a mandate to do it.' That was Mr Stanley Fischer of the IMF.Could you imagine a Labor treasurer going to an IMF meeting and saying to the Brits, who have a value added tax, `You've got it all wrong,' or saying to the Germans, who have a value added tax, `You've got it all wrong,' or saying to the Japanese, who have a value added tax, `You've got it all wrong,' or saying to the Singaporeans or the Canadians, `You've got it all wrong.'?  Can you imagine them saying at an IMF meeting, `What you countries really need is a wholesale sales tax. Why don't you follow us and Ghana and the Solomon Islands and Swaziland? What you need is a 1930s tax model.'? The Labor Party stands here in Australia today, stands in the school house door, saying `Wholesale sales tax today, wholesale sales tax tomorrow, wholesale sales tax forever.' You are the only people in western developed countries who maintain a support for the wholesale sales tax because you are not prepared to face the issues, you are not prepared to get in step with the international order and you are not prepared to do the reform necessary for the country.</DOC>

It goes to the heart of the importance of the taxation reforms that we have put before the Australian people and which have been accepted and welcomed by them. They have been particularly welcomed in electorates like that of the honourable member because of the implications they have for the transport industry. The transport industry is a vital cog in the Australian economy. It is indeed the lifeblood of our  whole body corporate and economy, if you like. The changes that we are proposing will constitute an enormous reform which will make a very big difference indeed.In the trucking industry alone, the average wholesale sales tax now on a big rig is over $40,000. It will go. The wholesale sales tax on tyres, parts, tarpaulins and ropes goes. We have some of the most highly taxed transport fuel arrangements in the world - higher, as I understand it, than many small European countries, let alone countries with distances comparable to ours. The reductions amount to some 34 per cent in the case of transport fuel for trucks, where the cost of transport fuel will come down from around -  -  - It is interesting that the opposition finds this hard to come to grips with. It is a very important reform. They do not like it. They recognise that it is extremely welcome in regional Australia and will make a big difference. For that reason they are obviously not particularly keen to talk about it. A 34 per cent reduction in the fuel costs of heavy trucks is a very important reform indeed, particularly when you consider it in the context of a certain debate happening around this place at the moment about taxes on food.The dairy industry will tell you, for example, that before an average dairy item is consumed by an Australian it has been transported on five trucks. Each of those trucks, by international standards, is taxed very heavily. We are going to remove that burden of taxation and that is a very important reform.In general terms the importance of the savings that will arise from our transport reforms cannot be underestimated. They are very important to rural and regional Australia. They are very important indeed for our export performance. They are very important for the regeneration of prosperity and jobs in regional Australia.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. I notice that it is not the one that she had intended to ask yesterday. I am disappointed about that. She faxed me a copy of it yesterday morning! - Perhaps she thought I might go easy on her if I had advance notice. In answer to the question, a report on the structural review of Air Services Australia has been considered by the government. We have agreed to consider introducing competition into some aspects of Air Services's tower business. This will not occur until the Civil Aviation Safety Authority has developed appropriate operating and licensing standards, because safety will remain our number one concern. We have, in this place now, a thoroughly effective body in CASA - a body headed up by a new executive director in Mick Toller, who enjoys the enormous respect of the Australian aviation industry. We are in a position where we can reassure the travelling public in this country that safety is paramount and that it will not be compromised.In terms of the question, the action that we have taken accords with an number of firm expressions of interest that the government has received from new airport lessees seeking to make tower services contestable. We will look at those very closely. We need to ensure that tower services are more responsive to the needs of airport users, and we have taken action to amend the Civil Aviation Regulations to permit bodies other than Air Services Australia to provide those services. But, again, I emphasise that safety will not be compromised. - Yes, I was. - </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Macquarie for his question because I know the interest that he takes in the welfare of his constituents. Indeed, last Saturday I attended with him the opening of a new hostel facility in his electorate - and a splendid facility it is, run by the Baptist community services organisation. I know that he shares with me, and indeed with the Prime Minister, the government's wish to see as many old Australians who want to stay in their own home when they are frail able to do so.Accordingly, we are putting in place policies to do precisely that. For a start, we have put in place a $280 million package over four years to fund 3,400 places for care in your own home. I like to call them stay at home packages because it does mean that you get assistance with bathing in the morning and with getting dressed. I might add that my own very favourite aunt, who is 93 years old, has one of these packages. - I will tell you, Prime Minister, that when I called to see her on the weekend she was planning -  - She'd probably enjoy it. - The reason I raised the question of my favourite aunt -  - Unfortunately he passed away. - Mr Speaker -  -  - Mr Speaker, I would just like to say that I am rather disappointed in that lot over there. - As I said, these care packages are very important to older Australians. I am fortunate to have an aunt who can have one. The second part of one of the initiatives which we have introduced is that a further $80 million will be made available for respite care for carers of older Australians. In addition, there is increased funding into the HACC Program. There is an increase of five per cent, whereby we are putting in $500 million, met by a 40 per cent contribution from the states. Again, this allows older Australians to remain in their homes. These initiatives will be ongoing. It is part of this government's commitment to allow those older Australians the dignity of living in their own home.I am sorry that you laughed when I told you about a relative of mine because, believe me, it is important to me, it is important to her and it is important to a lot of other Australians who find themselves in exactly the same position. I hope that in the future you may show that you have a little more tenderness in your own hearts.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. The government's policy on the further sale of Telstra was clearly outlined during the election campaign, and legislation to fulfil those commitments has been introduced earlier today. This package, as you will have noticed from any study you may have done, will enable the further sale of Telstra, with some of the proceeds from the further sale being used to provide a social bonus to modernise telecommunications. It will enhance communications services in rural and regional areas and will benefit the environment. In particular, there will be a staged approach to the further sale of Telstra with, initially, a sale limit of 49.9 per cent. - So there will be a staged approach to the further sale of Telstra, as has been made abundantly clear by the government, and in return there will be an enormous benefit for all Australians from that. Moreover, the Commonwealth will not be relinquishing majority ownership unless and until an independent inquiry finds that Telstra has met satisfactory levels of performance. The number of benefits that are available to Australians has been made well known. - As I said, the government's policy has been made abundantly clear many times, and more so now that the legislation has been drafted and introduced into the parliament. There was a staged approach. There are enormous benefits for all Australians and there is also protection for all Australians.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dunkley for his question. The member has numerous Job Network providers in his electorate, particularly in Frankston and Mornington. The Job Network is a bold and visionary reform for which the previous minister for employment ought to be congratulated. I do not say that the Job Network is entirely without blemish, but by the only criteria which really count, the Job Network is already far outperforming the old CES.In October of 1997, 36,000 job vacancies were registered with the old CES. In October 1998, 54,000 new job vacancies were registered with the new Job Network. In October 1997, the old CES put 17,000 unemployed people who were on benefit into work. In October this year, the new Job Network put 21,700 unemployed people who were on benefit into work. Over the last couple of weeks, both I and the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business have conducted intensive consultations with members of the Job Network. They say that the biggest single problem that the Job Network faces is unjustified carping.Today, I had a note from the member for Petrie,  forwarding me a letter from a Job Network member in her electorate. This Job Network member is very concerned that a major employer in her electorate did not want to use the Job Network because of the bad publicity that the Job Network has had. The Job Network member says:This was very upsetting for myself and my staff as we have built up a reputation for excellent and efficient service and I felt we are being punished for the bad press that constantly haunts our TV screens . . . The bad publicity has done disservice to our not for profit organisation and an injustice to the people on the peninsula.Obviously, people are perfectly entitled to point out and to criticise aspects of the system which are not up to scratch, but it is very important that we keep it all in perspective.  I think that people need to remember that every time they criticise the Job Network they are not just attacking the government; they are attacking the organisations which comprise that network, including people like Mission Australia and the Salvation Army's Employment Plus. - They are not criticising us; they are supporting the system. Every time they criticise the Job Network, they end up attacking the weakest and the most vulnerable people in our society, the unemployed, whom the Job Network is designed to help.I do not believe that anyone wants to use the unemployed of this country as a political punching bag, but that is the risk that people run when they take cheap shots at a system which is already working extremely well.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and indicate very clearly that the Auditor-General, in referring to the $5 million that related to paying the global coordinators and business advisers in respect of the so-called success fee -  - Thank you - the underwriting related to the indemnifications the government received for the second instalment. The honourable member might be pleased to note that right now there is the collection of that  second instalment under the instalment receipts process. I indicate to the House that that is proceeding successfully. The cut-off point is 17 November. There was an obligation on the part of the global coordinators to stand behind those processes. That obligation is currently being carried out and the process is being completed. The simple fact was that the cost of the sale of one-third of Telstra, at 1.8 per cent, was significantly below the cost, on a comparable basis, of other international telco floats. On that basis, the Australian taxpayer has value. -  - To summarise, Mr Speaker, let me say again that the fees that were referred to by the honourable member for Melbourne and the reference to the audit report on that aspect did not take into account, as was the correct interpretation, that obligation on the underwriting of the second instalment. That is a simple fact. You can say what you wish: that is the way in which those fees were paid.</DOC>

 - Thank you, Mr Speaker. And I thank the member for Page who has already shown considerable interest on behalf of his constituents by bringing them to me to explain some of the problems involved in their areas. I similarly thank the member for Eden-Monaro.The government substantially and continuously has supported the Regional Forest Agreement process. The process is one of applying science to industry matters, to environmental matters and to social factors in all the areas of the forests of Australia.One of the other more fundamental aspects of this process is public participation, and that has been well publicised. That is proven by the fact that tens of thousands of submissions have been received during the RFA processes already concluded in Tasmania, partially concluded in Victoria, substantially progressed in Western Australia and in good shape in Queensland. In Western Australia alone, to this date some 30,000 public submissions have been made in the process. That proves that all parties get a chance to put their case.Of course, science is the major determinant. The Prime Minister, in his instructions to me, made it very clear that job losses are to be considered a significant factor in all determinations - and he has my total support in that.Upon appointment - and, as you are aware, sir, that is very recent - I went straight to the ministers in New South Wales because I had been advised by my department that in fact they were planning some action on reserves in that state where the RFA process is still very immature. I made contact with the Hon. Craig Knowles and asked him whether we could have immediate contact. In that conversation he advised me that the state government was close to making an announcement on the Eden region where no conclusive arrangements have been made. We agreed that  we should keep that low key to create the proper foundation for meetings between myself and the three relevant ministers in New South Wales.In a very uncharacteristic fashion, I put my head down and kept quiet because I wanted that environment. The reality is that I feel the forest debate should not be trivialised by these sorts of shots. That was the agreement, and tomorrow we were to have those meetings. Let me say that the meetings were substantially to deal with the upper north-east and the lower north-east forest regions, for which I was not advised there were going to be any imminent arrangements laid down. They are by far the most substantial areas of forestry activity in New South Wales.Mr Speaker, today the Premier of New South Wales has unilaterally acted and announced the state's decision to introduce legislation to add significantly to reserves in that area. There are very substantial difficulties that have not been included. - It is certainly a state right to declare a reserve, Mr Speaker, but you would think it would be a state responsibility to base that on scientific assessment and consultation with the people concerned. There has been no formal consultation. On this issue, the Labor Party in New South Wales are back to backroom deals and, of course, the old smoke-filled room. The general public is enraged; the grassroots trade unionists are enraged; the green elements are enraged. It is clearly an announcement based on politics and not on science.I will still go to the meetings tomorrow, Mr Speaker, because the Commonwealth remains committed to an appropriate RFA process relying on the science as it applies to industry needs, as it applies to social needs and as it applies to environmental needs.In the representations I have received to date, the major industry participants have told me that some substantial volumes of wood have been promised - and I will refer to them, at the risk of reading something. In the lower north-east, they are promising 140,000 cubic metres, which is down from 160,000 cubic  metres, but in fact for 20 years and thereafter no guarantees. In the upper north-east, they are promising 129,000 cubic metres of sawlogs, which is down from 140,000, but they are going to cut that to 80,000 in 20 years time. If 20 years is considered a long time in forestry, let me say that it is not.But the grave difficulty we have is the sustainability of the remaining areas. A major industry source has said they doubt they can keep their international reputation by getting the timber identified out of the areas allocated. That could have grave repercussions for Australia's total standing in the international community.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker -  - The subject of delays in the Family Court has received considerable airing recently. I am not in a position to verify the detail of the data that the shadow spokesman on legal affairs has provided in  respect of Newcastle but I can accept that the delays in the Newcastle registry are unacceptable. In the recent past, there have been two Family Court judges appointed to the Family Court registry in Newcastle. One of them, Justice Margaret Renaud, retired on 11 September. In consultation with the Chief Justice of the Family Court it was suggested to me that, from the point of view of the court, it would be better and more convenient and there would be greater flexibility in dealing with the burdens of the court in the different registries if, instead of appointing a second judge as a replacement for Justice Renaud to Newcastle, the judge was appointed to Sydney. That is proposed to be done and steps are being taken for an appropriate appointment.On the subject of delays in general, I think the subject deserves better attention than it has been getting from some of those involved in the system. What we need to look at is why Family Court cases are taking so long. Something like five per cent only of Family Court applications actually end up in a final hearing before a judge. They take time to reach there, and one of the reasons is that there is a series of interim applications made pending the final hearing. This is taking judge time. Another factor is that it now takes, for an average children's matter - and the issues concerned there are simply: what is the residence of a child, with which parent, and what contact will the other parent have? - an average 3.3 days in a final hearing before a judge. If you could knock one day off that, you would have 50 per cent more judge time available. I think the legal practitioners and the judges who are dealing with those cases need to have a look at that.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Deakin for his question and acknowledge the brilliant electoral victory that  he had on 3 October. As the member for Deakin indicates - as part of the new tax system which the government was elected by the Australian people to implement on 3 October - we are introducing, probably, the biggest overhaul of Commonwealth-state financial relations since Federation. As part of that process, the government will be introducing a broad based indirect tax or GST, the whole proceeds of which will go to the state governments. As a consequence of that, the rate of that particular broad based consumption tax can only be increased by unanimous agreement from six states, two territories, the Commonwealth government, the House of Representatives and the Senate. This is a protection against rising taxes which does not exist in relation to Labor's wholesale sales tax which does not require agreement from any of the states or territories. This will give the states a growth revenue, which means that their revenues will grow in proportion to the economy as the economy grows - something that has been sought by the states for a very long time.The Commonwealth has also indicated to the states that this is conditional upon the abolition of inefficient indirect taxes which are currently applied at the state level, such as: the bed tax, which will be abolished under this proposal; financial institutions duty, which will be abolished under this proposal; the bank accounts debits taxes, which will be abolished under this proposal; stamp duties, which will be abolished under this proposal. The opportunity will be created to make Australia a great financial centre by taking stamp duties off marketable securities and shares, that will be a great thing for this country. It will work in with the government's reforms to make Australia a strong economy and to create more jobs, as we saw in today's labour force figures. These were the best labour force figures since 1990. I think all members of the House, even on the Labor side, would be pleased to see the surge in employment that we saw over the last month.The Commonwealth will offer to the states a guarantee, over the transition period, that they will not be worse off. Down the track, states will have a growth revenue which will  give them increasing security in relation to delivering state services - hospital services, school services - funded from a growing tax base from a big reform which is a necessary reform for a new tax system for a new century from a new government with a mandate to introduce it from the Australian people.</DOC>

 - This is a question that has come from a man who sat for 13 years in a government that did precious little to clamp out tax avoidance practices. He is also the leader of an opposition that opposed the crackdown on the tax avoidance abuses under the syndication scheme. I take the opportunity of reminding the parliament of the measures that have been undertaken in the last 2½ years. There have been measures relating to abuses under R&amp;D, the trafficking in trust losses, and the franking, credit and dividend streaming arrangements.If my memory serves me correctly, didn't the Labor Party vote against the measures to stamp out tax avoidance in relation to syndi  cation? Didn't the Labor Party also vote against measures to ensure that high income earners in this country paid a greater contribution to removing their own budget deficit via a superannuation tax surcharge? Doesn't it pass very strange that this is the same group of people who voted to oppose measures to extract from high income earners in this country a contribution towards eliminating their own budget deficit?I can remember when the Treasurer's first budget was introduced in 1996 that one of the measures was the imposition of a surcharge on superannuation contributions. If I remember rightly that was widely seen in the community as being a fair measure. It was not a popular measure among high income earners: I can testify to that. The Treasurer can testify to that and so can anybody on this side of the House testify to that. It was a very unpopular measure but, very interestingly, the Labor Party moved heaven and earth to try to stop that measure being passed into law. It is therefore an act of great hypocrisy for the Leader of the Opposition to be up here asking me questions about tax avoidance.We have a tax plan that will create a fairer, more transparent Australian taxation system. We believe the measures contained in that, and the measures that have been introduced by the Treasurer over the last 2½ years, represent, in those 2½ years, a more vigorous assault on tax avoidance than we saw from the Labor Party in 13 years.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Groom for his question. Can I say to him, and can he say to the 20,000 people  in the electorate of Groom who currently have private health insurance, that the taxation plan of the coalition government is unambiguously good news for every last one of them. The government's 30 per cent rebate is good news for all Australians. It will make private health insurance more affordable and it will take pressure off the public hospital system. I am told that around 45,000 people in Groom will benefit directly from the government's 30 per cent tax rebate. If this rebate is passed into law by the parliament, it will put $10 million per annum directly into the pockets of the people of Groom.A very interesting thing about this debate on private health insurance is that it has spawned a new species of elite Australians - you could almost call them `Macklin's millionaires'. You hear people from the other side running around Australia saying that in some way our benefit is beneficial to high  income earners. I am advised that no fewer than 700,000 Australians earning less than $20,000 a year have private health insurance. This proposition that everybody who has got private health insurance is a millionaire is absolute nonsense.There are literally tens of thousands, indeed, hundreds of thousands of Australians, who scrimp and save to give themselves the security of private health insurance. They are entitled to a greater reward than the insult they receive from those who sit opposite. They are entitled to a greater incentive. I want to say to the low income earners of Australia and to the pensioners of Australia that we will help them keep their private health insurance. The enemies of private health insurance are the members of the Australian Labor Party. Those who want to deny the pensioners of  Australia and the low income earners of Australia the benefit of private health insurance are the members of the Australian Labor Party.Our measure is a fair measure. It is a measure which will help not only private health insurance but also the public hospital system. Those who sit opposite will remember, of course, a man by the name of Graham Richardson. Those who sit opposite will know that, whatever it takes, Graham had a few  things to say about private health insurance. I will give a mere sort of classy selection of some of the things that he had to say about private health insurance: `On Labor's side, of course, they simply do not want to acknowledge that private health care matters. There is an ideological bent here that says, 'Medicare is perfect,' which is ridiculous. 'Therefore, it cannot be changed,' which is also ridiculous. 'Therefore, nothing should be done about private health,' which is also ridiculous because the one thing they do not want to acknowledge is that private health insurance matters. What they do not want to acknowledge is that as these people are dropping out of private health insurance they are simply queuing up in the public health system to be looked after.'Now this is the same man who in 1990 said that, `If you allow the critical mass of about 40 per cent of people in private health insurance to be lost, then you run the risk of a threat to the entire system.' He tried to get the Keating government to embrace incentives for private health insurance, and he was rolled by the former Prime Minister. He is still candid enough to say on this issue, `If you really care long-term about private health insurance in Australia, you will make sure that the private health insurance system does not fall over.' That is why we have a rebate system. That is why we are going into bat for the low income earners of Australia. That is why those people ought to be reminded that the real enemies of the low income earners on this issue are the members of the Australian Labor Party.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. On the issue of the eight to 10 per cent increase, we have not factored in a number of that order because they are the figures that applied under the Labor Party. Of the increases that have happened over the last 10 years, nearly 40 per cent of those increases are due to specific changes the Labor Party made to make private health insurance less attractive, such as abolishing the bed-day subsidy and reducing the rebate for in-patient services from 85 per cent to 75 per cent.So the increases have been much higher than in previous years as to what they would have been had you left the status quo in place. This has put a much greater burden on those people who have private health insurance. A large proportion of them are low income earners. The other point I would make is that we are not doing this to hit some sort  of artificial level of people in private health insurance. This is a tax cut. We are making private health insurance tax deductable. That is what the public want, so that is what are going to give them. -  - Members on my left are denying the member for Wannon the call, and the member for Batman knows much better than he does.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Wannon for his question. The honourable member will no doubt be aware that last week the government released for the first time a public information notice put out by the International Monetary Fund with an assessment in relation to Australia's economy.The executive directors of the International Monetary Fund in that assessment commended the authorities in Australia for implementing sound macro-economic policies and structural reforms. The IMF said that they had built the foundation for Australia's impressive record of strong growth and low inflation. They noted that fiscal consolidation and inflation targeting framework had contributed to a fall in long-term interest rates.I say on behalf of this side of the House that we believe, for the sake of young home buyers and young families, low interest rates and lower mortgage charges are a great thing. They are giving young people a start in life which they could never get under the Beazley-Keating interest rates of 17 per cent, which they had in the 1980s. The IMF also said:Moreover, the adoption of the Charter of Budget Honesty, which sets a high standard for fiscal transparency and accountability, was welcomed by Directors.These are the big reforms in the Australian economy: filling in Beazley's $10.3 billion deficit, targeting inflation, getting interest rates down, introducing a charter of budget honesty, ensuring that we have world class financial regulation which, the IMF said in its report `would put Australia's prudential regime at the forefront of international practice'.I also report to the House that the International Monetary Fund warmly commended the Australian authorities for its proposals to change Australia's taxation system. The report said this:Directors strongly endorsed the proposed tax reform package. The introduction of a broad-based tax on goods and services would enhance efficiency, while protecting the revenue base from continued erosion.I say to the Socialist Left members of the ALP, those who really think about the provision of social services: you have an interest in ensuring that the revenue base does not erode. Those people who are serious about social services in this country are serious about tax reform. That is one of the reasons why this government is serious about tax reform. As the IMF noted:The accompanying reduction in effective marginal income tax rates would improve the incentives for saving and employment.Let me make it clear, let me make it stark. This side of the House believes that average income earners should pay no more than 30 per cent in income tax. This side of the House wants to reduce income taxes for middle income earners. The Labor side of the parliament thinks your average income earner should be paying 48½c on every dollar that they earn. Labor's great contribution to the tax debate in the course of the last campaign was to say that what Australia needed was a wholesale sales tax and a capital gains tax on pre-1985 assets. Their capital gains tax on pre-1985 assets lasted two weeks after the conclusion of the campaign. They went for 3½ years with no tax policy, they adopted one and they dumped it two weeks after the election. It did not even last for more than two weeks and now they say that what Australia needs is a wholesale sales tax - a whole sale sales tax like Ghana, the Solomon Islands and Swaziland. That is modern ALP thinking from a party which is caught in reaction.</DOC>

 - Nothing can alter the fact that 700,000 low income earners in this country have taken out -  -  - Order! The Prime Minister has the call. - Nothing can alter the fact - much and all as the Labor Party will rabbit on about millionaires and high income earners - that 700,000 people in this country who earn less than $20,000 a year have private health insurance. This is a debate about whether or not you believe in a dual health system in this country. It is perfectly obvious that the Labor Party believes in one system and one system alone - that is, the public health system. I happen to believe, and the members who sit behind me happen to  believe, in both systems. I think Australia has a remarkably good public health system and I think the people who work in the public health system in Australia deserve our admiration and our unstinting praise. -  - That health system will be put under an intolerable strain if more and more Australians drop out of private health insurance. We do not intend to allow that to happen and the only way you can stop it happening is by giving people a greater incentive to stay in it. That is why we have introduced a non-means tested incentive for Australians to stay in private health insurance. I tell those who sit opposite that, if you imagine your attack on private health insurance is going down well in the electorate, you are even more out of touch than I thought you were. - I remind the members for Dobell and Brisbane that I have given them a great deal of latitude.

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. The opposition have been making some comment - I am aware of this - and I will make several points about this. The first point is that, before the election, the only thing the opposition could say about private health insurance is, `We have no policy on this. We'll put it on the back-burner.' So something that is 30 per cent of the whole health care system was put on the back-burner. They did not have the intellectual capacity to put together a policy. They have dealt themselves out of the debate and they have no right to even comment. - The fact is that you can believe Graham Richardson: the Labor Party is a bit biased against private health insurance. You could not come up with a credible policy. You are utterly condemned by your ineptitude and you are utterly condemned by your ideology.The second point is that, if you allow the private health insurance system to slowly wither away, what you will lose is something that has been almost unique to Australia - that is, a system where the public has had choice. We have done this almost better than any other country in the world. If you allow this system to slowly wither away, you invariably end up with a tiny private health sector that is the preserve of the wealthy and the rich and a large public health sector. If you want to know what this looks like, just have a look at the UK. I have worked under the United Kingdom National Health Service. I have sat in a surgical ward at two o'clock in the morning and watched a professor of surgery  scream and argue for 45 minutes to get a 13-year-old girl a bed, and I have got to tell you that it is not particularly attractive.The third point I would make is that the notion of just throwing more money at the public hospital system is inherently flawed. During the 1996 election, the Leader of the Opposition on television complained that, because of the extra money the Commonwealth had put in the system, the states had just pulled their money out. They had done this for a couple of reasons: first, the extra money that had been put in was at the expense of the financial assistance grants - the so-called Medicare guarantee, where they gave with one hand and took with the other; and, second, they could not guarantee that the states would put in an extra effort so, when the Commonwealth put in money, the states took out money and the net effect was no better off.Up until July this year, I was dealing with the agreement signed by Paul Keating and Kim Beazley in 1993 and all its inherent weaknesses. This government has signed a new agreement that will increase public hospital funding in real terms by 19.2 per cent  over five years, an unprecedented level of additional funding. We have done this at the same time as we have tried to actually do something to help the root cause of the problem, not just treat the symptoms.On the issue of just putting extra money into the public hospitals, I would like to read from the 1991 report Hospital services in Australia under the national health strategy chaired by one J. Macklin. On page 160, the report said:Expansion of funding to public hospitals would need to consider the potential effects on productivity and waiting lists, not only whether they need extra beds to be opened. The analysis of the relationship between waiting lists and patient throughput in Part 1 - of this report - suggests an increase in hospital utilisation doesn't necessarily lead to a reduction in waiting lists or waiting times.She went on:Increased funding to public hospitals is also likely to lead to change in equilibrium between public hospitals, private hospitals and private health insurance without necessarily achieving the level of impact intended. If increased funding to public hospitals reduces the perceived pressure on public hospitals . . . it is likely private health insurance will drop. This could result in increased demand for public hospitals and reduced revenue from private patients. The result may be a return to the situation that existed prior to the provision of extra resources.She knew it then but ideology prevents the Labor Party from realising it now.</DOC>

 - I am aware that various material is being put out. Some of it is accurate and some of it is not. The point that seems to be made by some of these lessors is that, because the price of vehicles will fall under the new tax system, they have to put the leases up. I would have thought it was an advantage to have the cost of vehicles falling. I would have thought it was an advantage to have cheaper vehicles. But if you happen to be in the Australian Labor Party, sniff around until you find a price fall and say how bad it is. Normally you are sniffing around looking for a price rise. Here are people who cannot maintain a policy position for 60 seconds.What did the member for Werriwa, inconveniently absent today, say? `People know what Labor is against; they don't know what Labor is for.' The member for Werriwa is engaged in an interesting experiment in this parliament. Is it possible to be in the Labor  Party and be a thinker? We know it is not possible to be in the Labor Party, be a thinker and be on the front bench. He is now engaged in an interesting experiment - can you maintain a position on the back bench and be a thinker in the Labor Party? - The Treasurer will return to the question. - In relation to the charities, under the government's tax policy charities are GST free. What that means for charities is that tax liabilities fall. Prices fall. For charities, they get back all of the taxes and all embedded taxes in relation to the inputs. If they are GST free, their costs actually fall. Charities actually do better.The argument which is occurring at the moment is in relation to charities which run commercial operations. Where commercial operations are competing with the private sector, we have said that the GST free status extends to non-commercial activity - that is, charitable activity - and not to commercial activity because, by definition, a charity is actually selling a service at a commercial rate  in competition with the private sector. But, in relation to charities overall and their non-commercial activities, the prices actually fall. Not only do they get back all of the taxes on their inputs, they get second round effects of all of the embedded wholesale sales taxes which go into inputs which they currently cannot claim back. In relation to charities, the treatment under this tax package puts them in a better position than the current wholesale sales tax even in relation to their tax exemptions. That is why it is a good policy, and that is why it is good for Australia.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Makin for her question. We do have reports in this morning's papers, particularly in Adelaide, about the concerns of the South Australian government about job losses if the government is unable to secure the passage of our legislation which is aimed at protecting the jobs of young people. The South Australian government is concerned; it has reason to be. The South Australian chamber and retail traders association have estimated that up to 20,000 jobs of young people alone will be lost in South Australia if we are unable to achieve the legislation which we will be introducing this week. That is consistent with the views of the Australian Retailers Association based on a survey of their own members. They believe that up to 60,000 jobs would be lost virtually overnight and, over a period of time, in the order of 200,000 young people would be out of work as a result of a failure to pass this particular legislation. The question asks about other state governments. The position of the New South Wales government is also very relevant on this issue. We now have a copy of the New South Wales  Labor government submission to the Industrial Relations Commission. It states:New South Wales has no immediate plans to abolish junior rates . . . There has been little substantive development of competency based or other alternatives to junior rates that we are aware of in the federal industrial jurisdiction. This has also been the position in the New South Wales jurisdiction.In other words, there is no reasonable alternative proposition being put within New South Wales. It goes on to say that it has assured New South Wales employers:. . . that the protection afforded age-based junior rates in New South Wales will not be removed until the industrial parties and relevant industrial tribunals have had a realistic opportunity to develop an adequate alternative to age-based rates.That is very important, because the previous Labor government spent 10 years attempting to formulate an alternative and was never able to do so. The whole issue is summed up very well by the Canberra Times , which said:In a system such as Australia which sets wage rates for adults in a range of industries and skill levels, it is inevitable that employers will avoid employing  young people if they have to pay the same wages for them as adults. And the irony will be that a law which is there to prevent discrimination on the basis of age will have exactly the opposite effect. Sure, on paper youth will be treated equally, but on the ground the effect will be they will not get a job at all. Paper equality is not of much value.There has been far too much ideology from the Labor Party on this issue. They are opposing for the sake of opposition, with little regard to the job prospects of young people. That is why this government is determined to press ahead and protect the jobs of literally hundreds of thousands of young people.</DOC>

 - I have not seen the detail of the announcement made by the Commonwealth Bank. Let me make it plain: I assume the member for Hotham is not suggesting that interest rates have not come down a lot over the last 2½ years. I would have thought of all the movements in economic indicators that have occurred over the last three years the one that the Labor Party would least want to refer to was that of the cost of borrowing money because there is no area in the Australian economy where the aggregate benefits of the coalition's economic management have been more apparent than in the cost of finance. Why does the member for Hotham not believe that the Australian economy is now charging ahead at a level of growth that not even the most supreme optimist believed was possible about six months ago? One of the reasons that is happening is that we have very low interest rates.One of the reasons that is happening is that the cost of borrowing money, taking everything into account, is dramatically lower than what it was 2½ years ago. The average home buyer is more than $300 a month better off. The average Australian farmer is dramatically better off as a result. -  - Is there a point of order? - No, I did not think there was either. - I was making the point that no-one can argue that over the last 2½ years there has not been a dramatic reduction in the cost of borrowing money in this country. One of the greatest economic gifts that the government has brought to the Australian people is the gift of lower interest rates. We have been able to reduce interest rates for home buyers, for farmers, and for small businessmen. This is one of the reasons why Australia is the economic strongman of Asia.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question, and I recognise his interest in the situation in Malaysia. I think many other members of the House are also very concerned, in particular, about the arrest and charging of Anwar Ibrahim, the former Deputy Prime Minister. The government has been clear and forthright in its expression of concern over the treatment of Anwar Ibrahim and was indeed very forthright about that matter during the visit of both the Prime Minister and me to Malaysia as part of the APEC meetings.The Prime Minister raised the matter directly with Dr Mahathir, the Prime Minister of Malaysia, in Kuala Lumpur. I had the oppor  tunity to raise the issue and discuss it frankly with Education Minister Najib, and with a range of other Malaysians at the MalaysiaAustralia Dialogue preceding the APEC meetings. I also met with Anwar's wife, Wan Azizah, to discuss her concerns about her husband's welfare and, importantly, to convey my personal concerns and those of the Australian government to her husband directly. That has been the Australian government's measured and sensible approach to this difficult issue. I think the measured way, as the Prime Minister puts it, the Australian way, in which this was handled by the government was well recognised by the Australian community.The honourable member asked whether there were alternative approaches, and there were alternative approaches proffered to the Australian government, in particular, by the Leader of the Opposition. His starting point was that the Prime Minister should not meet Dr Mahathir at all. Then having realised he had made a mistake, he started to shift ground. One of the themes of the Labor Party's approach to foreign policy is of shifting ground. I have never seen a political party shift ground so quickly day by day as has the Australian Labor Party over the last week.The Leader of the Opposition was saying that Australia should be concerned about Anwar Ibrahim, but we should not mention it to Dr Mahathir, that we should boycott any meeting with Dr Mahathir - the international equivalent of a `no speakies' relationship. This government does not operate on the basis of a foreign policy by boycott approach, which is beginning to characterise Labor's approach. We like to be forthright, we like to be frank, and we like to express our concerns. Perhaps Labor has suddenly decided to opt for what is sometimes called the megaphone policy approach.The Leader of the Opposition often says that the former foreign minister, the now member for Holt, was the greatest foreign minister Australia had ever had. You often hear him say that. We do not agree with that, do we? - No, that is right. We are just encouraging you a bit there. He says that the member for Holt was the greatest foreign minister Australia has ever had. He also says that there should be a parliamentary inquiry to establish whether the member for Holt was involved in a cover-up over affairs relating to the Dili massacre and subsequent events. Where is the Labor Party? An inquiry into the former Labor foreign minister's activities but he was the best foreign minister Australia has ever had. In conclusion let me say it points to a simple direction for the Labor Party - the direction of populism. There is no coherent foreign policy in the Labor Party and, to be fair - and I always am fair to the Labor Party -  - Yes, I am. Prime Minister, I am always fair to them. To be fair to the Labor Party, there was a coherence to Labor's foreign policy in government. There is a populist incoherence to their foreign policy in opposition. It is a matter of embarrassment for this country that its main opposition party is  just a cheapskate populist party on important foreign policy issues.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for La Trobe for his question. I acknowledge his long lasting interest in quality education for young Australians. In this country we give praise and recognition frequently to our high achieving sportspeople, people such as Cathy Freeman or Kieren Perkins. We praise our business leaders, but we too often overlook those who are responsible, perhaps more than any others, for moulding the minds of the next generation of leaders, and those are teachers.The awards that are being given today in the Great Hall of the parliament, the Australian Awards for University Teaching, recognise the enormous contribution that quality teaching makes to the next generation of young Australians. This is a very significant government initiative. It is a major item on the university higher education calendar each year. It recognises the tremendous role that quality teachers who care for their students have in producing the future leaders of this country. The 12 awards that will be presented tonight total some $765,000 in value. The highlight of the night will be the Prime Minister's award for the University Teacher of the Year, an award valued at $75,000.These awards have been embraced by the higher education sector. They recognise that this government is serious about providing a quality education to all young Australians. I have no doubt whatever that the recognition that university teachers get from these awards will promote quality, encourage talent to enter the teaching profession and encourage excellence.</DOC>

 - There are some misconceptions that need to be clarified in relation to the decision of the Australian Competition Tribunal last week. The first point is that this is essentially an agreement within the private sector. It is an agreement between the publishers and the newsagents. An authorisation has been in place for some years in relation to the distribution of newspapers through newsagents. The first point to note is that there will be no change whatsoever in the distribution of newspapers by newsagents. In fact, the Australian Competition Tribunal upheld the current authorisation in relation to the distribution by home delivery of newspapers in Victoria, New South Wales, the ACT and Queensland. There is no change in relation to the home service delivery in Western Australia, South Australia and Tasmania.The second point is that the decisions of the Australian Competition Tribunal in relation to the subagency arrangement and the distribution to look-alikes are under review. We will conduct consultation in the way that the Prime Minister outlined prior to the election. We are committed to a consultation process. I am beginning those consultations later today and I will keep the House informed of progress.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Parramatta for his question. I recognise the great interest he shows in the Middle East in general and in Lebanon in particular. We obviously welcome the positive response that there has been in the international community to the Middle East peace process and to the Wye River agreement. We would like to see as time goes on the Wye River agreement being an important stepping stone towards what we hope will eventually be a comprehensive peace settlement for the Middle East.In the case of Lebanon, the honourable member will be aware that the Lebanese government and the Lebanese people have sought for a long time the fulfilment of United Nations Security Council Resolution 425. They can aspire to seeing UN Resolution 425 implemented in the context of an overall Middle East peace settlement. The important thing is that the Wye River agreement has given the Middle East peace process renewed momentum when momentum was lost. We very warmly welcome that.It gives me the opportunity to say that the agreement has now been ratified by the Palestinian Legislative Council and the Israeli Knesset. That is good news. There are going to be difficulties in the implementation, but, as I said, the implementation of Wye River is a part of the overall implementation of the Middle East peace process. We look forward to its eventual conclusion.</DOC>

 - I have seen the media reports to which the member for Denison refers. Like any report which raises the spectre of corruption within a law enforcement agency, they are of concern. However, it needs to be borne in mind that some of the matters referred to are as consistent with inadequate record keeping as they are with corruption. The reports, I am advised, go back to 1993. The member for Denison might recall that, between 1993 and 1996, he was the Minister for Justice.As the member for Denison mentioned, the subject of the media reports are in fact audit reports - but they are not just audit reports; they are internal AFP audit reports. I am also advised that, in 1996 and 1997, internal guidelines were amended as a result of those reports. In preparing for the tough on drugs initiative, the government examined the procedures for the handling and destruction of drugs seized by the AFP and by other law enforcement agencies. As a result of that review, legislation is in the process of being drafted to amend those procedures. So it is clear that there has been a recognition of the deficiencies both within the AFP and externally by the government. In addition, the  Minister for Justice and Customs has sought a full briefing on the matters that are the subject of the report.</DOC>

 - May I thank the honourable member for his interest in the Olympics given that his electorate is in Sydney, which is going to be the town that hosts the Olympics in the year 2000. - Let us not say that it is New South Wales's Games; let us make it Australia's Games. We are looking at the Olympics as being perceived throughout the world as the Olympics down under. We  look forward to television images going around the world of Australia as a beautiful, tolerant and sporting nation.The federal government is contributing $460 million and is involving 30 different agencies such as Customs, the Australian Mint in the production of a coin program, the weather forecasting for the yachting program, Immigration and our own security forces in the defence forces. At the same time, we are using the Games to promote Australia and Australian tourism, which is of immense importance to me. We are seeing 1.6 million extra tourists coming to Australia because of the Olympic Games. It is an opportunity to showcase our nation to the world and to benefit from that in a financial fashion.Last year the Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister for Trade and sports minister at the time, Warwick Smith, launched the `Australia - Open for Business' initiative, principally using the Games to boost exports and inward investment. We are a partner with Telstra, Westpac and the New South Wales Department of State and Regional Development in order to capitalise on the investment opportunities coming from the Olympics. We are looking at spreading all of the benefits available from the Games right across Australia so that all states and all parts of Australia benefit from the games that will be held in Sydney but that will be remembered as `Australia's Games'.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Eden-Monaro for his question. I am aware that just last week he helped launch the construction of a new building for Campbell Page Employment and Training, a Job Network member in Bateman's Bay and part of Mission Employment. Last week, a gentleman called Mark Jull, who is a senior official of the Commonwealth Public Service Union, made a number of ill-informed comments about the Job Network. He said that it was a disaster for unemployed people. He said that people in the Job Network have just not had the ability to find people and place people in work.In succumbing to the tendency to see all change as change for the worse, Mr Jull is consciously or unconsciously attacking a large number of community and charitable organisations, such as the Salvation Army, Mission Australia, Centrecare, the Brotherhood of St Laurence and many other agencies which are helping the Job Network to already produce far better results than the old CES ever could. In October 1997, the old CES had just 36,000 new job vacancies notified. In October this year, the new Job Network had 54,000 new job vacancies notified. In October last year, the old CES succeeded in getting just 17,000 unemployed people on benefit into work. In October this year, the Job Network succeeded in getting nearly 22,000 unemployed people on benefit into work. By the tests that really  count, the new Job Network is already succeeding.Under the Job Network, 68 per cent of vacancies notified were for permanent jobs compared with just 60 per cent for the same period last year under the CES. In October 1998, the proportion of job seekers placed in jobs who were long-term unemployed was 43 per cent under the Job Network compared with just 37 per cent in October last year under the CES. So there has been a reversion to cloth cap cliches among sections of the Labor movement. However, I am pleased to see that the member for Werriwa said last week:It's often the combination and mix of public and private sector action, because it's neither government nor market. It's in the community - it's in the  strength of civil society - that many of the answers to economic and social problems can be found.This is actually quite a good description of the Job Network rather than the Third Way, of which the member for Werriwa is so enamoured. But it is the beginning of enlightenment from the member for Werriwa. I commend him for that rather than the kind of strike first, think later mentality that is coming from the dinosaurs in the CPSU.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for New England for his question. As the honourable member will be aware, this government is engaged in the most comprehensive reform ever of the Australian taxation system. The reform of the Australian taxation system involves not just the indirect tax system, which we propose to modernise and bring into comparison with other international jurisdictions, but also lower income taxes for average families. That is something that the Liberal and National parties stand for - lower income taxes for average income families, with a 30 per cent tax rate for everybody earning up to $50,000. After the government presents its legislation, on which it has a mandate, to implement those changes, the government proposes to move on in relation to reforming Australia's business taxation system.The first paper that was released today by the group that is doing the review of business taxation has received widespread support. The group is chaired by Mr John Ralph. It also has on it Bob Joss from Westpac and Rick Allert. The Australian Chamber of Commerce today said:The review of business taxation discussion paper `A Strong Foundation' is well named.The Business Coalition for Tax Reform said:The review's stated objectives of economic growth, equity and greater simplicity would find widespread support in the business community.The CPA has put out a press release today entitled `Light in the tunnel for small business in business tax review', and that is great news for small business. The National Farmers Federation said that the review was welcome and that:Such a system would replace the current ad hoc conglomeration of legislation and rulings.As part of this government's proposals to make Australia a great business centre and to create economic growth and jobs, we believe it is important to reform the taxation system. One of the things that we can do to reform the taxation system is get rid of Labor's taxes on all bank transactions. The Labor Party wants to tax people every time they put money into a bank account; it is called the bank account debits tax. The Labor Party wants to tax people every time they take money out of a bank account, under the financial institutions duty. I would not stand here and front for banks; but the Labor Party will complain about banks having fees on transactions, yet it taxes every single transaction in and out of a bank account. Why would the Labor Party want to tax people for putting money into a bank account and taking it out again? Why do you want to do that? Why won't you stand with us and abolish taxes on deposits and withdrawals? Why not be part of bringing Australia into the modern business taxation system?We have a situation now in Australia where the Australian Stock Exchange is the second highest capitalised stock exchange in the Asia-Pacific region. We have overtaken Hong Kong. We have overtaken Singapore. We run second to Tokyo. By removing financial taxes, we can make Australia a great centre for financial institutions, a great centre for business and a great centre for jobs. Wouldn't that be a great thing?Why will the Labor Party not stand with us? Why is it wedded to taxing bank transactions? When this government puts in place its great tax reforms - indirect tax, personal income tax, business tax - we will be building Australia for the next century.</DOC>

 - No, we are planning to abolish all of Labor's taxes on taking money out of bank accounts. The Australian Labor Party taxes people under a bank account debit tax every time they take money out of bank accounts. This is the side of politics that proposes to abolish it, and Labor says no. This is the side of politics that proposes to abolish the financial institutions duty. He always rises when the news is bad. - The question was whether they would be taxed for taking money out of bank accounts, and the answer  is no. This is the side of politics which is going to abolish Labor's tax on removing money from bank accounts. Isn't that great news? That is great news. - After informing the House of that good news, let me make the case as it is also said in the government's tax policy. In relation to financial services, there will be no GST on financial services - they are input taxed.Yesterday the shadow Treasurer said that banks would be getting a windfall - that is, having lower costs under a GST. That is what the shadow Treasurer said yesterday. He said banks would get reduced costs. That is what he said here in the parliament yesterday. He might recall that after saying that he said bank fees were going up and wasn't it a terrible thing because bank fees were going up but bank costs were coming down.Today in a doorstop the Leader of the Opposition said that bank fees were going up and that was because bank costs were going up. But the shadow Treasurer said bank fees were going up and costs were coming down. - The answer was that financial services -  - I state it again: under the government's tax package, financial services are input taxed - that is, there are no taxes on their outputs but there are taxes on their inputs. - The member for Parramatta will resume his seat. Let me deal with the point of order raised by the Leader of the Opposition. It is my intention to ensure that the opposition has an opportunity to ask questions and that ministers can respond to them. My observation of what has absurdly grown out of this question is that the Treasurer scarcely opened his mouth before a point of order was raised. For that reason, I intended to allow the Treasurer to answer the question before intervening. That was my response to the desire from the member for Hotham to interrupt what the Treasurer was saying. I now call the member for Parramatta. - I say for the third or fourth time that the treatment under the tax package is well known, I believe. In relation to financial services, they are input taxed - that is, they pay taxes on their inputs and there is no liability on their outputs. - I will say this for the fifth time for the Australian Labor Party. We did not think you would get upset so quickly, Simon. We thought you would show more good humour than you are showing. - Financial services will be input taxed and there will be no taxes on outputs. The shadow Treasurer yesterday said that would result in bank costs falling by $1.6 billion, I think he said; but then he was countermanded by his leader today, who asserted they would go up by $800 million. So this morning they are going up by $800 million; yesterday they were coming down by $1.6 billion. It is a bad old day when the Leader of the Opposition is shown up by the member for Hotham.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. We are now seeing very real, lasting and quality reform on the Australian waterfront and that reform is in the national interest. When it comes to electorates like the one the honourable member repre  sents - that is, export oriented electorates - the fact is that efficient ports and waterfronts are just like efficient tax systems. If they help exports, they help facilitate the creation of jobs. Therefore, no-one can deny that waterfront reform is very much in the national interest.We have seen some truly remarkable and admirable figures in recent times - for example, those provided by Patrick chief Chris Corrigan for East Swanson Dock in Melbourne. With a cut in its work force of 50 per cent, Patrick's is moving 20 per cent more containers than last year: work force down 50 per cent, movement of containers up 20 per cent. The average crane rate is now 26 containers lifted per hour, in excess of the national average put down in the guidelines by the previous minister who had responsibility in this area. It is very interesting to note that Mr Coombs, quoted in the Drury report, said at the time that the benchmark of 25 set by the government could never - I repeat, never - be achieved in a country the size of Australia. -  - In fact, not only has that been exceeded, rates of up to 35 container movements per hour have now been achieved in Melbourne, a truly remarkable result. - Those opposite plainly want to justify such things as the 150-minute truck turnaround times that we recently saw in Sydney when the MUA wanted to hold things up a bit, contrasted with the 20-minute truck turnaround times - as fast as anywhere in the world - we are now seeing at Swanson. All of this moved Alan Kohler of the Australian Financial Review  to say:It is hard to overstate the significance of the revolution that has occurred following the `loss' by Patrick Stevedores in the Federal and High Courts this year. Other Australian businesses must wish they could lose like that. These results are plainly a vindication of the government's stance on waterfront reform, not to mention the courage and determination of Minister Reith. At the same time as they are a vindication of what we have pursued, they are an indictment of Labor's opposition to reform and to achieve more jobs as a result of an improved export performance. -  - You opposed us all the way and you plainly still want -  -  - He plainly wants to continue to side with those who want to hold back job opportunities for Australians. We have to act now to lock in the gains and to ensure that they are achieved at every container port in Australia and by companies other than Patrick. The government is backing this reform program with a $250 million package for redundancies administered through the Maritime Industry Finance Company. Any stevedore wanting to access these funds must have submitted its reform plans to the government by 31 December. We will not be backing off the pace of reform. The challenge for employers and unions alike is to match or better Patrick's levels of performance.</DOC>

 - The first point is that I have learnt in my life to never take the word of the member of the Hotham on anything, whether it be what Senator Kemp said yesterday or otherwise. - I think there must have been instructions in the Labor Party caucus to the Labor front bench to lift their game. `Rev it up a bit today,' your leader said, `do better, you had a bad day yesterday.' I repeat again what I said that financial services are input taxed. - I come to page 96 which makes it quite clear that where banks are delivering other services like investment  advice, where they charge a fee for those services - as the policy makes clear - then the tax applies to the delivery of that service like it would from a normal investment adviser or like it would in relation to insurance or other non-financial services which are delivered by banks in competition with other areas where the GST applies. In regard to tax policies that are falling apart in hands, the Labor Party had two policies before the election. - I again say that the financial services will not be taxed in any respect whatsoever. I make it clear that they are input taxed. I say it for the sixth time. As for tax policies that fall apart in hands, before the election the Labor Party had two: one was to put a capital gains tax on everything you owned before 1985, and the other was to increase the tariff on the four-wheel drive. We know one of those policies has fallen apart. Where is the second?</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Longman. The latest Yellow Pages Small Business Index is out today. It covers August, September and October. The House will be pleased to hear that there are some good results in this latest survey. There has been a lift in small business confidence over the past three months. Perceptions of the economy are very positive. Sales growth strengthened for the second successive quarter. Job growth was the strongest for two years. Sixty per cent expect an increase in profits over the next 12  months, 62 per cent expect an increase in sales over the next 12 months and 24 per cent expect an increase in the work force over the next 12 months. They are positive figures. They are a testament to the good management of the Australian economy, and the excellent leadership provided by the Prime Minister.It is also no surprise that the small business community want tax reform. They want tax reform, including a GST, and they want us to keep it simple so that it is easy to administer. That is exactly what this government is doing. We are determined to see a modern, good tax system for the small business community.Let me conclude on this note that, whilst the figures are good, as the minister responsible for small business I am also aware that there are small businesses out there today - even today - who still have on them the scars of Labor's recession, Labor's high interest rates of 22 per cent, and the legacy of the $10.5 billion deficit that we inherited back in 1996. But I say to those small businesses: these figures ought to give you some encouragement; on top of that, this government supports what you are doing; and, furthermore, as a government we are going to continue the process of reform because small business is so important and can create so many more jobs in the future.Small business have done a good job creating jobs in the last couple of years, in the time that we have been in, and we intend to go further. That is why we want to change the unfair dismissal law to give small business encouragement. That is why we want small business to continue to employ young people. That is why tomorrow we will introduce legislation to preserve the jobs of young people, particularly young people in small business. This survey does report that many small business proprietors - more than 60 per cent - were pleased with the election of the coalition government, with the main reasons being: they have better policies; we need a GST; we need tax reform; they are better economic managers; and, lastly, we dislike the Labor Party.</DOC>

 - The reason why I laughed at the question asked by the member for Hotham was his use of the word `inaction'. I happen to have in my hand a press statement that was issued by the then Treasurer and member for Gellibrand, Mr Ralph Willis. Its title is dramatic. It says, `Labor to monitor fees and charges on retail transaction accounts'. It begins:A Labor Government will write to the Chairperson of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) requesting the Commission to formally monitor fees and charges on bank retail transaction accounts.What is the date of this press release? It is 26 February 1996. What was the date of the election in 1996? As we all remember with pleasure, it was 2 March 1996. In other words, you had 13 years to do something about this and this is another thing you were going to do in the 14th year.It gets even better. My research has also turned up an extract from the weekly Senate Hansard of 31 March 1995. The then Senator Kernot, now the member for Dickson, addressed a question to the minister representing the Treasurer. The thrust of that question was a complaint about the failure of the then  Labor government to do anything about what she regarded as `unacceptable practices' within the banking sector.If members of the Labor Party were really serious about reducing the cost of bank transactions for the average Australian battler, they would support the removal of $2½ billion of bank charges on Australian consumers which now exist via the financial institutions duty and the bank account debits tax. Every day they oppose the removal of those duties they are imposing a further impost on the battlers of Australia.They have no credibility on this issue. They did nothing about it in government and by their refusal to support our tax reform package from opposition they are condemning the Australian consumer to an additional $2½ billion every year on their normal bank transactions.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. There have certainly been some curious comments made, particularly by the member for Jagajaga, about the government's proposed private health insurance rebate. She has made comments such as, `The rebate subsidy is a simple subsidy to private health insurance funds,' `High income people are going to get the best out of it,' or `Labor supported and continued to support targeted private health insurance that currently exists.' Let me take these one by one.Firstly, giving subsidies to the private health insurance funds is just simply wrong. This is a subsidy to individuals who take out private health insurance. It will be paid through the tax system. It will be a rebate that will go to low income people as well. It will also be able to be paid as a direct and transparent reduction in an individual's premium.  So, far from being a subsidy to private health insurance funds, it is a subsidy to individuals. -  - I am glad you learnt something, Kim. You obviously know nothing else about health. The second point I want to make is about the member for Jagajaga's comment that Labor supported and continued to support the targeted private health insurance rebate that currently exists. This is in spite of the Labor Party calling the rebate a `dud', a `waste of money' and an `abject failure'. I would love to see what Labor would call it if it were actually opposed to it. The fact is that Graham Richardson was absolutely right about this: Labor does not like private health insurance and it is taking an ideological and illogical opposition to it.The third point I would like to comment on is the issue that high income earners are the ones who will benefit most from this. This morning on radio the shadow minister for health actually told us who she thought high income earners were: they were people earning over $70,000 a year. I will make several points on that. -  - Read the transcript and you will find out what your own shadow minister said. The first point is that they would be people who are earning less than two times average weekly earnings. Average weekly earnings for a dual income family are $74,500. So the shadow minister's idea of a high income earner is a dual income family on average weekly earnings.The second point I would make is that, between 1986 and 1995, if you look at those who have dropped out of private health insurance and you take it by income quintiles, lower income earners have actually remained quite stable in their coverage of private health insurance. It is the top three quintiles that have actually dropped their private health insurance far more than anybody else.The third point I would make about high income earners is the precedent. It is rapidly becoming a state aid debate for the 1990s. Labor are very happy for a millionaire's son or daughter to attend a poor Catholic school  and get exactly the same subsidy as everyone else but they are not happy for that to apply to private health insurance. Labor are happy for the medical expenses rebate to apply to someone on a high income and take a 20 per cent rebate for expenses over $1,500, regardless of income. This rebate is used by higher income people. I might make the point, because the Leader of the Opposition is talking to himself again, that when we tried to make this rebate fairer Labor opposed it in the House of Representatives and the Senate.The final point I would make is who could forget Labor's gift to the millionaire business people of Australia, and that was open-ended, non-means tested deduction of personal superannuation contributions. Millionaires in Australia were squirreling away tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars of taxpayers' assisted funds, given to them by Paul Keating and Kim Beazley. When we tried to make that fairer in the 1996 budget, the Labor Party attempted to block it.What the Labor Party are saying and what they have to come to grips with is this: they are effectively saying that if you are a high income earner you can privatise your health risk. If you are a high income earner, it is fine to self-insure. It is fine to get a 20 per cent rebate through the tax system and there is no incentive for you to get out there and do the right thing and actually contribute to a community rated process. That is not just the politics of envy. It is not just illogical and ideological, as Graham Richardson said. It is just plain stupid.</DOC>

 - Unlike the opposition, we have actually worked out what is a Commonwealth responsibility and what is a state responsibility. -  - I have to say I get no pleasure whatsoever in abolishing the Commonwealth dental scheme. If we had not been left a $10 billion deficit by an incompetent finance minister, maybe we could have kept it. -  - It is just the Leader of the Opposition talking to himself again, Mr Speaker. - The simple point about our assistance to ancillary cover is that extras are a risk-graded product. They help all Australians. They help low income earners and high income earners. They relate to the private sector. They are our direct responsibility. Unlike you who did nothing about it, we are doing something about it.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Moore for his question and for his interest in the integrity of the immigration program. I would like to take the opportunity today to inform the House of some changes I am intending to make in relation to the migration regulations dealing with what has been known as the special need relative provisions. From 1 December the regulations will prescribe a new category of carer. There are reasons for this and I want to inform the House of those reasons. - The regulations have been made. They are to come into effect and I am giving the House information about the changes that have been given effect to. I think it is important information to assist honourable members. I know that there is considerable interest in the integrity of the immigration program. In relation to the special need relative provisions, which were intended to  operate to assist those people who wanted a relative in Australia on a continuing basis of permanent and long-term need where there were no services available to assist them in Australia, I thought honourable members would be interested to know the extensions that have been given by the courts to the way in which those particular provisions would be interpreted.We saw in one case before the Federal Court of Australia involving the Fuduche family that it was decided that a serious circumstance can cover any compassionate situation such as homesickness. In the Federal Court case of Chan, it was found that working aged parents could be considered to be a special need relative of their Australian child. We have had the Immigration Review Tribunal giving wider ambit to it. We have seen that in the way in which it has now decided to look at assessing the quality of a relationship between Australian relatives and their children. We have a situation in which a man's special bond with his sister was seen as a basis upon which this particular category would be used, even though there were outreach services available to the family. - The only other example I want to give of the way tribunals have dealt with this matter is that they have now looked at people's need for child care as a factor for special need relatives. Members would know  that this is a capped category and the widening demand for general family reunion, for which it is being used, has meant that those people who have a genuine and really special need on the basis of serious illness or some psychological requirement are being denied an opportunity to be able to access Australia. It is for this reason that I have made these changes which are very important changes to ensure that the new carer provisions require people to demonstrate objectively before Australian health services officials that they have a requirement. It will be a requirement that will be judged against the impairment tables that are used for other purposes. It will be an objective test that can be clearly used and it will clearly prevent this, I have to say, exaggerated special need category, which the courts developed and which has destroyed the integrity of an important part of our immigration program.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Calare for the question. I am aware that there is from time to time debate about the adequacy of parliamentary remuneration. There is also debate from time to time about the believed generosity of the parliamentary superannuation scheme. I have been asked this question on a number of occasions in the past. If the parliamentary superannuation scheme in isolation is compared with some other schemes in the community, it is more generous. It is also fair to say that the contributions made by members of parliament are on average higher contributions than those made in the corporate sector and higher contributions than those made in the general community.It is also fair to say that, by community standards, we in this place are highly paid whether we are ministers, opposition leaders  or members of parliament. If you look at average community wages, we are highly paid. Some of us - I think most of us - work very hard for our money, and that applies to members on both sides of the parliament. If you compare the responsibilities of a senior minister - say, the federal Treasurer - with those of a chief executive of a bank, it would have to be said that the federal Treasurer is, relatively speaking, very under-remunerated - that would apply to the present federal Treasurer and it certainly would have applied to most of his predecessors.This is a serious question. It is terribly easy to joke about it. I know that the member for Calare has asked the question in a very serious fashion. I am trying to give it the respect that it deserves because it does raise a great deal of public interest. We have to accept in this place that you will never have, in the eyes of members of parliament compared with those people whom they believe have equivalent levels of responsibility in the private sector, a sort of comparative wage justice. I do not think that is ever going to happen. All of us know that when we come into it.Most people come into parliament for reasons unrelated to financial reward. Most people come into parliament because they have a genuine commitment to serve their community and a genuine commitment to live out the ideals of their political party. There is also the case of the honourable member for Calare, whom I congratulate for the second time at having been elected to this place as what I call a genuine Independent; that is, a person who stood as an Independent, not a person who stood under the banner of a political party and then became an Independent after he or she was elected.I never close my mind to reviews of superannuation, be it parliamentary or otherwise. The idea of having a common date is one of the changes that people have pressed from time to time upon the government. I do not rule out the possibility of that being looked at. If you were going to do that, you would have to consider whether it would relate to people who in the future become members or whether it would relate to people who are currently  members. There is an argument that if you make changes like that you make them on an entirely prospective basis.I do not think there is any answer that I as Prime Minister or anybody in this parliament can give to a question like that which will properly satisfy the feeling in the community that, in some areas, we are entitled to privileges that other sections of the community are not. We do have privileges that other people do not have. From time to time, when they are abused we are all ashamed and we all feel very sorry.The question of whether somebody who has been convicted of a criminal offence should lose their entitlement to superannuation is something that ought to be examined if there is any review. That is a fair question. But, in examining it, we ought to look at what happens in other sections of the community so that there is a fair treatment. The problem with this superannuation is that, compared with superannuation in other areas, it is generous. But it is equally fair to say that, when you look at their levels of responsibility, the levels of remuneration of senior people in this place are way below those paid to people such as chief executives of companies and chief executives of banks.My conclusion out of all this is that you will never really solve the problem. I say to those who have recently joined this place - I say this to people on both sides - that if you imagine you will solve the anomalies of all this within a short space of time, you will not. We are, relatively speaking, better paid than we were 25 years ago; there is no doubt about that. The most important thing for us to do is to remember that, compared with the great bulk of Australians, members of parliament are well paid. Our responsibility, whether we belong to the government, the opposition or to no particular party, is to work hard to serve the people that we are elected to represent and to not overly concern ourselves with questions of remuneration.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Aston for his question. I recognise his enduring interest in international relations issues as a member of the joint house committee and the chairman of the coalition committee on foreign affairs. Despite the well publicised disappointment at the APEC meeting on trade liberalisation on what is called early voluntary sectoral liberalisation, it is worth remembering that the APEC meeting did produce some important outcomes. We wanted APEC to focus very much on the regional economic crisis. We prepared the ground on a number of different fronts over quite some period of time.The leaders at the meeting, at which the Prime Minister ably represented Australia, did agree on a number of Australian proposals. The first was to reaffirm the commitment to APEC's free trade and investment goals of free trade and investment markets by 2010 and 2020. The second was to adopt national policies to promote economic growth. The third was to endorse best practice international codes in transparency and financial sector management. The fourth was to endorse a future role for the G22, of which Australia is a member, in pursuing initiatives to strengthen the international financial system. The fifth was to establish a working group on private sector involvement in crisis management, which Australia has offered to chair.I said earlier that there was disappointment about the failure to reach agreement on early voluntary sectoral liberalisation at APEC. That particular initiative has now been transferred to the World Trade Organisation. We very much hope, as do other APEC members, that agreement can be reached in the WTO over the next year. By next year's APEC meeting, there will be a good deal to report in progress in those areas.There were a number of other low profile outcomes of the APEC meeting that are, in our view, of very real value. First of all, the individual action plans that the countries put forward at APEC were extremely promising. They were significant, to say the least. In  particular, I mention the individual action plans of China, Indonesia and Korea, countries that made very important new liberalisation initiatives. It is also worth mentioning that there was agreement on an APEC blueprint for action on electronic commerce. That is a dynamic response to a very important part of the global economy. It is important to note here in the House of Representatives of Australia that Australia co-chaired the task force which produced the blueprint.We also at APEC accelerated regional cooperation on the critical year 2000 computer bug problem. There will be a regional crisis planning conference held early next year. Finally, we secured APEC-wide endorsement for an important Australian initiative to improve community understanding of the benefits of open markets. There is no doubt, as all members of this House know, that there is a lot of community opposition to trade liberalisation and the opening of markets. Yet, of course, there is an overwhelming economic case for it. It is important that the APEC members communicate much more effectively than they have done so far the benefits of trade liberalisation and the benefits of the work of APEC to the broader communities in their own states.We look forward to taking APEC further forward next year under New Zealand's chairmanship. But this year's meeting - which has had, I think it is fair to say, a fairly average press, not only here in Australia, but also in other countries - did achieve a good deal. Some of the achievements may not be very high profile achievements, they may not excite people greatly. But they are important to the overall evolution of an economic and financial environment of the region.The last point I would make is that nobody should ever underestimate the political importance of the leaders meeting - of getting leaders from now 21 economies together, in an environment which is relatively informal, to talk about a whole range of different issues of regional and global importance. You cannot underestimate the importance of that. We look forward to another successful leaders meeting in New Zealand next year.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Corio for his question. The first point I would like to make is that, if the member for Corio and the Australian Labor Party were serious about supporting farmers, they would support the government's tax reform package that we have got up in the Senate - and you would get your colleagues in the Senate to put it through.We took the tax reform package to the people of Australia so that they could vote on it. They voted on it. It just so happens that we are sitting on this side of the House, and you are sitting on that side of the House. That is the response from the people of Australia about tax reform. - The question was about tax averaging, Mr Speaker, but the question also was about the tax reform process. We have undertaken an open assessment in conjunction with the private sector on the circumstances with regard to business tax, which include the farm sector. We have done that in an open and transparent way, which is something that the Labor Party never did. But we are not going to undertake any measures that are going to be detrimental to the farm communi  ty - and that includes the measure that the question was just asked about.I go back to the point I was making. This is part of an overall package, and everybody in Australia knows it. Everybody in Australia knows that this is part of an overall review of the Australian taxation system. It is about making our taxation system much better focused for the future of this country. It is about underpinning or providing a much better foundation for the productive primary industries in this country. We are about doing that; the Labor Party are opposing it. They opposed all the way the measures that we undertook to fix up the Australian economy. - Thank you, Mr Speaker. I thought I had indicated that we were going to rule it out. We are not going to implement any measures that will be detrimental to the farming community. What we are going to do is implement changes to the taxation system that will be beneficial to the rural sector, absolutely beneficial to the rural sector - and it is the Labor Party in the Senate that is standing in the way.</DOC>

 - Thank you, Mr Speaker. This is a very important question for the Australian forestry industry per se, for the Australian forests, more particularly, for the forests of New South Wales and, most particularly, for the people who, the member for Page understands, need his support as a member of parliament.A considerable time ago, the Regional Forest Agreement system was put in place. In fact, there was a memorandum of understanding with New South Wales that to conclude those agreements in an appropriate way would cause the Commonwealth government to make contributions of up to $60 million to assist New South Wales where it was necessary to compensate people who lost their employment and who lost their businesses in the cause of restructuring the forestry industry to meet sustainable development.The fundamentals of the RFA process are good science, good science in the area of the ecology of industry needs and, most importantly, the social effect of any changes - in other words, people's right to a living and people's right to remain in small country towns. In every other state these processes continue with the cooperation of state governments of various political persuasions. But, with an election coming on in New South Wales, Mr Carr and his colleagues decided to put politics above good policy, politics above proper protection of the forest. They have unilaterally gone ahead and announced a series of legislation which is now in the House and will probably pass through the House.To date the federal government has spent about $19 million assisting New South Wales  in doing proper science, but New South Wales did not want that information. New South Wales has no assistance from the Commonwealth, including our scientific assessment. More particularly, it has no assistance from the Commonwealth, including the social effects of that area. That is pretty cruel to the people of those districts. The Regional Forest Agreement process allows for public contributions - the calling of public opinion. In other parts of Australia - for instance, in Western Australia - that resulted in 30,000 submissions. - Mr Carr and his colleagues have shrugged off that process. The member for Denison, who I think represents some part of Tasmanian forestry, thinks that is a big joke. It is a joke to refuse to consult with people. That is outrageous. The reality is that the New South Wales government had every reason to follow the process of the RFA, to get assistance from the Commonwealth in the form of proper scientific assessments and to get assistance from the Commonwealth financially, which will now become a burden on the New South Wales taxpayer if the Carr government bother to pay. They probably will not. They will let individuals lose work, and they will let individuals lose their businesses because they will not have assistance. It is a very sad situation in New South Wales. It is one that can only be criticised because the Commonwealth has been excluded from helping. It is not a case of staking out turf. Deals have been done, and those deals cannot be sustained.</DOC>

I have said on many occasions in my previous occupation as minister for industry that I would hope all areas of business and resources would take every opportunity to give their views to this committee. It is a most important committee, and they are there to canvass all the relevant areas of taxation that go right across the board. There are conflicts in it, and I am quite sure the committee will come back with a very sensible recommendation. - </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Indi for his question and for his interest in Australia's farmers. The answer is that the government's tax reform will benefit Australian farmers. - Well, let me tell you. - The first thing that our indirect tax changes do is they take every dollar of tax, including all embedded taxes, off exports. That is a $4.5 billion lift to Australia's export industries. At a time when Australia has consistently had pressure on its current account and its balance of payments, what a wonderful idea to take taxes off Australian exports. That can be done under a new indirect tax system.But that is not the only benefit that the tax reform which Labor opposes will give to Australia's farmers. The tax reform which Labor opposes will also cut the cost of transport to rural and regional Australia. This is a great idea: to reduce the diesel excise from 43c to 18c so that trucking business will be substantially cheaper, and people in rural and regional Australia will be able to get cheaper goods in and cheaper goods out. That is a great thing for rural and regional Australia. In addition to that, the government's changes will also abolish a whole raft of financial taxes that farmers and other exporters pay - for example, financial institutions duty. Labor loves to tax money going in. As I have said before, there are no taxes on financial outputs - none whatsoever. - No GST on fees in relation to financial outputs. There are no taxes on financial outputs and, better, the government taxes of financial institutions duty and bank accounts debits taxes are abolished - Labor's taxes. In addition to that, Labor's stamp duties and taxes in relation to conveyancing land and businesses are going to be abolished. In relation to shares and other securities to make Australia a great financial centre, those taxes are going to be abolished.And, best of all for people that are on average incomes, income tax is going to be cut to 30 per cent for 81 per cent of Australians. Isn't that great? A 30 per cent tax rate for 81 per cent of Australians. We want to say to people who Labor wants to tax at 47 cents in the dollar: `We will bring your taxes down to 30 cents in the dollar.' Won't that be a wonderful thing for families?That is put in the context of an overall economic plan for Australia - a plan to build  our export industry, to help rural and regional Australia to develop a financial centre, to give home buyers an opportunity, to keep interest rates low. Can I say on behalf of the government - and I hope this would be shared by the Labor Party too - we think low interest rates are great for home buyers. It is good economic policy that gives low interest rates to home buyers who suffered so dreadfully under the Beazley-Keating 18 per cent home mortgage interest rates. To have six per cent interest rates, I think, is going to be a great thing.Of course too - and I point this out to home buyers - once you abolish the stamp duty on mortgages, people will be able to swap mortgages without any deterioration in the cost. There will be no stamp duty, so you will be able to shop around for the lowest mortgage provider. This is going to give a lot more competition in relation to the home mortgage industry as well. So, for rural and regional Australia, great benefits on the income tax side, on the export side, on the transport side, on the financial institutions side. This is a plan for the next century, a new tax system. Let's all Australians get behind the government's proposal.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker -  - The Leader of the Opposition has in the last two question times and today referred to comments that have been made by Michael Carmody, the Commissioner of Taxation, on new generation type tax schemes in a speech that he gave to the chartered accountants in business congress of 1998. In the course of that speech, Mr Carmody indicated that he was worried about tax effective investments. He stated:In June of this year I spoke of our concerns about the huge growth in a range of tax effective investments in such things as research, films and primary production. To give you some idea of what I mean, the level of deductions in that year - in 1996-97 - associated with arrangements we have most concern about is in excess of $1 billion.Mr Carmody is an independent statutory officer. Having become aware of those schemes, he is now investigating them and taking action.I am aware that he is taking action because I have had numbers of complaints from members of parliament that he is taking too aggressive action. For example, I have a complaint from the member for Fremantle on 5 June 1998 complaining about the Commissioner of Taxation investigating one such scheme. I have a complaint from Daryl Melham, the member for Banks, on 11 June 1998 about the action that the commissioner was taking. I have a complaint from Mr Rod Sawford of 15 June about the action that the commissioner was taking. I have a complaint  from Robert McClelland on 16 June 1998 about the action the commissioner was taking. - I have a complaint from the member for Throsby on 22 June about the activity. I could go on. I have a complaint from the member for Hunter on 29 July 1998 which states:I make representation on behalf of 12 families in my electorate. They have been hit for six by the Australian Taxation Commissioner's recent ruling with respect to investment in the film Clockers . Your intervention in the matter will be very much appreciated.So we have the Leader of the Opposition saying, `What is the government doing about these tax plans?' and his backbenchers are running around saying, `Stop them, please stop them!' When you give away economic credibility, you only make a mockery of your own position.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and for his interest in legitimate tax reform. It has been argued and I think it is pretty clear that the government's tax reform, which is a proposal to take taxes off business inputs and to take taxes off Australian exports, will lead to the creation of jobs. Our proposal to improve business taxation in this country and to reduce personal income tax rates for average Australians down to 30 per cent will be great for incentive.One has to follow the claims of the Labor Party, which apparently is prepared to make any claim to try to justify its reactionary position in relation to tax, and they normally take a few days to track down. The member for Hotham has been running around the country saying that tax reform costs jobs. His first authority for that proposition was based  on a work by Dr Colin Hargreaves, who put out a statement on the Internet under the name of the Economic Modelling Bureau of Australia, which the Press Gallery will recall the Labor Party hawked about before the election. They hawked about a document saying that the Economic Modelling Bureau of Australia had on its board of reference Vince FitzGerald, Ross Garnaut and Chris Murphy. When Ross Garnaut was made aware of this claim, he put out a statement saying:We regret the way in which this paper on the effects of a GST on jobs has been associated with the ANU. In our opinion, the economic analysis on a GST on jobs is not reflective of the high standards of the ANU.Mr Vince FitzGerald, who also had his name taken in vain in support of this claim, put out a public letter saying:I am writing to let you know that I no longer wish to be on the board of the EMBA, if indeed there is an EMBA.Mr Chris Murphy also put out a statement saying that any attempt to try to link the tax reform with the loss of jobs was erroneous. When the member for Hotham put out the claim, first of all based on Dr Hargreaves - all of whose referees walked away - and said it would cost jobs, he then made this claim:. . . Access Economics . . . say it will cost 130,000 jobs.That was Simon Crean talking to Fran Kelly on Radio National  on 12 November 1998. I have now contacted Access Economics. They say that the modelling that they have done on the government's tax reform package creates in its first year an additional 23,000 jobs, an additional 21,000 in the year after that, an additional 54,000 in the year after that and 190,000 new jobs in the first decade, and the member for Hotham went on ABC radio and quoted Access Economics as saying it will cost jobs. It always takes a few days, but you can run these claims. I say to the journalists, before you publish them, give us a few days to run them down. You can always run them down. - We have this extraordinary situation where the Australian Labor Party now say that they need four inquiries into the government's tax plan before they can vote against it. They are opposed to the government's tax plan and they are going to vote against it under all the circumstances, and that is why they need five months to inquire into it!The Australian Labor Party had to conduct a ballot as to who would actually be their chairman on this inquiry. As AM reported this morning:But it's hardly a sign of the future, is it, when your key Economic Committee Chairman's drawn from a hat after a battle of the factions? - He always yells loudest when he is in the most trouble. Mr Crean answered:Well, I think that shows a pretty evenly divided Caucus situation . . . He said:. . . it's not the first time decisions like this have been drawn from a hat . . . Labor making up its tax policy - drawing from a hat! Labor finding its economic chairman - drawing from a hat! Labor finding talent from its backbench - drawing from a hat! This is high farce from a group of people who will not confront the issues that the Australian public voted on. Pass the tax plan.</DOC>

 - Of course I am aware that the Australian Bankers Association sought to bring financial services into the scope of the GST, and they were informed no. That is why our policy says it will not happen. As I said yesterday, on several occasions, the ABA sought to come into the GST system. Why? Many businesses seek to come into the GST system because they actually find that it helps them. After considering it, the government said no, and that is the policy.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Dawson for her question. There has been survey after survey after survey of the small business community, and they are saying one thing quite clearly: they would like to employ more people but they are genuinely concerned about the unfair dismissal system. We have gone a fair way to reforming it, but there is absolutely no doubt that we could create more jobs in the Australian community if we could provide a fairer deal for small business, and that means the passage of the legislation which we put to the House and which is critical to the creation of up to 50,000 jobs - on the advice of the independent small business community.The fact is that there is an impediment to creating more jobs in this economy, and that impediment is the Labor Party, because they are opposed to doing things which would  assist the small business community. They not only created the problem but they are now opposed to the fixing of the problem. It is the Labor Party, with a frontbench stacked with ex-ACTU presidents and trade union hacks. The Queensland Teachers Union now has the shadow portfolio. The deputy leader is an ex-ACTU hack - as is the shadow minister for finance. You have all these ex-union people running the Labor Party and stopping the creation of jobs in the small business community.We have of course provided a briefing to the shadow minister on the unfair dismissal law. We are also prepared to provide a briefing to the new shadow minister for small business. We would hope that the Labor Party might finally put ideology aside and realise that jobs are more important, and that this measure for the benefit of small business really would create jobs. That offer is there for the shadow minister. I am not sure that he needs a briefing from us, because he was asked recently on the Sunday program what perceptions there were in the small business community about unfair dismissal and I am very pleased to say that in responding to this question he said that his own family had had some experience of the unfair dismissal law. This is what he said:Well my wife constantly tells me she could afford to put on one person or would like to put on one more person, but is fearful of unfair dismissals . . . That was a pretty fair comment to make. Commonsense dictates that this is a measure which will create jobs in the small business community. These people know that that would do so, but it is only the ACTU and the ex-union types on Labor's frontbench which is preventing the passage of that legislation.</DOC>

 - As I made entirely clear yesterday on several occasions, financial services are input taxed and there is no GST on their outputs. That is, there is no GST on the financial service - or the fee for the financial service, as I also said to you. Where a bank provides a service for competitive neutrality purposes which is subject to a GST because the product is sold by somebody else, such as insurance or - the other example I gave to you - financial advice, the GST will apply to that. If that was a case of being under pressure yesterday - oh, we love it! Put us under such pressure every day.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I am aware of the AMA's comments. They came from the deputy president, Dr Sandra Hacker. The AMA, of course, is not a body that always agrees with what the government is doing and has been quite prepared to say so in the past. I am also aware of some comments made today by a former national president of the  Labor Party, Neil Batt. He has put out a press release which says the following:When Labor was developing Medicare - and he was around; he was on the national executive of the Labor Party from 1974 to 1980 - it was always predicated on the need for a significant private health insurance membership base. We knew that the public hospitals and the tax system would not be able to cope if private health insurance levels fell too low. The Labor Party that gave Australia Medicare would never have declared war on private health insurance. It accepted the right of all Australians to have choice. By denying 5.3 million Australians a tangible benefit, Labor is itself responsible for every adverse health outcome in Australia.Mr Batt is not the first Labor person who has come out in support of the government's proposal. It follows on from Graham Richardson, the former Labor health minister, who last Friday said that the Labor Party's position was illogical and ideological, and it follows on from comments made previously by Peter Beattie, now the Labor Premier of Queensland, who said, `Everybody knows that the public system would be better off if there were more people in private health insurance.'The honourable member also asked me if I knew about any other proposals. I have to say that I do not, because there is no other proposal on the table. The Labor Party went to the last election with private health insurance on the backburner. It did not understand it. It was not able to come up with a policy so it went to the election with nothing - 30 per cent of the health insurance system in Australia with nothing.So there is no alternative. There is not any organisation or body putting forward alternatives. You have a whingeing, carping, bellicose opposition. You have an after-dinner speech from the Leader of the Opposition. Can't you just imagine it: the Chinese takeaway, the bottle of red and him watching the television, seeing the debate coming on and saying, `I've got to get in there and talk,' and then giving a speech with no substance at all. That reflects your policy - no substance.</DOC>

 - The government clearly indicated to the Australian people before the last election the importance of private health cover. It indicated that it was prepared to ensure that that would occur by providing funding, and of course that has been the subject of some considerable debate. A number of modellings have been done on it. - Clearly, there are always modellings done and there is a proposition -  -  - You clearly don't want the answer. You don't want to know the answer; you want to play silly games, as you have at all times on private health cover. You are not interested in seeing that we have a viable health system in this country. The government has made its decision and that decision was given to the Australian people beforehand. It was verified, unlike Labor promises before the last election where they were not prepared under the charter of budget honesty to put forward their fundings for costing. - As I indicated, the matter that the government put before the Australian people was costed by Finance. When Finance costs any matter that the government makes a decision on, it is based on reasonable assumptions, it is based on objective assumptions and in this instance it factors in the current levels of premiums and the take-up rate that would be applicable. The outcome is that the government has announced the cost that is there -  - Oh, sit down. It is based on all of the reasonable objective analysis that has been done, which the government accepts.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Moreton for his question. I appreciate it. I am still waiting for Mike Pezzullo and John Angley to write one for the shadow minister. - The Commonwealth has delivered since 1997 a total of 70,000 places in TAFE over and above the places that existed before then at no cost to the Commonwealth taxpayer. The Commonwealth has achieved these additional places as a result of its policy of growth through efficiencies.In the course of the election campaign and since, I have become aware of an alternative approach to TAFE places. The Labor Party,  in the butchered education policy that it put before the people, promised a meagre 10,000 additional places in TAFE over three years at a cost of $120 million to the taxpayer. In other words, the coalition through good government can deliver 70,000 additional places at no cost to the taxpayer; the Labor Party is going to sting the taxpayer for $120 million for a mere 10,000 additional places.This shows the utter incompetence of the policy that the Labor Party put before the people at the last election. It is no wonder that the Leader of the Opposition is now calling for intellectual renewal within the Labor Party. What must his frontbench be thinking about this appeal of the Leader of the Opposition? As the little Red Indian from Werriwa said on 2BL on 7 October:What's the point of being a shadow minister to spend 18 months consulting closely with interest groups? What's the point of just going through what you think is a legitimate process in the party? What's the point of putting it down when you think of the quality format, to have it rewritten by someone in the leader's office who hadn't been involved in education policy at any part of the last 2½ years?The Labor Party's problem is that they have now got an education policy on the back bench without a spokesman, and they have a spokesman on the front bench without a policy. We all welcome the call for intellectual renewal, but it is a big job before the policy butchers in the Leader of the Opposition's office to deliver it.</DOC>

 - As I indicated a short time ago, clearly all members opposite would dearly love to see the hospital system break  down. They have never supported private health cover. - Clearly, if the government did nothing, the fallout rate would be very significant, the drop-out rate would be very significant, and this government is not prepared to allow that to happen. My recollection is that there would be an increase in the uptake, the exact details of that uptake I am not sure of but I will find out. I cannot recollect the exact increase of the uptake from the current 30.3 per cent. I will find out, and I will inform the Leader of the Opposition very soon.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Forde for her question. I recognise her interest in these issues and the interests that many members of the coalition have in nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament. The short answer to the honourable member's question is that this government looks to  achieve practical outcomes in foreign policy. We will support proposals that we think will help to advance the cause of nuclear non-proliferation and the eventual elimination of nuclear weapons. We did promote the Canberra Commission's report. I presented it to the United Nations General Assembly, I presented it to the United Nations Conference on Disarmament, and it was circulated to all relevant foreign ministries - just about all foreign ministries - around the world. One of the conclusions of the Canberra Commission's report - which I suspect on the opposition side has only been read by the member for Holt, the man whom the Labor Party wants to hold an inquiry into now - was that the nuclear weapons states themselves had to act to eliminate nuclear weapons. The truth is that action has been taken in the right direction. During the course of this decade, the United States and Russia have halved their holdings of nuclear weapons. We have high expectations that the Russian Duma will ratify the START II agreement so that START II will come into force and START III will be under way as well.But we have been doing more than that. We have been out there promoting the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty. The achievements of the Australian government in bringing to life that treaty will stand as one of the great monuments to non-proliferation by Australia. We are also in the process of promoting the Fissile Material Cut-Off Treaty, and I have very great optimism that, during the course of next year, a treaty can be concluded in the Conference on Disarmament.The new agenda proposal put forward by a number of countries has many features that are attractive, but it is an agenda which is ill-defined. It includes, for example, the proposal for an international conference on disarmament and the elimination of nuclear weapons. Frankly, we believe that to hold such a conference now would complicate the work being done to promote the Fissile Material Cut-Off Treaty and to conclude the further signatories of the comprehensive test-ban treaty.   There are some people of goodwill in this parliament who support the new agenda proposal and I recognise, in many cases, their goodwill. But I have gone to the trouble to find out where the Labor Party stands on this issue. I could find no reference at all to where the Labor Party stood on the new agenda. It has done no policy work whatsoever on this important issue. They set up the Canberra Commission and, since then, they have done absolutely nothing. They are a policy vacuum on one of the key issues that the international community is facing.But then I hesitated because I did find that the Labor Party had done something. A few weeks ago they supported a resolution in the Senate promoting the new agenda. But did the Labor Party put up the motion? No, Senator Margetts did. So the Labor Party's policy in so far as it exists is written by none other than Senator Margetts.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Riverina for her question. As all members of the House would be aware, the pig and pig meat industries in Australia have been in a bit of turmoil and suffering from low commodity prices in recent times. As a result of that, we commissioned an inquiry by  the Productivity Commission into whether safeguard actions should be applied. That report has been tabled in the parliament today. It contains a number of findings which we will now be  consulting with representatives of the pig meat industry about prior to formulating our response to the report.There has been a fair bit of debate about this issue. I think what should be noted are some of the circumstances that have existed in the past that caused this circumstance. People should note that the Labor Party removed the tariff from this industry in the early 1990s without providing any assistance to industry to adjust. - They removed that tariff and they did not provide any assistance to adjust. - Earlier this year -  - Earlier this year, our government announced a $19 million package of assistance to help the industry adjust to the international marketplace and to help it focus on international marketing and exports. It is instructive to note that in the last 12 months exports of pig meat from Australia have actually increased by 84 per cent.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Parramatta for his question. I acknowledge his great interest in the future of young people in his electorate. The coalition is committed to giving all young Australians the best possible opportunities in life through the education and training system. That is why we put in place our national literacy reforms. It is why we are providing a pathway from work to school. It is why we are maintaining junior wage rates so that young people can compete for the jobs that are available.As we approach the end of the school year, many thousands of young people will have the opportunity to take advantage of the government's training reforms. The government has put in place a new national training system that provides young people with national, portable, recognised qualifications for  jobs. This year, over 200,000 people will be participating in the new apprenticeship system. I should tell young people that new apprenticeships are available now not just in the traditional trades. They are available across the whole range of new industries, such as information technology, communications and multimedia as well as in areas such as sport, recreation and finance. There are now some 60 new apprenticeship centres available throughout Australia. I invite young people to inquire at these centres about what opportunities are available to them in their areas.This year, the government is also funding some 80 job pathway brokers, who will be assisting some 1,400 schools and the school  leavers at those schools to move effectively from school to jobs. This government is committed to the future of young Australians. This government has policies. The other side of the House has a massive, gaping policy vacuum. We are determined that young people will have opportunities.</DOC>

 - The assumption on which the Leader of the Opposition's question is based is wrong. - It is completely wrong. Not only do I call it wrong, but Graham Richardson calls it wrong as well. The reality is that, unless further action is taken, there will be a further catastrophic decline in the number of people taking out private health insurance in this country. That is exactly what the Australian Labor Party wants. The Australian Labor Party is opposed to private health insurance. That is why Graham Richardson was driven to say this on 23 November this year:I don't understand why Labor can't simply stand up and say - yes we do need to have a system of private health.The reason that Labor will not stand up and say that is that Labor does not believe, in its modern manifestation, that we should have a system of private health insurance. The incentive that the government has proposed, an incentive that will help 700,000 people who are on -  - And I am giving a direct answer. - Mr Speaker -  - The money that is involved in the new 30 per cent tax reduction that the Australian people voted for on 3 October will obtain three benefits. It will, on the assumptions that have been made, lead to an increase in the number of people who are taking out private health insurance. It will also achieve a very, very significant cost saving to the Commonwealth if it prevents a further burden being thrown on the public purse by the additional strain on the public  hospital system if there is a further fall in the number of people who are privately insured.What the Labor Party has done is to watch the steady decline, year over year, of the number of people in private health insurance. When Richardson was your health minister, he warned you that if this fell below 40 per cent you would have a problem, and Carmen Lawrence, Paul Keating and Kim Beazley rubbed their hands together and said, `Terrific, let's have the problem, because we don't believe in private health insurance.' - And year after year under Labor the number of people -  -  - I apologise to the member for Fremantle for not referring to her as the member for Fremantle. But the member for Fremantle, the then finance minister in the Labor government and now Leader of the Opposition, and the then Prime Minister in the Labor government all rubbed their hands together and said, `Let's have a crisis in private health insurance because we do not believe in it.'The Australian people have a very clear choice: you either invest more money in private health insurance and preserve it as a  viable alternative for middle Australia or let it die as an available option for middle Australia. You restrict it entirely to the very wealthy who will always be able to afford to take it out and you load onto the public hospital system of this country the health needs of the overwhelming bulk of the Australian community. That is what the Labor Party wants. The Labor Party wants a two-tiered health system in this country. It wants a health system that will always be able to be afforded by the very wealthy and it wants the rest to compete for the resources of the public hospital system. - The Prime Minister is winding up his answer. I am winding up to my answer, Mr Speaker. Can I just say we have that very clear choice: either you have a balanced system where there is fair access for middle Australia to private health insurance or you turn your back on private health insurance, surrender it to the very wealthy and leave the rest of the community with the public system. I do not think that is fair, we will never think it is fair, and that is why we are committing these resources to give middle Australia the opportunity of taking out private health insurance.</DOC>

 - I would like to thank the member for Robertson for his question. The member for Robertson takes a great interest in the Job Network, and last Friday he opened a new office of Wesley Employment in his electorate. Over the past few weeks, the Minister for Employment, Workplace Rela  tions and Small Business and I, singly or together, have consulted with a representative sample of 26 Job Network members. There have been three meetings with senior officers of Centrelink and two lengthy discussions with the board of the National Employment Services Association. Obviously, we would not be making this effort if everything was absolutely perfect, but I can inform the House that the Job Network is already significantly outperforming the Commonwealth Employment Service at getting unemployed people into work - and that is the test which really counts. The other day the well-known journalist Michael Duffy said:Many of the employment and training organisations in . . . the Job Network are non-profit groups (e.g. the Salvation Army, the Catholic Church) and admirable in the work they're doing. It makes a lot of sense for government to continue to work with such groups in a spirit of partnership.Through these consultations it has been impossible not to feel a surge of pride and satisfaction at the work these great organisations are doing to help Australians in need, people like Adrian Atkinson - I quote from a document put out by the Salvation Army - who said:I would like to thank you all for your help, support and encouragement while looking for work. Since working with a Salvation Army case manager, I have become more confident with job skills and am always encouraging others to use your services.Frank Ross said of the Salvation Army Employment Plus:You have been very helpful, honest, very open.They've actually sent you for a job, not just taking your name. They cared about you.There is no great secret to the success of these organisations. Whether their primary motivation is profit, service to the community or religious idealism, these great organisations are determined not just to work with the unemployed, but to put the unemployed into work.The member for Werriwa understands the importance of harnessing the community sector to important social goals. The member for Werriwa is not shirking the task of policy creation. If the Leader of the Opposition were serious about intellectual renewal, he would immediately invite the member for Werriwa  to return to Labor's front bench. The member for Werriwa's absence is a sign of the intellectual vacuum at the heart of a party which once prided itself on its mastery of ideas. But the member for Werriwa is not the only one -  - I am indeed, Mr Speaker. - I am now quoting Professor John Freeland, the head of the Evatt Foundation. John Freeland talks about the very things which underpin the Job Network. He talks of `the need to identify new policies relating to the generation of wealth, capturing the ingenuity, the creativity, the wealth generating capacity of the market, but harnessing that to achieve the sorts of social objectives we want'. That is a very good description of the Job Network. The Job Network precisely involves these sorts of principles. The Job Network is the so-called `third way' in action. What we have done with the Job Network is recruit a rollcall of the greatest names in Australian charity - Mission Australia, the Brotherhood of St Laurence, the Salvation Army and Centrecare, and through the Job Network we have enabled them to work even better with the Australians who need it most.</DOC>

 - In answer to the Leader of the Opposition, I have long since learnt at this dispatch box never to take at face value quotations that are made in public documents by -   - There is not a point of order, Mr Speaker. - I have learnt not to accept the interpretations placed on public documents by members of the opposition. But let me simply restate the choice. In the end this is about a choice: whether you believe in having a viable private health system or not. We do, you don't. That's the simple choice. For 13 years you allowed the private hospital system to waste away. For 13 years you rejected the entreaties even of those on your side of politics who wanted to preserve the private health system. Let me say to the Australian public that you are seeing played out in the parliament of Australia this week a perfect contrast -  - The Australian people are seeing played out in the parliament this week a very clear demonstration that for middle Australia there is only one side of politics to support on private health insurance, and that is the coalition side. It is only the coalition that is prepared to say to middle Australian families: `We will give you financial help to take out private health insurance.' I say to all of those newly appointed Labor members who  hold very small majorities: you go and talk to the families in your electorates about whether they want a private health insurance rebate. You go and ask the people who are battling to bring up a family on a modest middle income whether they want private health insurance and you will find that it is the overwhelming aspiration of middle Australian families to have private health insurance. They overwhelmingly welcome this initiative of the government. They know who is in there batting for them. It is not the Australian Labor Party; it is the coalition.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Barker for his first question in this House and also acknowledge that he is very keen to see the services in rural Australia improve. He knows, as we on this side of the parliament know, that it is this side of the House that is going to deliver better services to rural and regional Australia. The new member for Barker particularly has a great interest in our veteran community.I announced on Monday that the Department of Veterans' Affairs will be contracting local organisations in the Murray and Mallee regional electorates and also in the upper and mid-north part of South Australia in the electorate of Grey to assist in the provision of services to local veterans. These local organisations - the Murray Mallee Financial Information Service and the Upper and Mid North Rural Justice Committee - will provide weekly and fortnightly services to those two communities. They will be able not only to provide these services but also to explain eligibility to veterans in those communities and to take applications for compensation, health and income support entitlements.This is in recognition of the fact that one-third of our nation's veterans live in rural Australia, and they deserve the same type of  assistance and access to information as our veterans who live in the more populated parts of our nation. It is we on this side of the House, as I said earlier, who are going to deliver to these communities in rural and remote Australia, because we have at heart the interests of our veterans - wherever they live.This bill is on our commitment to extend the eligibility of our veterans to the gold card. On 1 January next year, up to 50,000 veterans who have qualifying service from the Second World War will receive that eligibility. I am pleased to receive this question from the member for Barker. I look forward to working with him to bring better services to veterans in rural Australia and, particularly in this case, to veterans in the seat of Barker.</DOC>

 - I am glad the member for Cunningham raised this matter, because it has been canvassed in a number of newspapers in Australia. The reaction is to the Defence Review Program which has been implemented across the whole of defence in Australia. At this stage we should draw to the attention of the House that the purpose of the reform program was to divert the balance within the Defence Force of Australia to 60 per cent active and 40 per cent support. As a consequence of those changes there will be shifts in personnel. It is the management of the shifts in personnel which is most important to  the government. As a consequence of that I have asked the department -  -  - I have asked the Department of Defence to assess the implications of the changes in personnel and to press on at the same time with the reform program. It is utterly important to Australian defence that the $1 billion that we are saving in this defence reform be transferred to the active side of the defence portfolio. As a consequence of that, Australian defence forces in the future will be very much more on the alert than they have been in the past. - As I was saying, the objective of the defence reform was to catch up on the 15 years in which the Labor Party neglected the defence forces. As a consequence of that, the Defence Reform Program will continue. The initiatives taken by the government are very welcome by the senior areas of defence.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Longman for his question. I know he has a very keen interest in this issue, as do a number of my colleagues. - And the Prime Minister does as well; I should never neglect the Prime Minister. I have had initial consultations with the key stakeholders in this industry. I have spoken with the publishers and representatives of the publishers. I have spoken with the umbrella organisations from newsagents and also with representatives of the sub-agents and a number of other stakeholders.I have asked the ACCC to conduct a mediation role in relation to this matter. It is essentially a private sector matter, but we have a very strong commitment to the protection of home delivery services. That commitment, given by the Prime Minister in the lead-up to the 1996 campaign and in the lead-up to the last campaign, is unchanged. We retain that commitment. I have asked the ACCC to conduct further consultations with the stakeholders. I have asked them to report back to me by 15 February so that we can pursue some issues and some solutions to parts of the problems that have arisen as a result of the tribunal's decision.</DOC>

 - I will tell the Leader of the Opposition what is true. What is true is that we won the last election with a policy of giving a 30 per cent rebate for private health insurance. What is true is that you campaigned against that rebate in the last election and you lost. What is true is that there are 12 more coalition members in this parliament than there are opposition members. - What is true is that the coalition supports private health insurance; Labor opposes it. What is true is that in the electorate of Bass there are 24,692 people with private health insurance. What is true is that in the electorate of Dickson there are 30,275 people with private health insurance. What is true is that in the electorate of Stirling there are 58,555 people with private health insurance. What is true is that we intend to give effect to the verdict of the Australian people. And what is true is that you are deaf to the wishes of the Australian people, and that is why you are in opposition.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Curtin for her question. There has been a lot of comments on public hospital funding, some more accurate than others. Most coming from the opposition of course are completely inaccurate. I was made aware last night of a comment on public hospital funding from back in 1992. Back in 1992 hospital funding was still an issue of great and immense interest. We were then coming up to the 1993 health care agreement and the Minister for Health in Western Australia was Keith Wilson.On 13 November 1992, Mr Wilson resigned as the Minister for Health. In his press release on his resignation as the Minister for Health he cited the continuing failure of the federal government to recognise the role of private health insurance as an important source of funding for public hospitals. He said, `The consequence of this failure is that public hospital services are unable to meet the needs of ordinary Western Australians, particularly pensioners and others on low incomes.' He went on to say:I wrote in my letter of resignation to the Premier that I have always considered I am primarily answerable to the Western Australian public for appropriately funded hospital services. Someone has to be answerable ultimately for these continuing failures and no-one in Canberra is prepared to be it.The Premier that he was sending his resignation to was the member for Fremantle, a former health minister herself, and the government in Canberra he was talking about when he said no-one was prepared to be responsible was the then Labor government.A health care agreement was signed after that and health funding from the Commonwealth went up and health funding from the states went down. This was a point that the then Minister for Human Services and Health, the member for Fremantle, and the then Minister for Finance, now the Leader of the Opposition, made on television in the 10 days  before the 1996 election. They complained that the problem was that the Commonwealth had put extra money into public hospitals and the states had taken that money out.The problem with that is that, while it is true, the 1993 health care agreement for public hospital funding that the Labor Party signed had a sleight of hand. The extra money that was going into the public hospitals was paid for by a reduction in financial assistance grants to the states, the so-called Medicare guarantee. It was specifically linked. The Medicare guarantee, the reduction in FAGs, was used to pay for the increase in hospital funding. So it is true that public hospitals were in difficulty because, as the Leader of the Opposition said, the Commonwealth money went up and the state money went down. But he did not say that the state money went down as a result of a deliberate action of the then Labor government.In contrast, the health care agreement that was signed in August this year for the next five years has an unprecedented 10 per cent increase in funding overnight to the state public hospitals - all new money, none coming from a reduction in financial assistance grants - and with growth built in over the next five years so that in five years time the increase in Commonwealth money going to state public hospitals will be 19.2 per cent real - not nominal; real. That sort of growth in funding is completely unprecedented.The other problem is that private hospital insurance provides a revenue stream to public hospital funding. Thirty per cent of Australians, if you ask them, will say their preferred method of treatment is to be a private patient in a public hospital. Those people with their private insurance provide revenue to the states.The simple problem with taking Labor's position of doing nothing is that the level of people with private health insurance will continue to decline. The increase in the number is, in one sense, just an estimate. It is very difficult, because of so many factors, to be certain about how big an increase it will be. But we can be certain of one thing: what the decrease will be if we do nothing. So at the end of five years - I picked that time  because it is the period of the current health care agreement for public hospital funding - we will be down to 20 per cent in private health insurance. The state public hospitals will lose their revenue stream and Australia will have a very different health care system - the sort of system that I do not believe the Australian public wants. - Mine is not falling either.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. I will take up in my response just where the Minister for Health and Aged Care left off. A failure to do anything in respect of health would lead to an enormous payout by the Australian people estimated to be an additional $2.5 billion at the conclusion of the current Commonwealth-state agreement. It would also lead to a complete breakdown of the public hospital system. That would lead to the need for the states to provide an additional 1.3 million bed days per year as a result of the membership decline that Labor presided over, encouraged and continues to do so in this current debate.Let me just indicate to the House the basis of costings on the government's proposal, which is the subject of legislation. These costings were, during the election campaign, given to Finance, unlike the proposals of Labor. They were not prepared under the charter of budget honesty to submit their proposals for costings. Ours were. The costings are based on the assumption that there will be an increase of about 2½ percent  age points in membership. We saw that; it was given to the House yesterday by the Prime Minister. That would mean that there would be an increase in coverage to about 33 per cent of the population.They are based on the fact that there is an annual population growth of about one per cent. They are based on the fact that there will be an annual premium increase of about four per cent. Those premium rises are projected to be significantly lower than we have seen in recent years. They reflect an improvement in the risk profile -  - resulting from new memberships and the impact of other structural reforms to be put in place, as was announced during the election campaign. This $1.5 billion that Labor wishes to peddle around is not correct. Like most of the figures it throws around, it gilds the lily. The net cost is about $1.2 billion in 2000-01.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. Rural and remote Australians understandably want to be first-class citizens when it comes to the provision of high quality health care that works for people with often very difficult and demanding lifestyles and particular needs. The government is committed to making private health more affordable and accessible. It is hard to understand why anybody would oppose that, but those opposite are obviously dedicated to just that outcome.Many specialised treatments, by necessity, for rural people are only available in major centres. This leads us to a heightening, if anything, of the two major benefits that flow from private health for rural people. It gives  them access to doctors of their choice and reasonable security in relation to treatment on time. They are both very important to people in rural Australia. To illustrate that very simply, it is a bit hard to knock off in the middle of shearing or harvesting when a bed suddenly becomes available. You really want to have some say over your doctor of choice and your place of treatment.I heard somebody interject that they need doctors for a start. No-one has done more than the current Minister for Health and Aged Care to get doctors into rural and remote areas. Not only has the flow of blood been stemmed; we have stabilised the flow of doctors out of rural and remote areas. It has started to increase. It is about five per cent in the case of rural doctors and eight per cent in the case of remote doctors. -  - I thank my opposite number for her question by interjection and ask: can we have more of them? Rural and remote Australians want the right to choose their own doctor and when and where they will have elective treatment just as much as those who live closer to these services want those sorts of access possibilities as well. Private health insurance gives them access to high quality and highly technical health care in the location of their choice.Our generous 30 per cent rebate proposal will make private health more affordable. You cannot argue with that. It will make it very much more affordable. It will curb the decline in participation rates, which will give the industry breathing space to allow it to participate in other reforms currently being developed in the private health insurance arena. It will take the pressure off our public health system. What is absolutely obvious out of all of this is that no-one opposite is out there cruising around rural Australia. If they were, they would be beating our door down to agree with us on private health insurance.</DOC>

 - The methodology that was adopted in relation to the approval of premium increases in the last term of government will come under review, as you would normally expect. - I thought you would react that way. - The reason you react that way is that when you were in government there were just so many premium increases that you stopped. That is the reason. When you were in government, you did not stop one increase. Of course, those sorts of arrangements will continue to be kept under review. Quite frankly, that sort of question is totally irrelevant to the issue which now faces the Australian people, and that is: do the Australian people want private health insurance to survive or don't they? Overwhelmingly the Australian people do want the private health insurance system of this country to survive. For example, I say to the re-elected member for Paterson - I thought he would catch my eye - that if I look at my little list I see there are 41,764 insured people in the electorate of Paterson. - Mr Speaker, I was just saying that there are 41,764 privately health insured people in the electorate of Paterson. May I say to the House that, on a scale of one to 10, the greatest level of betrayal at around eight or nine of any representative in this place is that of the representatives of Western Australian electorates in this House, because the level of private health insurance in Western Australia is much higher than it is in any other part of Australia. So every single Western Australian member who comes in here sells out the interests of the people of Western Australia who believe that they are entitled to get some return. You are talking here about hundreds and hundreds of thousands of Australian battlers who scrimp and save in order to take out private health insurance. You are not talking about millionaires; you are talking about people on $20,000, $30,000, $40,000 or $50,000 a year. They are the people who scrimp and save to have private health insurance. They are the people you are kicking in the teeth by opposing this measure, and they are the people who will remember long and remember hard if you continue to vote against this measure.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable and extremely capable member for Hume for picking out such a question and for showing such shrewdness in asking me. I can inform the House that today's capex figure for the September quarter of 1998 shows that private new capital expenditure for the quarter rose 8.4 per cent. The market expectation was, in median terms, about 2.5 per cent. The capex figures indicate much stronger investment than the market had been expecting.Although the building estimates in capex do not map closely into those of the national accounts, these strong capital expenditure figures point to the fact that in the national accounts, which are to be released next week, there should be a solid contribution to GDP growth from business investment. Non-residential construction continues to expand, growing a further 5.4 per cent in the September quarter after a rise of over 16 per cent in the June quarter. Expected investment is slightly higher than business expectation in investment at this time last year, and this points to continuing strong business investment over the year. This is another indicator that the Australian economy continues to perform well against a backdrop of the international financial difficulties.Fundamentals for business investment remain favourable. Interest rates are low. Inflation is low. Corporate profitability is sound. In fact, indicator interest rates on variable rates, small and business loans, are the lowest since the 1970s. Since July of 1996, when the coalition was elected, the overall cost of variable small business loans has fallen 3.6 per cent. That is a fall 1.1 per cent greater than the reductions in official interest rates, and indicator overdraft rates, as recorded by the Reserve Bank, are now the lowest they have been.You do not get results like that without doing hard economic work, and it was this government's decision to put the Australian budget back into surplus, to lock in low inflation, to run a debt retirement program to pay back the Labor-Keating-Beazley debt of the 1990s that did that. But it is important that we not rest there. It is important that Australia continue to engage in economic reform, the  kind of reform that the government proposes in relation to tax, to make this a strong economy in a very volatile environment.</DOC>

 - I have already answered the first part of the question. The second part of the question I would further answer by reminding the House that what is involved in this debate is the simple proposition of whether you are for or against private health insurance. What is further involved in this debate is what the real alternatives are. The real alternatives are not between an insured level of the population of 30 per cent or 33 per cent but between what would modestly occur if our measure came into force and what would occur if Labor had its way. If Labor had its way, there would continue to be a catastrophic decline in private health insurance and on the long-term Labor trend it would be down to 20 per cent in five years time, which would require the Commonwealth to pay an extra $2.5 billion to the states under the compensation arrangements that form part of the agreement.The chasm between the two sides of politics on this issue is obvious. I welcome the fact that the Labor Party has been so up-front about its opposition to private health insurance. The Labor Party imagines that in some way this is a brilliant masterstroke of political and economic strategy: you drive the level of private health insurance down to about 20 per cent of the population and then miraculously you have taken the load off the back of the public health system. You have done no such thing.I say again: we on this side of the House, the Liberal and National parties, stand proudly behind private health insurance. We believe  that middle Australia is entitled to have private health insurance. We believe that middle Australia is entitled to have a tax deduction for private health insurance. We believe that 81 per cent of Australians under our system of taxation reform, if our health reforms are implemented, will have full tax deductibility. I say to the opposition that that is what middle Australia wants, that is what a balanced health system in this country requires and if you started to listen to middle Australia, instead of arrogantly assuming you know better, we would have a great improvement in public policy debate.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I suppose that, in short, to the first part of the question - there are a number of parts - the answer is no, because everybody knows that there is an impacting effect all the way down the line. -  - The Labor Party says, `Oh yeah, oh yeah!' but it is an absolute fact, and the first people that recognise that and acknowledge that are the farming community themselves, because they know exactly where all the benefits are going to flow to their constituency. They know exactly where the benefits are going to flow to. The farming community right across Australia support the government's tax reform package. In fact, I happen to have with me a transcript of when I spoke to the NFF yesterday. In his thankyou, the Vice-President of the NFF said: `On tax reform we urge you to keep up the good fight and make sure that the comprehensive package is introduced. The NFF has supported and continues to support the package.' The  farming community knows that from this total package the average farm - be it either a wool or a beef farm - in Australia will have a benefit of about $5,400 because of fewer overheads flowing from this tax package.They know that their exporters - and they are part of the exporting community in Australia - will have $4.5 billion worth of burden lifted off their shoulders. They also know that the Australian Labor Party wants to keep all these burdens on their operations and wants to keep all these burdens on their exports, and they are supporting the government's tax package wholeheartedly. They are opposed to the position that the Labor Party is taking.I urged the NFF, when I spoke to them this week, that we need public support. We have taken this tax package to the people of Australia. We have been re-elected to government. The Treasurer and the Prime Minister presented the tax package to the Premiers of New South Wales and the rest of Australia, and they have supported it. So we have the broad support of the people of Australia to introduce this tax package, and it is now incumbent upon the Senate to pass it. The farming community across Australia are also going to be making that call over the next six months as the debate continues, because they know of the long-term benefits that are going to be there for the farming community of Australia.</DOC>

 - I can inform the honourable member for McPherson and, in fact, all members of the House that I have seen some reports in relation to the sale by the government of Tasrail. In fact, some Tasmanian newspapers carry such banner headlines as `Profit for Tasrail first in 127 years' and `Tasrail beats forecast'. Tasrail is one of the businesses of Australian National that was sold by the government last year. The objec  tive behind the government sale of those businesses, which of course was announced by the government in advance in 1996, was to stop the haemorrhaging.What we had seen in Australian National in the previous 13 years when the Labor government was managing these businesses had been job losses of some 7,000 employees. We had seen a call and a drain on taxpayers of several hundred million dollars cumulatively over that period. We also had an objective to see if we could grow rail in Australia by putting the private sector in there, creating the appropriate competition. At the time, what was the response of Labor? The honourable member for Melbourne, who was their spokesperson at that time in respect of transport, indicated very clearly with his dire predictions that the decision to sell the rail businesses would lead to job losses. - He said it would lead to line closures. - He said it would lead to a decline in services. - I am pleased to inform the House that the government's objectives have been met. Those headline banners clearly indicate that. The government's objectives have been met, and exactly the opposite of what the honourable member for Melbourne was predicting has in fact occurred. Since taking over ownership of Tasrail, the consortium that purchased it, Australian Transport Network, has in fact increased the number of employees by some 12 per cent: there are 197 employees now in Tasrail in Tasmania. Since taking over ownership, the consortium has  recorded an operating profit in its first seven months - the first in 127 years. Not only has it recorded an operating profit but it has shared that operating profit with bonuses to its employees.Whilst it was contractually obliged to invest some $20 million over four years in capital expenditure, it has already spent some $7 million in capital expenditure: it has undertaken the purchase of locomotives and wagons to haul freight across Tasmania, it has undertaken and upgraded bridges and tracks, it has undertaken and upgraded railway crossing signals and telecommunications systems; and it now plans not to spend $20 million in capital expenditure in its first four years but to spend $40 million in its first four years.So the next time the Australian public listens to Labor or when Labor states, as it usually does, this one-liner it has when it comes to asset sales that all government businesses must be owned by the government I would simply ask the Australian public to look at the Tasrail experience. When we unshackled Tasrail from public ownership, we saw an outstanding result. This is in stark contrast to the sick, sorry and sad history of business management under Labor and its attitude on asset sales.</DOC>

 - It is true that I chaired a meeting of the sports and recreational ministers on 20 November. It is true that all ministers at that meeting were appalled at the thought of people profiteering  from young children hitting each other around the ring. It was agreed at that meeting that we would go away and consider a national approach and set up a working party to look at the problem. New South Wales has come up with a bandaid approach to a problem that is of great concern to all Australians. Victoria put forward their legislation, which looks at banning professional boxing for under 18 - not 14, not 16, but under 18. - At that meeting the New South Wales sports minister introduced a motion that no-one at that meeting had read. We suddenly got a motion. She had not even bothered to get her Labor colleagues from Tasmania and Queensland to attend the meeting to second that motion. It was not even seconded. It was not even discussed before she raced out of the meeting to hold a press conference on the bandaid measure that New South Wales had come to. - The rest of the ministers at that meeting continued in mature and considered discussion of the issue. We came to a unanimous decision, backed up by the New South Wales minister and the South Australian minister, that we would form a working party to look at the Victorian legislation to come up with a national approach to the problem and that I would go away and discuss with the national sporting organisation a resolution to this issue. It was unanimous agreement at that meeting.</DOC>

 - The New South Wales government and the Commonwealth government signed a scoping agreement to undertake the RFA process back in January 1996, and that process commenced with an interim forest assessment process, which was concluded and announced in September 1996. That was a preliminary assessment of the New South Wales forest situation. Immediately upon that announcement, the New South Wales state government reduced the level of timber quotas in that state by 35 to 40 per cent and declared extensive new national parks and wilderness areas. New South Wales also committed to future extensive areas of reserves in the RFA process.The government at that time criticised these actions as pre-empting the RFA process, as they did, but we continued to seek agreement. The reduction that was implemented unilaterally at that stage has had a severe effect on the economics particularly in the area of Eden. The member for Eden-Monaro has drawn to my attention, amongst other things, there have been about 30 closures of small businesses that were in no way connected with any financial assistance, the problem being that when you take a trucking operator or a timber contractor out of business you might compensate that person but you do not compensate the people who were selling them tyres, fuel and feeding their families. So that first unilateral decision has had a severe economic effect.However, recognising the problems concerned, immediately upon my appointment, I contacted Mr Craig Knowles, one of the ministers responsible in New South Wales, and said, `Please, let us get this program of the Regional Forest Agreement back on track,' and he agreed we could have a meeting on 13 November. The next day the New South Wales government unilaterally announced their processes for Eden with increased reserves of 46 per cent of forested land and reduced timber quotas by another 10 per cent. As a consequence, Harris Daishowa have just advised five contractors with significant numbers of employees that they have to participate in a ballot. They have to draw a marble to keep their business. They have to draw a marble to keep their people in a job.Anyway, knowing that, I said to the minister, `Look, we won't fight with each other over this. Let's get together and try to do some good.' What happened? On 12 November, the New South Wales government announced its policies for the upper north-east and the lower north-east regions and declared that in both cases legislation would pass the New South Wales parliament prior to its proroguing, which could be today.No RFA processes have even commenced in the north-east regions. A significant part of that RFA process as laid down in these agreements is that there is a process of public consultation. In Western Australia where that process is progressing, some 30,000 individuals chose to make such submissions - and on issues across the board. Everybody in north-east New South Wales has been denied that opportunity. What has been the alternative? The reality of what has been done is that a selected group of people have got together in a back room to come to some agreement.In December 1995, the Commonwealth and New South Wales signed a memorandum of understanding with each committing $60 million to the Forest Industry Structural Adjustment Package, better known as FISAP. Following concerns regarding the administration and effectiveness of this program, and two independent reports outlining the program's coverage and guidelines, the Commonwealth sought to negotiate new  guidelines with New South Wales which would avoid perceptions of conflict of interest. There are grave concerns that one of your colleagues has been picking out mates to get the money, but again New South Wales did nothing about it. - As a result of all these unilateral actions, I have been obliged to write to Minister Yeadon in the New South Wales government and suspend all Commonwealth financial contributions to this process until it returns to the RFA arrangements. And I do not believe that is going to be particularly easy, simply because many of the areas identified for forestry, on good advice, will be unable to meet the sustainability management aspects of the RFA. New South Wales has put its own people in an intolerable position.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Deakin for his question on this matter. -  - Can I say on the issue of judicial review in relation to immigration matters that it has been long a vexed question, and that is because there are quite different objectives between the courts, who have a role in reviewing individual matters, and the policy questions that are involved in the admission of people to Australia under an immigration program. Decisions that can be taken by courts, often in isolation from the broad policy questions, can have a very significant impact on the way in which the immigration program ultimately unfolds. It is important to understand that because the Labor Party in office understood that question very well. - When it was in office it understood that very well. Section 6A(1)(e) of the Immigration Act provided that people could obtain entry to Australia if there were strong and compelling and compassionate circumstances. The interpretation that was developed over time by the court led to a situation where, in the last year that those provisions remained in place, 20,000 people  were seeking to access Australia under those provisions and, under the way in which the law had developed and been interpreted, they could not be excluded. - That was the impact of individual decisions, taken in individual cases, developed over time. It led to a situation where those provisions - the fundamental principle which has guided this government and previous governments in office that the government of the day should be able to determine the size of the immigration program and who should enter Australia for permanent settlement - were essentially unwound. - This government is of the view that the size and the provisions under which people enter Australia should be determined by the government of the day. The bill that we are intent on reintroducing to this House and to the Senate to deal with issues of jurisdiction and the way in which matters will operate will contain a privative clause.The impact of a privative clause does not lead to a situation in which the High Court would end up being the only court of review. A privative clause would operate in relation to both the High Court of Australia as much as it would operate in relation to the Federal Court of Australia. It would provide that access to both the Federal Court and the High Court would remain but that the grounds for review before the courts would be restricted. That is exactly the same sort of provision that operated when the former Labor government implemented part 8 of the Migration Act which was designed to restrict the basis upon which review could be undertaken. So it is very important to understand that.Can I conclude my remarks by saying that one other case where it has been clear that the courts have had an impact is a matter I mentioned the other day and, in answer to this question, I would like to ideal with the im  pression that some people gained that the 1993 Federal Court decision of Fuduche directly related to the question of homesickness. What the decision in Fuduche did was to broaden the definition of other serious circumstances affecting the sponsor or family member or family unit in Australia by saying that the special need does not have to be medically based and that the heart of the provision should be given a broad and generous construction. The broadening provided a legal precedent which enabled tribunals to then include conditions such as homesickness as grounds for establishing special need.</DOC>

 - My role as Minister for Sport and Tourism is to find positions and points of view from the industry and to reflect them relevantly to the minister responsible. For every decision that affects one industry, there are several flow-on decisions to other industries. The Treasurer is the most important person or the key person in determining all of those issues. I have made representations to the Treasurer in an accurate manner of the decisions, and you should defer to the Treasurer on all tax issues.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. It is worth remind  ing the House on this matter of the Australian Youth Ambassadors for Development Program that the member for Parramatta has been promoting a scheme of this kind and has been one of the key influences leading to the establishment of the scheme. That is, policy development on this side and ruckus on that side. That is about it.The program was launched on 27 August. It is a program to send 500 young Australians to the countries of the Asia-Pacific, linking communities in Australia with communities in our region. The program is developing extremely well. We have had 680 young Australians apply for the first intake, and I am advised that those 680 applicants are of the very highest standard. Eighty young Australians have been selected for assignments overseas in February 1999, and they will be notified very shortly of their successful applications.The Australian Youth Ambassadors for Development Program is a very important component of building our engagement with the Asia-Pacific region. It is a way in which we will get young Australians to understand the region, to develop contacts in the region and to project the fine qualities of young Australians to the region and help the region understand our country. We have large numbers of young Australians showing interest in the program. Over the next two years something like 500 young Australians will participate in it. Frankly, I hope not only that the program will extend beyond the next two years - I am sure it will - but also that we will be able to build that program up beyond the current scale we have in mind.In answer to the last part of the honourable member's question about what young Australians should do to express an interest in participating in the program, they can get in touch with AusAID. It is through AusAID that applications can be made. I am happy to pass on later to the honourable member the appropriate telephone number and details and the web site. Of course, on this side of the House we are interested in the web site. On your side I should think only the member up the back would know about that.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Blair for his question. The fact is that prosperous small businesses mean jobs. When this government is in power and implementing our policy, that means jobs in the future. How do you create jobs? Good economic management is one of the first things you have to do. It is one of the things that this government has been providing. What else do you have to do? You have to get interest rates down. That is what this government has been doing and will continue to do. You have to get inflation down. That is what this government has been doing, and that means jobs.Then you have to get into the difficult issues, the major reform issues. This government has been active in franchising - a huge area in which we want to see small business prosper and create jobs. We introduced capital gains tax rollover relief. We have said to small business, `If you do well, we want you to keep more of what you earn.' We have introduced reforms in unfair dismissal. We want to go further. We have introduced general reforms to the Workplace Relations Act, all of which are aimed at producing jobs.We have introduced historic reforms, like reforms to the Trade Practices Act to protect small business, as recommended by the Reid committee in the last parliament. Not only have we done that; we are powering on with our agenda - tax reform, more IR reform,  more workplace relations reform, reform for small business so they can give young people jobs and keep young people in jobs. We also need to cut back on the red tape for small business. We have started that task. It is a long, hard task, but we have a plan - as we have in all these areas - to prosper small business and to create more jobs. That will see this economy do better in the future.I conclude by saying that we have a plan, because we know what to do. The other side basically has no plan, although in fairness to the new shadow minister, the member for Hunter, he said in his maiden speech - he said it; who wrote it would be another question, whether it was his wife or another member of his family:Competent management of the Australian economy is the most basic prerequisite for jobs growth in Australia.That is exactly right. I say to the member for Hunter that he ought to come down here and give a few of these ex-ACTU presidents a few simple messages about running the Australian economy.</DOC>

 - I have not seen any of the documents tabled in the Northern Territory parliament. I certainly do know Mr Textor, and I think you know him as well. Mr Textor has been a very competent and a very effective pollster for the Liberal Party of Australia. He is also, like any other person in that area, entitled to do other work.Any casual thumbing through the research records of the Hawke and Keating governments would find with stunning rapidity the company called ANOP, which of course was a very competent polling organisation owned and run by Mr Rod Cameron, for whose  polling expertise I had a considerable personal regard. It also had a large amount of government work in those days. - Having sort of prepared the ground, I say to those who sit opposite that I am advised that total propriety has been observed by this government in relation to those matters.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dunkley for his question, and I am looking forward very much to going down to Dunkley and to Frankston in particular to launch the national literacy standard online as part of Online Australia Day. Frankston is a particularly appropriate place in which to make this launch. It is a place with historic importance in many ways, particularly for the Labor Party.As we remember, Frankston was the place where the member for Werriwa as the then shadow minister for education was first handed the Labor Party education policy in the course of the election campaign. He had the opportunity, as he said, to read the policy for the first time on the way back from the policy launch. Indeed, he discovered at that time that there were a dozen spelling mistakes  in the policy. That was very quickly and easily dealt with because it was handed to the Victorian branch and Kim Carr to correct those literacy arbiters. If you are relying on the Victorian branch to set literacy standards, you have sunk a very long way indeed.Tomorrow I will be launching the year 3 and year 5 literacy benchmarks on the Internet as part of Online Australia Day. This is going to coincide with the launch last year of the Education Network Australia.This government has a great commitment to literacy and numeracy. When we came into office, we found that 30 per cent of young people in this country after 13 years of Labor could not read and write at an adequate standard. Since then, we have established Australia's first national literacy standard. This year almost every child in Australia in years 3 and 5 is being assessed against that standard. We will be able to determine exactly the scale of the issue which needs to be addressed, and we will address it because those literacy and numeracy skills were one of the main reasons why after 13 years of Labor youth unemployment was at such unacceptable levels.In the Pezzullo and Angley education policy issued by the Labor Party, literacy got five lines. That was the Labor Party's commitment to literacy and numeracy. There was no commitment to the national literacy standards. Literacy was to be handed back to the Australian Education Union so that, once again, they could take charge of what happened in the classroom, make sure that there was no proper accountability and continue to sacrifice young Australians. We have an absolute commitment to raising these standards in this country, and this launch tomorrow will confirm that commitment.</DOC>

 - The position on mergers of banks is very clear. We will not agree to any merger of existing Australian banks until there is greater competition in the banking system. Although there has been some increase in competition in the banking system, due to the enlightened reforms implemented by the Treasurer, we are still not satisfied that the level of competition is enough.Mr Speaker, let me simply make the point that the Australian banks occupy a very privileged position within our financial system but, as a result of the policies of the government, there has been a lot more competition in the home mortgage area. We would like to see that level of competition spread to the small business area. At the moment I can simply say that we do not see any public interest at all in allowing any mergers of the existing banks for the very simple reason that they are a long way short of providing the sort of competition that the Australian public requires.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I did see such a report in the Australian  newspaper on Friday under the headline `Health funds reap $300 million fee bonanza'. I thought this was a wonderful piece of subediting, and I am sure there are many corporations in Australia that make a loss that would like to have such a heading. I cannot actually find any health fund CEO who thinks they have had such a bonanza, and the figures in that report show quite clearly the true state of the industry.In a letter to the Australian newspaper - a copy of which has been sent to me - the Commissioner of PHIAC, the body whose report this story was based on, makes three points to show the overall situation. He starts off his letter by saying:Whilst it is accurate to claim that the growth in premium income to health funds during 1997/98 exceeded that of benefit payments this is not the complete picture and a number of important aspects have been overlooked, or ignored by your writer.These aspects are that, if you look at the 15-year period during which statistics have been kept, you will see that premiums have gone up 213 per cent and benefits have gone up 235 per cent. This is untenable in the long term. Over the last five years, premiums have gone up 15.6 per cent; benefits, 18.9 per cent - clearly underlying the fact that this is untenable. Last year was the first time in three years that health fund benefit growth had not actually outstripped the growth in premium increases.In the previous two financial years there were very substantial losses from the health funds of the order of $134 million in 1996-97 and $70 million in 1995-96. Last year was a better year but the health funds still lost around $11 million, or their net operating margin - if you just look at their core business - was a $6.6 million loss. So, in spite of a period of consolidation, the fact is the funds have gone from a $134 million loss to an $11 million loss. This is hardly a bonanza, though it does underline the importance of the incentives that we introduced in 1996. Had we not done this, another year of a $134 million loss would have seen many funds - hence, members with accrued benefits - go to the wall.The Commissioner of PHIAC also points out that last year funds reserves declined 2½ per cent. The reserves are the funds investment incomes. If they are making a bonanza, the reserves went up. You can hardly have a bonanza when the reserves go down. Finally, as I have mentioned, the net operating margin for the funds was actually a loss.The report also shows how unbalanced the funds are becoming. Last year, for the first time ever, more than half the funds benefits were paid out to people over 65 years of age. Eight years ago, in 1989-90, this was only 40 per cent. So it highlights the fact that the funds have a larger number of frail people who are drawing more heavily on it and not a large number of fitter, younger people - which is effectively anyone under 65 - to back this community rating. If nothing is done  about this, we have a very stark future ahead of us; that is, a system where health insurance is only for the privileged and the wealthy, such as in Britain, and we can expect the public hospitals to be like the national health service.</DOC>

 - Of course I have seen today's recent ABS trend data. The government has forecast in the 1998-99 budget that Australia's current account deficit would increase to $31 billion or 5¼ per cent of GDP. The balance on goods and services for the month of October released today reflects those forecasts. It also reflects the fact that we have strong domestic growth and it reflects the fact that in relation to prices, as a result of commodity prices generally, and in relation to the Asian downturn that prices are down.Of course, the current account deficit peaked at around six per cent of GDP in the mid-1980s, the late 1980s and the mid-1990s under Labor governments. In none of those circumstances - not in the mid-1980s, not in the late 1980s and not in the mid-1990s - was there an Asian downturn. The Labor Party peaked the current account deficit at six per cent of GDP during Asian booms. During Asian booms is when the Australian Labor Party peaked current account deficits. - That, as the Prime Minister said, must have taken a special kind of genius. In addition, Australia comes into  the Asian downturn and the consequent pressure in relation to exports and prices in a much stronger position because this government took the steps to put the foundations of the Australian economy in shape.We come into this not with a budget in deficit, not in a $10.3 billion Beazley deficit, which he sought to conceal, you will recall, but with a balanced budget, with low inflation and with a retiring debt program, which the Labor Party again wants to oppose. All the measures which are necessary to deal with Australia's savings like balanced budgets and retirement of debt have been opposed by the Australian Labor Party. The best thing that Labor could do would be to support the government's policy, which has given us strong foundations and which will strengthen the Australian economy in the future.</DOC>

 - The short answer to the question is yes and yes. - No, it will not be quite as easy as that. The slightly longer answer to the question is that we have a marvellous example of the balance that ought to be struck in the approach of the coalition government to the development of the Jabiluka mine. - Oh! A dramatic thrust - grammatical pronunciation is now the Labor Party's development policy. They have found a policy at long last! Congratulations to the Australian Labor Party. - This project will involve the creation of 1,000 jobs. It will generate revenue of more than $12,000 million, with over 85 per cent of that revenue staying in Australia. It will also provide royalties estimated to be worth over $200 million to local Aboriginal communities. It will be carried out under the strictest environmental safeguards.I would have thought that, if you have a project that creates 1,000 jobs, generates $12,000 million of income, 85 per cent of which stays in Australia and $200 million is going to the local Aboriginal communities, there might be a possibility it would attract the support even of the Australian Labor Party. I thought it might be a possibility - just a slim chance - that they might be interested in jobs for Australians, royalties for the indigenous people and export income for this nation.A moment ago the shadow Treasurer was up here complaining about and shedding crocodile tears over the current account deficit. If you want to fix the current account deficit, you ought to export more. There are two ways you can export more: you can support this project instead of opposing it and you can support the GST and take $4½ billion off exports. That is a way of supporting exports.Instead of supporting this project that will generate 1,000 jobs, will give $200 million in royalties to the Aboriginal people and will generate income of $12,000 million for this country over the expected life of the mine, in the face of all that, what does the Labor Party do? The Labor Party goes scuttling off to UNESCO via its spokesman on environmental matters with what I can only call a submission which is against the national interest which says:The conclusions of this submission are that the Australian government and the responsible ministers have made an unsustainable decision in permitting the uranium mine to proceed.Then the document concludes with a quite unqualified statement. You can always find an unqualified statement of what the Labor Party is against; you can never find an unqualified statement of what the Labor Party is in favour of. On page 8, this is what he has to say - and  this is a document written in the name of the Australian Labor Party and, therefore, has the personal endorsement of the Leader of the Opposition:The mine continues to be controversial and the ALP has opposed its development both in government and in opposition for a range of cultural and environmental reasons including the location of the mine within the boundaries of the area. The Australian Labor Party asks that the committee call for the immediate inscription of Kakadu on the world heritage endangered register on both cultural and environmental grounds.There you have the clearest possible statement by the Australian Labor Party. They are against 1,000 jobs. They are against $12,000 million of export income over the life of this mine. They are against $200 million of royalties going to the indigenous people of Australia. That opposition and that approach destroy the credibility of any Labor Party crocodile tears shed on issues related to the development of this country, employment or practical assistance to the indigenous people.</DOC>

 - That is a ridiculous question. What the Labor Party refuses to recognise - because it suits its purposes to refuse to recognise - is that the benchmark that all Australians must work from in respect of private health insurance is the trend terms of recent years. There has been a reduction in private health cover which, if it were not arrested, would clearly see those numbers go  down from the current level of 30.3 per cent to about 20 per cent. With the level of private health insurance cover at some 20 per cent, the taxpayers of Australia would be required to contribute $2.5 billion under the current Commonwealth-state health agreement. That is something this government is not prepared to stand by and let happen.This government recognises that a dual system is vitally important for the best health cover for all Australians and that is why we made the decision, which was clearly announced to the Australian people before the last election, to provide the 30 per cent rebate. We have indicated in this House what the assumptions led to in terms of the arrest of that decline and the fact that that will contribute to the dual system, which is vitally important and in the interests of all Australians in terms of health delivery.</DOC>

 - I am disappointed that the frontbench opposite seem to make a joke about these matters. -  - Today we had the release of the ABS export trade figures. They show exports up 1.4 per cent this month from the previous, exports up three out of the last four months and exports up three per cent for the 10 months of this year compared with the 10 months of last year, reflecting the massive diversification. -  - They would be up even more if you had not stuffed around on Jabiluka all these years. It seems the opposition is more interested in exporting jobs to Canada, than in giving them to Australian miners and workers in relation to uranium mining.In response to the question by the member for Mallee, it is true that I did make brief working and hectic visits to Uruguay, Argentina and Chile partly because of the inaugural Qantas flight now operating from Sydney to Buenos Aires, and that reflects the diversification of our service exports. Members would be interested to know that our trade is diversifying: Pivot fertiliser is now being exported to Brazil; the first ever beef shipment has gone to Uruguay; even leather products are going across to economies in South America, including products from Mick's Whips presented to the President of Chile and the President of Uruguay.The investment pattern is even more exciting. In addition to BHP and MIM, we now have Prime Television's direct interest in Channel 9 Argentina being successful. AGL gas has invested in Chile. P&amp;O terminals are successfully managing and boosting the efficiency of terminals in South America. Even Hoyts Cinemas is redeveloping complexes in Santiago. All of that means more dividends back here in Australia and, ultimately, a win-win situation.All of this, I hope, will be reflected in the National Export Awards taking place tomorrow night in Sydney, because our exporters deserve a gold medal for their performance in very difficult circumstances. Imports are at manageable levels partly because, through diversification, our exports are holding up extremely well in all the circumstances.</DOC>

 - The answer is very simple. There are a variety of reasons why we are trying to do this. We are making a philosophical statement that we wish to help people who are trying to help themselves. We believe in people making an effort for self-provision, and this is what they have substantially done with very great difficulty in taking out private health insurance. -  - The Leader of the Opposition is interjecting about his health fund paying for his tennis racquet. I have a hard time believing the Leader of the Opposition gets on the tennis court. Even if he does, he is seriously trivialising -  -  - I seem to remember you standing in this position saying a similar thing. - What the Leader of the Opposition does is trivialise the issue of what extras insurance does and it shows he clearly does not understand its place in the health care system. The fact is that extras insurance pays for a very substantial amount of dental treatment, physiotherapy, occupational therapy and psychological treatment. An overwhelming part of it is related to assistance for people in the broader expanse of their health care.Given that we are trying to cover people's health care costs and help them with their private insurance, this would seem to be eminently sensible. The final thing is that extras cover as a risk rated product is something that is in people's benefit if they have better access to those range of ancillary services. It will lead to better health outcomes. It seemed eminently sensible that we do so. Finally on the issue of this helping public hospitals or not, all you have to do is look at the state health ministers' own figures, because it is quite clear that they believe this would help state public hospitals. Peter Beattie, for example, in 1995 is on record in the Queensland newspapers saying, `Anyone knows, it is glaringly obvious that if you had more people in private health insurance you would take pressure off the state hospitals,' and that is absolutely correct.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Petrie for her question. I am aware of claims that the car industry will pass on lower price reductions than those estimated by the government in its tax package. Such claims were made by none other than the member for Hotham in this House on 12 November when he asked:Is the Treasurer aware that the spokesman for the car industry Mr Peter Sturrock has said that the industry will pass on significantly less than that?It takes a few days, but you can always run these falsehoods to ground. I have now had the opportunity to get hold of Mr Sturrock's speech. Mr Sturrock stated in his speech:. . . the abolition of the wholesale sales tax and the implementation of a value added component will result in a saving to the consumer of around six per cent.I think those on this side of the House would say, `Isn't that a good thing to be reducing prices by six per cent?' - The member for Hotham says, `Only six per cent, you are only reducing prices by six per cent,' as if this is some rather big point. The Labor Party is reducing prices on cars by how much? Zero per cent. The Labor Party wants to keep a wholesale sales tax. - On this side of the House, we would say even a six per cent reduction in the cost of motor vehicles was something to be welcomed. We oppose Labor's proposal to keep the cost of cars high.As Mr Sturrock makes entirely clear in his calculations, the six per cent saving is the difference between a wholesale sales tax and a value added tax. What Mr Sturrock does not do is he does not model into the price the abolition of other taxes that impact on motor car manufacturers - financial institutions duty abolished under the coalition, imposed by Labor; bank account debits taxes abolished under the coalition, imposed by Labor; stamp duties abolished under the coalition, imposed by Labor. It is entirely clear when you read his speech that he is talking about one change and one change only - wholesale sales tax and value added tax. Mr Sturrock then went on to say this:It is quite possible that the size of our market within five years will be between 850 and 950 thousand vehicles: quite enormous gains. No doubt the growth will be at least in part due to tax reforms now to be implemented by your Federal Government.So not only does it reduce the price but it is going to boost the volume and boost motor car manufacturing. We had jobs for Australians. How can you get nought out of three? The member for Hotham then gets up and asks about exports. Let me read to you what Mr Sturrock, the man he was misrepresenting in this place on 12 November, said:The impact of tax reform on international growth will be positive. According to government figures, cost reductions in the order of 3.9 per cent will be possible on goods which this industry sells offshore.Listen to this:For our burgeoning export industry now in its tenth successive growth year this is very good news. Industry exports in 1997 reached a record . . . Over  the 10 years exports have grown . . . Annual automotive exports of vehicles, engines and components will reach six billion by the year 2005. This will mean at least 100,000 Australian made vehicles will be exported annually, of great assistance to the nation's balance of payments.Precisely the point that the Prime Minister was making. Anybody who is interested in the balance of payments in this country will be supporting taking taxes off exports under the government's tax plan - $4.5 billion of taxes off exports - boosting Australian exports, dealing with the balance of payments, increasing jobs and getting those industries going. That is why this side of the House stands for tax reform. The no policy, policy free zone Australian Labor Party stands for higher export costs, fewer jobs and a worse balance of payments.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. CASA has released the Skehill investigation into the regulatory role of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority in relation to the South Pacific Seaplanes, following that unfortunate crash which all of us regret. The fact is that, so far as this matter is concerned, Mr Toller, the director of aviation safety, has taken certain actions. He has cancelled the air operator certificate of South Pacific Seaplanes and there have been certain staff changes and so forth.But, most importantly in relation to this matter, BASI, the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation, is looking at the direct factors which led to the accident - the systems and related causes behind them - as well as safety  oversight arrangements. It will be giving me a complete report early next year.

 - If you wish to look at the Rehame analysis of talkback last week, it is certainly not the government who is catching up. The effects are sixfold. The first is that there would be a direct effect on the Commonwealth budget and there would be extra compensation for the states under the provisions that trigger an $83 million increase in funding every year that one per cent of private people drop out of private health insurance. This will be $2.5 billion of funding over the life of this agreement. The second effect will be that this will feed into the base funding for the next agreement from 2003 to 2008. We could expect the base funding to rise $5 billion one-off just because of this measure for the next health agreement.The third effect is that, if we followed the long-term decline trend, which it would be expected, with the 20 per cent rate we would lose 1.9 million Australians out of health insurance over the lifetime of this health care agreement. That would mean about 3.7 million people only. The fourth effect is that this would then have a direct effect on hospital bed days. When the Commonwealth, state and territory health ministers some years ago commissioned work to try to determine the effect of dropout of private health insurance on bed day utilisation, it was estimated that every half million people who dropped their private health cover led to 322,000 extra bed days. This would mean that 1.2 million extra bed days would be required in five years  time - 3,300 extra hospital beds. A large major teaching hospital is a bit under 500 beds, so you are looking at five to six extra public hospitals.The fifth effect is that public hospital revenue would drop by about $1 billion and the sixth effect is that the health funds who are currently doing their arrangements for the next financial year would have to go back to the drawing board. So rather than having premium increases in an increasing market, they would be looking at premium increases in a declining market. On this basis we can expect the increases would come earlier and would be higher than they would otherwise be.Finally, in response to the puerile interjections over the road, the fact is that we would still be facing a further dropout. All we would have done is treat the symptoms; we would not treat the cause root of the problem - which you are incapable of grasping.</DOC>

 - I do not think I have much to add. I will await BASI's full report. It is a very respected institution. The fact of the matter is that at this stage only the executive summary has been handed to me. -  - If you are really concerned about air safety, you will accept that BASI is conducting a full inquiry into the whole matter. It will report to me shortly next year and further action, if required, will be taken from that point on.The point has already been made that SPS's licence has already been cancelled and action has been taken against those people who might have been regarded as having performed inadequately, and certain other personnel have left voluntarily. Until such time as BASI's full report is available, I think we can rest assured that appropriate action is being taken in the meantime.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. A press release was issued on the weekend from the Queensland Minister for Tourism, Sport and Racing, Mr Gibbs. Mr Gibbs said in his press release that he just returned from leading a Queensland government delegation attending the 27th General Assembly of European Olympic Committees in St Petersburg, Russia, between 12 and 14 November, which I suppose is nice work if you can get it! Mr Gibbs said that, while he was in St Petersburg, he noticed that there was certain interest in Australia. According to Mr Gibbs:The Howard government's plans to introduce a goods and services tax before the Sydney Olympics had received a hostile reception from delegates in St Petersburg.I thought that was pretty interesting because, when I consulted the Coopers and Lybrand's survey of consumption taxes for 1997, I found out that not only does St Petersburg have a GST, but Mr Gibbs was paying it all the time he was in Russia receiving complaints. When Mr Gibbs went to Russia, he would have been paying, under Russian law, a 20 per cent value added tax on all goods and services but only a reduced rate in Russia of 10 per cent on various staple food products. Here is Mr Gibbs, courtesy of the Queensland taxpayer, sitting up and shovelling 20 per cent out to the Russian government under a value added tax and saying, `Wouldn't it be a terrible thing if there were a GST in Australia.'Mr Gibbs said that, as a result of his negotiations, he thought he could get people from Germany, France, Switzerland, Poland, the Netherlands, Romania, the Czech Republic, Israel, Spain and Russia out to Australia to engage in pre-Olympic training, although he said delegates had privately admitted that they may have to reconsider it in the light of a GST. Let us think about who has the GST: Germany, yes; France, yes; Switzerland, yes; Poland, yes; the Netherlands, yes; Romania, yes; the Czech Republic, yes; Israel, yes; Spain, yes; and Russia. Every single one of the countries that Mr Gibbs wants to bring out to Australia has a GST. According to Mr Gibbs, they are now reconsidering their plans if Australia follows suit.You would have to be a mug to say that, when our athletes go to Germany, France, Switzerland, Poland, the Netherlands, Romania, the Czech Republic, Israel, Spain and Russia, and when Mr Gibbs goes to Russia, those countries can get visitors to their country to pay taxes and reduce the tax burden on their own population, but the only country in the world that is not allowed to do that is Australia. The poor old Aussie taxpayer has to give a free kick to everybody else charging them value added taxes when they go into their country and pick up the tab. That is Labor policy.Labor policy is to slug the battler and give the international visitor a tax-free go in Australia. This side of the parliament will stick up for Australians. We will make sure that the Aussie gets a fair deal, that the Aussie who pays taxes overseas gets a fair deal from overseas people who come into Australia as well.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I certainly thank him for his interest in the plight of the wool industry in Australia today. I am aware of some commercial arrangements that have been undertaken. I have had discussions with some of the financial institutions that undertook those arrangements. We have discussed the implications of the government's policy that we have announced and implemented so far. Those financial institutions have been satisfied with that. I will make one point: we will not, as a government, see anybody disadvantaged out of these arrangements. I took the opportunity early in the piece to talk to the financial institutions that had provided cover for wool growers in Australia.It should be also noted that the value of their equity in the wool stockpile since the government made its decision, and announced it and introduced legislation through the  parliament a week or so ago - which is in the Senate now - has increased. Those financial institutions also recognise that. So yes we are cognisant of those elements. It is a very serious issue.The shadow minister will also be aware of a very important meeting taking place in Goulburn today about the future of the wool industry. Our government takes very seriously its responsibility in terms of facilitating the management of the future directions of the wool industry in Australia because it will have a dramatic effect, as it always has had, on our economy generally. We certainly will do that. I will leave it there. It is a serious situation and I have addressed a number of those concerns.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Blair for his question. I appreciate that such a sensible question comes from the member for Blair. I know some of the other candidates during the election did not have such sensible ideas as the member for Blair.From time to time, Chinese commentators have criticised alliance arrangements in the region, including the US alliance in the region. There is nothing new in those comments; they are made fairly frequently. The Australian government's position is that we have had a longstanding alliance relationship with the US, as indeed has Japan and the Republic of Korea. We regard the relative stability that our region has enjoyed in recent years as being partly as a result of the strong alliance relationships that exist in the region. If those alliance arrangements were to be swept away overnight, that would be a seriously destabilising factor in the region as a whole.With the Chinese, we work on a number of other arrangements. In particular, there is the ASEAN regional forum, where both Australia and China are very active and engaged participants. There are a number of different levels to the region's security architecture. But it has been this government's view and the view of successive Australian governments for a long time that the alliance arrangements we and others have with the United States remain an important component of the security architecture of the region.The Chinese government is aware that that is our view. It is aware that that view is shared by most of the other governments of the region. Whilst we do not agree on that matter, we do agree on a wide range of other important security issues. We have been able to discuss and agree on these issues from time to time in bilateral discussions with China.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. I do not think there is any doubt that, if the Labor Party's legislation remains on the books, in June 2000 a lot of young people will lose their jobs. I will give the House an explanation of why that is the case. This is the government's submission to the junior rates inquiry. It has contained within it a fairly typical award in the retail industry. It is for shop employees in the ACT. It is the award in 1996.If you are less than 17 and today employed under that award, you will receive 60 per cent of the adult wage - namely, $259.10 per  week. If Labor's policy is not prevented from being implemented - in other words, if our legislation does not pass - in June 2000, that young person will receive a wage increase of $172.70 per week to $431.80. They will get a pay increase of 67 per cent. Do you know what the Labor Party says? They say that if you increase a 16-year-old's pay by $170 per week it will make no difference. They say that not one job will be lost across the country and that it will be immaterial to the job prospects of young people. This is absolutely nonsensical. This is ideology before the jobs of young people.McDonald's employs a lot of young people. One of my sons had a job with McDonald's. There are literally tens of thousands of young people who have had a job with McDonald's. They have learnt the basics about working. They have taken it as the first step in their careers, whatever they might be. Julie Owens, the head of In Work Force, said this week that they have a 50,000-strong work force which would be decimated if junior wages are abolished in June 2000. The Daily Telegraph says of junior wage rates:The value to young people is psychological as well as financial. It creates a work ethic. Experience in the work force at any level creates confidence, a sense of achievement and a stepping stone to the next level of employment.In other words, this is a scheme that works for young people to get a job. The Labor Party is set and absolutely determined to ruin that scheme and to see the end of it in the year 2000. 	 To conclude, the member asked me what alternative policies there are. The fact is that there are no alternative policies. If you ask the Labor Party, they say, `We're going to oppose the legislation when it's introduced.' The shadow minister says that in one breath. When he is asked, `What is your position on it?' he says, `We actually haven't had our caucus discussion about it, so I guess I should try and wait until the party has a meeting on it.' You have had 13 years to work out your position on this. - A lot of young people will lose their jobs as a result. The Courier Mail  summed it up very well recently in an editorial. Its title was `Labor has no plan for the future'. It said:A decade ago, the then Treasurer, Paul Keating, was fond of saying that good policy made good politics. Today's Labor has not only lost sight of this truth; it no longer believes it.</DOC>

 - I think we need to bear in mind that the Miriuwung Gajerrong decision, while a very important one, is probably going to be appealed. I say `probably' without knowing that any individual party has in fact formed an intention to appeal, but it does raise new issues that need to be addressed by the justice system. I strongly suspect that there will be an appeal. Whether the Commonwealth will be an intervener in the appeal will depend upon what the issues are. The member's question was no doubt prompted by speculation in the media over the weekend as to how much the compensation for extinguishment of native title rights in relation to this claim would be. I am not aware of any proposal for that to occur in any sense. On that basis, I think we can leave it as speculation as it was in the media.</DOC>

 - I thank my friend the member for Wentworth for his question. In the course of extensive consultations, a number of Job Network members have reported that some job seekers are failing to make the most of the system. They are either failing to register for job matching or, more importantly, they are not turning up for jobsearch training after referral from Centrelink. The government is considering refinements to the system including measures to ensure that job seekers on benefit make full use of the services available to them. Society has an absolute right to expect that job seekers on benefit will be actively seeking work, and that means making full use of the Job Network.I would have thought that that principle was commanding of such universal assent that it would hardly be worth restating - that is, until I saw a notice of motion from Senator Stott Despoja which noted with grave concern a report that the unemployed will be forced to seek assistance from the Job Network under threat of losing their income. I was very concerned about this lest other people had the same view. I was reassured to find support from members opposite. No less an authority than the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, when in government, said:What we are proposing is extra obligations on the part of those receiving the benefits to take them up. If they refuse a reasonable offer, they will be taken off benefits.That is what one half of the ACTU parliamentary team said. The other half, the member for Batman, said:The government is prepared to assist in finding work - that is correct; the government is prepared to assist - but it means people must front up to their own responsibilities.That is what the member for Batman said, and he is absolutely right. That is what the government is going to ensure happens.Senator Stott Despoja's outrage is of fairly recent origin. She herself said just last year:I do not believe that anyone in this place disputes the notion that has been talked about today of mutual obligation.Any idea that this government is scapegoating job seekers is completely wrong. This government is determined to ensure that people on newsearch take jobsearch seriously. A small minority who do not take it seriously taint a much larger number who do. When we do bring down a series of refinements to the system, the House will find that these are in the broad mainstream of Australian policy.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. The benefits are very considerable. They would certainly flow to people in the vast area that he represents in a way that, not surprisingly, makes them very  attractive indeed. For example, the government has committed itself to some $70 million over five years to put rural transaction centres into approximately 500 small country towns. Those centres will provide services like personal banking, postal services, fax and phone services and Medicare Easyclaim. In the future, it could even look at providing services like Centrelink and various other medical information lines.The amount of $150 million will be allocated over three years to abolish Telstra's pastoral call rate and to provide untimed local calls in extended zones in remote areas. This will benefit nearly 40,000 Australian households in some of the most remote parts of the country. An additional $81 million will be provided over three years to the Regional Telecommunications Infrastructure Fund. That will help us do a whole range of things, such as provide $20 million to the telecommunications needs of remote and isolated island communities, $25 million to upgrade to 100 per cent continuous coverage of mobile phones on many of our national highways, $36 million to increased Internet points of presence, and local call Internet access points. Also, $120 million over five years will be allocated to establish a television fund to extend coverage of SBS television and to eliminate a surprising number of television black spots where, even in 1998, people still cannot get television reception.To that must be added a $250 million boost to the Natural Heritage Trust, which is an outstanding innovation of the Howard-Fischer government and is very much wanted in rural Australia. I make this final point: if only my opposite number would go out into the bush and have a look, she might find out why these initiatives are needed and why they are very popular. Perhaps the cat has been well and truly belled by her previous colleague Senator Woodley when he said on ABC radio, `Cheryl was always telling me to stay out of the bush because she didn't think there were any votes there.' I am sure that is quite right: she ought to stay away from the bush.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Sturt for his question. As he would be aware, and I think all members that follow tax issues would be aware, the wholesale sales tax is an outmoded, outdated system which is not relevant to modern-day Australia or the kind of tax system that we want to build for the future. This can be evidenced by recent rulings. The tax office recently issued a ruling in relation to general purpose road vehicles, which goes to 36 pages, deciding whether or not they are exempt. According to this ruling, after 36 pages, it is an exempt vehicle if it goes across a road from one property to another, but is not an exempt vehicle if it goes down a road from one property to another. That gives new meaning to the question: `Why did the general purpose road vehicle cross the road?' Answer: `Because it wanted to preserve its sales tax exemption.' - I hear the Leader of the Opposition vociferously interjecting. This is the Labor tax - the wholesale sales tax. This is what they are fighting to preserve. We recently had another ruling on classifying frozen yoghurt. Under Labor's wholesale sales tax all goods are subject to tax unless it is in an exemption for food, but ice-cream is an exemption from an exemption because it is confectionary. And the tax office has now decided that frozen yoghurt is an exemption from the exemption from the exemption from the act. This required the tax office, to administer Labor's wholesale sales tax, to try to define what frozen yoghurt was. The tax office said this:To be frozen yoghurt, the primary constituent must be yoghurt within the meaning given to that term by the tribunal in the Xerox case. To be frozen yoghurt, it is expected that the manufacturer would be able to provide scientific data showing that the primary constituent was yoghurt. Other ingredients added to the yoghurt base must have been for the purpose only of sweetening, flavouring or emulsifying so that the resulting product might be frozen and made ready for sale. The final product must retain some of the distinctive acidic taste of yoghurt, an indicator of which would be a pH of around 4.5. So now we have to have people putting litmus paper into frozen yoghurt, looking for a pH of 4.5. The tax office goes on to say:There must be, or must have been before freezing, a significant presence of live culture in the final product.You have to melt it down, see if there was live culture before the freezing. If there was, then it comes in the exemption to the exemption to the exemption to the Labor sales tax act.Tomorrow this government is going to introduce legislation to sweep away Australia's antiquated and outdated tax system. Tomorrow we are going to introduce a bill called the abolition of sales tax bill. We are going to give the Labor Party the opportunity to vote against the abolition of sales tax so they can stand in this parliament behind the tax which they really love: the wholesale sales tax. They can explain to the House why we should have tax inspectors putting litmus paper in frozen yoghurt, why we should be looking for live cultures to get the exemption to the exemption to the exemption, why we should have a system where a good gets one treatment if it goes across a road and another if it goes down a road, so Labor can show what a modern party it is in facing the future with Jim Scullin's 1930s tax system.</DOC>

It is headed up by a highly competent director of aviation safety. He has undertaken certain actions, as I indicated in here yesterday, in response to this report. - I will come to that. I have indicated that I want a fuller response from him - a total response from CASA - to be released in mid-January and then tabled in the parliament concurrently with BASI's investigation, which is an extraordinarily important investigation into this unfortunate incident as well. At that time, if there are no compelling reasons to do otherwise, I will release the Skehill report as well.I had the executive summary last week.

 - I am very happy to answer the question by the member for Corangamite. Firstly, I point out that the government has extended national interest cover under the Export Finance Insurance Corporation arrangements to important regional markets such as Korea and Indonesia. We have taken these additional steps ahead of the game to facilitate, amongst other things, Australian Wheat Board exports during this particular summer. Secondly, we are opening additional TradeStart offices. One will be in Toowoomba in the electorate of the member for Groom, and another will be in Bundaberg in the electorate of the member for Hinkler as part of a roll-out of TradeStart offices across rural and regional Australia.Thirdly, the Supermarket to Asia, under the chairmanship of the Prime Minister, saw last week the launch of the FoodConnect web page whereby, through the Internet, sales are being made just in time to the hotel market of Asia and beyond in a very successful way. I welcome Australia's ambassador to the Philippines and our Philippines visitors to the House on this occasion. That is one market where we are making real progress. We are making progress in market negotiations, with the abolition of a beef quota into the Philippines and a reduction of tariffs from 30 to 20 to 10 per cent on both beef and flavoured milk over the next couple of years.Fourthly, I announce that we have decided to appoint a senior DFAT officer, Allan McKinnon, to the position of market access facilitator for the agricultural sector, in addition to Graeme Thomson's work with the processed food sector. Fifthly, we have tax reform, about to be introduced by the Treasurer tomorrow, which will greatly facilitate our export effort and impose a GST on our imports but abolish sales tax and give a $4½ billion boost to our exporters at just the right time.As a result of some of these steps, our exports are holding up very well. Wine exports to Japan are up 170 per cent; pork exports are up 60 per cent over the eight months to August; more beef is going into  Korea - just to nominate some - and citrus fruit and juice exports to the USA rose almost 100 per cent from $19 million to $35 million last financial year. More sugar is going into the Philippines, and I welcome that along with a range of other breakthroughs, some of which will be detailed at the national export awards being presented in Sydney tonight. It is an outstanding effort, but there can be absolutely no complacency. -  - The frontbench of the opposition, this vacuum of an opposition, can joke about our export effort. We are getting on with the job.</DOC>

 - Let me emphasise that this was a report commissioned by CASA, responsibly I think, into their operational matters. They commissioned it. It is a report to the board, the board which is elected by us. -  -  - The fact of the matter is that there is a further very significant inquiry under way by BASI which will be made public. It is the one which will determine whether further action is required by the minister and the government. In terms of the executive summary, it made it quite plain that the areas that needed to be focused on by CASA in the immediate future were narrowed down to one or two specific actions which have been taken by CASA. I am satisfied with the quality of those actions.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Kooyong for his question. If these assertions have been made by the shadow minister for health -  - The Treasurer asks me, are they right? Not only are they not right; they are not even consistent with what she herself said in a report that she wrote in 1991, or chaired anyway. On page 160 of the report, Hospital services in Australia: access and financing , issues paper No. 2, the shadow minister said:If increased funding to public hospitals reduces the perceived pressure on public hospitals through smaller waiting lists and shorter waiting times, it is likely that private health insurance levels will drop. This could result in increased demand for public hospitals and reduced revenue from private patients.Of course, consistency is not something we expect, and we could dismiss that, except we look to some people in the Labor Party who actually have to run hospital systems. The Labor Premier of New South Wales, Bob Carr, in 1997 said:As fast as we hurled money at the hospitals, there was a further abandonment of private health cover and a further rise in demand on the public system.Peter Beattie, then Labor health minister and currently Labor Premier, on 4 October 1995 said:It is an unarguable fact that, if more people took out private health insurance, it would alleviate the burden on the public health system.Further, a study that I mentioned yesterday done for health ministers that started in 1993 - about the same time that the shadow minister was chairing the National Health Strategy - came out with the figures of 507,000 people in a 15-month period dropping out of private health insurance putting a 322,000 extra public hospital bed days of pressure on the system. In fact, it could possibly be worse than this, and this was recognised by Graham Richardson. In his discussion paper, Reform of private health insurance , he said:It - the drop-out from private health insurance - is not an immediate problem as those who have dropped out are mostly young and healthy. However, as time goes on, an increasing number of older high users of health services will have to give up their insurance. These are people who do not currently use the public system much or at all. Should they come to rely on it, money and resources will have to be found to provide for them.So there you have it - the Labor Party's own discussion document from 1993, Peter Beattie from 1995, Bob Carr from 1997 and the shadow minister from 1991.</DOC>

 - I certainly agree that the matter has had a fair hearing. The fact of the matter is that CASA is the body that is charged with responsibility for air safety in this country. I am satisfied with the actions that have been taken by the director of civil aviation. Further reviews are well and truly under way and will be fully tabled in this place. I believe that that is an adequate course of action at this point in time. In fact, I find it very concerning that it would appear that there is a willingness on the other side of the House to go out on a limb to imply that people who travel by air in Australia somehow cannot have confidence in the appropriate authority. - The fact of the matter is that those people who are identified as having possibly failed in their responsibilities in this matter have been moved aside or are otherwise no longer employed in the positions that they were in. - Because that was made openly public at the press conference held by the director of civil aviation last week.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for New England for his question. Obviously, it is an issue of great concern to both him and a lot of his constituents. He is representing an electorate that is one of the finest fine wool growing areas of Australia. Yesterday's AGM of AWRAP was a very significant meeting in terms of the history of the Australian wool industry. It probably marks a bit of a turning point in terms of attitude and how the industry is managed and run.Members should be aware that the motion of no confidence in the board did get up, with  74 per cent of the wool taxpayers that were registered to vote at the meeting supporting the no confidence motion. That results in an almost immediate end of the tenure of the existing board. Under the legislation I am required to appoint a new chairman within 30 days, which I will do. In the meantime, the Managing Director of AWRAP will undertake that responsibility in a caretaker role until such time as a new chairman is appointed.More importantly, I have announced earlier today that I am going to establish a future directions task force for the wool industry to undertake a benchmarking study of wool against its competitor fibres and review the structures for wool marketing, promotion, research and development in Australia. It is a very serious issue, Mr Speaker, as you will no doubt be aware. I think it is incumbent upon the government - indeed this entire parliament - to take this issue very seriously. The wool industry has been at the centre as one of our great agricultural industries. We have to ensure that it has a viable and sustainable future. I certainly intend to do that.We need to end the uncertainty within the industry. We need to give growers more choice and we need to provide growers with more control over how their wool tax dollars are spent. I want the future directions task force that I am establishing - and I will announce the membership of it in a short period of time - to look at the future of the wool industry and where it should be going, not to look at the past and not to rake over old coals.It was a significant meeting that was held yesterday. I understand that it was extremely well attended. The debate went on into the night last night. The result of the debate was announced at about 11 o'clock this morning. Our government certainly intends to take positive action in partnership with the industry to ensure a viable and sustainable future for Australia's wool industry.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. The simple fact is that the government has no control over the equity in the stockpile, because we do not control commodity prices. On two occasions since the freezing of the stockpile there has been an immediate reaction in the marketplace in terms of a lift in the price of wool. When the freeze of the stockpile was first announced by cabinet earlier this year, there was an immediate reaction upwards in the price of wool. - The member for Corio has asked his question. - Then we went into the process of the federal election, and there was a hiatus period while that election was undertaken. After the election result was known, when we won the election, we reconfirmed -  - Thank you, Mr Speaker. Immediately following the outcome of the election - when we won the election and the coalition was re-elected - we reconfirmed our commitment to the freeze of the stockpile and also confirmed that we would immediately be introducing legislation into this place as soon as the parliament was sworn in and sat. That happened in the very first week. That legisla  tion has been through the House of Representatives and is now in the Senate. Hopefully, it will pass through the Senate this week. But the fact still remains that nobody in this place controls commodity prices - that is in the marketplace. The point I will reconfirm is that on two occasions, particularly after the election when we introduced the legislation, there was an upward turn in the price of the commodity again. I said yesterday in an answer to the honourable member's question that that in itself has increased the equity in the stockpile of wool growers, and wool growers recognise that fact. What the wool industry needs is security and certainty about the future of where it is going, and our government is providing it.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. As a member representing a seat that is vitally interested in the sugar industry, he will be pleased to know that we have announced and allocated an extra $13.45 million for sugar research and development over four years. The funding is to help boost sugar content levels. The issue that the member raises has been a very serious issue in North Queensland. The problems of low sugar content have arisen mainly in North Queensland and have reduced the profitability of the industry. The industry is quite concerned about the assistance that it may be able to be provided from government for the R&amp;D that needs to be undertaken to address this issue. The SRDC has recently submitted for my approval an additional $2.6 million worth of programs to address these profitability issues, with an  initial focus on North Queensland. I can assure the honourable member that the approval of the proposed program will be fast-tracked to ensure that the R&amp;D activity can commence early next year.It is vitally important to one of Australia's great exporting industries that we address these issues. The House will be interested to know that some of those issues that will be dealt with in these R&amp;D programs include an integrated management of weevil borers, which are a significant problem in North Queensland, and also the eradication of the grey-backed cane grubs in the Burdekin and Innisfail areas. -  - No, I was thinking more in terms of we are accounting for a number of the members opposite. - This is further evidence of the government's absolute commitment to the secure future of the Australian sugarcane industry, particularly in North Queensland.</DOC>

 - In answer to the honourable member for Hotham, foreign debt is obviously not the first priority of the Labor Party, because it has taken 34 minutes for the Labor Party to ask a question. -  - There are quite a lot of things that can be said about foreign debt. The most relevant thing that can be said about foreign debt is that today's debt servicing ratio - in other words, the capacity of this  nation to service its foreign debt - now stands at a figure of 9.8 per cent. That is less than half of what it was in September 1990. It is the first time that the debt servicing ratio has been below 10 per cent since September 1984. In other words, it is the lowest debt servicing ratio in 14½ years. - That is an indication of the capacity of the 1998 Australian economy to repay foreign debt. When you were in government not only was foreign debt at very high levels, but also the capacity of this country to service that debt was far less than what it is now. The measure of our economic strength in the context of foreign debt is the capacity of this nation to service that foreign debt. -  - The strength of the Australian economy is demonstrated every day. It is no idle boast to say that the Australian economy is now without doubt -  - The Australian economy is the economically strong economy of the Asia-Pacific region. On every count the economic performance of this country, despite the attempts of the Labor Party to talk it down -  -  - The member for Hotham, as well as asking about foreign debt, also asked about the current account deficit. I am glad that he asked me about the current account deficit, because in June 1995 I asked the now Leader of the Opposition a question about the current account deficit. That is when it approached 6.6 per cent of gross  domestic product. That is a lot higher than it is now. Do you know what he said in reply? He said:You have asked for our approach. Absolutely, we will give you our approach. Our approach is to produce budget surpluses . . .That was on 21 June 1995. It was only eight months before he infamously deceived the Australian people in the 1996 federal election campaign, when he went the length and breadth of the Commonwealth with the then Prime Minister swearing on a stack of Bibles that the Australian budget was in surplus.The reality is that the Labor Party has no credibility on economic management. We have turned the fortunes of the Australian economy around. I was proud to go to Kuala Lumpur as the Prime Minister of a nation whose economic credentials are widely respected not only in our region but throughout the world.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. Today is World AIDS Day. The theme for today is young people as a force for change. With respect to HIV-AIDS there is mixed news. A recent report from UN AIDS suggested that in some parts of the world, notably Zimbabwe and Botswana, 25 per cent of the population is now HIV positive. In some regions in Zim  babwe, it goes as high as 40 per cent. That is something I find particularly frightening.Australia has had recognised success in dealing with the epidemic that stretches over a decade. We are well placed to help both technically and professionally. Our aid program was only $2 million for HIV-AIDS in 1990-91. In the next financial year, it will be $20 million, most of that spent in the Asia-Pacific region.The good news, though, is that treatments are far more effective than they ever have been before. The number of people living with HIV in Australia is about 11,100. Of those, about 430 a year progress to AIDS. The latest treatments are able to delay that progression. In fact, since the end of 1995 and the beginning of 1996, it has been estimated that 530 Australians have been prevented from progressing to AIDS from just being HIV positive by the new treatments. This comes at a cost. But as we cannot successfully treat AIDS, the prevention of the progression is the best thing that we can possibly do.One of the things about trying to treat HIV is actually measuring the load of the virus in the body. That enables us to titrate the treatment against the known viral load. Viral load testing is something that we funded 18 months ago.In the budget in 1997, the government announced that it was setting up the Medical Services Advisory Committee, a new body. It would mean that new items on the Medicare schedule would be listed on the basis of independent scientific advice, not ministerial discretion. I am pleased to say that the Medical Services Advisory Committee has looked at the issue of viral load testing and advised me that we should actually increase the number of viral load tests that are allowed per year to better manage HIV. For people who are having their cerebrospinal fluid tested because of cerebral HIV, we will effectively have unlimited testing. This again is a measured approach that should give the country some optimism.</DOC>

 - I have not seen the report and I suggest that the member for Hotham has not either, because credit unions did not release the report. What they released was what they said were the results of the report. -  - No. It was not even an executive summary, I am afraid. It was a document drawn up by the credit unions which contained what they said was one table from the report. I am quite happy to see that report, because I would very much like to go through the methodology. - I would very much like to go through the methodology and help the credit unions with their assessment.In relation to red-hot competition, I think today the credit unions, for the first time, get the right to issue cheques under legislation which this government introduced. Labor was in power in 1983, 1984, 1985, 1986, 1987, 1988, 1989, 1990, 1991, 1992 and 1993 - there was not one bill in any one of those years to give credit unions access to the chequeing system. This side of politics had to do it. This side of politics had to give credit unions the right to issue cheques.This side of politics has also set up opportunities for credit unions to come into a national scheme of prudential regulation. Labor did not do that in 1983, 1984, 1985, 1986, 1987, 1988, 1989, 1990, 1991, 1992 or 1993. Thirteen wasted years; 13 years of nothingness. This government gets elected and it begins introducing significantly improved  competition, giving credit unions opportunities which they have never had before. So let the responsibility lie where it lays. This is the side of politics that has given credit unions the opportunity to compete, and we were pleased to do it.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. The interesting point about that is, if you look at the forward estimates over the life of the last government, the three years 1996, 1997 and 1998, Labor had planned to increase health spending by $1.4 billion. The fact is that the result of what we ended up doing in our first term of government was increase spending by $2 billion. But the extra money went to areas such as an extra $830 million into state public hospitals as part of the negotiated Commonwealth-state health care agreements; $150 million for full cost purchasing of veterans' entitlements, something the Labor Party promised to do but forgot to put in the forward estimates and we had to fund; and $300 million for the private health insurance incentives scheme. If you look at the mix of resources and additional resources that we put in, the fact is we exceeded what the Labor Party had hoped to do in their wildest dreams and, in exceeding it, we had done it by specifically supporting and aiding the public hospital system.</DOC>

 - My attention has not been drawn to those comments. I have to say that I would be surprised because it is completely at odds with what the Premier has said over the last two months. The fact is that we had extensive negotiations with the Victorian government. The Victorian government took a lead in bringing the other state governments on board. The Victorian government said that what we were doing was more than adequate to meet their needs. The Victorian government has been running full-page advertisements in Victorian newspapers extolling the virtues of the new health care agreement. I cannot see how he could say that we are not meeting our obligations. It would appear to be completely contrary to everything we have ever heard in the last two months.The second point is that the government gave a commitment before the 1996 election that we would keep Medicare in its entirety. We have kept that commitment. We reaffirmed that commitment in our election policy in 1998. We believe in a mixed system where there is public provision and private provision, unlike the Labor Party who wants to see the British National Health Service in Australia.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and his concern. This is a difficult area. The provision of the genetically engineered human growth hormone, also known as somatotropin, has been provided to people generally of short stature and in the case of renal failure in such people. That happened a couple of years ago under a special section of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. It was done on the advice of a number of paediatric endocrinologists on the best available evidence at the time.What has happened subsequent to that is that the evidence that has flowed through has not confirmed that there is solid scientific research to back up its use in renal failure. Our pharmaceutical benefits system is a world-leading system, but it is very solidly based on scientific evidence. I get lots of requests from time to time for certain drugs to be on the PBS. I do not have that discretion myself. I have to take the advice of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee, a body of independent experts.The Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee said that, given there was not the scientific evidence to back up its use, it should be removed from the PBS from 1 January 1999. I was concerned about this. So what I have done is given the company another 12 months - until 1 January 2000 - to come up with the scientific evidence that it is in fact effective in the condition for which it is used. If that evidence is not forthcoming after 1 January 2000, we will not require people currently on human growth hormone to go off it. It will only apply to new people who would have used it for that condition.I understand how sensitive this is. I understand the anxiety of families. I will do everything I can to assist the company to come up with the evidence. I would assure the honourable member that anyone who is currently on human growth hormone will not be forced to go off it for financial reasons.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Page for his question. Being a former Minister for Agriculture in New South Wales, he is obviously interested in the support programs that our government is providing the farming sector. As part of the AAA package that was announced by our government in our last term, we are going to provide $50 million over four years for the FarmBis program, which is about promoting a positive approach to change across the farm sector and improving the skills base of the farming community. It will assist all those involved in the management of the farm business to build their existing skills and improve the performance of their farm businesses.It is all about benchmarking to make sure that they are up to world standards as far as the operation of their farms is concerned. It has been welcomed by the farming community as a positive approach to improve the skills base of the farming community. The assistance will be provided by way of direct financial contribution towards the cost of training activities. FarmBis is a cooperative matching agreement between the Commonwealth and state governments. It is another one of the  initiatives that our government has introduced to ensure an ongoing, viable and sustainable farm sector in Australia.</DOC>

 - This question is from the supposed spokesperson for a party which planned to slash university research funding in its policy put out during the last election campaign. The implication of the Labor Party's election policy - the Pezzullo and Angley policy, the policy that the member for Werriwa dissociated himself from - was to cut research funding in Australia by $90 million and spend some of that money on some of the favourite schemes of the National Union of Students. It is a good thing that they have the member for Werriwa on the back bench now, working out what a decent policy might look like. In fact, he says, `I'm planning a follow-up book.' So I do not want to upset the delicate policy petals on the front bench. - The question was about research and research policy. I was just referring to the delicate policy petals on the front bench of the Labor Party. - There is no secret plan, and I will not be commenting on any speculative comments that may or may not have appeared in the press. The government is deeply committed to quality research in Australia, and any policies that we do announce and become public will be designed to lift the quality of Australian research.</DOC>

 - I thank the magnificent member for Robertson. - He took on the New South Wales Right with all its might and he is back here with much renewed vigour. - We have two very important initiatives I want to talk about in question time today which help our veteran community. I preface my remarks by saying that all our veterans are getting older and as they get older their health needs increase. In recognition of that, this government introduced a very important initiative to extend the gold card to 50,000 Second World War veterans, and those gold cards will be able to be used from 1 January next year. This is a very important initiative because those 50,000 Second World War veterans, with qualifying service, join nearly 250,000 veterans or war widows who already have a gold card. That  means that these veterans will no longer need access to the public health system because it gives them the equivalent of private health care. -  - The second initiative, as alluded to by the Minister for Health, is the fact that we will be funding the hospital care of veterans through the state health agreement that was recently struck with all states. That means that the states will no longer have to subsidise the health care, in the public health systems, of those veterans in those public hospitals, because we will be providing $750 million over the next five years for the provision of health care for the veterans in those states. That money that is freed up will mean that low income people who do remain in the public system have greater access to that public system.All that really remains now is for the opposition to support the federal government's initiative of extending the rebate for private health insurance so that we can get more people encouraged to take out private health insurance and relieve the pressure on the public health system.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Macquarie for his question. I can inform the House that today's national account showed that, in the September quarter, the Australian economy grew by one per cent. In the year to September 1998, the Australian economy grew by five per cent. These are exceptionally strong growth figures, particularly in the face of the Asian financial crisis. Going through the year terms over the last year, Japan has had a fall in GDP growth of 1.8 per cent. New Zealand is in recession and growth has declined by 1.2 per cent. Growth in Korea has declined by 6.8 per cent. Singapore is in recession and growth has declined by 0.7 per cent. Hong Kong is in recession and growth has declined by seven per cent.In Australia, the Australian economy withstood the Asian financial crisis and grew by five per cent in the year to September 1998. This compares favourably with not only the region but also other advanced economies. US growth through the year has been about 3.5 per cent. In Germany and France it has been about 2½ per cent. In Canada it has been 2.3 per cent and 1.1 per cent in Italy. The strong Australian growth in the face of the Asian financial crisis did not come about by accident. It was a consequence of good and sound policy.When this government was elected in 1996 and the full nature of Labor's concealment of the fiscal position became known, we said that we would have to put the Australian budget back into balance to strengthen it against unanticipated events. We did not know then that the Asian financial crisis would occur, but this government fought every inch of the way as it put the Australian  budget back into surplus. As the House knows, the budget was back in surplus in the last financial year. This government also introduced a new monetary policy to ensure that inflation was kept low and interest rates could respond appropriately.We do not say that the Asian financial crisis or indeed the world financial crisis is past. Clearly, 1999 is going to be a hard year, but I think we can say that the Australian economy has weathered the first year of the crisis exceptionally well. I want to pay tribute also to Australian exporters. Australian exporters have been phenomenally successful in diverting their exports away from the troubled Asian economies and exporting instead to North America and Europe. They have been aided by a floating exchange rate. They have kept Australia's exports up in the face of this onslaught. They have been a very big part of the good economic performance of Australia over the last 12 months.</DOC>

 - We do not take seriously the Labor Party's proposition that a new tax system which takes taxes off exports is somehow going to worsen the current account. The Labor Party taxes business inputs under its wholesale sales tax. What is more, the Labor Party taxes all transport in Australia, both of imported goods and domestic goods. The Labor Party taxes 22 per cent on all trucks and 43 per cent on all diesel, which under our system will be dramatically reduced. Under our system of tax, all taxes on business inputs come off exports - $4.5 billion off exports. - I was asked a question about the effect of tax reform on the current account, exports and balance of payments. - Let me just tell you that balance of payments covers exports and imports; it covers both. I was asked a question about the balance of payments. A new tax system which takes tax off exports helps the balance of payments - $4.5 billion off exports, $4.5 billion that the Labor Party opposes taking off exports. This is the side of the House which has a new tax system and it will help Australian exporters.</DOC>

 - I think members of the House will welcome the fact that this morning the Reserve Bank of Australia cut interest rates to 4.75 per cent. This is the sixth interest rate cut since this government was elected. When this government was elected, the standard variable mortgage interest rate was 10.5 per cent; after the last five official interest rate cuts, the standard variable had come down to 6.7 per cent; and, as a result of  a cut in official rates this morning, I notice that Aussie Home Loans has already jumped in first and cut its standard variable home rate to 6.24 per cent. `Aussie Home Loans jumps first', they said, `with rate cut to 6.24 per cent.'The National Australia Bank has issued a press release saying:National cuts home loan rates and has announced that its standard variable home loan rate has been cut today from 6.7 per cent to 6.45 per cent.We congratulate the National Australia Bank on cutting home mortgage rates. We also look forward to other banks following suit and passing on the benefits to home buyers in relation to lower interest rates.Since this government was elected, as a result of interest rate cuts the average Australian family is now saving more than $3,000 a year on its home mortgage interest rate. That is $3,000 a year going back to young families to help them with the cost of children; to help them with the cost of buying homes; and to help them keep consumer sentiment up, as we have seen in today's strong figures.I have gone back through Reserve Bank bulletins to see when interest rates were last at this level. The official interest rate was last at this level in July of 1993, although home loans were higher. But, according to Reserve Bank rates, if one goes back to January 1990 - remembering that today's official cash rate was 4.75 per cent - the cash rate was 17 to 17½ per cent. That is when the Labor Party decided to bring on the recession we had to have. They were very successful in bringing on the recession we had to have in 1990 with cash rates at 17½ per cent. But I think that people on this side of the House will welcome the fact that good policy has brought great returns for home buyers and families.</DOC>

 - The first point I make is that, under the government's tax reform, education becomes cheaper - because, under the government's tax reform, people who supply education get all of their tax back and there is no tax on outputs. So education falls in cost under the new tax system; it is cheaper and more affordable than it is under Labor's tax system. Labor taxes business inputs, particularly embedded inputs in relation to education. - As I was going on to say, as I said in the second reading speech in relation to implementation costs, registered organisations will be able to take advantage of that particular provision.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. Her constituents are typical of the many hundreds of  thousands of Australians who want the best for their families, want to have some control over their life, want to have choice and want to take out private health insurance. The opposition has shown no interest in them. In fact, all the opposition has done is talk a lot about the so-called rich. These are people, in the opposition's view, of a family earning more than $70,000 a year as a combined family income.I had someone call my office yesterday and it was typical of that. They were a family from Queensland. They had a 10-year-old daughter. This daughter had had 30 operations throughout her life. The family were marginally over the cut-off limit. They were finding that they were having serious difficulty in coping with the health insurance expenses in conjunction with all the other medical expenses for the long-term treatment of their daughter. They wanted to have private health insurance because they wanted some choice and some control, and they felt they got much better rehabilitation - which is probably correct because rehabilitation is an area that has not been traditionally handled well in the state system. That sort of family, the opposition would say, should get no assistance whatsoever.It is also typified by a letter that was sent to me which I would like to read to my colleagues. The letter is from a lady in Victoria and states:Dear Sir,I have never written a letter to a politician before, but I am doing so today because I feel so strongly about this issue. Having been a public patient in a city public hospital last year and seeing the overworked, overstressed staff, a lot of patients being left unsure of their situation, I feel the government's 30 per cent tax rebate for private health insurance must be passed through both houses of parliament so that people like us can choose to pay private health insurance at a somewhat affordable price, thus taking the load off the public hospital system.I could not have put it better myself.</DOC>

 - The answer is no. As part of the tax reform package, the government introduces an Australian business number. The Australian business number gives the opportunity to enforce both indirect tax and income tax. In fact, the Australian business number was such a dramatic reform in this area and anti-avoidance technique that the Labor Party adopted it as its policy before the last election.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Riverina for her question. The Commonwealth government is committed to improving and advancing Australia's basic research and its research infrastructure. In the last election campaign, the coalition committed itself to an extra $148.6 million over three years to maintain investment in research and research infrastructure, including $90.5 million for research infrastructure.That funding fully dealt with the projected fall in the forward estimates for research and research infrastructure. The Labor Party's education policy did not do so. The Labor Party's education policy committed only $57 million extra, with the result being that Australian research was left some $91.6 million short. There was a massive, gaping hole in the Labor Party education policy. It was quite clear from the reaction of the Leader of the Opposition in the House yesterday that he had not even read the policy. He did not know about the gap in the policy.The little red Indian on the back bench at least read the policy from the launch to the airport. He actually read the policy. The  Leader of the Opposition, the big chief in the opposition, never got around to reading the policy at all. It appears that he was not briefed on the issue of the forward estimates. As we know, the Leader of the Opposition has a continuing problem with the forward estimates. During the 1996 election he informed the electorate that the budget was in surplus. But, as we know, it was in deficit to $10.6 billion.What this demonstrates is that the member for Werriwa has correctly identified the massive intellectual vacuum which exists on the part of the Labor Party. I see that the member for Werriwa is currently out of the chamber, presumably working on that most valuable book which he is preparing to fill the gaping intellectual hole that exists on the other side of the chamber. - Well, challenge it. Go on; get up and challenge it.</DOC>

 - I am going to repeat what I said this morning and I am going to go on repeating it, because it is a major embarrassment for the Labor opposition that there is now a major split in the ranks on the union side. We all know where they take their instructions from - from the labour movement, from the trade union bosses. On this particular issue, the instructions are to block the government's reforms, which will in fact preserve jobs and create jobs. We have got the usual that we get from the Labor Party. We have inherited the problem. Now they are doing all that they can to prevent the fixing of the problem and the implementation of the solutions.It is a very interesting development that the shopies union has now made a submission to the Industrial Relations Commission on the question of junior wage rates. Obviously, we would not agree with everything the shopies union say. But when it comes to the central, absolutely critical issue in this whole debate, this is what the shopies union say:The SDA is prepared to acknowledge there may be a role for youth wages for employees under 18 years who are still enrolled in secondary education. - I will read the rest; it is my pleasure to do so. It is a pity you do not read it and understand what they are saying. They further say:Experience of life can give maturity and knowledge. Age has been used in the Australian society as a basis to reflect experience and knowledge (i.e. school). It is not a perfect match as, depending upon other factors, experience does not necessarily match up with age.  - Elsewhere in their submission they say:The SDA proposes that youth rates should apply to employees under 18 -  - Further:but full adult rates apply to all other employees. - Order! The minister will resume his seat. The member for Brisbane persists in interjecting. He is aware that I had already called his attention to the fact that the minister had the call. The member for Brisbane will exercise some restraint. - When you read the report, you find that they propose their own alternative, which is this: those aged 15 years should get 50 per cent of the adult rate; 16 years, 60 per cent; 17 years, 80 per cent; 18 years, the adult rate. What they are proposing is in fact reflecting the basic principle. Australia has a system to date that works well. We have a system by which a lot of young people are employed. Labor's policy, which we inherited, would see the end of that system in the year 2000. If that system comes to an end, tens of thousands of young people are going to lose their jobs. - That is just proof positive; you have got the ex-ACTU president in here misleading people about an absolutely central issue which goes to the employment of young people. When it comes to the central issue,  the shopies are absolutely right. What an embarrassment for the Labor Party.</DOC>

 - I have certainly read Joe de Bruyn's remarks; in fact, I have got them here. Nothing he has said and nothing that you have said by way of argument in your question will deny the simple fact that the shopies are putting up our proposition. They are saying that you ought to have a system whereby people's wages are discounted to reflect their age. Why do they say that? They say that because `experience of life can give maturity and knowledge'. This is a huge problem for the Labor Party, a huge problem for all the ex-ACTU presidents who sit on the other side.The fact is that Labor's policy, if it not prevented from being implemented, will see a lot of young people lose their jobs. The shopies know that. Sure, they are on a barbwire fence. They are in the ACTU, they are in the Labor Party and they want to make life as comfortable as possible for you, as usual. But it is very clear from their statement. - You can read any quote you like from it. The fact of the matter is that their proposition is absolutely in conformity with our basic proposition; that is, we ought to have discounted wages for young people, to reflect their circumstances and protect their jobs. - </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and recognise the great interest the honourable member has in foreign affairs issues and, in particular, developments in East Asia. The Australian government clearly wants the elections that will take place in May or June of next year in Indonesia to be truly successful elections. We are prepared to offer practical assistance to see that those elections are successful. Australia, after all, is one of the world's oldest continuously operating democracies, and we have a lot to offer.The Australian Electoral Commissioner, Mr Bill Gray, recently led a team to Jakarta to undertake a preliminary needs assessment. Our experience in holding elections means we are well placed to assist in areas such as computerisation of the compilation of results and practical planning procedures for voting. After all, there will be something like 130 million people voting in the Indonesian elections, and that will require somewhere in the vicinity of 350,000 polling booths.But it will not just be a question of providing Indonesia with technical assistance. For the elections to be successful there has to be a calm and confident domestic political environment. We will be consulting Indonesia on the possibility of developing a code of conduct for the elections to provide a framework for resolution of differences and prevention of escalation of disputes among the parties.It is crucial that all parties in the upcoming elections in Indonesia work closely together for both a fair and a peaceful election. Australia is ready to do what it can not just to help Indonesia through its economic crisis but to help Indonesia through this difficult transition to genuinely democratic administration. Through the work of the Australian Electoral Commission and through our development assistance agencies as well as our diplomatic network, we will be providing whatever assistance we usefully can.</DOC>

 - I did not hear the first part of the question, but it was the car industry, I believe, and transitional issues? - Of course, as is well known, under the government's tax policy the cost of cars will fall. One of the things that the industry says is, `This will be an enormous benefit for the car industry and its exports in due course, but in the interim how will you stagger the price reductions?' The government has had discussions with the car industry and has transitional provisions which give three-year stepping in relation to business purchases of cars. When a business purchases a car of course, it will get even the 10 per cent GST back. It is not just a question of taking Labor's 22 per cent wholesale sales tax off and putting a 10 per cent GST on; when business buys the car it gets the 10 per cent GST back.About 60 per cent, I am led to believe, of car sales in Australia are fleet sales, and so we have a three-year stepping down of that dramatic price reduction. In addition to that, as a result of the representations made to us by car traders that they would prefer a notional input tax credit system for second-hand vehicles which gives a notional input tax credit against liability, the government accepted their submissions and agreed to such a system.I make the point that these are good transitional measures. They will help the transition to the new tax system. But the overall point is this: those people who really want to help manufactures in this country will support the new tax system. At the moment, with an indirect tax base, Labor's wholesale sales tax puts all the burden of indirect tax on manufactures, on goods. And, as a consequence of that, Labor's tax system discriminates against manufactures. The whole idea of broadening the base to goods and services is so that the service sector bears some of the brunt and Australia's manufacturers and exporters get a go.This is a government that believes in reform. This is a government that believes that we need a new tax system. The opposition is now marked by one thing and one  thing only: it has become a party of reaction. Nobody knows what Labor stands for. The only thing we know is Labor stands against all reform. This is the difficulty of the member for Werriwa, who has found himself trapped inside a party of reaction, who is unable to have ideas because this is a party which can hold itself together only by not having a policy. - This side of politics does have a policy. We are going to do what is in the national interest, and that is tax reform.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dawson for her question. I am aware of comments that the Premier of Queensland has made. As I indicated in an answer to a question yesterday, we as a government extended an extra $13-odd million for research and development for the sugar industry, particularly in North Queensland where the honourable member represents the seat of Dawson. Mr Beattie also said that we should come to the party, and we have already identified programs that we are going to fund in that process of increasing the sugar content in the crop up there.The Beattie government, on coming to power, actually withdrew funding from this research and development program that had been announced by the former Borbidge government. They withdrew funding and then they came back, in the lead-up to the Mulgrave by-election, and reannounced it, saying it was new funding. So the question is a very pertinent one. It is about the efficacy of the way the Queensland government is running its business.  I will just close by saying that our government stands behind the Queensland sugar industry, particularly in North Queensland, and we aim to provide the resources so that it can address the problems that it is facing, particularly the sugar content problem in North Queensland. We have done that, and we have expressed that commitment very clearly with the extra $13 million we are providing.</DOC>

 - I presume that the honourable member's question was prompted by the fact that among the bills introduced this morning was one that was aimed at protecting those people who are in residential care from having the automatic 85 per cent fee deducted from their payments. The point is that that legislation was introduced this morning, so that those people could be distinguished from -  - Thank you, Mr Speaker, and it is precisely in general terms that I am addressing the question, in accordance with your ruling. The fact is that the bill was introduced this morning to distinguish residents in residential care from the general bulk of the population, for the reasons  that were expressed in the second reading speech and in the explanatory memorandum. The rest of the community is treated like any other resident across the general community.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Menzies for his question, and I congratulate him for co-founding the Donwork JobWatch organisation in his electorate. - In the course of extensive consultations, a large number of Job Network members have said that the biggest single problem that they face is unjustified carping against a system which is already working well. They say that the whole network has been tagged by the problems of a relatively small number of its members. It is a bit like judging the whole of test cricket by the performance of the current England team. An example of the kind of carping is the statement of the member for Swan earlier this week when he said that there was only one Commonwealth service provider left in his electorate. In fact, there are four Job Network members with sites in the electorate of Swan, including one, Communicare, which I visited just two weeks ago.I am able to report to the House that the Job Network is getting better and better all the time. In November 1997 the old CES got just 15,000 unemployed jobseekers into work. In November 1998 the new Job Network got 22,400 jobseekers into work. The Job Network is performing at the rate of some 7,000 placements a week, and this is 20 per cent better than the old CES at its best. It seems that the message is finally getting through. I  would like to quote from an article in this week's Business Review Weekly entitled, `Clouds clear on jobs scheme'. - He praised us with faint damns, and that is probably about as good as you can get from that source. - Narelle Hooper says:The Job Network scheme is not the disaster that many feared. Indeed, new research suggests that on the critical determining factor of success or failure - the scheme's standing with employers - it is showing signs of being a good system.She said:Employers contacted by BRW that have taken on staff under the new system say they are much happier with the results. Many are using a range of providers and have been negotiating on price or have been able to get a wide range of services for no charge.She quotes Michael Hurley, a yarn manufacturer in Victoria. - Woollen yarn. He says that his company:. . . used the CES but the less said about the result the better. 'The scheme was a new learning curve for us, but ultimately we have probably got a better deal out of it.'She also quotes a gentlemen called Derek Cafferty. - This gentleman has surveyed 2,500 local employers in conjunction with the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology, and he says that employers who have used both the old CES and a new Job Network agency favour dramatically the Job Network by a factor of eight to one. That is what is happening out in the real world.Even in this place the message seems to be getting through to the member for Batman, who had previously in a series of press releases excoriated the Job Network. He came into the House this week and, in a rather constructive speech, said that he supported the principle of a competitive market and he even offered:. . . bipartisan support for a Job Network which has an emphasis on quality, value, diversity, real competition and accountability - one that is driven not by ideology but the needs of the unemployed, the community and the employers.I welcome that statement of the member for Batman because that is precisely what the Job Network is. The Job Network is not perfect, but it is already doing very well. It will do even better with the kinds of changes the government has in mind.</DOC>

 - The GST applies across the board, as you know, and compensation arrangements have been put in place for the anticipated 1.9 per cent increase in the CPI. That applies to people of any age,  and it applies to people in whatever circumstances they reside.The reason I answered the previous question in the way I did was to point out with regard to people who live in residential care that a specific provision was made to protect them from an automatic mechanism in legislation taking 85 per cent of the compensation. Accordingly, the way in which the GST is applied to people who live in rented accommodation, in their own homes, in blocks of apartments and in retirement villages is totally consistent, and the relative compensation packages are put there to offset the 1.9 per cent.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. I know it is an issue of concern to her and to her electorate, and I am pleased that there is improvement in sight for this particular part of the national highway. There is no doubt that the coalition, this government, recognises the importance of a viable transport structure for Australia. Having in my first week in this role as transport minister travelled quite a bit of Queensland, I recognise the very real need for improved roads in that state, and we are going to deliver.The area that the honourable member referred to is the Caboolture motorway, which is a particularly congested, southern most section of the Bruce Highway. It carries a lot of traffic, much of it commercial by way of trucks and vans. Every indication is that, without increased works and expenditure, that congestion will only get worse and the accident rate will go up. It is for that reason the government has announced that it will provide funding of $25 million for the Caboolture motorway. There we go.Apart from the $25 million dedicated to this program, this financial year the Commonwealth has provided $75 million to the Queensland state government to improve state funded roads and an additional $70 million to improve council funded roads. We are serious about improving roads in this country, and I believe that measures such as this are clear evidence of that commitment.</DOC>

 - The answer to the first question asked by the member for Barton is yes. In respect of the second question it seems, regrettably, that he has been misled by a media release by the member for Melbourne a couple of days ago. The member for Melbourne put out a press release in his capacity as shadow minister for consumer affairs, but regrettably he didn't have regard to the interests of consumers in what he had to say. He asserted, as is implicit in the question of the member for Barton, that there would be no GST payable as a component of the costs awarded on a party and party basis. I can't see any basis for that suggestion at all.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. In the policies this government has been implementing we have been trying to set up a certain sure framework for the conduct of workplace relations. That is good for small business and it is good for people who work in small business because it gives them a sense of accomplishment, they can earn more and we can boost productivity. As we are already seeing, the sorts of reforms we have been introducing have contributed to today's magnificent results with the GDP. I pay tribute to all those small business people and the people who work in those small businesses for the fantastic job they have been doing.Victoria is covered by the federal legislation. That was one of the historic changes that we brought into effect. That is under threat in the trade union movement and in the Labor Party in Victoria. They have proposed a policy which would see a Labor government in Victoria resurrect the old Victorian state tribunal and take the jurisdiction away from the federal tribunal. It is unbelievable. We have finally got a uniform system for the advantage of small business and the Labor Party is now advocating going back to where they were in the 1980s.Who is going to pay for that, with all the duplication and red tape? None other than the very small businesses which have contributed to the jobs - 90,000 in three months. This is the Labor Party's policy in action. And who is running it? The trade union movement in Victoria. And who does the trade union movement in Victoria run? They run the state ALP and, of course, the federal ALP, where they have so much influence. The two ex-ACTU presidents here both now represent Victorian seats and both are part and parcel of the trade union movement in Victoria.As to proposals for reform in that state, we have the ETU saying: `The unions should have all the power we have got today.' The member for Batman says there is a major problem in Victoria. He says that there is corruption within the union movement in  Victoria. It is the very union movement in Victoria which is dictating policy for the front bench here in Canberra. One of those policies, would you believe, is not only to oppose what we are trying to do for small business in respect of unfair dismissal but to go back to where we were when Laurie Brereton was in. We are trying to create jobs. They have a policy dictated by the trade union movement that will cost jobs and rob those small businesses in the member's electorate of the very confidence that could create jobs.There is some hope for us, because whilst we have the trade union saying that they should have all the power they have got now, if not more, we have Martin Ferguson, the member for Batman, saying that they are basically corrupt. Lo and behold, we now have the member for Werriwa, who reckons there is a third way. Isn't that interesting? What is his third way? Somewhere I have it here; it is definitely a collector's item. He says :Labour market flexibility. . . Australia has a unique opportunity to improve the flexibility of its labour market while also maintaining equity for its lowest paid workers.Its lowest paid workers have never been so well-off as they have been under us. We are the party introducing genuine flexibility. What a shambles. When there is a policy vacuum on the other side who is there dictating policy? It is none other than the union movement in Victoria, described as `corrupt' by the front bench of the Labor Party, telling the Labor Party what to do.</DOC>

 - The answer to the Leader of the Opposition is yes, I do recall that statement. I remind him that, when the tax plan was released several months ago, the Treasurer made an announcement that certain practices in relation to the use of trusts would be prohibited with effect from the date of that announcement. He also made a further announcement that part of the new arrangements would involve the introduction of  entity taxation, which will of itself eliminate a number of practices that have led to unreasonable tax minimisation.It is also the case that the introduction of a goods and services tax and the compliance measures associated with it and the Australian business number will enhance the effectiveness of compliance work by the Australian Taxation Office. It is also the case that further tranches of legislation, as foreshadowed by the Treasurer, will be introduced in the new year.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Fadden for his question. This really follows from a question I was asked on Tuesday by the Leader of the Opposition, who in his question claimed that Mr Kennett had made comments that `Medicare should be  axed basically because the Commonwealth is not meeting its responsibilities as far as the public hospital system is concerned'. I went and had a look at Mr Kennett's comments. Obviously I should take a lesson from the experience of the Prime Minister, who does not ever believe anything at face value until he looks at it himself.I could not find anything at all in Mr Kennett's comments to suggest that the Commonwealth was not meeting its responsibility toward public hospitals. In fact, Mr Kennett's comments related more to the duplication of health services and the difficulties that occur at boundaries between one system and the other. I did notice that in Mr Kennett's comments he also described senators who were opposing the rebate as `turkeys treating private health fund members in an inhumane way', which I think is far more appropriate.The interesting thing is that Bob Carr is on the record as having said, `As fast as we hurled money at the hospitals, there was a further abandonment of private health cover and a further rise in the demands on the public system.' He obviously understands the interplay between private health and public health.There is a Senate committee inquiry tomorrow which the New South Wales government was due to come before and give evidence in support of the opposition. We find out at 7.30 last night that the New South Wales health minister, Andrew Refshauge, cancelled his appearance before the Senate committee of inquiry. Can you not just imagine Andrew getting the telephone call from John Della Bosca telling him, `There are 1.8 million New South Wales people with private health insurance, and there are 1.8 million people in New South Wales that the Labor Party is denying a rebate to. We have an election coming up on 27 March, and this is going to hurt us.' You bet it will.</DOC>

 - As the bill that was introduced yesterday makes entirely clear in its objects, as I recall, this is being introduced as part of a Commonwealth-state agreement in accordance with principles agreed between all states and the Commonwealth. Indeed, as I have also already indicated, once the agreement is brought to conclusion, the legislation will be part of the second package that the Prime Minister indicated will be in the parliament early next year. I do not suppose that the Labor Party would vote against that, but there is no telling what the Labor Party will do. I thought that a provision to lock in the mechanism would be uncontroversial and would be able to be enacted without opposition, but I may be going too far. - Again, I have said in very specific principles that the lock-in mechanism will be legislated in accordance with the agreement in the tranche of legislation to be introduced next year, which I expect to sail through the parliament quickly because I could not conceive of the Labor Party opposing it.In conclusion, I want to say that we did appreciate the fact that the state premiers and state treasurers worked very  constructively with us. In particular, I would like to single out for praise the state Treasurer of Tasmania,  who was very supportive of getting a share of the GST.</DOC>

 - Bangladesh does have a GST; it is 15 per cent. In answer to the honourable member's question, a lot of countries have developed systems which reflect the fact that, if you want to preserve the employment of young people, you need to understand the differences for young people who obviously do not have the maturity and experience of adults. For example, in Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands - just to take three from Europe - the adult rate is reduced successively for each year below 23, 21 and 18. So they have acknowledged the point.This has been a significant issue recently in the UK where Tony Blair established a commission to look at these issues and to set a minimum. It is interesting that the third way in the UK has seen the UK government exclude 16- and 17-year-olds from the new minimum hourly rate. They did that because the UK government was worried about the jobs that would be available for young people. It is definitely worth reading the work of the Low Pay Commission in the UK because it is current, it is relevant and it looks at all the international experience. But for those who would not be interested in the UK experience even the Irish National Minimum Wage Commission has recently recommended - has Ireland got a GST? - There you are; they are a modern economy. That commission recently recommended a separate minimum wage for people under 18, which is set at 70 per cent of the full-time adult rate, and a training rate of 75 per cent, 80 per cent and 90 per cent of the adult rate for job entrants without experi  ence in their first three years of employment, regardless of age.I point out that young people - the people for whom we are trying to create positions through this legislation - as a rule, are more happy with their rate of pay than just about any sector of the work force. The irony is that a research program in place when Labor was in office - the Australian Industrial Relations survey of workplaces - showed that, whilst Labor was legislating to take away the prospects of their having a job, young people across the Australian work force were as happy as anybody with the rate of pay that they were achieving under that system.The bottom line is that, if we are unable to achieve our legislation, Labor's policy on this will destroy the jobs of literally tens of thousands of young people. I conclude by referring honourable members to the Canberra Times of today. Mike Taylor, who I would have to say is not our greatest supporter, in his article titled `Cogent case for retaining youth wage' says to the opposition:To have credibility, the ACTU must come up with a viable alternative competency-based system which will not disadvantage young workers or unduly add to Australia's current unemployment levels.In the end, it may require an acknowledgment by all concerned that junior rates of pay represent the most equitable answer to an inequitable situation.Well, he is no supporter of the government but surely if Mike Taylor can see the point it is time that the Labor Party did.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. Today in Washington the IMF executive board has approved a financial support package for Brazil. Agreement on the IMF program with Brazil and the financial support package is very welcome. The Brazilian program will be crucial to efforts to stabilise the international financial crisis. Stability in Brazil is important for financial stability in Latin America.Loans will be provided under the IMF's new arrangements to borrow. The new arrangements to borrow were set up with Australia playing a pivotal role and, as the Treasurer of Australia, I am chairman of the IMF's NAB. As a member of the new arrangements to borrow, Australia will be making a contribution to the IMF in the form  of loans up to $A500 million. The loans will be repayable by the IMF and will bear interest. Because these are financing transactions, the loans will not appear on the budget bottom line because they will be secured by the IMF and repaid.As the House knows, Australia has concentrated its bilateral involvement in programs in its own region. Australia has on a bilateral basis agreed to provide funding to Thailand and second-tier funding to Indonesia and also to Korea. In this case, Australia will not be partaking in bilateral assistance in relation to Brazil because we have considered our contribution through the new arrangements to borrow to be sufficient and because we have the focus of our contribution to these financial packages in our region.As I informed the House yesterday, whilst nearly all of our region is in recession, the Australian economy continues to perform strongly, with the national accounts yesterday recording growth of five per cent - outside China, the fastest growing economy in the region - and an economy which is growing faster than all the major European nations and the United States. Australia has shown remarkable resilience in the face of the Asian and international crisis. That illustrates the importance of good strong economic policy, the policy that this government has put in place over the last three years, particularly the low interest rate policy.I pay tribute again to Australia's exporters who have been successful in diverting exports. By doing the hard yards - putting the budget back into surplus, getting a new monetary policy and promoting competition - the Australian government has been able to withstand and ensure that the policy can withstand the crisis in the region. It provides an example of what this country must do in the next two to three years to provide a strength and foundation to face the challenges which will come in the new century. Most importantly, that involves laying down the groundwork for a new taxation system which will make our country strong and prosperous in the future. Let us confront those challenges and build a new tax system rather than disintegrate in oppositionism, which is based on  populism, for which there will be no future for the Australian economy.</DOC>

 - Of course many of those would be S3, S4 or S8, so they will be GST free. - Don't argue. You don't know what you are talking about. In the same week, 5.8 million Australians had private health insurance, and they will be better off, and 18 million Australians will be better off under the proposal as a whole.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. The measles control campaign started on 3 August this year and wrapped up on 6 November. It had very strong support from members right across the House, and I thank members very sincerely for their support.It was the biggest single public health campaign ever run in Australia's history. We were doing it for two reasons. The first is that the National Health and Medical Research Council advised me that we should bring forward the second measles vaccination from 12 years of age to five years of age. Secondly, the World Health Organisation was predicting that Australia would face an epidemic of measles in the next 12 months. This gave us the opportunity to attempt to basically  immunise the whole of the primary school age population in Australia.The results are that we managed to get to 1.3 million Australian children directly through schools, which is really an extraordinary effort - 7,200 schools around Australia. A further 10 per cent of children were vaccinated at a local health clinic or by their general practitioner through the campaign. Six per cent of students were not at school on the day the teams came around. They are currently being followed up through general practitioners and local government, and an estimated two to five per cent of children had already had the vaccination.So our best estimates are that, over the last four months, we have been able to get to 94 per cent of all Australian school children between five and 12 years of age. This is a highly acceptable level of measles vaccination and, quite clearly, will prevent us from having the epidemic that was predicted.The other interesting thing is that it gives us very good data on the rate of side effects and reactions to the measles vaccination. There is a very tiny group that nonetheless gets a lot of publicity that prior to our campaign was predicting up to 334,000 adverse reactions. Just today I got the definitive data and, rather than having 334,000 adverse reactions, we had 71 - and 71 adverse reactions in 1.3 million school children is one adverse reaction for every 18,300. Most of those adverse reactions were fairly trivial - rash, fever and faintness. They accounted for well over half the adverse reactions.There were five serious adverse reactions - anaphylaxis, which is a life threatening condition - but at one in every 260,000 children that is a tiny incidence. I am pleased to say that all those children have successfully recovered. This is something that all of Australia can be proud of. It is an example of preventive health. It is an example of everyone working together to achieve a fantastic health outcome.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker -  -  - The taxation plan is the most pro-family taxation policy this country has ever seen. I am delighted that the new member asked me this question because only this morning I had the opportunity to launch a book co-authored by the honourable member for Menzies called Changing Australia . I commend it to the honourable member who asked the question. Indeed, I commend it to all honourable members because it traces some very important social, economic and demographic changes in our country.One of the things it traces is the appalling increase in the tax burden on families that has occurred over the last 20 or 30 years. It records that in the last 20 or 30 years the  effective marginal tax rate on an individual has risen by something like 83 per cent but the effective marginal tax rate on families has risen by 360 per cent. That underlines the crying need in this country to have a government that will introduce tax measures to provide some relief to mothers and fathers for the costs of raising children. We did it with our family tax initiative before 1996 and we have done it again with our taxation plan introduced by the Treasurer yesterday. We are doing it in relation to private health insurance. The party that the honourable member represents is voting against a measure that will advantage millions of mothers around Australia -  -  - I say this very seriously to the honourable member who has just come into this parliament: if the honourable member is interested in striking a blow for tax equity for young mothers, she should vote for our private health insurance rebate. If she is interested in striking a blow for tax equity generally, she should vote for the coalition's taxation plan, which produces the greatest measure of taxation justice Australian mothers and Australian families have seen in the last 30 years.</DOC>

 - The government's tax plan lists religious services as being GST free. I am sure the honourable member would approve of that. That means that, where churches or any religion so defined - it does not have to be a church - is delivering a service which is an integral part of that religious belief, it will be GST free. There will be no input taxes on it. They get all their input taxes back and they will not be paying any tax on outputs. </DOC>

 - This is good news for Australia in a good news week. Apart from the national accounts figures that came out yesterday, apart from the 25 basis point drop in cash rates and apart from the introduction of structural change to our tax legislation by the Treasurer yesterday, I would like to advise the House that the Sydney Futures Exchange and Dow Jones, which is one of the world's largest business and financial publishers, have agreed to launch in the second quarter of next year a new index series known as APELS, Asia-Pacific Extra Liquid Series. It will be known as APELS around the world.This means that a funds manager sitting at her desk in New York will be able to trade index-linked products in Australia in real time. It means funds managers can buy and sell those products linked to, for example, the Hong Kong Stock Exchange or Japanese equities. They can trade them sitting at their desks in New York, London or Chicago. That will potentially extend to a wide range of products across the Asia-Pacific region. Obviously, funds managers around the world will have access to that.Initially, this product will cover Hong Kong and Japan, but it is an exciting development for Australia because it opens the doors to massive amounts of international funds that will come through funds managers around the world. It will also trade on regional financial interests, not just Australian financial interests. Importantly, it provides an opportunity for international banks to base their operations in Australia, to run a single clearing account to access markets around the Asia-Pacific region. That means more jobs for more Australians.This comes about through no small amount of effort. It comes because Australia has leading-edge world technology. It comes  because we have better and simpler corporate law reform. It comes because we have a stable and growing economy. It comes because we have an innovative and sophisticated work force. It comes, most importantly, because of our commitment to a 21st century taxation system. - The opposition does not want to hear this good news.</DOC>

 - The government determined in its policy that religious services would be GST free. That was the policy that we put to the Australian electorate and it is the policy that we are going to enact. In the last election, this government put out a detailed policy. We said to the Australian public, `If you want tax reform, vote this government back and we will enact it.' This is a government which seeks to do no more than fulfil all of its election pledges. That is why the Labor Party is so at odds on the particular issue. The Labor Party has never come across a government that wanted to actually deliver promises before.We remember the 1993 election when the Labor Party said, `No GST', and then hiked every wholesale sales tax after the election. We remember when the Labor Party said that it would cut income taxes. - I do. The point I make is that this government is implementing its policy and that that is our policy. The point I am also making is that the Labor Party is engaged in one effort in this parliament. It is engaged in an effort to try to make a government break its promise to the Australian people.This government puts out a policy and it asks to be elected. It comes back into this parliament, and it seeks to legislate it. To the Labor Party, this is some kind of novel proposition. It is a novel proposition. Before the 1993 election, the Labor Party said that it would cut taxes, but it did not. It said that it would not hike indirect taxes and it did. This  government put out a policy in relation to income tax cuts and in relation to the goods and services tax and this government intends to implement them in full.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. The short answer is that the government has been working very hard to overcome and untangle the mess left behind by the member for Dobell's appalling decision in 1992 to enter into contractual arrangements which clearly discriminated against the needs of rural and regional Australians, who, above all Australians, need access to top-quality telecommunications technologies and corridors.The government is absolutely delighted to be able to say that we have reached agreement with the three existing mobile phone carriers - Telstra, Optus and Vodafone - to ensure that all areas of regional Australia will continue to enjoy services where they have them now. There will be a 12-month extension of the analog coverage until 31 December 2000, and that coverage will remain in place until there are alternatives available. In short, this really means that regional Australians do not lose out as a result of the quite disastrous and appallingly ill-thought through decision that the member for Dobell entered into in 1992. We will be imposing licence conditions on Telstra, requiring it to replace the analog AMPS network with an alternative digital network which provides reasonably equivalent coverage. Telstra has recently announced that it will be introducing a technology known as CDMA to construct a new network which will completely replace the existing AMPS network in both city and  country. I think this is testimony to the commitment and the effectiveness of the Howard-Fischer government in meeting the needs of rural and regional Australians.</DOC>

 - I think I answered this question earlier in the week, making the point that credit unions will be treated the same as  any other financial institution and will be under the same tax treatment. I also made the point earlier in the week that this problem so-called only arises because it was only when this government legislated that credit unions got the right to issue cheques. The way you solved the problem of credit unions was banning them from putting out cheques. - As I said, the treatment is precisely the same for a credit union as it is for a bank. It is precisely the same for any financial service provider. But I go on and make this point. - You have had a bad week, haven't you? - The only reason the question arises as to how you would treat cheques issued by credit unions is that this government, for the first time in Australian history, gave credit unions the right to issue cheques. They did not have it in 1983 or 1984 or 1985 or 1986 or 1987 or 1988 or 1989 or 1990 - he is counting with me. - I have concluded my answer. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Herbert for his question and I commend him on his enthusiasm for the concerns of veterans in his own electorate. I also note that tomorrow he is holding a presentation for veterans in his electorate. I would like to be with you but, unfortunately, I cannot. Today I announce -  -  - You don't want to hear about this, do you. - You don't want good news. Today I announce that Australian Vietnam veterans can now formally accept and wear South Vietnamese government and Cambodian government awards which were earned during their service in the Vietnam War. Records show that several hundred Australians received South Vietnamese and Cambodian awards during the Vietnam War, but at the time Australians were not allowed to officially accept or wear individual foreign awards.Under the government's foreign awards policy, there is now a mechanism whereby honours and awards, issued by a former foreign government which has ceased to exist, may be formally recognised and approved for wearing. This will allow those veterans to wear those awards and medals with great pride. This recognition has been sought by Vietnam veterans for a very long time, and it is hoped that more recipients and their families will apply for the official recognition of their service during the Vietnam War. I advise that applications are available from the Vietnam Veterans Association of Australia, the Australian Army Training Team Vietnam Association, the RSL, the defence department and PM&amp;C. This is good government policy  brought forward by this government. It is going to be very much welcomed by the Vietnam veterans, and I hope it will be supported by both sides of this parliament.</DOC>

 - Well, I earnestly desire, Mr Speaker. The question of course starts from a false premise, as usual. - I will tell you why it is false. There are two exemptions: it does not apply in relation to donated second-hand goods; nor does it apply in relation to non-commercial sales, which are judged on either of two grounds - either 50 per cent less of the price or 50 per cent less of the cost. - You said that there was a double test. It is an individual test on any one of those three grounds. That is the first point. The second point -  - He asks a question, you are in the middle of answering it, and so he asks a different one. - The question is wrong. In relation to charities the reason we put that test is that we think that, by and large - and I think there are reasonable grounds for this - most charities are honest. As a matter of fact, we do not think there is going to be any great problem with the Salvation Army cheating on the tax system. - Or the St Vincent de Paul or the Catholic Church cheating on the tax system. I think that, by and large, you can trust the Catholic Church. You can trust the Anglican Church. I think that by and large you can trust the churches if they say they are engaging in non-commercial activities. But I suppose, if there is any evidence to the contrary - in the same way as if there is any evidence to the contrary in relation to all of the taxes that currently apply - you have a look at it. That is the way you do these things.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Kalgoorlie for his question. I am aware that results of the first tests against the national benchmark have been announced by the education minister in Western Australia. This is a very historic moment for Australian education, because for the first time we now have placed on the public record an assessment of the literacy standards of all students in one state in years 3 and 5 against an objective national standard. This standard has been established by this government in consultation with all the states and territories.For the first time, now all students in Australia have an opportunity to be brought up to the basic literacy level that will be required for them to continue successfully with their education. After 13 years of the previous government, there was no such standard in place. With regard to literacy, the Labor Party included a mere five lines within its education policy at the election. It was going to hand over the national literacy standards to the Australian Education Union.The results of the Western Australian tests will be of interest to the House. Western Australia found that 20 per cent of all students were below the national standard. It found that 60 per cent of all indigenous students were below the national standard. I congratulate the Western Australian minister on being prepared to put this information on the public record in order to be honest with the Australian people and to indicate the determination of his government to finally address this problem once and for all. Literacy is the greatest social equity issue in education today. It falls to the coalition to address social justice issues in education which have been unaddressed for decades.This government has committed an additional $112 million to literacy and numeracy standards in Australian schools. Today I announced that next year the government will be putting in place a National Indigenous Literacy Strategy within the national plan to ensure that educational equality is finally delivered to indigenous students in the shortest possible time, building on the excellent results of the strategic result projects that I announced earlier this year. We will be working to ensure that all Australians students - indigenous and non-indigenous - will reach the literacy levels by the end of year 3 in school that will enable them to continue successfully with their education. This will have a dramatic effect on the quality of schooling in Australia, the quality of the classroom experience, and is fundamental to addressing the tremendously difficult problem of youth unemployment.</DOC>

 - The answer to the last part of the question is none, no police - strangely enough, no police. - Mr Speaker, let me read for the member some of the advantages of a broadly based consumption tax:A broadly based consumption tax . . . would - .	 provide much larger income tax cuts..	 reduce marginal tax rates . . . at all  income levels . . . .	 increase the tax take from people who continue to avoid or evade income tax..	 provide . . . revenue to enable a more generous benefit for wage and salary earners . . .  .	 enable the existing wholesale tax to be abolished . . .  - I read about the benefits that come from indirect tax reform from a book in fact written by a former member for Blaxland, Mr P.J. Keating. And, because I was reading, I table the document from which I was reading. I want to table a copy because it is the only original I have.

 - In reply to the honourable member for Fairfax, can I say to him that I am aware of statements made in recent days about the growth prospects of the Australian economy. I am also, as it happens, aware of some statements made about the growth prospects of the Australian economy in not so recent days. In fact, I follow comments about the growth prospects of the Australian economy, and I follow them particularly closely, as befits the discipline in my office, when they are made by the Leader of the Opposition. The Leader of the Opposition over the last few months has made some very interesting comments about the growth prospects of the Australian economy. For example, on 22 July 1998, interviewed by Fran Kelly on Radio National, he had this to say:The growth that has come off in Australia over the last couple of years as a result of Costello's  Budget, before the budgets before the Asian crisis hit us, has been entirely a product of their misplaced fiscal policy and nothing to do with the rest of the world.That was not bad. Then on 27 September 1998 the Leader of the Opposition had this to say:The problem is this, the Government took a baseball bat to growth, completely unnecessarily.Some baseball bat, I have got to say! Some growth! I think you are thinking of the baseball bat that the voters of Queensland took to your predecessor. But on 18 November 1998 this is what he had to say:A slowing down the pace of growth - yes. We have had that as a result of John Howard taking a baseball bat to the Australian economy immediately after he came into office and that now the Asian region crisis kicks in and that will slow our growth rates.And so the list goes on. The reality is that month after month the Leader of the Opposition was predicting doom and gloom and despair and desperation. Now even the most stubborn critics of the Australian economy would have to acknowledge that we have turned in remarkable growth rates, for which the entire Australian community deserves a great deal of respect and thanks from the government. Can I, on behalf of the government, particularly thank my colleague the Treasurer for his contribution and the work he has done in relation to the stewardship of the economy.I also record my gratitude to the Reserve Bank of Australia for the way in which it has managed the monetary policy of this country over the arrangement that was entered into between the government and the Reserve Bank when we came to office in 1996. In fact, the behaviour of the Reserve Bank of Australia is an object lesson in the conduct of monetary policy to central banks around the world.But, in the face of all this evidence, the Leader of the Opposition is now starting to change his tack. Do you know what his tack now is? Having blamed the coalition for the last 2½ years for any kind of bad sign that might be around, now that there is unambiguous good news, what is the response of the Leader of the Opposition? The response  of the Leader of the Opposition is to say that today's good news is really due to what Labor did before we were elected in 1996. That is an unbelievable performance. He is still saying it.This is what he had to say. He said that, while Australia was not completely fireproofed for the Asian currency crisis, Labor could take some credit for helping shield the economy. Labor left us with a $10½ billion deficit. They opposed every attempt we made over the last 2½ years to correct their mess. They predicted gloom and despair. Every time we had good news, they talked the Australian economy down. They ran around and sent their emissary to Kyoto to try to undermine that greenhouse safe arrangement we made. The Leader of the Opposition allowed Senator Bolkus to ride over to UNESCO undermining the representations of the lawfully elected government of this country. That happens every time they get a chance.They want the views of foreigners to destroy Australian jobs. As far as that great uranium mine in the Northern Territory is concerned, there are 1,000 Australian jobs, $12,000 million of export income and untold revenue to the federal Treasury. But what does the Labor Party want? They want that mine closed down. They want to close down Australian jobs. In office they neglected the national interests. In opposition they have not changed. I can only say that it has been a great week for the Australian economy. It has been a great week for the Australian national interest. But it has been a terrible week for the Australian Labor Party. Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Melbourne for his question. I am aware of certain statements by the Australian Private Hospitals Association which have been made in recent times. I can indicate very clearly this government is committed to having a dual system in health which allows a viable health system, that is, supported by both the private health funds and the public system. The government made a decision on that and put it to the Australian people. We were given the right to implement that by virtue of the decision on 3 October.The government will continue to press for that legislation and implement it, and it will be on Labor's head if they refuse to look after those people, many of whom of course have very little in the way of funds themselves and who are very careful in how they spend their money. If they choose to have private health cover, this government believes they should have that right in an affordable manner, and that is the reason behind the policy. On the question of changing the statement of risk, the answer is that no steps have been taken in that regard.</DOC>

 - This is a very good news day for a large section of southern New South Wales and north-eastern Victoria. It is a positive breakthrough - the first ever project approved under Investing for Growth is going to inland Australia, to Tumut in the electorate of Hume, on a magnificent regional site with good environmental considerations taken into account which will provide an economic boost not just to the Riverina but also to the Monaro. It is Australia's first major coordinated pulp mill project for many years, something Labor could never get going in their years in office.It is about harnessing the five per cent economic growth rate to ensure the creation of jobs and a spread of jobs right across Australia. I am delighted to point to the fact that this new mill, which Minister Nick Minchin has provided details in respect of, will produce some 170,000 pulp production tonnes with an additional 100,000 tonnes for export. - It will replace the 110,000 tonnes of softwood pulp and paper product annually imported into Australia. That is one bonus aspect -  - You don't like good news. This is about import replacement as much as it is about export generation. It is a $40 million facilitation, $25 million of which is pursuant to existing programs and $15 million of which is additional - to make the difference, to make this huge project proceed and proceed at the strategic location of Tumut, adjoining, as it does, the electorates of Eden-Monaro, Riverina and Farrer and located, as it is, in the electorate of Hume.This is a Christmas bonus present that has come early. It will inject confidence into the  region, and it will allow members of the next generation, the Tristans and others, to prepare for the jobs which will be created by this magnificent project.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. I do understand that there are some difficulties, and that is exactly the reason we have sought to introduce legislation to strengthen the role of the Private Health Insurance Complaints Commissioner. It is why, when we reappoint a new commissioner in the coming months, we will be appointing someone with substantial experience in the area who is able to deal with the funds and ensure that these unacceptable practices do not happen.It is somewhat hypocritical, coming from the Leader of the Opposition, who had 13 years in government to do something about this and did absolutely nothing about it whatsoever. It is somewhat hypocritical coming from the opposition who, at the last election, put out a health policy that had a total of 4½ lines only of effective policy on the private health insurance sector, and all that said is that we have to work together. It is hypocritical coming from an opposition that is negative, opportunistic, carping and offers no solutions whatsoever themselves.</DOC>

 - Let me state, firstly, how proud I am to be a minister of a government that is actually doing something in the forest and forest products area. This project, under the Prime Minister's Investing for Growth strategy, is the first major value adding project that has come to Australia since 1981 when the newsprint mills were created in Albury. I have been here long enough to remember another opportunity for Australia when this parliament debated the Wesley Vale mill. -  - I have heard the bleatings from the new member for Braddon and I heard him in his 90-second statement; and he is crying crocodile tears when it was his colleague that killed off a $1,000 million project and committed the workers of Burnie to unemployment. - I have mentioned in this parliament before the fact that Australia, with very high forestry resources, still has a net deficit of $1.5 billion per annum in forest products. That includes paying for 110,000 tonnes of softwood pulp each year. This proposal is going to reverse that into some 300,000 tonnes of production, some of which, hopefully, will go to fill the 3.5 million tonnes of softwood pulp orders that come out of the Asian region - 3.5 million tonnes, 90 per cent of which is imported. This is extremely important and it is the right sort of project. It is value adding existing timber coming from plantations, it is creating the opportunity for a further 30,000 hectares of plantation and the jobs that will grow from that are estimated at over 1,000 - new real jobs. Everybody should be very proud that the Investing for Growth concept has delivered this as its first project. Furthermore, it has been my decision, in addressing these same issues, to have an action agenda to eliminate that $1.5 billion deficit. - If you have got an agenda. Ours will be implemented, and that is the big difference. We know all about your agendas and your inquiries. There is another aspect of this minimill concept, and that is that for the first time in Australia many millions of dollars have been invested in researching to get a mill that is of a better size to be accommodated in the Australian forest environment. We have not got those very huge forest areas that necessarily support the usual sort of two million tonnes of timber type pulp mill. But if this is successful it will also be built in many other parts of Australia because it is an Australian mill for Australia. That has to be recognised. The Visy company have put in about $40 million in proving their technology.Let me give another reason why this mill is going to succeed. It is going to start operations under the government's new tax policy, which the Treasury tells us will benefit the forest industries by $530 million a year. Sir, you are aware of my business activities in years gone by in the trucking industry, and in that industry we knew very well the cost of  the sales tax/fuel tax regime. I have been informed by the Road Transport Forum of the types of trucks that will be serving this mill and carting in the timber that is needed - and, by the way, it is all the waste timber that is being used. There will be about 56 of those trucks a day working continuously and I am advised that the running cost attributable to tax for those trucks is $1,700 a week - and that gives you $88,000 of savings if those costs are all removed under our tax plan. So we are not only supporting this industry, giving it the financial incentive to create new, real jobs, but giving that company the opportunity under a new tax regime to be successful and expand in Australia's interest.</DOC>

 - I do not agree with those comments. It is just more carping from the opposition. The comments I do agree with are the following comments:We're actually offering families choice, whereas the Opposition has consistently said you'd only get relief if you had private health insurance. We're saying it's up to families how they purchase their dentistry, their physiotherapy, psychology, whatever it may be, and we will simply ensure that you have some assistance, quite substantial assistance every year - to take out extras. That was the member for Fremantle on 6 February 1996 extolling exactly what we are doing now. There is a word for people who say one thing and do another - and it is `hypocrite'.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Grey for his question. Last week I paid tribute to Australia's exporters for the great work that they had done in diverting exports of Australia away from the troubled Asian economies and into markets in Europe and North America. The Australian exporters have been minimising the impact of the Asian financial crisis in a way which has given Australia such strong growth through the Asian financial crisis - growth which I think all members of the House welcomed last week - of five per cent in the year to the end of the September quarter.Today the Colonial State Bank and the Australian Business Chamber survey of manufacturing reports that there are more manufacturers in New South Wales exporting than ever before. The survey shows that the number of New South Wales manufacturing firms involved in exporting rose from 52 per cent in the September quarter to 62 per cent in the December quarter. The Colonial State Bank chief economist, Craig James, said that the survey results `further highlighted the degree of resilience of the Australian economy'. He said:Manufacturers are responding to a volatile environment in a positive fashion. New age manufacturers recognise the challenges but also identify the opportunities. The reduction in interest rates, together with a competitive Australian dollar, provide a firm foundation for growth.The government's policy of ensuring that interest rates are kept low has been a very big part of the adjustment process.Today the ANZ released figures on job vacancies, which rose by 3.4 per cent in November. The ANZ notes that, based on the historical relationship between job ads and employment, the trend is consistent with net new jobs growing at an average of around 18,000 per month as a result of these vacancies. In an economy where you have low  inflation, where you have strong monetary policy put in place by this government, where you have low interest rates, where you have five per cent growth, where you have 90,000 jobs in the last three months, where you have strong job vacancies and where you have a magnificent effort from Australia's exporters, we are riding out what is possibly the most difficult external environment since the Second World War in good shape.Australia's exporters will be helped further by the passing of the government's tax plan. The government's tax plan is going to take $4.5 billion off Australian export costs just at a time when the external markets are turning down. What could be better news for Australian exporters than a new tax plan to take input taxes off exports and give them a fair go in the international arena? That is why this government stands behind exports and jobs, and we call on those oppositionist parties who cannot cope with change and reform to support Australia's exporters and agree to our tax reform.</DOC>

 - It is strange the opposition should talk about rising premiums. This is the group who removed the Commonwealth contribution to the reinsurance pool. This is the group who abolished the Commonwealth bed day subsidy. This is the group who reduced the Medicare rebate for in-hospital services from 85 per cent to 75 per cent. Those three actions alone, according to Access Economics, increased premiums by 39  per cent higher than they would be otherwise, or around $30 a month or $360 a year for the average family. Further, this is the opposition that when in government in 1993 signed a health care agreement that gave the states every encouragement to get private patients out of public hospitals, thereby pushing up the cost structure of the private hospital system and further increasing premiums. This is also the opposition, on the issue of gaps, that in 1995 -  - Thank you, Mr Speaker. I am just setting the scene, but I will certainly give the opposition some joy in just a moment. If you have to compare and contrast, which I intend to, this opposition in government in 1995 passed legislation on gaps. The then health minister got up at the National Press Club and predicted that there would be a range of no-gap products. When I came into government, one of the first things I did as health minister was to ask my department what the predictions were for the number of people who would take up these new products. I was told 20 per cent within two years. On the legislation the previous government passed, in fact you had got less than 0.1 per cent of people taking up no-gap products in two years. It was a complete failure.The shadow minister asked what we have done while we are in government. First of all, we have introduced a private health insurance incentive scheme. Secondly, we have introduced legislation to change the prudential requirements of funds to encourage mergers and encourage funds that are not solvent to keep going. - I am telling them what we have done with the funds, and the opposition does not like to hear it. I would like to keep going. - Thank you very much. It is an answer. The third thing we have done is to work with the funds to promote simplified billing - something that did not exist at all 2½ years ago. The fourth thing is that a substantial range of no-gap products has been introduced, none of which was in operation even 12 months ago. That includes roughly 30 per cent of all services in South Australia and 10 per cent of all services in Victoria.The fifth point is that there has been no health fund premium increase since March this year - something on which we have worked together with the funds. The sixth thing we have done is that the funds have agreed to new arrangements for the reinsurance pool, whereby it will encourage funds to be far more cost effective than they are at the moment. The seventh thing we have done is to introduce legislation that will remove some of the disincentives for in-hospital treatment rather than out-hospital treatment.The eighth thing we have done is that we have got agreement with the funds to delay the premium increase. If this is defeated in the Senate, the premium increase will come through earlier and at a higher level. They are eight things I can think of off the top of my head - which is more than you did in 13 years of government.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for the question. I am aware that on the weekend the MBF health watch survey was released - a survey which, I might say, in the past the Labor Party have been happy to use when it suited them. This was a survey of 512 people done by the Roy Morgan research group over the weekend of 6 to 8 November. It covered a wide variety of issues in health, one of which was whether the Senate should pass the government's legislation. Some 68 per cent of people supported that; only 17 per cent said no. That is a four to one approval in favour of what the government is doing.But that is only part of the story. We are not doing this simply to be popular; we are doing it because we believe it will work and because we have a sound basis for what we are doing. In contrast, the opposition, which continues to carp and be negative, has no plan.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. I know that she and all other members of this House have a real interest in road safety, particularly with the Christmas season just about upon us. I am delighted to be able to say something about an initiative which the Commonwealth has led the charge on and on which the states have now, to their great credit, joined us. In this country, we can take a lot of comfort from the fact that since the 1970s we have overseen a dramatic reduction in the number of fatalities on Australian roads from around 3,700 a year to less than 2,000 a year today. That is even more dramatic when you realise that we have doubled the amount that we travel by motor car in this country.Significant inroads have been made with such things as the taking up of the compulsory wearing of seatbelts. The crackdown on drink driving has had a real impact. So too has better vehicle design, including airbags and increased bus rollover strengths. All of these things have contributed towards the continuing trend.If I may make another observation on the way through: one thing we can all take great pride in in this country is that, commensurate with a rapidly rising standard of quality and reliability in Australian made vehicles - to the point where they are now truly world class - safety has also seen a dramatic rise, to the point where it is world class and, in many cases, well above world class.However, driver fatigue remains a real problem on our national highways. It is one of the things we need to tackle as a nation. Up to 20 per cent of fatal road crashes involve fatigue. So it is that, with the Commonwealth again taking the lead, we are  going to address this problem - a problem which stems largely from people taking long trips without taking adequate rest. They tend to stop only for toileting or eating purposes. They do not plan to break their journeys and rest.Last Friday, in conjunction with my state counterparts in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland, I endorsed the route 39 fatigue management strategy, an action plan for the Melbourne-Brisbane national highway corridor. It brings together the functions of police, coordinators of driver reviver sites, road safety educators, tourism bodies and state road authorities to influence driver behaviour. We think we can significantly reduce the level of accidents and driver fatalities on that vitally important section of road through a mix of surveillance, radio advertisements, billboards, better signposting of rest areas, information in maps and tourist brochures, and other measures.Assuming it is a success - and we will certainly monitor it closely - we will seek to extend the strategy right across Australia's highways. I know that all members join with me in expressing the hope that motorists will take care and will look after their safety and the safety of their families over the Christmas break.</DOC>

 - I will be delighted to visit that facility, or indeed any  other facility in Australia, as I am doing on a regular basis. - Indeed I will. Thank you, Prime Minister. I will be very pleased to tell the people who live in those facilities, as I do on a regular basis, that there is a two-pronged attack from the government to deal with the provision of proper care for aged people and for people who want independent living arrangements. It will be a simple matter to tell them that, by increasing the number of home care packages, as we are doing, those people who live in independent living arrangements will be able to do so for longer and that where they are in need of health related services that will be GST free in accordance with the rest of our package.I will also be pleased to tell people that we are planning to have a greater degree of accountability in the way taxpayers' dollars are spent in residential care and that the policy we have put in place is one that is fair and is designed to ensure that the Australian people can continue to see our welfare system delivered because we have a new tax reform which will enable them to afford it.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Mitchell for his question and for his involvement in the Hills Hawkesbury initiative for excellence, which does fine work with job seekers and employers in his electorate. -  - You're just jealous, Martin. - I am aware of an article in the Sydney Morning Herald  this morning entitled `Long-term jobless are being dudded', in which the distinguished commentator Ross Gittins criticises the practice but not the theory of the Job Network. In theory, he says, it is a great scheme, but he does make some criticisms about the practice. They are serious criticisms and they deserve a serious response.The first criticism is that the government has replaced labour market programs with Work for the Dole. The problem with the labour market programs under Working Nation is that they were hugely expensive and largely ineffective in getting the long-term unemployed into work. It has been estimated that the New Work Opportunities program, for instance, cost $143,000 per extra job created. Don Harding of the Melbourne Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research said:The valuations clearly suggest that labour market programs were in general not cost effective in getting the unemployed into jobs. Thus, the cutting of expenditure on labour market programs represents a major reduction in wastage of public funds and is therefore to be welcomed.No-one says that work for the dole is a miracle cure for the long-term unemployed, but the fact is that results of the pilot program suggest that 30 per cent of participants are going into employment or training, and that is comparable to the results obtained by the much more expensive Working Nation program.The second criticism of Mr Gittins is what he calls the `obvious danger' that Job Network members will take the up-front money attaching to the long-term unemployed but not invest the performance component of intensive assistance in reskilling the unemployed. This criticism is quite misconceived because the organisations which provide the heart of the Job Network - such as Mission Australia, the Salvation Army, Centrecare and the Brotherhood of St Laurence - are completely dedicated to the welfare of the unemployed. The idea that those organisations would rip anyone off is simply wrong.It is too early to be dogmatic about exactly what the intensive assistance money will be  spent on, but I have a model of what it might be spent on by a for-profit provider. It includes provision of work tools, boots and clothing, usually up to $200; provision of fares assistance, vouchers, et cetera, up to $500; validation of overseas professional qualifications, up to $1,000; English language training, up to $800; training subsidies, up to $1,200; and up-front training and reskilling and industry based courses, around $500 per trainee. Finally, Mr Gittins says:. . . 'outcomes' are all the go.This government is happy to be judged on outcomes. As the House knows, in November last year the old CES got just 15,000 unemployed people on benefit into work. As I told the House last week, in November this year the Job Network got 22,400 unemployed people into work. Unfortunately, that figure did not include the last day of the month, and the correct figure is 23,700 unemployed people on benefit into work. That is 50 per cent higher than the old CES.Not only is the Job Network putting more people into work, it is putting more long-term unemployed into jobs. In the period July to October last year, 30 per cent of those placed in work by the CES were long-term unemployed. In the same period this year, 42 per cent of those placed in work were long-term unemployed. On every score, the Job Network is doing better. The Job Network is not perfect but it is doing well and it will do even better with the changes the government has in mind. - I did quote from one document. - It is, as a matter of fact, Mr Speaker.</DOC>

 - The government's tax reforms will be of enormous benefit to families with school-age children. They will be of great benefit to schools, both government and non-government. They will reduce the overall cost of schooling in Australia, according to Treasury estimates, by some $240 million a year. They will leave the average family some $40 to $50 per week better off. You would think that everybody would be delighted with the effects of these tax reforms.The specific question of the shadow minister is based on a complete misapprehension. There is no distinction whatsoever drawn in the tax legislation between government and non-government schools. Any suggestion that there is discrimination in this legislation between government and non-government schools is false. - As I said, parents will be much better off as a result of this tax reform - all parents, whether they send their children to a government or to a non-government school. It ill behoves the opposition to continue trying to draw distinctions between parents who exercise their choice and choose a non-government school and parents who choose a government school. Tutoring connected with any school will be GST free. Parents will benefit from this legislation, because if a tutor is associated with a school in the provision of tutoring and that tutoring is for the curriculum then that tutoring will be GST free. No distinction is drawn between a school, whether it is government or non-government.</DOC>

 - To ensure the Olympic Games translate into long-term economic benefits for Australians, the Australian government has established a number of initiatives to maximise the business spin-offs from the games. Investment 2000 is one of those key initiatives, which we are undertaking in conjunction with the New South Wales government. Whilst I am wary of the need not to go over the top with regard to the Olympics, there is certainly a job generating gain to be had from the momentum associated with the Investment 2000 program.The potential benefits from this initiative will include some $250 million in net foreign exchange earnings for Australian companies, between $500 million and $1 billion in new investment for Australian industry, and some 2,000 new jobs. Australia has a unique opportunity at the start of a new century and a new millennium to use the event of the Olympics - a magnificent sporting occasion - to  translate that into enduring business benefit and enduring jobs, not just for Sydney but for investment projects beyond Sydney.I very much thank the member for his long interest in this particular subject. Bruce Baird, before entering federal parliament, put his shoulder to the wheel to help Australia and Sydney capture the Olympic nomination.Investment 2000 is being facilitated by the Austrade agency of the federal government. The momentum associated with Investment 2000 continues to build. It will mean that Australia and Australians get a lasting benefit from the Olympics at the start of a new millennium.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I am not aware of the specific treatment that he raises with me but, if it is true, it is a very exciting prospect. I would be a little cautious though. Having been involved for many years with health and science, there are often very grand claims made by practitioners that do not always bear out in clinical practice.That said, one of the big reforms we have made has been to introduce the Medicare Services Advisory Committee, MSAC, which is now operating under the chairmanship of Professor David Weedon from Queensland. This has taken away the political element in trying to determine what goes on to or comes off the Medicare benefits schedule. It looks at - in a cool, calm, scientific manner - new procedures coming onto the Medicare benefits schedule. This sounds like a perfect type of procedure for MSAC to look at, because they have the scientific and technical capability. As soon as the appropriate colleges alert my department that this is something for us to look at, I would be happy to refer it to MSAC. If the potential claims are true, I think it could be a very exciting procedure.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. It is a very important one, and I would like to say a few things about this matter. At the outset, I would like to say that I have been keeping in very close contact indeed with the Director of Aviation Safety on these matters and have been since the moment I became the minister responsible for this portfolio.The demonstration in the Canberra-Ballina region of class G airspace introduces new operating rules. That class G airspace, which is the airspace between the ground and 8½ thousand feet, is now seeing a process of international standardisation. The key feature of the demonstration is that it introduces radar based traffic information in that airspace for the first time, subject to availability. The use of that radar is aimed at improving air safety. - The person who asked the question now asks me for my professional advice on air safety. It needs to be recognised that the model set up by the member for Kingsford-Smith, when he was the minister for aviation, clearly set up CASA as the body responsible for air safety in this country. - I suggest that the member for Dickson should go and have a look at how the model was set up. It makes CASA responsible for air safety. I am responsible for matters of governance, and that is an appropriate model. The only problem with the Labor Party's model was that they claimed  they put a board with appropriate expertise in place, and we had to fix that aspect of it - and you will remember how difficult it was for the then minister to achieve that objective. We sorted that problem out. The Leader of the Opposition talks about accountability. We made certain that the Australian people have a set of arrangements which work and which they can have confidence in.Let us come back to the very real issues. I am surprised that the member for Dickson wants to interrupt. I have indicated that this is a serious matter, and there are a couple of things I would like to say to the House that I think ought to go onto the public record. In view of the seriousness of these concerns expressed by, in part, the Air Force and, more recently, by Pearl Aviation over the weekend, I point out that Pearl Aviation are in discussions today. All services are operating, and that particularly applies to the air ambulance in New South Wales. In relation to the broader issues raised by people like the RAAF, I specifically sought advice from the director of aviation, the man who has had 27 years of experience in aviation with Cathay Pacific. I want to read a couple of excerpts from his advice to me and then table that full advice, because I think it is in the public interest that it be tabled. Mr Toller stated:I believe that the criticism of the Class `G' demonstration is not soundly based on legitimate safety issues and reflects, to some degree, an understandable resistance to change in airspace arrangements that have existed for decades. -  - I would have thought this was an important matter for the Australian community to be advised about. I think it is therefore appropriate that we have on the public record what the director of civil aviation in this country has to say. He continued by saying:I do not believe that the removal of DTI - that is, directed traffic information - is a genuine safety concern for any operations in this area, including those of the RAAF. I have been informed that the RAAF operate frequently in this airspace using a `no com' procedure where no radio contact is maintained with either Flight Service or other aircraft. I accept the advice of the director of air safety in this country. He was put there for very sound reasons under a structure put in place by the then Minister for Transport after the tragic Monarch and Seaview air crashes. Mr Toller concludes his letter by saying:I am convinced that, overall, the Class `G' airspace demonstration is safer than the previous DTI system, and is nowhere less safe. To revert to the old system would be a retrograde step.As I advised in a number of personal briefings on the `G' airspace demonstration, I will immediately announce the cancellation of this demonstration in the event that any genuine safety concerns are identified by CASA or BASI.Mr Speaker, I table the letter.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I note that the last part of his question was: what does it mean for businesses in his area and elsewhere? The answer is that it means a significant amount. The plans recently covered in the press - and I have some of it here - are for a $200 million international container terminal proposal with an eventual capacity of up to 500,000 TEUs per annum for the port of Newcastle. I think that more than anything else this demonstrates quite clearly that our reforms on the waterfront are attracting serious investment in major new infrastructures, which can only be to the benefit of the entire nation and particularly those people who depend upon the facilitation of our trade, which is nearly everyone in regional Australia. It is the sort of question that seems to be avoided by the opposite number that I have here - perhaps for good reason.The announcement of a $6 million feasibility study, to be undertaken by BHP, Leighton Contractors and P&amp;O Ports and completed by the end of the first quarter 1999, is very good  news. It demonstrates their confidence in the reforms that we have put in place - greater efficiency, greater reliability, better service to customers - at the same time as it means more opportunities for regional development. - Which is much needed in your region but also much needed in areas like Western Sydney where, as a result of the sort of transport infrastructure that is now in place, industrial development can also be considerably enhanced by the prospect of this sort of development. This is very welcome but, above all else, it is testimony to the fact that the private sector believes that our reforms are lasting, substantial and provide the impetus needed for further investment in jobs and economic development in regional areas.</DOC>

 - Again, I thank the honourable member for her question. I think that the question of aviation safety in general and of airspace management in particular is one on which we all acknowledge that safety is paramount. In relation to class E in general, I can tell the House that there was the successful introduction of class E airspace in what is known as the Canberra-Ballina corridor earlier this year. -  - If members opposite are interested in the answer to the question, I will give it to them in a moment. There was a  problem last week in relation to a further rolling out of class E, which has been successfully trialled, is now bedded down and supported for its enhanced procedural and safety aspects in that corridor between Canberra and Ballina. There was an industrial disputation essentially over the width of the corridor last week, and an agreement was made to triple the width of the corridor. That is to be reviewed at the end of the period which, as you indicated, is in a few days time. - As I say, if you are interested in the answer, the fact of the matter is -  - I would expect you to say that. The fact of the matter is that this class E airspace has been successfully introduced in that corridor of Canberra-Ballina, as it is known. It is now being wound out. There was a disagreement about how wide the corridor should be - five kilometres either side of centre or not. It was agreed initially to try 15 each side of centre, and that will be reviewed in due course in the normal way.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dunkley for his question. I know he is particularly interested in preventing hearing loss in Australians, which is both a question of quality of life for Australians and also a question of cost to the community as a whole. It is quite true that there has been a new, innovative test applied for early detection of potential for hearing loss. -  - Thank you, Mr Speaker. It is true that this new test has been developed. Australia is at the forefront of research into hearing disability. Indeed, it is the Australian Acoustics Laboratory which has developed this test which tests how many hair cells are lost from the cochlear, which determines whether or not there is to be hearing loss in the future. What we are able to detect is that, with a diminishing number of cells, the potential for hearing loss increases and a critical mass can be reached whereby the ability to hear is lessened. The warning is this: if you, as a young person, are listening to stereos for six hours a week -  - and the person sitting next to you can also hear what is coming from those headphones, then it is too loud. - Part and parcel of my portfolio responsibilities is Australian Hearing Services. It may come as news to those on the opposite side, because they never do listen anyway, that very simply the question of loss of hearing -  - I know you can't hear. - Thank you, Mr Speaker. It would perhaps be an advantage for the chamber as a whole if they did listen not only to me but to you as well. - Returning to the question per se, there is a strong warning to young people that listening to their personal stereo too loud and too long will give them an impaired hearing loss in their early 20s. -  - Of course, by the time they get to their 60s, that will be of great disadvantage to them. - Thank you, Mr Speaker. The point I want to make - and perhaps those of you in the chamber can take the message out to your electorates - is to young people to look after their hearing. In Australia we are at the leading edge of research. We have developed a test which will give early warning to people and, if they pay heed, their hearing can be saved.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I can say to the honourable member that, under the Labor  Party's tax system, average earners are now facing a marginal income tax rate of 43 cents in the dollar, plus the Medicare levy of 44½ cents in the dollar. The Labor Party opposes the reduction of marginal income tax rates because it refuses to support the reform of the Australian taxation system. The Labor Party opposes the reduction of marginal income tax rates on average earners. - The member for Corio does not seem to know what his own policy is. The Labor Party opposes the reduction of marginal income tax rates for average earners. It would not be the case that the tax rate was 43c for the average earner in Australia if a previous attempt to lower income tax had gone through. The House would be well aware that, prior to the 1993 election, by an act called `an act to amend the law relating to income tax' in 1992, this parliament passed a law reducing the tax to 30 per cent on what are, today, average weekly earnings. That was not a promise - that was l-a-w.That l-a-w tax cut of 1992 was never put in place, not even for one day. It is still on the statute books. The Labor Party passed an act to reduce income tax rates. They said it was l-a-w. It is still on the statute books and it did not apply for one day. As a consequence, average earners in Australia are now facing a 43c income tax marginal rate. Only if this government's tax reform is put through will average earners in Australia get lower marginal income tax rates.In addition to the relief for average income earners and families - which Labor opposes - there is good reason on economic grounds to cut marginal income tax rates. Cutting marginal income tax rates will help this country in relation to productivity, savings, incentives and the reduction of effective marginal tax rates. Lower personal income tax rates are good economic policy in themselves, but they are being opposed by the Australian Labor Party. On this side, we welcome the opportunity to make good and do better than the fraud of the Labor Party - when it took away the income tax l-a-w - and give families and average income earners lower income taxes  and to see a new tax system for a new century.</DOC>

Some of these experts have a clear vested interest in a public dominated health care system, such as the Australian Hospitals Association and the Doctors Reform Society.  Others among the rest quoted have a stated preference for a residual role only for the private sector, such as the Consumers Health Forum, the Council for the Ageing, Mr Roy Harvey and Professor Douglas. This is essentially a personal preference as distinct from any academic or intellectual position.The Democrats' option would not work. First of all, our plan is to encourage all Australians to take out private health insurance. The universal nature of Medicare is that every taxpayer pays for Medicare whether they need it or whether they don't. It is only fair, then, that every taxpayer should receive a benefit if they choose to make an extra contribution of their own income, whether they use it or not. Secondly, the Democrats' proposal would have an adverse impact on the middle and higher income people who are in fact the largest group of people falling out of private health insurance. Thirdly, those higher income earners are people who by and large do not draw heavily on private health insurance. Lower income earners, usually because of their age, are heavy drawers on the private health system. So that balance of having higher income people who are lower users maintains community rating for those lower income, generally older, higher users. The fact is that if you artificially bring in a whole lot of heavy drawers on the system you will push premiums up, not down.Fourthly, the Democrats' proposal would be highly complex. We have found one of the drawbacks of the current health incentive scheme is its complexity, that you have to apply for it annually. The public, as we have found in research we have done, is very wary of a means test, believing that even if they qualify it may not be for them. If we take up the Democrats' proposal, we will not treat any of the problems, we will only be treating the symptoms, and we will find we are back to exactly where we started.</DOC>

 - That clearly shows that the Labor Party does not understand the basic problems with health. It is more of their carping, negative opposition for the sake of it. What it will do is maintain community rating, prop up the people who are dropping out of health insurance faster than anything else, and slow down the rate of premiums and put them off for a couple of months. The earlier premium increases at a higher level than they would be otherwise will be absolutely your fault.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. I have seen such proposals as put out by the Labor Party. Again, they fail to understand the complexity of the whole system. I have a copy of a letter from the Australian Podiatry Association.  Podiatry is one of the reasonably large users of ancillary benefits. This letter states:The members of the Australian Podiatry Association in South Australia wish to express their concern and alarm at the comments from Jenny Macklin that ancillary health cover should be exempted from the rebate. We are very aware of the great need in the community of ancillary health services such as podiatry that enable people to remain mobile and thus live independently.I note a letter from the President of the Australian Physiotherapy Association, who says:The fact is there are significant waiting lists across the public hospital system for patients needing access to physiotherapy services. Including extras insurance in the government package would provide incentives for some individuals to access physiotherapy services in the private sector. By providing such an incentive, waiting lists can be reduced and the public sector may be capable of focusing on those who are in the greatest need or the most disadvantaged.The fact is that, if you look at ancillary benefits paid in the last financial year, 1997-98, 56 per cent were for dental, 16 per cent for optical, seven per cent for physiotherapy, seven per cent for chiropractic, three per cent for pharmacy, four per cent for podiatry, 1.2 per cent for prostheses and appliances and one per cent for ambulance services. Then there are a number of things below one per cent. These are many things accessed by low income people. These are things not available on Medicare. These are items that have very limited capacity to be provided in the public system. If we did not provide assistance for them, Australians would find that they would have significantly less access than they do now.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. I make the point that if she were to spend some time in rural and regional Australia she would find there is a very deep commitment to private health insurance. That is in fact reflected in the very high membership of the private health providers in rural and regional Australia, as in fact has been indicated in this place by none other than the Prime Minister on occasion.The fact of the matter is that it is a reality of life for many rural people that, for quite a range of medical services they need from time to time, they do have to travel, either to capital cities or to major regional centres. The last thing they need is to be told, right in the middle of something like harvest or shearing, that an opportunity for their surgery or whatever has suddenly become available.They need hospitals of choice, doctors of choice and some control over when they might be able to receive the attention that they need. I am absolutely amazed that you would raise the prospect of rural people being prepared to support your absurd position in relation to this issue.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Menzies for his question. It is very pleasing to be able to inform the House of this new initiative of the government. The government has approved in principle the establishment of a federal magistracy. It is envisaged that it will service the Federal Court and the Family Court and will thereby significantly improve access to justice. The federal magistrates will be able to deal with less complex matters, freeing up judges to deal with the more difficult cases that take longer time. There will be simpler and less formal procedures in the summary court and that will be less expensive and more expeditious for the litigants.The proposal does sit well with other reforms the government has initiated to reduce delays. I refer in particular to the expansion of funding for alternative dispute resolution, arbitration, counselling and mediation, particularly in the Family Court. This is a very positive proposal which should provide benefits to those areas, particularly rural and regional areas, that are not serviced by judges' circuits. Speedy passage of the relevant legislation, particularly through the Senate, would help provide the benefits earlier, and I urge the opposition to get behind this excellent initiative.</DOC>

Now I have a question from the opposition complaining that some do and some don't. The fact is your question last Thursday was wrong and the Leader of the Opposition's interjections across the table were wrong.

 - I thank the honourable member for his interest in this particular matter. I am very pleased to report to the House that, in only three weeks time, around a quarter of a million extra Australians will be eligible to receive the Commonwealth seniors health card. This is an important initiative by this government, and I am pleased to report that it has passed the parliament. I hope the goodwill that was associated with that measure, which is unambiguously good for self-funded retirees, will soon flow through to the private health insurance rebate as well, because that is another important initiative for self-funded retirees.Close to a quarter of a million self-funded retirees, including about 20,000 veterans, will be eligible now for the seniors health card because the government has extended the income limit for people who are eligible to receive this card. For single people, the income limit has been extended from $22,320 to $40,000, and for a couple from $35,620 to $67,000. Those are very generous income limits now, and the effect of that will be that many self-funded retirees will be eligible for this card.	One of the major benefits that they will receive is access to the concessional rate under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme - $3.20 for their prescriptions and, after 52 prescriptions, they will get them free.One other thing I would like to report to the House is that a new application form has been prepared. It has been very much simplified. Most people will simply have to provide their taxation notice and fill out a few details. The forms will be available in Centrelink offices next week. I would encourage the seniors of  Australia to access this form, and access this benefit which starts on 1 January next year.</DOC>

 - May I thank the member for Hinkler for raising this matter today which I know is of interest to many members on the government benches and, indeed, members opposite who have taken a keen interest in the Child Support Agency, the formula and many of the other issues associated with the fair delivery of income support for Australian families.The changes to the Child Support Scheme which have now passed the parliament and will take effect from 1 July have certainly been long awaited. There are quite a large number of changes. They reflect the very important principle which this government has always emphasised - that children are the financial responsibility of their parents. The second important principle is that government should not seek to interfere unnecessarily in people's lives. The government will continue to provide a safety net, but fundamentally the responsibility for care for children rests with their parents.Under the new tax system, around 22,500 families will be better off as a result of the government changes to the child support arrangements. But as far as the amendments to the act - which has now been supported by the parliament - are concerned, there are a number of very significant new initiatives. Parents will be encouraged to deal directly with each other, rather than go through the Child Support Agency, whenever those arrangements are able to work satisfactorily. The amount of income that a non-custodial parent will be able to earn will rise by 10 per  cent before the amount of the child support payment is calculated. The amount that a custodial parent can earn before their payments are affected will fall. Income earned overseas and the effects of negative gearing will be treated differently under the new arrangements to ensure a fairer assessment of income.In addition, in an important new initiative, 150,000 payees will be better off because of the introduction of the minimum payment - everyone will be paying a minimum of $260 a year. There are a large number of reforms incorporated in this new legislation that go a long way to meeting the government's commitment to improve the child support arrangements. We recognise that more work still needs to be done. I would like to compliment the large group of government members who have been a part of developing these proposals and have worked long and hard in putting together a practical option that trades off the interests of both custodial parents and non-custodial parents in the best possible way to ensure the welfare of children.We know there is more to be done. The government is committed to moving to stage 3 of the reform proposals as quickly as possible. I commend these changes to the House. I think they will make a significant improvement. I assure the House that we will be reporting back, hopefully in the next calendar year, with new initiatives to further enhance these reforms.</DOC>

 - The government has taken the view, as I told the House last year, that people should know the price that they have to pay at the checkout, and that will be the price that the goods are advertised at. With regard to a price inclusive of taxes, why was it that the Australian Labor Party's wholesale sales tax was hidden in every item in every good? Why was it that the Australian Labor Party never told you that when you went to buy your toothpaste you paid 22 per cent tax? - The government has one rate across all goods and services which everybody knows about. There is nothing hidden; it is 10 per cent. Everybody knows about it. - It is across the board, the point that you have been making, genius, in this House of Representatives. But what did the Labor Party do with the wholesale sales tax? They hid it in every price. They still go on with it, Mr Speaker. Did the Australian Labor Party say that there is 22 per cent on your toothpaste? Did the Australian Labor Party say that there is 22 per cent on your paper? Did the Australian Labor Party say that there is 22 per cent on your biros? - Mr Speaker, he always yells the loudest when he is the wrongest. He hates it. He sits there and he tries to knock us off our game because he is trying to cover up a 22 per cent hidden tax. - Mr Speaker, not only is it up front, because everybody knows it is 10 per cent, but they know it is a uniform rate. The beauty of Labor's wholesale sales tax was that you could have 12, 22, 32, 41, 45 or 47 per cent. Nobody actually knew what it was, it varied and it was hidden, which gave the Australian Labor Party the opportunity to take the 10 per cent rate to 12 per cent, the 20 per cent rate to 22 per cent and the 30 per cent rate to 32 per cent, hidden, without one dollar of compensation.We on this side of the House are proud that we are going to sweep away Labor's wholesale sales tax. We are going to make this open and transparent. We are going to make a new tax system for a new century. This is the party of the future; that is the party of the past.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for New England for his question. I am reminded of the fact that he represents an economic region which is very diverse in its export effort, ranging from services such as the international pilot training taking place at Tamworth - and I hope to attend a graduation dinner this week - through to a small company, Jakab Industries at Tamworth, and also Ruddweigh at Guyra, which is exporting weighing equipment to South America. That reflects the diversity of our export effort.I advise the House that total exports during the 10 months to October are up by 6.5 per cent. Exports to non-East Asia are up by almost 23 per cent. Significantly, this week, exports to Italy are up by 12 per cent, and exports to South Africa are up by 8.3 per cent.We had the visit to Australia this week by the Italian President. We also have the visit of the South African Minister for Trade, Alec Irwin, to Parliament House this day for the  joint ministerial commission between Australia and South Africa.Our exports continue to grow and to diversify in terms of location - to places like South Africa, South America, the Middle East, Europe and elsewhere - and also in terms of content. This is helping to secure jobs in the export sector. Indeed, our ratio of exports to GDP is now around 20 per cent and nearly 1.7 million jobs are linked to our export efforts in both goods and services. We are not going to be complacent about this at the start of a second term. We have reactivated the Market Development Task Force, under the chair of Dr Ashton Calvert, to push the bilaterals strongly.We have been involved with various regional initiatives and I will continue to push the envelope of lateral thinking to bring about further breakthroughs at that level and, at the multilateral level, we prepare for the World Trade Organisation ministerial next year in the USA. We mean business in activating and further expanding our trade agenda. I am pleased to inform the House that the 1999 trade outcomes and objectives statement will be presented to parliament on 11 February, at the start of next year's sittings.</DOC>

 - One-eleventh. - One-eleventh. - Mr Speaker, I answered the question: one-eleventh. What is his big point - it is a complicated calculation to divide 138 by 11? Is that your big point? - It is so simple. It is still one-eleventh. It is one-eleventh of any number you choose to bring out. Let me make the point about simplicity. It is simple compared with Labor's wholesale sales tax. Let me quote:. . . Australia already has a wholesale sales tax on many manufactured goods . . . the problem is that it does not . . . work properly. It taxes goods, such as cars, white goods and kitchenware, but not services, such as repairs, entertainment and restaurants. It has many anomalies. It has high rates such as 20 and 32½ per cent -  - It is simple, because it is one-eleventh, and there is one rate. It simplifies the current system which has so many anomalies, as I said. I quote:It has many anomalies. It has high rates -  - I will conclude very briefly. I quote:. . . the problem - with the wholesale sales tax - is that it does not work . . . properly. It taxes goods, such as cars, white goods and kitchenware, but not services, such as repairs, entertainment and restaurants. It has many anomalies. It has high rates such as 20 and 32½ per cent because it is imposed on a relatively narrow range of goods.And it has a high price effect - Who said that? It was the Australian Labor Party in their paper of July 1985 on why the wholesale sales tax should be abolished - and I table it.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Fairfax for his question. I can inform the House that the sale of ANL, the Australian National Line, is almost complete. The government has completed the sale of the liner shipping business to CGM, a French based international shipping company, for approximately $10 million. In addition to that $10 million, CGM has taken over the net financing obligations of the Commonwealth of about $50 million. In addition, all of the Australian National Line liner employees have agreed to accept offers of employment from CGM. The sale of this business has significantly reduced the exposure of taxpayers to the business losses that have arisen over a  number of years; that is, the operations of Australian National Line. In addition, we have provided a commercial future for the business as part of this international operation. Only this week I received a letter from CGM indicating that they were looking forward to developing their presence in the Australasian market.The rest of ANL will, I am confident, be disposed of in the near future. The government determined, after a very significant scoping study, to sell the business in part. The negotiations with the preferred purchaser in respect of Australian National Line's bulk business are progressing well, as are the negotiations for the land based businesses. They are proceeding in an orderly fashion.To go to the second part of the question - how does this contrast with the attempts that were made previously to dispose of ANL? - this quiet achievement stands in stark contrast to the woeful attempts by the former Labor government to dispose of ANL. It was announced way back in 1991 in the budget when the Labor government said, `We're going to sell the Australian National Line.' We were then treated to daily headlines that centred on the very inept attempts to sell this business. Those headlines related to the concessions that they gave to the union movement and the protection that they built in. Finally, after about four years, it all fizzled out. But I still recall so well the words of the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith, when he said, `It's not a case of selling this business; you couldn't give it away.' What we saw while this went on were accumulated losses to the Australian taxpayers on the balance sheet of ANL since 1991 of $180.5 million. In the last 10 years it has cost the Australian taxpayers around $250 million. We have stemmed the losses; we have received some money for it. It shows how this government is prepared to operate the business of government in a proper fashion in the interests of the taxpayers of Australia, whereas the former Labor government was simply stuck in a hole because they had no capacity to do anything that interfered with their union masters. </DOC>

But I have to say probably the strangest support for what the government is doing was recently drawn to my attention. I have a press release here that states:Health economists have proved that, to attract new members, premiums would have to be reduced by 30 per cent.That press release dated February 1996 came from the then Minister for Human Services and Health, Dr Carmen Lawrence. -  - Clearly, when they were in government they understood what needed to be done to help private health  insurance, but now they are in opposition they are prepared to say something totally different. -  - This just highlights the fact that what is happening with the Labor Party is that they are being carping, negative and opportunistic. They do not understand health and, if you do not understand health, you can't fix it.</DOC>

 - The government's new tax system will make education more affordable for parents and more accessible to children around Australia. Under the government's new tax system education will be GST free and current taxes which are pushing up the cost of education will be abolished. One of  the effects of this new tax system will be to reduce the costs of delivering schooling by some $240 million a year. This will come about because the government will be abolishing the tax system favoured by the Labor Party, the wholesale sales tax. Labor's wholesale sales tax is adding some $240 million a year to the cost of education. Over a period of four years, almost $1 billion has been taken out of the schools to fund Labor's wholesale sales tax. One of the most positive effects of the government's tax reform will be to reduce this $1 billion impost on schools by removing the tax system which Labor favours.In addition, the government will also be reducing personal income tax. The average family with children will be some $40 to $50 per week better off. Day by day, Labor's tax is imposing additional costs on everyday items which parents have to buy to support the education of their children. Labor's 22 per cent wholesale sales tax is putting up the price of A4 paper, exercise books, notebooks, pens and pencils, rulers, erasers, calculators and backpacks. The price of every one of these items has increased as a result of Labor's taxes. The government's new tax system will remove this tax burden from Australian families.One of the biggest challenges for families today in financing education is the cost of computers. As Australia moves into the information age and schools and parents are increasingly seeking to give their children these vital skills, Labor wants to put up the cost of computers. Labor has a 22 per cent wholesale sales tax on computers. The government will be reducing the cost of computers. - Tuition provided by schools as part of the curriculum will also be GST free and the price will come down. It is time for the Leader of the Opposition to face up to the fact that Labor is 10 years and more behind in its thinking on Australia's tax system, and the Leader of the Opposition knows that. As the member for Werriwa informed us in the 7.30 Report  on 20 October this year, in April 1996 Kim Beazley said to him that `Australian Labor had fallen 10 years behind compa  rable parties in our policy development and ideas'. The member for Werriwa went on to say, `If that was the case then, we have probably got as much ground to make up now.'It is time for Labor to face up to the fact that its tax system is pricing education up and up. Education will be more accessible and affordable under the government's new tax system.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I have noted the report by the ACA as it was tabled yesterday. The member fundamentally misunderstands the report because it is a compilation of the various data released through the year. The government has already responded to the matters raised in the report. - For instance, in January we introduced the customer service guarantee -  - We have acted on the issues brought forward by the ACA throughout the year. As I said, on 1 January we introduced the customer service scheme so that customers will be compensated if performance falls below certain minimum standards. Secondly, from 1 August the government introduced the penalty to $40 a day if Telstra failed to improve its service levels. Moreover, the minister advises me that he is looking at ways to tighten even further, following on from the report of the ACA, the customer service guarantee. And remember also that the government has said that we are not going to agree to any further sale of Telstra beyond 49.9 per cent until the independent inquiry assesses Telstra service levels as adequate in country areas as well as in metropolitan areas.I point out that another part of our response throughout the year has been to introduce legislation giving the ACA power to direct Telstra to take action to correct systematic failures and faults in regard to provision of performance services or face the fine of up to $10 million - all requirements on Telstra that the previous Labor government never introduced.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for her question, because I am aware of the concern she has for aged care within her own electorate. Very simply, this report of the Auditor-General's Office entitled The planning of aged care  drew on 10 years of experience under the Labor Party from 1986 through to 1996. It showed very simply that we had inherited a lousy Labor legacy. It showed that they set a target of having 100 aged care places per 1000 people over the age of 70 years. In 1986 at the time they set the targets it was at 98.3. By 1996 they had dropped it to 93.4. That meant that we were 10,000 places short. In other words, they had  dropped funding over that period by $1.5 billion. We are yet again in the position of having to fix up that lousy legacy. By the year 2000, we will have reached that target. - By the year 2002, we will have 103 places per 1000. By the year 2001 we will have 100. Just so the Leader of the Opposition can understand, here is a graph. -  - Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I only prepared the chart because I know that those on the other side have a great deal of difficulty grasping concepts. On that basis, I would like to table it. -  - Thank you, Mr Speaker. I simply conclude by saying that we inherited a lousy Labor legacy and, as usual, we are fixing it up. I table the graph so that it may be incorporated in Hansard .</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question and for her  interest in this area. Last week I launched two reports from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare. There was the first ever report on breast and cervical cancer screening over 1996-97 and on breast cancer survival over the period 1982 to 1994.I will take the cancers separately. Breast cancer is clearly an important cancer. One in eleven women will have breast cancer during their lifetime. Some 1.3 million Australian women were screened for breast cancer over a 12-month period. This picked up a large number of small cancers. About one in 700 women who were screened in the target group - which is 50 to 69 years - actually had a small cancer picked up.The survival rate from breast cancer is good. Over 90 per cent of women are alive two years later. If you look at the period 1983 to 1990, the survival rate from breast cancer is going up. If you were diagnosed with breast cancer in 1983, your chance of surviving for five years was 74 per cent. In 1990, if you were diagnosed with breast cancer, your chance of survival had gone up to 79 per cent - a five per cent improvement. The chances of survival for a woman who was diagnosed with breast cancer today would almost certainly be much higher than 79 per cent. The exact figure will take five years to know.This puts us in a very good position internationally. Our survival rate for breast cancer for women is higher than in countries such as England, the Netherlands and Spain. It is comparable with or better than in most Scandinavian countries. One country that does do better than us is the USA, but that is only for white women - the survival rate for black women is substantially below ours. Our survival rate gives a very great reason to hope.Cervical cancer is the other cancer examined. This is one of the few cancers that can be picked up at a precancerous stage. The number of women screened over a two-year period was 2.6 million - a massive effort around Australia. Over the period 1982 to 1994, there has been a very dramatic decrease in the incidence of cancer of the cervix. It has gone down 36 per cent. At the same time, the  number of precancerous legions being picked up has gone up dramatically. The simple fact is that we have reduced mortality from cancer of the cervix in Australia by 40 per cent over that period. Again, that is something the country can be very proud of. Obviously, there is a lot more to do, but it shows that, with cancers such as this, concerted national effort can make a very great difference. It also shows the need to take a very long-term approach in health because these successes have taken 15 years to achieve.</DOC>

 - In response to this very sophisticated question from the shadow minister for small business, I inform him that  the small business community reckons that fixing up the tax system is one of the most important things we can do. In all the surveys - the one during the election, for example - they were asked to nominate the most important issues -  - A few more seconds will do to dispose of the question, Mr Speaker. The fact is that small business reckons it is a great idea. We have announced a small business consultative committee which will be working with the government to ensure that we have the best possible system for small business. - How many jobs are there in this? The new tax system is very good for jobs. That is why we are in favour of it, and that is why you are against it.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Barker for the question. This question refers to the government's farmers retirement assistance scheme which, for the first time, addresses the issues of intergenerational farm transfer - something which Labor did nothing about. The legacy that Labor left this government in primary industry has made this scheme very important. Under this scheme, farmers are able to retire, transfer their property to a succeeding generation and be given special concessions under the assets and  income test to be eligible for the pension. That has meant that a significant number of farmers have been able to pass their farms on to the succeeding generation so that the property can continue to be worked in a productive way while they enjoy a normal and happy retirement.I am happy to be able to report in response to the honourable member's question that, to date, some 210 customers have successfully applied under this scheme and are now receiving either an increased pension or a full pension that they would not have been eligible for had it not been for this government initiative. The department has currently received about 550 applications, and so there has obviously been a very warm response to the scheme in the rural community. It is already providing very real benefits to farm families.For the information of the honourable member for Barker, I am sure he would be pleased to know that there are some seven successful applicants from his electorate. That demonstrates that this scheme is working in his part of Australia, as it is in many rural parts of Australia. This has been an outstanding initiative by the government and it is going to have real rewards for the Australian farming community.</DOC>

 - The member for Dobell clearly does not listen. He is the authentic spokesman for the intellectual vacuum which exists in the Labor Party on education policy. I have already had the opportunity to explain to the House that the effect of the government's new tax system will in fact be to reduce costs to schools. Schools will have more resources available to them because we will not be ripping out of schools the billion dollars in wholesale sales tax costs that are indirectly flowing through into schools at present under the tax system favoured by the Labor Party. - We are now seeing that the Labor Party's attack on the government's new tax system is based on a complete ignorance of how the wholesale sales tax system which they support applies. Schools have to claim exemption from wholesale sales tax. Wholesale sales tax cascades through into the costs of items which schools pay for. The abolition of the wholesale sales tax is one of the major reasons why schools will save some $240 million. The Leader of the Opposition does not like to hear this, but over a four-year  period the effect of that additional cost on schools resulting from Labor's wholesale sales tax system is an additional $1 billion worth of costs on schools; just under one billion dollars worth. - The Leader of the Opposition is once again demonstrating that he does not understand the significance of that report. There is a distinction between net and gross costs. The total cost to schools, as estimated by the Treasury, from the implementation of the new tax system is a decline in costs of $240 million - </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hume for his question. I think one of the worst fears that any parent has is that their child will become involved with illegal drugs. Schools need to be places where pupils are safe and where parents can have confidence that their children will be learning about the dangers of drugs and will not be exposed to drugs. As part of its national drug strategy, the government has set a goal that there should be no illegal drugs at all in schools. This goal has been endorsed by all the states and territories.I am proud to say that this week the government has launched its draft national school drugs education strategy. We have allocated some $17.5 million to the implementation of the strategy over the next four years. This strategy document has been distributed to a wide range of organisations and interested parties, including the state and territory governments and school and parent organisations. - The members of the opposition are not interested in protecting young people in schools against drugs. It is clear that they are not interested in contributing to the development of the national school education drug strategy.I would like to take this opportunity to thank the members of the National Advisory Committee on Drug Education for the contribution that they have made to the development of this strategy. The government recog  nises that drugs in schools can only be tackled effectively with the support of the whole community. This drug strategy is designed to assist -  - The government recognises that community support for schools is going to be vital to the success of this drug strategy. I invite all interested members of the community to access the draft national school drug strategy on the Internet at the department's site and to make their contributions to the consultations on this strategy.The national school drug strategy is about more than teaching our young children to say no to drugs. It is about teaching young people to know and understand why saying no is much better and healthier for them than saying yes.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Parramatta for the interest he has taken in this issue. This government has no sympathy whatever for welfare cheats. Australians do not mind paying taxes to support the needs of those people in our community who need genuine help, but they resent working hard to fund the lifestyles of rorters and cheats and this government is determined to stamp out any illegitimate activity.The facts are that the vast majority of Centrelink's six million customers receive their benefits properly and in order, but there is a small group of people who are deliberately rorting the system and additional measures need to be taken to help stamp out that kind of behaviour.Over the last few months the government has been conducting a trial in Sydney and on the Gold Coast using private investigative companies to assist in identifying and accumulating evidence against suspected cases. That trial has been very successful. Of 53 cases referred to private investigators, a total of 33 have led to benefits being cancelled or reduced. In fact, something like $440,000 worth of debts will be recovered as a result of this activity.On the basis of that success the government has decided to extend this activity and has indeed called tenders inviting private surveillance companies to offer these sorts of services in the community. - Of course it is not an announcement of policy. These advertisements  were in the paper last week. If you read the newspapers you would not be so far behind.It is anticipated that these companies will be particularly involved in cases where, for example, people who claim to have a disability and who are receiving a disability pension are keeping down jobs in the work force, or where people are perhaps employed but claiming to be unemployed. There may be other examples where perhaps they pay cash in hand -  - Mr Speaker, I know the opposition is being sensitive about this matter because we are cleaning up another Labor mess. The situation is that the vast majority of pensioners and beneficiaries receive their benefits and the benefits that they are entitled to. They have nothing to fear from this kind of surveillance. In fact, Centrelink will always use data matching and a whole range of other options before engaging private surveillance companies. But there will be a small number of cases where we believe this mechanism will be helpful in delivering real benefits to taxpayers and in clearing any slur on legitimate welfare beneficiaries by those who are cheating on the system.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. The House will recall that on Monday in this place I tabled a letter from the Director of Aviation Safety, Mick Toller, which concluded that in the event that any genuine safety concerns were identified either by CASA or by BASI the demonstration of the class G airspace would cease.The Bureau of Air Safety Investigation has been carrying out a systematic investigation of this demonstration as part of its normal safety functions. I can inform the House that the bureau is, in fact, releasing its interim recommendations today. This goes to the heart of the question that the member has asked about further steps taken by me, or further advice from independent sources that might be made available to allow the assessment of the safety of the trials and so forth; there it is, it will be released later today.I can tell the House, too, that the bureau has concluded that the demonstration has served its purpose and that it should now be subjected to a comprehensive evaluation. BASI has identified a number of safety issues that need to be addressed. As a result, Mr Toller advised me yesterday afternoon that the demonstration will now end. - I hear with enormous interest that the man who set up the statutory authority to distance himself, appropriately,  from management of air safety now, by his laughter, makes a claim that he considers himself a greater expert on aviation safety in Australia than CASA. That might have been the case, given the way that he set the model up and the people that he put in control of it; but after we fixed it up and ensured that there was appropriate expertise there, I have to inform the member for Kingsford-Smith that I have a lot more confidence in the board of CASA to manage aviation safety in Australia than he does - a lot more - and I would suggest that the Australian people do as well.Having said that, BASI has also recommended - Mr Speaker, I assume that those opposite are actually interested in air safety, not simply in politicisation of the issue. - No. the evidence of the last few days is that they are more interested in the politics. But this is pretty important stuff. BASI has also recommended that CASA, Airservices Australia and the department of transport should review their roles and responsibilities in airspace regulation and management. My role, of course, in all of this is to oversee governments. I have directed the head of my department, Dr Allan Hawke, to conduct the review and report back to me by Tuesday, 22 December. He is to work closely with Mr Toller and the Chief Executive Officer of Airservices Australia, Mr Pollard. So the correct approach to this matter has been taken. - By me. And that has been to allow the government's air safety experts to do their job without political interference. Mr Speaker, it is perfectly obvious that we can assume from those opposite that they have now actually redefined their policy in a given area. They have got a new policy. They are going to take over responsibility for aviation safety again - having set up the statutory authority to look after it. They are exposed, it is as simple as that, because I have actually followed the model laid down by the member for Kingsford-Smith. This is the only way that Australians can be sure that air safety decisions will be based on genuine safety concerns other  than political or industrial relations considerations. It may not be the most politically expedient approach, but it is the right approach.</DOC>

 - This question has previously been asked and the answer has previously been given, but I will give it again. Once you get rid of Labor's wholesale sales tax and you replace it with -  - Just hold on; just calm yourself down. Once you get rid of Labor's wholesale sales tax - which is 22 per cent on cars, as you know - and you reduce taxes to 10 per cent, you actually make cars cheaper. It is a great thing for the car industry, it is a great thing for not-for-profit organisations and it is a great thing for everybody that buys a car. We on this side of the parliament like cheaper cars.Some of the lease companies say, `If the remainder value of a car is less, then we will put up our lease payments.' That is what they say. Some say it rightly; some say it wrongly. Some are taking the opportunity to put up costs in advance because the car has become cheaper. But, for the not-for-profit organisation, let me explain this point again: costs fall. - For charities, costs fall. - Charities are GST free. That means that charities get back all of the embedded costs. - Oh! - I agree with the member for Fraser. Can I say in relation to charities, as I think has been well explained to anybody who has an open mind on the question, that prices for charities fall under the government's new tax system. Isn't that a great thing? The fact is that charities can get back all of the taxes that are currently embedded -  - I have dealt with the question of cars. You asked me about charitable services, and the point I am making is this: under the next tax system charities get a better tax deal. They get back all of the embedded wholesale sales taxes that they now pay under Labor, and they do not put any tax on their outputs. Running a charity becomes cheaper. That's great for the charitable sector, it's great for people who get their services, and we do not understand why a Labor Party would not support that.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Menzies for his question. Particularly as a lawyer, he would have a great interest in the whole issue of the international criminal court. I respect the interest that he has shown in those sorts of issues. Tomorrow, as at least some honourable members will probably know, is the 50th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Appropriately, on the day before the commemoration of the signing of that historic document, the Australian government will sign the Statute of the International Criminal Court at the United Nations in New York tonight, Australian time.The establishment of an international criminal court has been one of the government's key human rights objectives. We have played a very active part in the establishment of that court. In particular, I draw the attention of the House to the fact that it was an Australian official who chaired the so-called like-minded group during the diplomatic conference in Rome earlier this year, who did an outstanding job in helping to bring together some diverse points of view and in the end made it possible for there to be the establishment of an international criminal court. I gave the opening address to that diplomatic conference in Rome on 15 June. - Members on this side of the House would be aware of that because they follow interesting policy issues; members on the other side are obviously expressing surprise because they have shown not the slightest interest in the international criminal court at all. For example, the member for Kingsford-Smith has asked this year no questions of me on any topic whatsoever, and today is the second last day on which he could ask a question. So here we are in December, and still not a question in 1998 from the member for Kingsford-Smith, which shows what a lazy policy process the Labor Party has. - We would regard the establishment of the international criminal court as one of the great achievements of this year both for Australia and for other countries. It is appropriate that we should sign the statute itself the day before the anniversary of the signing of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.In conclusion - because the honourable member asked a question about human rights issues more generally - the Australian government, over the last 2½ years, has made one very significant change to our human rights diplomacy, and that is to focus a great deal more on what is called `institution building'. One of the institutions that we established - and honourable members opposite will not be aware of this - was a centre for democratic institutions. This is one of the ways that we will be able to encourage the spread of good and democratic governance throughout the Asia-Pacific region. There are many other initiatives in the area of institution building that we have pursued, and this government can be proud of what it has achieved in international diplomacy to advance human rights.</DOC>

 - I welcome the question. I would have welcomed the opportunityto stand in the debate if the member for Hotham had not broken theagreement that prevented me from doing so. So I am glad that he hasgiven me this opportunity to participate. I thank him for thatopportunity. I presume the premise of his question is that the taxsystem is not broken. As I recall, he said rather rhetorically, `IfMonash doesn't think it is broken, why are you changing it?' If theLabor Party does not think the tax system is broken, you can standand defend it to the last man and woman, but you will not have ussupporting you. - Okay, you are reinforcing your point that you do not think the tax system is broken. You will have trouble convincing Australians of that because Australians who are living under huge marginal income tax rates of 43 cents in the dollar, facing the prospect of paying 47 cents in the dollar, do think the tax system is broken. We know Labor is a party of reaction. Labor can only oppose; it cannot build. So Labor has to maintain this pretence that the tax system works because it will not engage in reforming it.It was not always the case that Labor opposed tax reform. When it had decent leadership - when it had any leadership - back in the mid-1980s, it used to support tax reform. Who supported tax reform? The current Leader of the Opposition and the member for Holt, when they were in the Keating Labor Party, supported a 12½ per cent broad based consumption tax - as I have already told the House - in a booklet put out back in 1985. I had to go to great lengths to find that booklet because I thought all of the copies had been destroyed. I am not sure that troglodytes like the member for Hotham endorsed a broad based consumption tax, but it was certainly endorsed by the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Holt back in 1985.Back in the 1980s when Labor was supporting a broad based consumption tax, indirect tax represented 7.2 per cent of GDP and now it only represents 5.8 per cent. So Labor was arguing to broaden the indirect tax base right back in the 1980s when it was substantially higher than it is now. Back in the 1980s, direct taxation on individuals and companies was only 16.4 per cent and now it is 17.2 per cent. Therefore, back in the 1980s Labor was supporting reducing the burden of personal income tax even though it was less than it is today. If you wanted to make sure you have a sustainable position in relation to the tax base, you would be broadening the indirect tax base. This point was made by somebody in debate in the Main Committee last night when he said:The sales tax regime has been undermined by the shift in consumer spending from goods to services. This is the inevitable consequence of a modern service based economy. Tax modernisation is needed to protect the integrity of the public sector's revenue base.Do you know who said that? - It was the member for Werriwa, Labor's thinker, Labor's lonely thinker, who stood up in the Main Committee and belled the cat. You have somebody who thinks and somebody who does not. If I were on the Labor backbench, I would follow the member for Werriwa on that one.</DOC>

 - In the last week, there have been a number of surveys released which find that business expects economic growth to continue in the New Year. The New South Wales State Chamber of Commerce released a survey today saying that business confidence has undergone a transformation in the last three months. Katie Lahey, the Chief Executive, said that the optimism stems from reported improvements in general business conditions, sales revenue, export sales, selling prices, profits and investments in plant and equipment. Ms Lahey also stated that the survey found strong support for the government's tax reform package and that 84 per cent of respondents supported the federal government's tax package. It is great news to have such a vote of support - 84 per cent - from small business.We finish the year in Australia in a strong position in very difficult international circumstances. Australia's growth rate compares exceptionally with economies in the region, nearly all of which are in recession. Australia grew by five per cent. It grew faster than the United States, faster than the major economies in Europe and faster than the OECD average. We do that at a time when inflation is low. Headline inflation was 0.2 per cent in the September quarter and 1.3 per cent over the year. Inflation has now been below two per cent for over two years. - Ha, ha! There was an interjection from the Labor Party: `We gave you that.' The shadow Treasurer said on 21 July 1998:After three Costello budgets we have slower growth, we face the Asian crisis. It's not what I call a fireproofed economy.It is not fireproofed and it is all my fault. The Leader of the Opposition said on 3 December:In so far as we are fireproofed from the impact of the Asian crisis, it is due to the harsh and difficult changes that we in the Labor Party put in place.So the deputy leader says we are not fireproofed and it is the coalition's fault; and the leader says we are fireproofed and it is all the good work of Labor. That is what you would call a consistent economic message. Bring the member for Werriwa down on to your front bench. The lonely thinker, the empty chair in every question time as he conducts this experiment: is it possible to be a thinker and a member of the Labor Party at the same time?We go into this with a budget which is in surplus and a charter of budget honesty praised by international authorities as state-of-the-art legislation. Official interest rates have been cut six times since the coalition came to office. Under Labor home mortgage interest rates were 10.5 per cent; now they are below 6.5 per cent - a saving for the average Australian home buyer of over $4,000 per annum since this government came to office. And that is great news for home buyers. This side of the House thinks it is great news for home buyers. You can compare that to the Keating- Beazley-Crean-Evans interest rates of 17 per cent in 1989-1990. - It's a bogus comparison to compare 6.5 per cent to 17 per cent, a totally bogus comparison. Why? Because it puts Labor in a bad light. The Financial Times  editorial of 3 December stated this:Australia was once regarded as one of the more hopeless cases in the industrialised world. Its response to the Asian crisis suggests this is an economy whose prospects should now be taken seriously.</DOC>

 - As I recall, in that policy document, A new tax system , which was put to the Australian people, we cited assessments, as I recall, from the Melbourne Institute, from the Brotherhood of St Laurence, I think - we did not put our own figures out there - on the amount that this would add to growth. I heard the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the member for Hotham, saying in a debate just earlier that this was a terrible fiscal stimulus. Well, if it is a fiscal stimulus, it would be adding to growth, would it not? On the one hand, he wants to criticise it because it is a fiscal stimulus; on the other hand, he wants to say that it is going to have a negative effect on growth. I have learnt one thing when I have taken questions from the member for Hotham: never respond to a proposition or a quote that he puts in somebody else's mouth until you have seen it with your own eyes, and you have actually learnt what the truth is -  - And you've road-tested it. - We do not need any help with the answers; we find answering your questions easy enough as it is. In the Australian new tax system research we quoted from the Melbourne Institute and the Brotherhood of St Laurence. I think we also got a research document from Access Economics about the new jobs that would be created. As I recall, there were responses from Econtech to the same effect. As I said earlier, one of the Labor Party's attacks on cutting personal income tax is that it is a fiscal stimulus. If it is a fiscal stimulus you are complaining about, do not try to have it both contradictory ways at the same time. What the Labor Party has to learn to do is to run a coherent economic policy, to think of a position and to defend it.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Groom for his question. The latest monthly stats have come out. The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate has moved from 7.7 per cent to eight per cent. It does reflect the fact that the numbers jump around a lot. The figures last month fell to 7.7 per cent so we are seeing some monthly volatility.What takes the volatility out is the trend unemployment rate, and the trend unemployment rate has actually fallen for the month from eight per cent to 7.9 per cent, which is moving in the right direction. Also within the figures is a marginal improvement in the youth unemployment rate, which is welcome, and in respect of the trend employment number there is a growth of around 11,000. I think what the figures demonstrate, apart from the fact that there is volatility in the month-to-month numbers, is that a lot of the numbers this month were in New South Wales, where there were 48,000 fewer jobs on the seasonally adjusted number, which is a very large and obviously significant number in this set of data.The real point to make, though, is that there are still a lot of things that need to be done to create the framework within which we can see jobs growth in the future. The shadow minister, the member for Batman, did the usual opposition doorstop on the issue. After he had run through the numbers, the final question was, `Well, what are you going to do about it? What would Labor do about it?' What is Labor doing about it? They are voting against absolutely every measure that we put up that would create jobs. Here they are today in one division after another voting against tax reform which will be to the great benefit of business. They will vote, and have voted, against benefits for small business. No-one has created more jobs than small businesses in Australia in recent years. What is the Labor Party's attitude to that? They vote against it.There is a lot more to be done in respect of creating the framework in the future for jobs growth. This government is committed to the policy changes that really will create jobs. We will put our votes behind constructive measures that will create jobs in the future. It is a pity that the Labor Party continues to fail to take their own rhetoric and then apply it when it actually comes to things that count, namely, votes in this place and in the Senate.</DOC>

 - I am aware of statistical comparisons between our management of the Australian economy and that of the Australian Labor Party. I am eternally grateful, on this last question time perhaps of the year, that the Leader of the Opposition should have given me an opportunity to reflect for a moment on some of the comparisons. I say so in the confidence that the Australian public will go to this Christmas knowing that the economic circumstances of this nation are better at this Christmas than they have been for more than 30 years. They will go to their Christmas knowing that we have the strongest economic growth rate in the Western world. They will go to their Christmas knowing that the quality of economic management of this nation over the last 2½ years has piloted the Australian economy away from the worst impacts of the Asian economic downturn. They will go to their Christmas knowing that these words were written in an editorial by Maximilian Walsh in the Bulletin  only this week. Under the heading `Good News for the Coalition', with an engaging cartoon of one of my Liberal state colleagues, he talks about the Howard era and he says that real wages have risen by 10 per cent during the time we have been in power. This is a measure of the miracle of our economic management. - Real wages rose by 10 per cent. Mr Walsh went on to say:What is critically important in respect of that figure is that the profit share of income climbed from 16% of GDP to well over 17%. Not since the `60s have we had it so good.Mr Walsh, very importantly, went on to say this:The explanation for the simultaneous rise in both real wages and profits is that our national productivity has moved up a gear. - The Leader of the Opposition does not want to hear about national productivity. - I will start that again. The more the Labor Party noisily interject, the more they proclaim their sensitivity about the comparison. Maximilian Walsh says that there has been a simultaneous rise in both real wages and profits. I repeat: there has been a simultaneous rise in both real wages and profits, and that is the foundation of rising employment in secure, well paid jobs. We have delivered rising employment and we have delivered secure and well paid jobs. He  goes on to say that productivity has moved up a gear. -  - The article goes on to say:Just how and why that has happened is something the economists will pore over. However, the statistical fact is that the Howard government, by the most sensitive measure of the hip-pocket nerve, really has delivered.The truth of the matter is that, on every economic comparison, the Labor Party's last years in office were an abject failure compared with our first two to three years.The man who asked me the question drove unemployment in Australia to a post-Depression high of 11.2 per cent. The man who asked me the question left us a budget deficit of $10.5 billion. The man who asked me the question is leading a negative opposition to the most historic economic reform package this parliament has seen in the form of the taxation package. I conclude by saying to the Australian people that the management of this economy is in sound and reliable hands. We are delivering strong growth and a secure economy, which is the basis for rising living standards for all Australian families.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. I am surprised such a question should cause amusement on the other side of the House. I did notice that, in debate in another place over the last two nights, there have been several comments that population health is what the government should be commenting on. I thought I would mention 10 things that I take particular pride in that were conceived about 2½ years ago.The first is a national public health partnership. For the first time ever, we have a new way of approaching population health with the Commonwealth, states and territories. It has meant negotiating an agreement with eight different governments around Australia and thereby setting clear goals and targets. We have a coordinated and consistent approach across the whole country.The second is our national illicit drug strategy, which is allocated $214 million of extra money over four years to address the issue of illicit drugs in Australia. This has been addressed in both the supply and demand side of drugs with slightly over 50 per cent going to the health aspect of that, which is in fact the demand for drugs.The third thing which we take particular pride in is our work in smoking. For the first time ever, again, we have got nine Commonwealth, state and territory governments around Australia to pool their money and run one consistent campaign. It has now been picked up in more than 12 countries around the world. The fourth thing I mention is our immunisation campaign, which has been very successful with respect to measles. - It has shown sufficient success that, if you take a cohort of 12-month-old children, unlike what was reported in one newspaper yesterday - we have an 84.3 per cent completed immunisation rate for that group. That is still below our target but substantially better than the 53 per cent completed childhood immunisation rate we found 2½ years ago.Fifthly, we have looked at a number of specific illnesses - diabetes, folate in terms of spina bifida, HIV-AIDS - and muscular-  skeletal initiatives, in all of which many would say we are leading the world. The sixth is that we have had a second mental health strategy, one that is focused on prevention, particularly early intervention, in psychosis in young people. This is something that we recently had the British health minister, Paul Boateng, out here looking at and is something which the British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, has praised us for and has said he wishes to emulate.Seventh, in the area of cancer, we have introduced a national cancer control initiative. The early signs of this are that we are showing improvements in the prevention and early detection of cancer, leading to better survival. Eighth is the environmental health strategy - something the Labor Party, I might say, promised in 1993 and never even commenced in their last full term of government - looking at air and water quality.Ninth, in Aboriginal health, funding has been increased in the three years that we have been in government by 44 per cent. Finally, in rural health, we now have a rural health department operating out of the University of Sydney, out of Broken Hill. In 1997, for the first year in many years, we had an increase in the number of doctors in rural Australia. As a direct result of our initiatives in 1996, rural retention grants are to be introduced next year to help keep doctors in country areas.It is sad that people opposite should find this amusing. They are population health issues that affect the most disadvantaged people in the community. They are 10 things that the opposition, when in government, could never even dream of. They show your incompetence. They show the fact that you have never understood health, and that is why you cannot fix it.</DOC>

 - I have probably already told the House that, if you reform Australia's tax system and you take taxes off exports, you give exports a great boost. That is a great thing. If you take the burden of wholesale sales tax off the motor car industry, you are going to get a much more vibrant motor car industry in this country. I do not know why former ACTU officials would be opposed to that. If you broaden the indirect tax base from just manufactured goods to goods and services, you take the tax burden off the manufacturing base and you create much more equity in that growing part of the economy. All in all, and for the reasons that the Labor Party said in 1985 when it supported tax reform -  - The reasons that the Labor Party gave in 1985 when it had the leadership were:The government's preferred approach would mean a switch in the tax system, with more tax paid at  the time income is spent, but less tax paid at the time income is earned. This will reduce the level of tax avoidance and evasion because many of the ways income tax is avoided will be directly removed by new laws. There will be bigger cuts in income tax than increases in consumption tax.That is the policy that was supported by Kim Beazley and Gareth Evans and the Labor Party in their document on tax reform in July 1985. They were right then, and they are wrong now. I have finished.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Mallee for his question. I acknowledge the interest he has shown in the petroleum industry. - No, he's not a petrol head - I think you're a far more likely candidate, my friend. In July, the now Minister for Defence, Mr Moore, and I announced the government's reform plan for petroleum retail marketing. It was based on the recommendations of the 1994 Industry Commission and the 1996 Australian Competition and Consumer Commission inquiry into petroleum products.I have always said that petrol pricing will depend on a number of factors. One of the principal ones is the world price for oil. The exchange rate will contribute to it. Refining  costs will contribute to it. We have always said that, all other things being equal, a more competitive retailing end of the market will deliver lower prices. That is, prices will move according to world prices and exchange rates and everything else - things we do not have control over - but, all other things being equal, if you have a more competitive retail end of the market, you will get better prices. -  - Our package was to allow open access to oil terminals for bulk fuel supply customers, and we have done that. Our package was to get monitoring of prices by the automobile clubs, and the automobile clubs are now doing that for us. Our package was also to introduce a more competitive regime in relation to petrol marketing. Of course, like all economic reform, it was opposed by Labor. Labor opposes everything, and so it opposed reforms to petrol marketing. In fact, Labor said in its policy: `The one sure thing is that under Mr Howard petrol will rise.' - That's right, is it? Okay. One of the thinkers on the Labor frontbench says that that is right. The consumer price index for the September quarter showed that petrol prices fell 2.2 per cent. The Labor Party said that the one sure thing is that petrol prices would rise - and that has been confirmed by a member of its frontbench. The consumer price index for September showed that prices fell 2.2 per cent and, in relation to some areas, you can actually now buy petrol for under 60c a litre.We have implemented open access. This has given new opportunities for bulk suppliers to get into the industry. We intend to move on and enhance competition in the retail area because, by enhancing competition, by getting more effective sales of goods and services, you are going to see the kind of productivity lifts that the Prime Minister talked about which will make our country strong. - </DOC>

 - I certainly am aware of the regulatory impact statement and I am certainly aware of the statement I made to this House in 1981, which followed a very vigorous internal debate inside the then government. Those who were around at the time will be very well aware of the vigour of that debate. I was making a statement on behalf of the government as Treasurer at that time.I have never disguised the fact that, over the last 20 years, I have argued both in and out of government for the reform of our taxation system. And it gives me immense pride, as we come towards the end of this parliamentary session, that this is the week that the government I lead - in which the honourable member for Higgins is the Treasurer - after 25 years of need has finally matched the national need and introduced taxation reform.What really matters is that this is the government that, after all the opportunities former governments - both Labor and Liberal - have had, has finally bitten the bullet; this is the government that has done the job in the national interest. I applaud the Australian people's courage -  - Of course, with any change there are burdens, but there are also greater benefits. The cash flow benefits of a broad based indirect tax far outweigh any of the burdens. If you just read one side of the ledger you will always get a negative, miserable outcome. If you read both sides of the ledger you will get a glorious future for the Australian economy.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Moore for his question. I very much appreciate the interest he shows in this most important issue to Australia. One of the achievements of this government - and it has many achievements in many fields - has been the contribution that it has been able to make to peace in Bougainville. In that context, I cannot hide the fact that we were disappointed that the Papua New Guinean parliament recently failed to pass legislation to establish the Bougainville Reconciliation Government. That is something that we were looking forward to, and indeed we remain hopeful that it will occur. Nevertheless, it was a matter of disappointment that that legislation did not pass because the requisite two-thirds majority was not obtained as a result of a boycott of the vote by some members of the opposition.It is fair to say that the Bougainville peace process, despite that vote, remains very much on track. This lack of enabling legislation for  the Bougainville Reconciliation Government is not a fatal setback.I was delighted to be informed that on 8 December a meeting of the Bougainville Transitional Government and the Bougainville Interim Government, the BTG and the BIG, recommitted the parties in Bougainville to the process of peace and to the cease-fire which was signed early this year.The following day the Bougainvilleans announced that they would establish a Bougainville People's Congress by the end of this year and that they would maintain their commitment to the establishment of a Bougainville Reconciliation Government. This is a very good message; this is a very good development. It confirms my view that the Bougainville peace process does remain on track.Tonight I will be going to Papua New Guinea. It will be an opportunity for me to discuss this issue further with ministers there, and not only to reaffirm our commitment to the peace process but also to inform Papua New Guinea ministers that we will remain active leaders of the Peace Monitoring Group on Bougainville. We will certainly be continuing to participate in the PMG until the end of February, and I do not doubt that its life will extend well beyond that. But it is important for the House to understand that the PMG will not last forever. In the end the people of Bougainville, in consultation and eventually agreement with the government of Papua New Guinea, will have to take affairs into their own hands. The Peace Monitoring Group cannot remain forever. It is itself an interim arrangement, but it is a very important way in which Australia is helping that peace process.I also inform the House that tomorrow I will be opening the Australian funded hospital in Buka, in the north of Bougainville. I think all Australians, particularly members of the government, can take great pride in the fact that we have built this hospital. It demonstrates the very real dividends that peace can bring to the people of Bougainville.</DOC>

 - I am not aware of the particular circumstances of the case that the honourable member refers to. As the honourable member has raised it with me, I will find out about it. If there is anything further that I can add to what I am about to say in relation to that particular company and the circumstances of its employees, I will.More generally to the issues that the honourable member for Gellibrand has raised, they have of course arisen in the context of a lot of community concern about the circumstances of the workers at Cobar, which provoked a great deal of debate on this issue. It is an interesting coincidence that the honourable member should ask me the question in the very week that a very satisfactory conclusion has been reached in relation to the Cobar workers. That has been due to the activities - I might say with appropriate encouragement from the government - of the Australian Securities Commission. In fact, I would go so far as to say that, if it had not been for the strong but entirely appropriate representations that were put to the Australian Securities Commission, the very satisfactory outcome in relation to that matter would not have been realised.I remind the House that 85 per cent of the benefits that were due to those workers have been recovered. That is a direct consequence of representations that were made and in which my office, the Treasurer's office and  the office of the minister for workplace relations were involved. - The mine is about to reopen, as the Deputy Prime Minister reminds me. The rhetorical part of the honourable member's question was: when are you going to do something? I would have thought that getting 85 per cent of their entitlements back was certainly doing something. I would have thought that a government that was prepared to use the steady recovery facilities of the Australian Securities Commission to secure that outcome was a government that was doing something. And when it comes to doing something -  - The honourable member asked me a specific and a general question. I said in relation to the specific question that, if there was anything further I could find out, I would come back to her. I am now answering the general part of the question.I would remind the honourable member for Gellibrand in relation to the Cobar mines that, whilst individual entitlements will vary, the settlement means that the employees as a group can expect to receive a total of 85 cents in each dollar that was due to them when the mine was closed. Trade creditors are expected to receive approximately 29 cents in the dollar. In other words, the recovery for the workers has been something like 3½ times -  -  - This is good news for the workers and everybody should be pleased about it. You should not be trying to stop me from informing the House about it.The other and final point I would make to the parliament is that -  -  - The other point I would make is that the member for Prospect and others have been urging the government to take action that for 13 long years the Labor Party, when it was in office, declined to take. I can only remind the honourable member for Prospect of what has been said before - that the matters that she has raised are under consideration inter alia by the Labor ministers of the various states.I think what the government has done in relation to Cobar indicates a very conscientious commitment to the protection of the rights of Australian workers. A recovery of 85 cents in the dollar is a great deal better than many workers had recovered for them in the 13 years that you were in government.</DOC>

 - Work for the Dole is giving thousands of young Australians new skills, new responsibilities and new opportunities. For instance, the Thuringowa city library project, which is strongly supported by the member for Herbert, is teaching participants how to index and computer scan historic photos onto an Internet database. For instance, the Ballarat project, strongly supported by the local member, has participants restoring a heritage paddle-steamer. These are typical of hundreds of projects giving thousands of young Australians the experience they need to get real jobs. - I am advised that the Work for the Dole pilot project in the electorate of Robertson had 120 out of 200 participants proceeding to full-time or part-time employment. It is results like this which help to explain growing community support for this great project. In fact, the member for Werriwa, an intellectual beacon amidst the wasteland of ideas opposite, has even proposed a work for the dole scheme of his own. He wants to compel parents on welfare to become teachers aids for their kids.Mr Speaker, it seems that the only people opposed to Work for the Dole are a small group of union oligarchies. Not surprisingly, the New South Wales government has instructed its agencies and instrumentalities not to participate in work for the dole schemes without `a full consultation with the New South Wales public sector unions'. That is not consultation with employers and unions; that is not consultation with the whole community -  - I think the member for Greenway is showing a little sensitivity on this. I regret to say that last year union opposition helped to stop a Work for the Dole project in the electorate of the member for Hughes. I understand that a small clique in the head office of one union is now trying to veto a number of Work for the Dole projects on the north coast of New South Wales, despite the support of the relevant New South  Wales government agencies and despite the support of the local union organisers.The young people of Australia need to understand that sections of the union movement are trying to take away from them new skills, new opportunities and new responsibilities. Members such as the member for Greenway, the member for Batman and the member for Hotham need to understand whose side they are on. Are they on the side of the dinosaurs in head office or are they on the side of local union officials who want to give young Australians a fair go through this great program?</DOC>

 - I do not know about the length of questions, but I think I have had the longest preparation time for an answer for a very long period of time. Can I say to the honourable member who asked me the question that I understand his concern about the continuing level of unemployment in the area that he represents. - Yes, many times, and I will be very happy to visit areas like that - and I will be doing so over the next three years and in subsequent years of my prime ministership. I will be very, very happy to do that.It is true that the levels of unemployment in this country vary. Some parts of Australia experience very high levels of unemployment and others do not.There are a number of things that can be done to assist in reducing unemployment in areas such as the La Trobe Valley and other regional areas of Australia. One of the things, of course, that you can do is to press ahead, as the coalition government has done, with the regional forest agreements. We inherited inactivity in that area and, since we have been in power, we have been successful in securing quite a number of those.Another thing that you can do, of course, is that you can encourage exports. You can encourage exports of raw materials. You can encourage and allow exports of uranium. You can generate a thousand jobs at the Jabiluka project. You can generate export income for Australia. Another thing you can do is to -  - The reality is that a lot of things can be done to reduce unemployment in regional Australia. All of the measures being taken by the present government, with one or two rare exceptions, to reduce unemployment in regional Australia are being  opposed root and branch by the Australian Labor Party. And I would have thought the member who asked me the question would be, like all other members, interested in reducing youth unemployment. Young jobs are protected by protecting youth wages; young jobs are advanced by supporting the government's proposals in relation to unfair dismissals.The truth is that, when we assumed office, unemployment had averaged 8.7 per cent under the previous government, and it had reached 11.2 per cent. Whilst I do not regard the present level of unemployment in this country as being satisfactory - and I have never asserted for a moment that the unemployment problem represents anything other than a very significant challenge to whoever is in government - the undeniable fact is that the Australian economy now is stronger and better able to generate jobs than at any time in the last 20 years. As we come to the end of this year, we can be secure in the knowledge that we have a stronger economy than Australia has boasted for more than three decades, and that is overwhelmingly due to the policies of the coalition government.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Wannon for his question. He has always shown a great deal of interest in one of Australia's great rural industries. The House will be aware that there have been difficulties in recent times with the wool industry, and that the government, prior to the election, took a decision with regard to the management of the wool stockpile. That was welcomed across the industry. We have now gone on with that.The legislation has gone through the House of Representatives - and is now through the Senate - to establish the freeze, and we will go on now to establish an interim advisory board to work with industry and government in the management of the stockpile as we go  through the transitional process of moving towards the demutualisation of the stockpile.It was interesting to note a press release from the member for Corio earlier this week when he spoke about the cost to the stockpile of the government's decision, but what he did not realise, what he did not mention in his press release, was the fact that those are costs to the stockpile, and - whether we remain under the previous administration's regime or whether we move to the position the government is now taking - those holding and management costs will be there. But the stockpile has maintained its level and increased its value.So we are moving to establish the Interim Advisory Board. Yesterday we announced that the Chairman of the Interim Advisory Board would be Donald McGauchie, a highly respected agropolitician across Australia, a former President of the NFF, a highly respected corporate player in Australia. -  - The new Chairman of the Interim Advisory Board is a great Australian and he is a well-respected industry leader. I suppose the Labor Party would have us appoint John Coombs to the job. You've got to be joking! We want people with ability, experience and respect within the industry. Through this transitional period with the wool stockpile, we are very confident that Mr McGauchie will do a great job on behalf of the wool industry in Australia as we de-mutualise the stockpile and hand control of the stockpile back to the owners, the wool growers of Australia. I say again that our government has a great deal of confidence in the job that Mr McGauchie will do in looking after the interests of the wool growers of Australia.</DOC>

 - I find it incredible that a question about literacy amongst indigenous Australians should be raised by the Labor Party. -  - As I said in my first 11 seconds, I find it incredible that the Labor Party would raise a question concerning literacy amongst indigenous young people. After their 13 years in office, we have now discovered that 70 per cent of indigenous students are below the national standard. - It is the coalition government which has been forced to address a problem which was totally ignored and neglected for 13 years. This question shows the blindness of the Labor Party when it comes to matters of educational equity. - I was referring to the blindness of the Labor Party when it comes to fundamental issues of educational equity. The question asked about a Northern Territory bilingual program concerned with literacy education amongst young Northern Territorians. It has been up to this government to finally address the issue, not only amongst all young Australians, but amongst indigenous young Australians. - As the members of the Labor Party well know, one of the major reasons for these bilingual programs concerns the literacy skills of young people, and I am addressing that aspect of the question. Last week, I announced that the government would be putting in place a national literacy program for indigenous Australians. That program will be an effective program because, for the first time, we will have a program focused on outcomes, not rhetoric, not feel-good feelings in the stomach which we have had from the rhetoric -  - of the previous government for the last 13 years -  - I didn't hear you, Mr Speaker, and I apologise for appearing to ignore you. - I announced last week that the government would be working with the states and territories, including the Northern Territory, to put in place for the first time a program for the education of indigenous young people, which will be focused on the actual outcomes of those programs. This government has already lifted spending on indigenous education. It is a government which is now putting more resources into outcomes focused programs. - The government has also introduced, for the first time, intensive English as a second language courses for young indigenous students who do not have English as their first language. This is proving to be an exceptionally effective way of addressing the literacy needs of young people who are native speakers of a vernacular language. The government is very proud of the fact that it has faced up to these fundamental issues of educational equity in the Northern Territory and throughout Australia and we will continue to work with the Northern Territory government to achieve better outcomes.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. Suffice it to say, as honourable members will know, the recent APEC meeting did have some positive outcomes, including the endorsement of the Australian government's economic initiative. -  - There were useful initiatives on ecotech and the support of the work of the G22 on improving international financial system. But there are alternative approaches. I noticed on Monday an article written by Senator Cook, the opposition spokesman on trade, who argued that at the APEC meeting, APEC - and, indeed, the Australian government, in encouraging APEC - made a mistake by concentrating on economic issues and should have more narrowly focused the whole meeting on trade alone.It says something about the Labor Party that it has not even noticed that there is a regional economic crisis - the most severe of its kind in at least a generation. The Labor Party criticises the government for focusing the APEC meeting on this economic crisis. Of course there was discussion about trade; of course there was a focus on that. But this was  a meeting that went way beyond that, and the Australian initiatives were an important part of the successful outcome. All I can say in the brief time available to me is that the article written by Senator Cook is yet another insight into the lack of intellectual rigour - if you could use the word `intellectual' at all - within the Labor Party.</DOC>
